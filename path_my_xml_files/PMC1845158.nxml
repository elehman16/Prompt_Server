<bold>Background:</bold> AIDS dementia complex (ADC) was first identified early in the HIV epidemic and at that time affected a substantial proportion of patients with AIDS. Patients with ADC experience dementia as well as disordered behavior and problems with movement and balance. ADC is now much less common in locations where patients have access to HAART (highly active antiretroviral therapy), consisting of combinations of several drugs that attack the virus at different stages of its life cycle. At present, however, there are no generally accepted guidelines for the best treatment of people with ADC. It has been thought for some time that the best treatment regimens for people with ADC would include drugs that cross the barrier between blood and brain well. Shortly following the introduction of HAART, a trial was carried out to find out whether adding one particular drug, abacavir, to existing combinations of drugs would be beneficial in people with ADC. This drug is known to cross the barrier between the blood and brain. The trial enrolled HIV-positive individuals with mild to moderate ADC and who were already receiving antiretroviral drug treatment. 105 participants were assigned at random to receive either high-dose abacavir or a placebo, in addition to their existing therapy. The primary outcome of the trial was a summary of performance on a set of different tests, designed to evaluate cognitive, behavior, and movement skills, at 12 weeks. Other outcomes included levels of HIV RNA (viral load) in fluid around the brain, as well as other neurological evaluations, and the level of HIV RNA and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (the cells infected by HIV) in blood.</p><p>
<bold>What this trial shows:</bold> When comparing the change in performance scores for individuals randomized to either abacavir or placebo, the results showed an improvement in scores for both groups, but no significant difference in improvement between the two groups. Similarly, the levels of HIV RNA in the cerebrospinal fluid did not differ between the two groups being compared, and other neurological tests did not show any differences between the two groups. However, at 12 weeks, patients receiving abacavir were more likely to have low levels of HIV RNA in their blood, suggesting that abacavir was active against the virus, but this did not translate into an additional improvement of these patients' dementia. The overall rates of adverse events were roughly comparable between the two groups in the trial, although participants receiving abacavir were more likely to experience certain types of events, such as nausea.</p><p>
<bold>Strengths and limitations:</bold> The trial was appropriately randomized and controlled, using central telephone procedures for randomizing participants and subsequent blinding of patients and trial investigators. These procedures help minimize the chance of bias in assigning participants to the different arms as well as in the subsequent performance of individuals within the trial and the assessment of their outcomes. Limitations in the study design have been identified. One limitation is that individuals enrolled into the trial may not in fact have been receiving their existing HAART regimen for long enough to experience its optimal effect, and therefore the improvement seen in both groups could have resulted from an ongoing response to their existing regimen. It is also possible that patients improved in their test scores over the course of the trial simply because they became more familiar with the tests and not because their condition improved. This is a problem in all such trials that try to improve mental function. Finally, a limitation may have been the inclusion of patients who did not have active disease leading to worsening dementia.</p><p>
<bold>Contribution to the evidence:</bold> The findings from this trial suggest that adding high-dose abacavir to existing HAART is not beneficial for patients with ADC. However, the trial provides several insights into the way that future studies of this type can be done, and which typically pose a number of challenging design problems. In particular, sensitive markers are needed that will allow researchers to monitor progression of ADC and patients' response to therapy.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Brew BJ, Halman M, Catalan J, Sacktor N, Price RW, et al.

ADC is characterized by a complex of cognitive, motor, and behavioral abnormalities [<xref rid="pctr-0020013-b002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. While the incidence in the HAART era has halved relative to pre-HAART, the prevalence has approximately doubled, because of the life-extending effect of HAART [<xref rid="pctr-0020013-b003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Zidovudine (ZDV) is the only antiretroviral drug whose efficacy in ADC is supported by the results of a randomized, placebo-controlled trial [<xref rid="pctr-0020013-b004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In addition, the efficacy of ZDV is supported by anecdotal and observational studies [<xref rid="pctr-0020013-b005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pctr-0020013-b006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], as well as evidence of significant declines in the concentrations of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) immune activation markers such as &#x003b2;-2 microglobulin and quinolinic acid, both of which are closely correlated with the severity of ADC and its response to therapy [<xref rid="pctr-0020013-b007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pctr-0020013-b008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. A number of antiretroviral drugs may be effective in the treatment of ADC, based upon reduction of HIV-1 RNA in the CSF, as seen with stavudine (d4T), lamivudine (3TC) [<xref rid="pctr-0020013-b009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], and indinavir [<xref rid="pctr-0020013-b010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]; the measurement of potentially efficacious drug concentrations in the CSF, as observed with nevirapine and efavirenz [<xref rid="pctr-0020013-b011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pctr-0020013-b012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]; and efficacy in in vitro models (d4T, 3TC, and efavirenz) [<xref rid="pctr-0020013-b013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Although the effect of combining these and other antiretroviral drugs within HAART on clinical and neuropsychological performance has not been systematically studied, there is increasing evidence suggesting a beneficial impact on ADC [<xref rid="pctr-0020013-b014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pctr-0020013-b017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>For an antiretroviral therapy (ART) to be effective in ADC, theoretically it should have potent antiviral activity, ability to penetrate the brain at efficacious concentrations, and activity in macrophages and microglia, the primary targets of HIV infection within the brain. While the need for adequate brain penetration is controversial, studies addressing this issue thus far have been incomplete. There has been variability in the number of drugs that have been assessed in the regimen (at times one drug and at other times three), in the comprehensiveness of neuropsychological assessments, in the level of impairment of the patients, and in the potential for drug interactions. Moreover, there has been no head-to-head comparison of a brain-penetrating three-drug regimen versus one that is not penetrating. In a recent study, we have found that while <italic>overall</italic> there does not appear to be any benefit from a brain-penetrating regimen in neurologically asymptomatic patients, there is neuropsychological benefit in a <italic>subset</italic> of patients with significant dysfunction [<xref rid="pctr-0020013-b018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>Abacavir (Ziagen, ABC) is metabolized to a novel 2&#x02032; deoxyguanosine analog nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) that fulfils these criteria. The compound has potent antiviral efficacy, can cross the blood brain barrier to an extent similar to ZDV, and has good antiviral activity in macrophages in vitro [<xref rid="pctr-0020013-b019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and microglia [<xref rid="pctr-0020013-b020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Furthermore, while ZDV is active against de novo infection of macrophages, but not against <italic>chronic</italic> infection in resting monocyte lineage cells, ABC is active against both [<xref rid="pctr-0020013-b021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Consequently, a controlled study was conducted to determine the efficacy of ABC as part of combination therapy in ADC. An ABC dose of 600 mg twice a day (double the standard dose) was selected in an attempt to maximize the central nervous system ABC concentrations while providing an acceptable level of safety [<xref rid="pctr-0020013-b022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Results for the 12-wk randomized phase of the study, presented below, did not show any benefit for the addition of ABC.

Given that approximately two thirds of the patients in the trial had Stage 1 ADC and that Stage 1 overlaps with minor cognitive motor disorder as defined by the American Academy of Neurology, it seems likely that these results also pertain to less severe forms of HIV-related cognitive impairment. Analysis of the data reveals important issues in ADC trial design and patient management.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Generalizability</title><p>There are two general theoretical reasons for the lack of additional demonstrable clinical activity: either ABC does not have efficacy or aspects of the trial design were flawed.</p><p>The median CSF HIV-1 RNA was reduced, albeit by a modest 0.64 log<sub>10</sub> copies/mL over the 12 wk and ABC was present in the CSF in potentially efficacious concentrations, on average 9-fold greater than the IC<sub>50</sub> reported for ABC for the wild-type virus. Moreover, there is published evidence for the systemic and neurological efficacy of ABC. This was obtained by searching PubMed for the keyword &#x0201c;abacavir.&#x0201d; Lanier et al. have shown in a meta-analysis of five studies where ABC was added to existing therapy that there was significant reduction in plasma HIV viral load even in patients with baseline NRTI mutations as long as the number of these did not exceed four [<xref rid="pctr-0020013-b027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The evidence for the neurological efficacy of ABC to date is more complex. Limoges et al. [<xref rid="pctr-0020013-b028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] have shown that in the brains of SCID mice with HIV encephalitis ABC decreased viral load by approximately one log while the efficacy of ZDV and d4T were variable but in general inferior. Indeed, ABC was very effective at limiting the spread of infection and microglial nodule formation. On the other hand, Kandanearatchi et al. [<xref rid="pctr-0020013-b029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] found that neither ABC nor ZDV made a significant difference to HIV replication in a human fetal brain aggregate model and that only d4T was efficacious when given 24 h prior to HIV infection. These findings do not accord with the known clinical efficacy of ZDV and raise potential concerns over the appropriateness of the model for assessment of antiretroviral efficacy. The only other study that tried parenthetically to assess the neurological efficacy of ABC is that by McCoig et al. [<xref rid="pctr-0020013-b030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In a small substudy, 13 children were randomized to receive ABC, ZDV, and 3TC compared to ten who received ZDV and 3TC. Approximately half in each group had neuropsychological impairment and this did not significantly change at week 48. However, there were several dropouts and the study was very significantly underpowered.</p><p>Given the above-mentioned points, it seems that there is adequate theoretical reason to expect ABC to have neurological efficacy. So perhaps this did not translate into practice because of flaws in trial design. In this regard, the first concern would be the presence of pre-existing resistance to the drug. Certainly, at baseline, 90% of participants had virus with evidence of resistance to the NRTIs and two thirds of isolates had three or more NRTI-associated mutations at baseline. The latter participants had less reduction in plasma HIV-1 RNA compared to those with virus with two or fewer mutations. As previously mentioned, recent data have shown that the greater the number of NRTI mutations, the greater the likelihood of ABC resistance [<xref rid="pctr-0020013-b027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Nonetheless, despite the presence of multiple mutations, in this limited group of patients significantly more participants treated with ABC had undetectable HIV-1 RNA at week 12 in the plasma and CSF. So, while this was clearly a factor it is unlikely to be the most important.</p><p>A second issue in trial design is that of the neurological stability of the patient groups at entry. An 8-wk period prior to entry was chosen because of pre-HAART data showing that the vast majority of improvement had occurred by 8 wk from commencement of a particular drug [<xref rid="pctr-0020013-b004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pctr-0020013-b031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. It was presumed that even though some patients were on HAART, approximately half in both groups at baseline, any improvement would still have stabilized by 8 wk from commencement of the regimen. At the time, this was based on the presumption that HAART would not make a significant impact on ADC because of the limited penetration into the brain of the most common component of such a regimen, namely the PIs. At the time of the trial, HAART consisted of two NRTIs and a PI. However, the fact that both the SBG and ABC groups improved at week 12 of the study (that is, after at least 5 mo on HAART) and that there were only two ADC progressions (both in the SBG group) strongly suggest that HAART does have efficacy in ADC leading to a lengthening of the time window. While there are no precise data on progression rates prior to the introduction of HAART for the different ADC stages, the mean time to death for Stage 2 ADC was 4.6 mo and for all ADC patients the time was 6 mo [<xref rid="pctr-0020013-b031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pctr-0020013-b032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. These figures therefore suggest that there should have been more ADC progressions in the study participants if HAART had no effect on dementia. The other interpretation, namely that the neuropsychological improvement was related to a learning effect for the tests seems unlikely: no similar improvement has been observed in other clinical studies and further analyses of the neuropsychological data comparing the results of testing in the memory domain (the most sensitive to learning effect) with the other tests of psychomotor function and reaction time did not show any significant differences. Thus, unlike the issue of baseline resistance, this does seem to be a major factor. In future ADC trials, patients should only be entered after a period of 5 mo on existing HAART to ensure stability.</p><p>A third issue in study design relates to whether or not the trial was appropriately powered. The sample size calculation was based on an estimated SD of 0.75, a difference between treatment group responses of 0.60, and a dropout rate of 20%&#x02013;25% giving the study a 90% power. These estimates had been derived from previous MACS studies. However, the observed SDs on the change in neuropsychological perfor-mance from baseline were 1.27 (ABC + SBG group) and 1.15 (SBG group). Because the variability of the neuropsychological data was much greater than expected, the likelihood of detecting any treatment differences was compromised. Indeed the power of the study was reduced to 52%. With the same sample size, but with the larger SD of 1.20, only differences between treatment group responses on the order of 0.96 would have been detected. Had the study been planned with an SD of 1.20 (using all other assumptions) rather than 0.75, approximately 115 patients per treatment group (that is, approximately twice the number enrolled) would have been required. It should be noted that two HAART era studies conducted after the completion of this study also showed unexpectedly large SDs of 1 and 1.5 [<xref rid="pctr-0020013-b033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="pctr-0020013-b034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. It therefore seems that the MACS cohort data that were used in the power analyses do not reflect ADC patients in the HAART era. Indeed, future trial designs should utilize these sample size re-estimations.</p><p>Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, the study was designed to include participants with a diagnosis of ADC not confounded by other illnesses, but there was no provision to restrict entry to those who had &#x0201c;active&#x0201d; disease (that is, ongoing brain damage). Some patients may have had virologically or immunologically inactive disease while others may have been in a &#x0201c;reparative&#x0201d; phase, perhaps analogous to head injury or stroke patients who may take months to slowly improve after the initial insult. Studies have shown a correlation between ADC severity and CSF HIV-1 RNA and &#x003b2;-2 microglobulin levels when used in pre-HAART era ADC patients without other confounding conditions [<xref rid="pctr-0020013-b031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. However, there are no consensus criteria by which &#x0201c;active&#x0201d; versus &#x0201c;burnt out&#x0201d; disease versus a &#x0201c;reparative&#x0201d; phase can be differentiated. The fact that 56% of participants had a CSF HIV-1 RNA level below 100 copies/mL at baseline strongly suggests that many participants had a component of their neurological deficit that was unlikely to be driven by ongoing viral replication, and hence unlikely to be reversed by antiretroviral agents. Moreover, the fact that 83% of participants had CSF &#x003b2;-2 microglobulin concentrations that were normal for an HIV-infected population also suggests that most patients had a significant component of their deficit that was not driven by immune activation or active viral replication. How can this lack of virological and immunological activity be reconciled with the fact that most of the patients improved? We suggest that this may be related to the patients being in a reparative phase of the illness: possibly new synaptic connections are being made. It could be hypothesized that CSF HIV-1 RNA &#x0003e;100 copies/mL and &#x003b2;-2 microglobulin &#x0003e;3 nmoles/L should identify &#x0201c;active&#x0201d; ADC. However, in a recent manuscript, we thoroughly explored this with a negative result [<xref rid="pctr-0020013-b035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Elevation or non-elevation of any one or combination of CSF markers at entry did not predict stability, improvement, or worsening of ADC at week 12, although there was a weak negative association with the degree of elevation of CSF viral load at entry. Future studies will need to focus on markers that can identify active ADC, inactive or &#x0201c;burnt out&#x0201d; ADC, and address the possibility of some patients entering a reparative phase. It is still possible that CSF HIV viral load may be a good marker of activity if the limit of detection can be reliably measured down to 10 cpml, for example. Thus, the issue of CSF markers will need to be approached in two ways: the refinement of existing markers with greater sensitivity and the development of new markers. Neuroimaging with spectroscopic analyses may also be able to address the issue of ADC activity.</p><p>Moreover, this study highlights an important change in CSF ADC markers in HAART-treated patients. No longer does the CSF compartment as assessed by HIV RNA and immune activation markers such as &#x003b2;-2 microglobulin reflect what is occurring in the brain: there is no relationship to the severity of ADC or to the risk of its worsening. This has been confirmed independently in another publication using a different cohort of patients [<xref rid="pctr-0020013-b036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. There are two explanations: either the CSF compartment still reflects brain disease, but current CSF markers are insensitive, or the CSF compartment has become &#x0201c;separate&#x0201d; to the brain through HAART&#x02014;perhaps through differential activity in these compartments. Future studies will need to address these possibilities.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Overall Evidence</title><p>This study highlights four issues that are critical in the design of future ADC trials and in individual patient management. Firstly, if a new antiretroviral agent is to be trialed in ADC the details of resistance mutations to it should be known before commencement of the trial so that patients with resistant virus can be excluded from the trial. A potential means of circumventing this problem in the case of a novel agent where resistance patterns have not yet been described (this was the case for ABC at the beginning of this trial) would be to recruit only antiretroviral na&#x000ef;ve patients. However, this would mean that a large number of study sites would have to be involved to enable the requisite number of patients to be reached. Secondly, HAART has a beneficial effect on ADC which continues for at least 5 mo after commencement of therapy. Thus, future ADC trials should enroll patients after at least 5 mo of HAART. Thirdly, the variability in neuropsychological performance over time is greater than previously reported. These data should be used to estimate the required sample size in future trials. Fourthly, ADC patients should only be recruited into future anti-retroviral trials if they have active virally mediated ADC. At an individual patient level, it is not possible to be certain of the degree of activity of ADC in a HAART-treated patient. Consequently, clinicians are forced to consider an empirical trial either of intensification or change of HAART. Thus, markers that allow &#x0201c;real time&#x0201d; evaluation of ADC activity, as opposed to its retrospective identification by history, are urgently needed. In this regard, emerging data on the CSF concentrations of the neuronal markers neurofilament and perhaps t-tau are promising [<xref rid="pctr-0020013-b037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pctr-0020013-b039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p><p>While this trial delivered a negative result, it highlights important factors that must be incorporated into a new design methodology for future ADC trials in HAART-treated patients.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pctr-0020013-sd001"><label>CONSORT Checklist</label><media xlink:href="pctr.0020013.sd001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media><p>(50 KB PDF)</p></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pctr-0020013-sd002"><label>Trial Protocol</label><media xlink:href="pctr.0020013.sd002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media><p>(4.5 MB PDF)</p></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pctr-0020013-sd003"><label>Text S1 Clinical Evaluation Form</label><media xlink:href="pctr.0020013.sd003.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media><p>(1.7 MB PDF)</p></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors gratefully acknowledge the contribution of the patients participating in the study, the technical and clinical staff from all centres, and, in particular, S.
