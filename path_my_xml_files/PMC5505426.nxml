Children and adolescents aged 6-18 years were recruited from 3 pediatric diabetes clinics at Cambridge, London University College Hospital, and Peterborough. Eligibility criteria included type 1 diabetes (WHO criteria) for at least 12 months, insulin pump therapy for at least 3 months, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) below 97 mmol/mol (11%) based on analysis from local laboratory within 3 months. Exclusion criteria included any physical or psychological disease likely to interfere with the normal conduct of the study and data interpretation or current treatment with drugs likely to interfere with glucose metabolism.</p><p>Medtronic MiniMed Paradigm&#x000ae; Veo&#x02122; insulin pumps (MMT-554 or MMT-754) with second-generation Enlite&#x02122; CGM sensors (Medtronic MiniMed, Northridge, CA, USA) were used as study pump and continuous glucose monitoring systems (CGM). At recruitment, participants received training on real-time CGM component of the Veo system, and participants&#x02019; competency in using CGM was assessed and documented by the clinical investigators. No additional pump training was provided as all participants recruited for this trial were already using Veo insulin pump prior to enrolment.

Sensor accuracy for each study arm was assessed using paired sensor and plasma glucose points. The bias (sensor minus plasma value) and relative absolute difference (RAD) (absolute difference divided by the reference value, expressed as percentage) were computed for each pair. Numerical accuracy outcomes were calculated across the whole range of measured glucose levels, as well as for euglycemic (3.9-10.0 mmol/L), hypoglycemic (&#x0003c;3.9 mmol/L), and hyperglycemic (&#x0003e;10.0 mmol/L) ranges stratified according to plasma glucose measurements.

Outcomes were presented as mean &#x000b1; SD for normally distributed values or as median (interquartile range) for non-normally distributed values. Accuracy outcomes were summarized using descriptive statistics. Efficacy and accuracy metrics were calculated by GStat software (University of Cambridge, version 2.2), and statistical tests were carried out using SPSS software (IBM Software, Hampshire, UK version 21).

We hypothesized that this is related to the robustness of our model predictive algorithm, which mitigates against sensor inaccuracy and has been safely and effectively used in a range of populations and settings including pregnant women, adults, adolescents and children in unsupervised home application.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-1932296816678631" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="bibr22-1932296816678631" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="bibr23-1932296816678631" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="bibr24-1932296816678631" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> The relatively slow kinetics of subcutaneous insulin may inherently increase robustness of CL algorithms as short-lived aberrations in sensor glucose on day 1, translating to short-term deviations from ideal insulin delivery, may have limited impact on glucose control as these insulin delivery errors cancel each other. However, prolonged sensor inaccuracies cannot be accommodated in this fashion.</p><p>Outcomes based on sensor readings significantly inflated CL performance compared to plasma glucose outcomes. This is in contrast to findings from an overnight inpatient study with a similar design conducted in young children using another sensor make, when plasma and sensor based outcomes were comparable.<sup><xref rid="bibr25-1932296816678631" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> In the present study, sensor reported glucose levels significantly lower than plasma glucose values. A similar trend was described by Calhoun et al.<sup><xref rid="bibr15-1932296816678631" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> In view of these results, previously reported glucose outcomes based on Enlite sensor, including to benefits of sensor-based therapy regimen (eg, sensor-augmented pump therapy, low glucose suspension, CL trials), should be interpreted with caution.</p><p>The current study was limited by the relatively small sample size and short overnight intervention periods. A limited number of data points for sensor accuracy assessment were collected, particularly with respect to the hypoglycemic range. The strengths of our study included the crossover randomized design, and the controlled environment to exclude potential confounders with respect to this particular research question.</p><p>In conclusion, overnight CL glucose control in adolescents informed by Enlite glucose sensor on day 1 or day 3 to 4 after sensor insertion was comparable. The model predictive controller appears to mitigate against sensor inaccuracies.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Results of this trial were presented as a poster at the 9th International Conference on Advanced Technologies &#x00026; Treatments for Diabetes in Milan, Italy, February 3-6, 2016.
