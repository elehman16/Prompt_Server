Sixteen eyes of 16 patients with central serous chorioretinopathy and persistent subretinal fluid (SRF) for at least 3 months were enrolled. Patients were randomized to receive either spironolactone 50 mg or placebo once a day for 30 days, followed by a washout period of 1 week and then crossed over to either placebo or spironolactone for another 30 days. The primary outcome measure was the changes from baseline in SRF thickness at the apex of the serous retinal detachment. Secondary outcomes included subfoveal choroidal thickness and the ETDRS best-corrected visual acuity.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The mean duration of central serous chorioretinopathy before enrollment in study eyes was 10 &#x000b1; 16.9 months.

On binding to the glucocorticoid receptor or to the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), glucocorticoids exert different effects. Preclinical studies have shown in the retina and choroid, that the glucocorticoid receptor, MR, and HSD-2 (hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase Type 2) are coexpressed.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Therefore, glucocorticoid-induced effects may result in part from MR activation in the retina and choroid. Indeed, the activation of MR pathway in rodents with its specific ligand aldosterone or following high dose of glucocorticoids resulted in choroid vessel dilation and leakage, effects that were shown to be reversible with MR antagonists.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Our group has previously identified a molecular target for MR activation in the choroid, namely KCa2.3, which is an endothelial hyperpolarizing calcium-dependent potassium channel involved in vasorelaxation. Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist reversed the upregulation of KCa2.3 in the choroid demonstrating its local molecular action.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Our hypothesis is that excessive occupancy of MR by glucocorticoids and/or excessive MR sensitivity or endogenous activation may increase choroidal thickness and susceptibility to CSC.</p><p>Different MR antagonists are available in the market and have been approved for congestive heart failure and for primary hyperaldosteronism. Spironolactone, the oldest drug of this class, can exert hormonal effects at high dose and with prolonged use (&#x0003e;3 months), including gynecomastia, reduced libido, and menstrual disturbance.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Eplerenone, with an increased specificity does not induce hormonal effects but has in vivo a 50-fold reduced efficacy on MR blockage.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> In a previous prospective pilot but uncontrolled study, we treated 13 patients with CSC for 3 months with oral eplerenone.

From January 2012 to October 2012, 16 patients who met the inclusion criteria and consented to partake in the study were enrolled from the Ophthalmology Department of H&#x000f4;tel Dieu of Paris Hospital, France.</p></sec><sec id="s1-3"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. This study was approved by the Paris Centre Ethical Committee on January 7, 2012. It was declared and authorized by AFSSAPS (Food and Drug Administration in France) under identification number # 2011-003046-40a and declared on Clinical <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Trials.gov">Trials.gov</ext-link> Identifier under # NCT01552044 (February 14, 2012). The study was conducted in accordance with the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki. INSERM (the National Institute for Health and Research in France) has promoted and monitored this study.</p></sec><sec id="s1-4"><title>Study Drug</title><p>Spironolactone is a steroid with a strong antagonist effect on the MR. At the dosage of 50 mg/day for 30 days utilized within this study protocol, spironolactone is not expected to induce any significant effect on blood pressure nor androgenic or progesterone receptor interference.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Tablets containing either the treatment drug of 50 mg spironolactone (Piramal Healthcare UK), or placebo tablet (comprised of lactose) were administered orally during the study period. Tablets had identical galenic presentation; these were prepared by the Department of Pharmacy of H&#x000f4;tel-Dieu of Paris Hospital.</p></sec><sec id="s1-5"><title>Study Protocol</title><p>After signing the informed consent, each patient was randomized to one of the two treatment sequences: sequence treatment/placebo (TP) or sequence placebo/treatment (PT). Sequence TP was where patients received spironolactone 50 mg/day for 30 days, then a washout period, where no treatment was administered for 7 days, followed by placebo for 30 days. In the treatment sequence, PT patients received placebo for 30 days, then a washout period for 7 days, followed by spironolactone 50 mg/day for a further 30 days. The duration of the washout period was calculated taking into account that after oral administration, the mean post&#x02013;steady-state half-life for spironolactone and its active metabolites are 1.4 hours and 16 hours (for spironolactone and canrenone, respectively).<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> After 112 hours, 4.6 days (which corresponds to 7 half-lives), no active spironolactone or active metabolites should be measurable.</p><p>The primary end point is reduction in SRF. Based on pilot data, the treatment effect was estimated to be 70 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>m on average.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> The repeatability of measures on SRF has been estimated to be 30 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>m. The power calculation was based on the first period of this study (i.e., a parallel study design and two-sample <italic>t</italic>-test). To have 95% power of detecting a reduction in SRF of 40% (at a statistically significant level of &#x003b1; = 5%) between the TP and PT sequences after the first treatment period, 7 patients are required in each group. Allowing for a 10% dropout during follow-up, a total of 16 patients were required. The crossover design has greater power than a parallel design, since each patient acts as their own control. Therefore, 16 patients were sufficient here also.</p><p>Randomization of treatment sequence, placebo followed by treatment (PT) or treatment followed by placebo (TP), was assigned by the pharmacist. The randomization was done using online statistical computing web programming (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.graphpad.com/quickcalcs">www.graphpad.com/quickcalcs</ext-link> or <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.randomization.com">www.randomization.com</ext-link>) to generate the randomization schedule. The labels providing the batch number were placed by the pharmacist and were in line with the Commission Directive 2003/94/EC.

Based on the observed association of CSC with corticosteroid exposure, mifepristone, a specific glucocorticoid antagonist has been evaluated for 12 weeks against placebo and showed potential effects but with a low tolerance.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Taking into account the high endogenous fluctuation of this disease and the strong psychological impact in its evolution, it is clear that no benefit of a medical treatment can be established without a placebo-controlled study. Having previously found encouraging results with oral eplerenone on persistent SRF in patient with CSC,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of another MR antagonist spironolactone administered orally, against placebo on SRF in nonresolving CSC. This study was designed to evaluate the optimal treatment conditions (regimen, duration, dose) but provide evidence of the potential biological effect of MR antagonist on SRF. The crossover study design to reduces confounding covariates because each crossover patient serves as his or her own control.</p><p>The results demonstrated a significant reduction of SRF in treated eyes. The analysis on retinal thickness and SRF on measures taken with the two SD-OCT devices, Spectralis and OPKO devices, detected no significant carryover or period effects in the presence of a statistically significant treatment effect on SRF. However, there were significant carryover effects observed in choroidal thickness. In the presence of these carryover effects, a subanalysis of the data from only the first period (D<sub>0</sub>&#x02013;D<sub>30</sub>) of this trial (similar to a randomized, double blinded, parallel clinical trial) reaffirmed the significant treatment effect of spironolactone on SFCT, SRF, and retinal thickness.</p><p>The pharmacokinetics of spironolactone and its active metabolites (canrenone) showed that the treatment drug had a half-live inferior to 7 hours.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Given the 7-day washout period used here, the significant carryover effects observed in choroidal thickness cannot be attributed directly to the active drug. These carryover effects may be due to secondary biological events after spironolactone treatment. As such, future studies should consider such possible biological effects in terms of study design. In addition, there was a borderline significant difference observed in the baselines measures of choroidal thickness between the TP sequence and the PT sequence groups. This may have contributed to the observed carryover effect. A larger sample would have reduced the likelihood of such an imbalance occurring in a randomized trial.</p><p>The available data indicates that other contributory factors could induce RPE leaks; since in most study patients, both eyes presented with a dilated choroid yet CSC was monocular. Whether MR antagonists have an effect on these possible additional factors remains to be explored. In the field of vascular diseases, MR overactivation is a recognized pathogenic factor mediating endothelial dysfunction, vascular inflammation, and remodeling; furthermore, it is recognized that MR antagonists reverse these effects.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> In our experimental studies, we have identified KCa2.3 as a potential molecular target of MR activation in the choroid. There are other potential molecular targets that are regulated by MR/glucocorticoid receptor complexes, and there may be additional potential therapeutic pathways.</p><p>The trial design and the short treatment period were chosen to further demonstrate the treatment effect since recurrence after treatment withdrawal is also supportive evidence. Clinically, the strong recurrence observed in some cases after 1 month of treatment indicates that either more prolonged use or ongoing treatment is required to maintain the absence of SRF in these eyes. However, since the MR antagonists used have low toxicity and tolerable adverse side effects, prolonged use of these treatments should not be a limiting factor.</p><p>No statistically significant changes were observed in the visual acuity, this is likely related to the small sample size (a sample of &#x0003e;100 eyes would be required to detect a change of 3 letters between the groups) and limitations on achievable visual acuity recovery due to the high baseline BVCA (&#x0003e;70 letters in 12 of the 15 cases enrolled).</p><p>The optimal dose or duration of spironolactone required to treat the patient will be the subject of further study. Recent preclinical studies have indicated that females are less sensitive to the effects of spironolactone than men, and that there are racial differences in spironolactone sensitivity (with Afro-American being less sensitive),<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> which indicates that further dose&#x02013;response studies are required. Also, since spironolactone is a target of efflux protein, its ocular penetration might therefore be reduced when outer retinal barrier is restored, suggesting that oral administration may not be optimal for long-term treatment therefore, alternative delivery pathways also require investigation.</p><p>The limitations of this study are the nonoptimal dosage per patient, the small sample size, the short treatment period, and the unforeseen carryover effect in choroidal thickness from M1 into M2. The nonoptimal dosage per patient may be correlated with the different treatment response observed between patients and with reduced efficacy. The short treatment period may have limited the treatment efficacy in patients with more advanced/prolonged disease. The estimation of the washout period was based on the half-life of the drug; however, since significant carryover effects were observed in choroidal thickness of these patients, this would suggest that the washout period was not sufficient to study this parameter using the crossover design. Future studies should select more restricted phenotypic characteristics in addition to SRF duration to study a more homogenous population.</p><p>Although very large sample sizes are required to demonstrate equivalence (less than 5% difference) on parameters with poor repeatability (e.g., visual acuity), this study was designed to detect a large treatment effect (&#x0003e;40%) using an objective scale with good repeatability (OCT). This translated into small number of patients being required to attain the same degree of statistical power. A statistically significant treatment effect was observed, whereas in some parameters, it was marginal, considering the sample size, this indicates a very large treatment effect. As with all clinical trials, there is a low probability that these results have occurred randomly, however, trials with small sample sizes are more vulnerable to bias and random effects than those with larger samples. These results should therefore be verified at other centers, and separate research groups.</p><p>In conclusion, this study aimed to validate the hypothesis, deriving from our experimental preclinical work, that MR antagonists influence SRF and choroid thickness in CSC. Other studies are now required to confirm these results, to determine the optimal treatment dose and duration, and to evaluate clinical factors predicting response to MR antagonists. Other MR antagonists, under development, and/or other routes of administration could also be proposed for optimized therapeutic index.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p>Inserm provided financial support for the statistical analysis and was promoter of the study.</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p>F.
