In this study, 90 patients with left idiopathic symptomatic varicoceles of grades II&#x02013;III according to the Dubin grading system were randomly assigned to TTLVL (<italic>n</italic> = 45) and conventional laparoscopic varicocele ligation (CLVL) (<italic>n</italic> = 45). The demographic, intraoperative, postoperative, and follow-up data were recorded and compared between the two groups. All the procedures in the two groups were completed successfully with no intraoperative complications and no conversions to open surgery. No significant difference was found in the operative time, resuming ambulation, bowel recovery, postoperative hospital stay, and postoperative resolution of scrotal pain between the two groups (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05). However, the postoperative mean visual analog pain scale scores for TTLVL group were all less at 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, and 7 days postoperatively compared to CLVL (<italic>P</italic> = 0.001, 0.010, 0.006, and 0.027, respectively). The mean patient scar assessment questionnaire score in postoperative month 3 was 29.7 for TTLVL group compared with 32.1 for CLVL group (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). There was no testicular atrophy observed in both groups during the follow-up period. The study shows that TTLVL is a safe, feasible, and effective minimally invasive surgical alternative to CLVL for the treatment of varicocele. Compared with CLVL, TTLVL may decrease postoperative pain and improve the cosmetic outcomes.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>laparoendoscopic single-site surgery</kwd><kwd>umbilicus</kwd><kwd>varicocelectomy</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Varicocele is the most common curable cause of male infertility, which is found in approximately 15% of the male population and in up to 35% of men with primary infertility and 81% of men with secondary infertility.

Several surgical techniques via high retroperitoneal, inguinal, microsurgical inguinal, and laparoscopic approaches have been reported, but with no most ideal treatment.<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Although some reports indicated that the microsurgical varicocelectomy may be lead to a lower incidence of postoperative hydrocele formation, the operating time is considerably longer than that for other procedures.<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> The high retroperitoneal, inguinal varicocelectomy may cause many injuries and slower recovery.</p><p>In recent years, with the development of laparoscopy, laparoscopic varicocele ligation is becoming increasingly popular in clinical practice for its many advantages, such as less invasiveness, quicker recovery, improved cosmesis, magnified and clear surgical visual field, and treating bilateral lesions during one procedure.<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> For the purpose of decreasing invasiveness and improving appearance, U-LESS was established, which represents an extension of the minimally invasive surgery. There were several reports showing that U-LESS varicocelectomy yielded superior cosmetic results with less pain compared with conventional laparoscopic varicocelectomy.<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p><p>TTLVL, a modified U-LESS for the treatment of varicocele, was established by ourselves and applied in our clinical practice broadly. We initially compared this novel method with CLVL. Concerning the two groups, the patients were almost the same, and all the procedures were performed by one of two surgeons so that the both procedures were performed by the both surgeons to avoid bias. Apart from comparable intraoperative and postoperative parameters, such as operative time, bowel recovery, postoperative hospital stay, recurrent varicocele, and postoperative improvement of semen parameters, TTLVL yields lower VAPS and PSAQ score than CLVL. Thus, TTLVL not only had a comparable surgical effect to CLVL but had less pain and better cosmetic outcome, which satisfied the patients who were subjected to varicocelectomy. The patients who undergo the varicocelectomy are usually younger. They often place more importance on the number of incision scares than older patients.<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> TTLVL need only two 5-mm ports which are less than that of CLVL with three ports. What is more, the two-ports for TTLVL are both at the umbilical edge which could lead to better cosmetic result because the scar will be hidden and difficult to find in the future.</p><p>For the ligation of the internal spermatic vein, a 7#-silk thread was used. There is some difficulty in knotting via a single port. In the early stages of this approach, we used a knot tier to complete the knotting. When the surgeon was proficient, the knot could be completely finished in the abdominal cavity by only one forceps. In this study, the shortest time for TTVL was only 18 min. Using silk thread was safer than a Titanium clip. Friedersdorff <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> and Kang <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> used Hem-o-lok clips to ligate the incompetent internal spermatic veins in their U-LESS varicocelectomy. Glassberg <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> and Al-Hunayan <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> used a vascular sealing system to complete the varicocele ligation in the laparoscopic varicocelectomy. Compared with Hem-o-lok and vascular sealing system, the 7#-silk thread is much cheaper, which could decrease the economic burden of patients.</p><p>Numerous studies have revealed an improvement in the semen parameters the following varicocelectomy.<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> However, some studies have not demonstrated any beneficial effect.<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> This discrepancy might be the result of several factors that include variations in patient populations among studies, methods of assessment, the expertise of medical personnel, low patient numbers, and variation in semen parameters within an individual, along with other possible factors.<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Our study showed that TTLV and CLVL both resulted in significant improvement in semen parameters, which was comparable to previously reported results.<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></p><p>Preservation of the testicular artery is a controversial issue. Some studies have showed that testicular artery ligation has no deleterious effect on the testicular blood supply and semen parameters if the arteries of the vas deferens and cremaster were spared.<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Recent meta-analyses and study have shown that preservation of the internal spermatic artery may be result in similar clinical outcomes of semen analysis and higher recurrence rate in varicocelectomy.<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> In the current study, we could not preserve the spermatic artery in all procedures. As a result, no testicular atrophy was found at the follow-up and a good postoperative improvement of semen parameters was obtained in the both groups.</p><p>Al-Hunayan <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> introduced their two-trocar laparoscopic varicocelectomy in 2006. Two trocars were used in their operation, including one 5-mm trocar at the umbilicus for the camera and one 5-mm suprapubic trocar for the forceps. In addition, the Veress needle was inserted percutaneously about 1 cm medial to the anterosuperior iliac spine and was used to dissect the incompetent internal spermatic veins free. Differently, two-ports were both inserted at the umbilical edge in our two-port method, which resulted in less pain and a good cosmetic outcome because of the hidden umbilical scars.</p><p>There were some limitations in the study. The patients with bilateral varicocele were not included in the study for the sake of the convenience of the comparison. Furthermore, there were no exact details of some possible confounding factors such as a follicle-stimulating hormone, testosterone, and testicular volume to be reported.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>TTLVL is a safe, feasible, and effective minimally invasive surgical alternative to CLVL for the treatment of varicocele.
