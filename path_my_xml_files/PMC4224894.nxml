The primary analysis at 48 weeks showed 400 mg EFV was safe and virologically non-inferior to 600 mg. This analysis explores over 96 weeks the durability of efficacy and safety.</p></sec><sec id="st2_19523"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>A multinational, double-blind, placebo-controlled, non-inferiority trial in treatment-na&#x000ef;ve HIV-positive adults randomized to TDF/FTC plus reduced (400 mg, EFV400) or standard dose (600 mg, EFV600) EFV. The difference between proportions of participants with plasma HIV RNA (VL) &#x0003c;200 log<sub>10</sub> copies/mL by intention-to-treat (ITT missing=failure) was compared using a non-inferiority margin of &#x02212;10%. Non-inferiority was also examined in per protocol (PP) and non-completer = failure (NC=F) populations. Adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) were summarized by treatment arm.</p></sec><sec id="st3_19523"><title>Results</title><p>The ITT population comprised 630 patients (EFV400 = 321; EFV600 = 309); 32% were female; 37%, 33% and 30% were African, Asian and Caucasian, respectively. A total of 585 (EFV400 = 299; EFV600 = 286) completed 96 weeks on randomized therapy. At 96 weeks, proportions with VL &#x0003c;200 copies/mL were EFV400 (90.0%) and EFV600 (90.6%) (difference &#x02212;0.6; 95% CI &#x02212;5.2 to 4.0; <italic>p</italic>=0.72) demonstrating continued non-inferiority. Non-inferior efficacy was also observed for VL thresholds of &#x0003c;50 and &#x0003c;400 copies/mL irrespective of baseline VL (&#x0003c;100,000 versus &#x02265;100,000 copies/mL). There was no between-arm difference in time to loss of virological response (&#x0003e;200 copies/mL) (<italic>p</italic>=0.47) or mean change from baseline VL (<italic>p</italic>=0.74). Mean change from baseline in CD4 T-cell counts at week 96 remained significantly higher for EFV400 than EFV600 (difference 25 cells/&#x000b5;L; 95% CI 2&#x02013;48; <italic>p</italic>=0.03). There was no difference in the frequency or severity of AEs (EFV400 = 89.4%, EFV600 = 89.3%; difference 0.09; 95% CI &#x02212;4.73 to 4.90; <italic>p</italic>=0.97). The proportions ever reporting an AE definitely or probably EFV-related were EFV400 (37.7%) and EFV600 (47.9%) (difference &#x02212;10.2%; 95% CI &#x02212;17.9 to &#x02212;2.51; <italic>p</italic>=0.01). SAEs did not differ in frequency (EFV400 = 7.5%, EFV600 = 10.4%; difference &#x02212;2.9%; 95% CI &#x02212;7.3 to 1.6; <italic>p</italic>=0.20).</p></sec><sec id="st4_19523"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Non-inferiority of EFV 400 mg to EFV 600 mg when combined with TDF/FTC as initial HIV therapy was confirmed at week 96. Both doses demonstrated similar safety profiles. These results support the use of a lower EFV dose as part of routine HIV management.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front></article>
