Ambulatory management of MPE has the potential to improve quality of life (QoL). The OPTIMUM trial is designed to determine whether full outpatient management of MPE with an indwelling pleural catheter (IPC) and pleurodesis improves QoL compared with traditional inpatient care with a chest drain and talc pleurodesis. OPTIMUM is currently open for any centres interested in collaborating in this study.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>OPTIMUM is a multicentre non-blinded randomised controlled trial. Patients with a diagnosis of MPE will be identified and screened for eligibility. Consenting participants will be randomised 1:1 either to an outpatient ambulatory pathway using IPCs and talc pleurodesis or standard inpatient treatment with chest drain and talc pleurodesis as per British Thoracic Society guidelines. The primary outcome measure is global health-related QoL at 30&#x02005;days measured using the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire. Secondary outcome measures include breathlessness and pain measured using a 100&#x02005;mm Visual Analogue Scale and health-related QoL at 60 and 90&#x02005;days. A sample size of 142 patients is needed to demonstrate a clinically significant difference of 8 points in global health status at 30&#x02005;days, for an 80% power and a 5% significance level.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>The study has been approved by the NRES Committee South East Coast&#x02014;Brighton and Sussex (reference 15/LO/1018).

With advancement of techniques over the last decade, physicians and patients are faced with a number of choices in the management of MPE. These choices depend on many factors, and not all patients are suitable for every strategy. Regardless of the choice, the aim should be an overall improvement in quality of life (QoL).</p><p>Managing patients with an easily implemented ambulatory pathway which averts the need for an inpatient hospital stay may improve QoL in a population with an otherwise poor prognosis.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> To investigate this, the OPTIMUM trial, a National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Portfolio multicentre study (UKCRN 19615), is currently open to taking on other recruiting sites.</p><sec id="s1a"><title>British Thoracic Society guidelines</title><p>The 2010 British Thoracic Society (BTS) pleural disease guideline advocates chest tube drainage and chemical pleurodesis involving a hospital admission.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> The sclerosant of choice in the UK is graded large-particle talc, a safe and effective sclerosant at a dose of 4&#x02005;g.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Median length of a hospital admission for this intervention is 4&#x02005;days (IQR 2&#x02013;6&#x02005;days).<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p></sec><sec id="s1b"><title>The indwelling pleural catheter</title><p>An alternative and increasingly popular strategy to manage MPE is the insertion of an indwelling pleural catheter (IPC) as an outpatient and continued management on an outpatient/ambulatory basis. The BTS recognises that IPCs are effective in controlling recurrent effusions and are particularly useful in cases of trapped lung, where talc pleurodesis is likely to fail. It is a safe procedure which can be managed in the outpatient setting, thus avoiding hospital admission.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p><p>A relatively new treatment pathway involves instillation of talc via an IPC to prevent recurrence, allowing the opportunity to manage people as outpatients. This novel pathway in the management of MPE is well established at Guy's and St Thomas's Hospital. Our case series of 24 patients who underwent talc pleurodesis via an IPC confirms the safety and efficacy of this treatment algorithm<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> on which the OPTIMUM trial is based.</p><p>A huge body of research has looked into the therapeutic management of MPE. This has led to multiple management pathways. However, there is no one definitive management strategy. Despite the goal of palliation, the majority of studies focus on outcome measures such as pleurodesis success rate, failure rate and complications.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8&#x02013;12</xref> While this is important, we believe it is important to understand the impact of these interventions on the overall well-being of patients.</p><p>There is a paucity of data on QoL outcomes in this population, particularly the effects of different pleural interventions. A retrospective study of talc pleurodesis by surgical video-assisted thoracoscopy failed to show any QoL benefit at 3 and 6&#x02005;months.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> The Second Therapeutic Intervention in Malignant Effusion (TIME2) randomised controlled trial showed no difference between medical pleurodesis and IPC insertion without talc in relieving breathlessness. Global QoL evaluated as a secondary measure did improve in both groups at 6&#x02005;weeks, but there was no significant difference in QoL at any time point.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> There are no prospective randomised controlled trials primarily comparing QoL outcomes in the outpatient and inpatient management of MPE.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Objectives</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Hypothesis</title><p>The primary hypothesis is that outpatient management of MPEs with an IPC improves global health-related QoL at 30&#x02005;days following insertion when compared to standard treatment according to BTS guidelines.</p><p>With no validated QoL assessment tools for patients with MPE, global health-related QoL as measured by the EORTC QLQ-C30 has been selected as the primary outcome measure.
