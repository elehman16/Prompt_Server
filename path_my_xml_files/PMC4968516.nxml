at risk for falls. For the elite athlete, balance deficits may affect performance<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. The interaction of central and peripheral
elements is essential for maintaining balance. The peripheral element is comprised of the
somatosensory system, which provides information on the location of joints and the level of
tension, extension, and pain in joints, muscles, ligament, and the vestibular system, which
provides information on environmental changes<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. The central element integrates information delivered from the
peripheral element and controls the location and posture of the trunk so that the are
correct. One of the important elements for functioning in daily life is maintenance of
symmetrical balance in the human body in standing or sitting postures. Therefore, the loss
of balance ability can cause secondary functional disorders due to falls<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Walking is one of the most common forms of
human movement, and the human body undergoes a complex process in neurologic and kinetic
terms until walking can be performed repeatedly and rhythmically. As this shows, because
various elements are involved in walking, an individual exhibits unique gait characteristics
according to his/her own functions in the muscular, skeletal, and nervous systems<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Gait is composed of cyclic crossing of the
stance leg by the swing leg during the single support phase, and in this phase, the trunk&#x02019;s
dynamic balance ability is a highly important factor<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. In recent years, balance training using the Aero-Step has been
introduced as one of the various interventions for improving balance and gait abilities. The
Aero-Step is characterized by elasticity and an unstable surface, as it contains chambers
filled with air. In addition, balance exercises using an Aero-Step reduce the impact on
lower extremity joints, and the Aero-Step enables performance of various exercises.
Moreover, it is a useful exercise tool that can reduce monotonousness and boredom in one&#x02019;s
exercise routine<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Balance exercises using
an Aero-Step can not only activate the somatosensory, vestibular, and visual systems, which
are sensory systems involved in maintaining the body&#x02019;s balance, but can also improve the
balance ability necessary for maintaining a standing posture. Although various studies have
been carried out regarding balance training, studies on balance training using the Aero-Step
are limited. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine the effects of Aero-Step
balance training on the balance and gait abilities of normal individuals.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Forty subjects participated in the experiment and were randomly assigned to an experimental
group of 20 subjects and a control group of 20 subjects. The selection criteria for the
subjects that participated in the study were as follows: no history of orthopedic surgery in
the lower limb, no history of taking any drug due to neurologic problems, and no
musculoskeletal system disease. The Research Ethics Committee of Eulji University Hospital
approved the study, and all participants provided informed, written consent prior to
enrollment in the study. The average ages, heights, and weights were 20.17 &#x000b1; 1.22 and 21.25
&#x000b1; 1.36&#x02005;years old, 172.44 &#x000b1; 12.03 and 173.15 &#x000b1; 10.42&#x02005;cm, and 68.05 &#x000b1; 9.61 and 65.31 &#x000b1; 6.62&#x02005;kg
in the experimental and control groups, respectively. Sufficient explanation of this study&#x02019;s
intent and the overall purpose was given, and voluntary consent to participation in this
study was obtained from all of the subjects. All procedures were reviewed and approved by
the Institutional Ethics Committee of Eulji University Hospital. The experimental group
performed balance exercise on the Aero-step device (Aero-step XL, TOGU, Prien-Bachham,
Germany)<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. The control group was
performed balance exercise on the rigid ground. All subjects performed balance training 30
minutes a day, 5days a week, for 4weeks. The Aero-Step equipment was used to provide an
unstable base during the performance of the exercise program<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. The Aero-Step equipment is 51&#x02005;cm long, 37&#x02005;cm wide, and 8&#x02005;cm high.
It is composed of a soft rubber and contains two chambers, which are filled with air. In the
first phase exercise, the subjects bent the left knee joint at 90&#x000b0; while supporting the body
with the right leg, and then they bent the right knee joint at 90&#x000b0; while supporting the body
with the left leg. In the second phase, the subjects bent the left knee and hip joints at
90&#x000b0; while supporting the body with the right leg, and then they bent the right knee and hip
joints at 90&#x000b0; while supporting the body with the left leg. In the third phase, the subjects
walked in place on a supporting surface and maintained a certain gait velocity. While
walking in place, they bent the knee and hip joints. In the fourth phase, the subjects stood
upright with the feet shoulder-width apart and bent the knee and hip joints at 90&#x000b0;. In the
fifth phase, the subject bent and stretched the left hip joint while supporting the body
with the right leg, and then they bent and stretched the right hip joint while supporting
the body with the left leg. During this exercise, they were required to look straight ahead.
Each phase of exercise took five minutes. A three-minute break was provide between phases of
exercise. After the intervention, balance measuring equipment (Good Balance, Metitur,
Jyvaskyla, Finland) was used to quantitatively measure balance ability. For measurement of
balance functions, the subjects were instructed to stand on a triangle platform and maintain
a symmetric standing posture with the legs apart at shoulder width. In this case, a visual
fixed point was marked in front of the subjects to minimize head movement. The subjects were
then ask to place their arms comfortably at the sides of their hip joints, and the COP
(center of pressure) was measured for 30 seconds in this standing posture with the eyes
open. The COP was measured three times repeatedly, and the average value was calculated. A
pedometer (Gait Rite, K634-DB, Epson Inc, America) was used to collect data for
temporospatial gait characteristics such as velocity, step length, stride length, single
support duration, double support duration, and cadence of the experimental group and the
control group. For precise analysis of their gait, the subjects were asked to walk along a
2&#x02005;m walkway in three sessions, and the average values of the data were used. The subjects
lifted their head and looked straight forward and walked barefoot while lightly swinging
their upper limbs<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Data analysis was
performed using IBM SPSS Statistics version 20.0 (IBM corp., Armonk, NY, USA). The mean and
standard deviation (SD) were calculated for each variable. Before the intervention,
differences in the general characteristics of the experimental and control groups were
compared using independent t-tests and &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> tests. Comparisons of variables before
and after training within each group were made using paired sample t-tests. Comparisons of
pre- and post-test differences in variables between the experimental and control groups were
performed using the independent t-test. Intergroup effect sizes were calculated using the
Cohen d coefficient<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Statistical analysis
was performed at a 95% confidence level, and p values &#x0003c;0.05 were considered statistically
significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>No significant differences in the baseline characteristics were observed between the two

not only sensory organs such as the somatosensory, vestibular, and visual systems, but also
the central nervous system, these exercises are also effective for brain fitness. In
addition, because the Aero-Step is safe and easy to handle, it can be used by the elderly
aged 60 or older<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. This study was
performed to learn about the effects of balance exercises using an Aero-Step on the balance
and gait of normal individuals. As a result, statistically significant increases were
observed in dynamic and static balance abilities and gait velocity. A previous study
reported that when poststroke hemiplegic patients performed somatosensory exercises using
the proprioceptive senses, statistically significant increases were shown in the balance
ability and functional gait indices<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. This
is similar to the results of the present study. Another study reported that when stroke
patients performed exercises on an unstable supporting surface, they showed improvements in
balance ability and reduction in the risk of falls compared with performing exercises on a
stable supporting surface<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
mechanism of balance exercises using an Aero-Step can be explained as follows. Somatosensory
receptors are largely influenced by the surface. Therefore, balance exercises using
Aero-Step as an unstable surface activate tendons, ligaments, and joint receptors. This may
be because activation of the somatosensory system by the Aero-Step&#x02019;s unstable surface has
positive impacts on improving balance and gait abilities. Reduced balance and gait abilities
cause falls. To prevent this, the visual, vestibular, and somatosensory systems should be
strengthened<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. The organs that show
the largest distribution of somatosensory receptors in the human body are the hand, foot,
and face. Among them, the foot has the largest number of sensory receptors. Therefore,
balance exercises using an Aero-Step may be recommended as an exercise method that can
develop the somatosensory system effectively.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Fernie</surname><given-names>GR</given-names></name><name><surname>Gryfe</surname><given-names>CI</given-names></name><name><surname>Holliday</surname><given-names>PJ</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>The relationship of postural sway in standing to the
