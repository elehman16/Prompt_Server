In addition, there were 3 partial remission events in 2 patients assigned the 4 mg/kg fresolimumab arm versus only 1 patient in placebo arm who had at least 1 partial remission event. Although there were no statistical differences in eGFR between the groups, fresolimumab-treated patients showed a trend toward better preservation of renal function compared with placebo-treated patients. As the expected spontaneous remission rate in primary FSGS has been reported as&#x000a0;&#x02264; 5%<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> or&#x000a0;&#x02264; 6%,<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> the number of patient responders and total partial remission events in the treated arms may represent an efficacy signal. It is not clear why no dose response was seen in the lower versus higher doses of fresolimumab. It is possible that the short duration of treatment may account for the low rate of proteinuria remissions. Further studies with longer treatment duration are needed to provide additional clinical data.</p><p id="p0195">Four of 6 patients treated with either low- or high-dose fresolimumab who had a clinically meaningful and consistent proteinuria response were black (2 of whom were Hispanic); 5 patients had APOL-1 risk haplotypes, and 1 patient was not genotyped (optional genetic testing consent not signed). The mechanism by which APOL1 variants promote renal fibrosis remains unclear, with no direct, known linkage to regulation of TGF-&#x003b2; reported as of yet. The 2 black patients assigned to 4 mg/kg fresolimumab who had &#x0201c;durable&#x0201d; clinical responses experienced their partial remission events during the follow-up period (visit 7&#x02013;9) after steadily declining proteinuria during the treatment period, whereas the 4 patient responders in the 1 mg/kg fresolimumab arm had most of their partial remission events during the treatment period (visit 3&#x02013;6).</p><p id="p0200">A potentially higher response rate to fresolimumab in black patients with FSGS may be consistent with previous reports that healthy black patients as well as black patients with ESRD and hypertension have significantly higher levels of circulating TGF-&#x003b2; when compared to white patients with comparable health status.<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> Furthermore, these signals of therapeutic response in the black patients harboring APOL1 risk alleles are noteworthy in light of the recent report from the NEPTUNE consortium showing that the APOL1 risk genotype in black patients with FSGS is associated with significantly greater interstitial fibrosis at the time of biopsy.<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> These trial findings, albeit preliminary, raise the possibility that black patients with APOL1 risk alleles may receive greater therapeutic benefit from fresolimumab than others. The phase 1 FSGS study also reported that black patients may have had higher rates of proteinuria responses to a single dose of fresolimumab.<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> The observation that not all patients responded to fresolimumab may not be surprising in view of the heterogeneity and racial predilection of FSGS.</p><p id="p0205">Fresolimumab was generally well tolerated by study patients. The majority of TEAEs in all treatment groups were nonserious and either mild or moderate in severity. No significant difference was noted in the adverse drug reactions seen in the 1 mg/kg arm versus the 4 mg/kg arm. The MEOIs observed were consistent with what has been seen in the previous clinical studies on fresolimumab, specifically, events associated with bleeding and skin changes. The nature of the MEOIs was not significantly different between the 1 mg/kg and 4 mg/kg arms.</p><p id="p0210">In previous clinical trials on fresolimumab, the relationship of the skin events (including keratoacanthoma and squamous cell carcinoma) to drug appeared to be associated with both dose and dose exposure, although the majority of skin events was reversible over time following discontinuation of&#x000a0;treatment and did not cause significant morbidity. A&#x000a0;recent study has linked mutations of TGFBR1 as&#x000a0;the&#x000a0;causative gene in self-healing squamous epithelioma.<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref></p><p id="p0215">The relationship of fresolimumab to bleeding events remains unclear, but the majority of these events were grade 1, and, importantly, no study drug treatment-emergent abnormalities were observed in platelet number, platelet function, and coagulation parameters that might indicate a bleeding diathesis.</p><p id="p0220">Intriguingly, in a <italic>post hoc</italic> exploratory analysis, a trend in eGFR stabilization that was not clearly related to the magnitude of proteinuria reductions or the presence of remission was observed in fresolimumab-treated patients compared to a decline in percent eGFR change in the placebo group over the total study period (252 days). This may reflect the effect of fresolimumab in slowing progression of&#x000a0;kidney fibrosis and thereby stabilizing eGFR independent of proteinuria reduction. Although only a trend due to the limited patient numbers, this should be further explored in a larger and adequately powered study. The possibility of an anti&#x02212;TGF-&#x003b2; treatment to stabilize the otherwise downward trajectory of the kidney&#x02019;s decline could be important for the overall prognosis of patients with FSGS.</p><p id="p0225">Further studies of fresolimumab in FSGS in larger studies with adequate power are needed for validation to show whether this trend portends a statistically significant clinical benefit. In the future, biomarkers reflecting glomerular and tubular cell injury and/or repair may aid the selection of patients with refractory FSGS who will benefit from this novel therapeutic agent.</p></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>Disclosure</title><p id="p0230">KNC, MDE, FCF, LG, PN, MP, JR, LS, AS, DT-B, JT, FVV, and FV received research funding from Sanofi to their institution for incurred clinical study participation expenses.
