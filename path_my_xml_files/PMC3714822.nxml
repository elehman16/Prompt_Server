For many years, the free gingival graft was considered as a widely used, versatile and predictable mucogingival surgical procedure. Its main objective was to increase the apical-coronal dimension of keratinized tissue to extend the vestibular fornix, to dissipate muscle pull, and to provide an adequate zone of attached gingiva to maintain gingival health and to prevent gingival recession to occur. Once it was shown that periodontal health could be maintained even without gingiva, as long as good plaque control was maintained; the goals of the treatment of gingival recession have changed from preventing further progression of gingival recession to achieving predictable root coverage to solve patients&#x02019; esthetic demands, root sensitivity, decrease potential for root caries.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>]</p><p>The exposure of root surfaces maybe due to periodontal diseases, mechanical forces such as faulty tooth brushing, iatrogenic factors such as orthodontic movement, poor restorations, and anatomical factors such as tooth malposition and frenum pull.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>]</p><p>Several surgical techniques have been described to cover the root: Lateral or pedicle sliding flap that has several limitations there should be adequate dimension of gingival tissue lateral to the site of recession and the area to be treated should be localized. The advantage of this procedure is in the esthetics because the color match is ideal.</p><p>The coronally positioned flap (CPF) is another surgical technique used with many variations. This technique is limited by the amount of height and thickness of the gingival tissues; however, the resulting esthetics are usually good and can be used to treat localized or generalized recession defects.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] This technique was shown to be a predictable method for recession coverage with apparently satisfactory esthetic results. This is a relatively easy procedure for the clinician to perform and for the patient due to reduced morbidity because donor tissue need not be procured.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] This technique has been performed with or without use of root conditioners such as citric acid or tetracycline.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>]</p><p>A CPF with an adjunctive subepithelial connective tissue graft (CTG) is also used in treating gingival recession. The removal of a CTG results in only minor palatal denudation. This technique usually results in a good color blend of the augmented area and increased graft vascularization from the underlying periosteum and the overlying flap to the graft.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] CPF + CTG have demonstrated great predictability and versatility, even when treating severe recessions and thin tissues. Sometimes a second surgery is needed to reduce thickness and obtain a good esthetic result.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] A histological study showed that recessions treated by CPF + CTG can partially heal with regeneration.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] This technique appears to offer significant improvement in predictability.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] Current literature indicates that the CTG offers increased predictability.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] This procedure has a high degree of success and predictability on teeth that present with Miller cl I and II gingival recession.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>]</p><p>Guided tissue regeneration (GTR) is based on the principle of guiding various cells to proliferate and to form new periodontal tissues during healing through the use of resorbable or non-resorbable membrane. This technique has been used to treat localized gingival recession defects.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] Several problems have arisen with the membrane technique. These included the technical difficulties in optimally placing the barrier, membrane exposure in the course of healing, and possible damage of the newly formed tissue due to membrane removal or absorption.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>]</p><p>Enamel matrix derivative (EMD) preparation consists of a group of proteins thought to be important in the development of the dental organ, particularly as it relates to the formation of cementum, periodontal ligament, and alveolar bone.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] A major component of the EMD, amelogenin has been shown by immunohistochemistry to be expressed in human teeth not only in enamel formation, but also in root formation. When mesenchymal cells of the dental follicle are exposed to the enamel matrix, a non-cellular hard tissue matrix is formed on the enamel surface. A commercially available product, Emdogain, consists of amelogenins that are extracted from developing embryonal tooth buds of porcine origin.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] It has been shown that EMD enhances the proliferation and protein production by human periodontal ligament cells <italic>in vitro</italic>. It has also been tested as a periodontal regenerative treatment modality in animals and humans and was shown to be safe and effective on improving clinical attachment levels and radiographic bone fill. Human biopsy reports revealed that true periodontal regeneration could be achieved with topical application of EMD.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] Two histological studies showed formation of new cementum, organizing PDL fibers, and newly formed woven bone after treating recession by CTG + EMD or CPF + EMD.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>]</p><p>Root coverage outcomes in almost all studies are based on linear measurement of the recession depth and recession width obtained by a periodontal probe. Today, by use of different software programmes, a new horizon to diagnosis and treatment plan in periodontics has been opened. AutoCAD is a software programme that could be used for obtaining two-dimensional views in the treatment of gingival recession.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>]</p><p>The aim of the present prospective, randomized, split-mouth, clinical study on teeth with Miller cl I or II gingival recession was to clinically evaluate the use of EMD in association with CPF to cover gingival recession compared to subepithelial CTG alone. The covered surface area was obtained and compared by AutoCAD programme for the first time.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>Thirteen non-smoking patients (eight females and five males) aged 16-52 years (40.6 &#x000b1; 12.5) with two or more similar bilateral Miller cl I or II gingival recessions of &#x02265;3 mm and &#x02265;3mm width on incisors, canines, or premolars were selected among patients referred to the periodontics department of Islamic Azad University-Dental branch and private periodontal clinic. Twenty pairs of gingival recession were treated. Before therapy, all patients agreed to participate in the study signed a written informed consent according to ethical principles No 12053 Islamic Azad University-Dental branch. Inclusion criteria were that vital teeth free from decay, crown, or buccal restorations, no radiographic signs of periapical infection, no occlusal trauma, no previous periodontal surgery in the area.</p><p>All patients were healthy, not taking any medication, pregnant, and/or lactating women were excluded from the study. All patients received oral hygiene instructions associated with full mouth scaling. One patient refused to continue the study. Therefore, eighteen pairs of gingival recessions fulfilled the 6 months examination.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Clinical evaluation</title><p>One clinician blinded to the surgical procedure collected the pre-and post-operative data.

The measured pre-operative points on the stent were processed by the AutoCad programme and &#x000ab;Points&#x000bb; and &#x000ab;Spline&#x000bb; rules were used to make a curved line. This line showed the pre-operative gingival margin position. New gingival margin position at follow-up intervals (1, 3, 6 months) were made by the aforementioned rules. &#x000ab;Boundary&#x000bb; rule was used to make an area between the curved lines at different interval examinations and the pre-operative curved line. This area, which is referred to the covered root surface after treatment was measured by the &#x000ab;Region&#x000bb; and &#x000ab;Area&#x000bb; rules. In other words, these points were used to make an area of the recession defect by the Autocad programme and changes of the area over time could be assessed and calculated by overlapping the figures obtained at different follow-up examinations [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>].</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Root surface area coverage by AutoCAD evaluation from baseline to 6 month</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="DRJ-10-38-g001"/></fig></sec></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Surgical procedure</title><p>Pre-operative photographs of the cases and surgical procedures were performed between September 2008 and June 2009. In each patient, the tooth with gingival recession was randomly assigned to one of the surgical procedures. Randomization was performed by coin toss. Surgical procedures were performed by one clinician with over 10 years of clinical experience in periodontal surgery. The test treatment consisted of a CPF technique plus EMD. Before elevation of the flap, the exposed and the intrasulcular root surfaces were gently scaled and planed with Gracy curettes. After local anesthesia with Lidocaine 1:80000, a no. 15 blade was used to make intrasulcular incision on the buccal aspect of the tooth. The incision was extended horizontally up to the adjacent tooth both mesial and distal to the involved tooth or teeth at the level of the CEJ. Two oblique releasing incisions were carried out from the mesial and distal extremities of the horizontal incisions across the mucogingival junction reaching the alveolar mucosa. A trapezoidal partial thickness flap was raised and the root surface was scaled and debrided with hand instruments properly. The papillae adjacent to the involved tooth were deepithelialized to create a connective tissue bed. For the test group, the root surface was conditioned with 24% EDTA gel (prefgel, emdogain) for two minutes to remove the smear layer and to obtain a surface devoid of organic debries. The root surfaces was copiously rinsed with normal saline.</p><p>EMD (straumann, swiss) was then applied, starting from the most apical bone level and covering the entire root surface. The CPF was secured coronally slightly above the CEJ and sutured tension free with 5/0 silk suture along the vertical and horizontal initial incisions [Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>].</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>(a) Test site<sup>[22,23]</sup> at baseline, (b-d) during surgery, (e) after 6 months</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="DRJ-10-38-g002"/></fig><p>On the control tooth, a trapezoidal partial thickness flap with vertical incisions was elevated on the buccal surface of the tooth and the root was scaled and planed with curet.
