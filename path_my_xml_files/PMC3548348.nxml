Elimination of bacteria from root canal is normally accomplished by mechanical instrumentation in adjunct with irrigating solutions and anti-bacterial agents. Among these anti-bacterial agents, calcium hydroxide is the most commonly used and recommended for inter appointment intra-canal endodontic dressing.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>]</p><p>There are 3 main types of vehicles used: (1) Water-soluble substances like water, saline, local anesthetic agent, and ringers solutions; (2) viscous vehicles like glycerin, polyethylene glycol, and propylene glycol; and (3) oil-based vehicles like olive oil, silicone oil, camphor, eugenol, metacresylate, etc.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>]</p><p>Residual calcium hydroxide on the root canal wall influences dentine bond strength and penetration of sealers into dentinal tubules. The remnants of calcium hydroxide could also react chemically with the sealer, reducing the efficiency of its properties like flow and working time.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] Therefore, calcium hydroxide dressing has to be removed from root canals before obturation.</p><p>This can be achieved by irrigating with irrigants like sodium hypochlorite, saline or Ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid and combining the usage of hand instruments along with irrigants. Few studies have used passive ultrasonic irrigation to remove calcium hydroxide from root canal walls and were found to be effective.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>]</p><p>Maleic acid, which has been used as an acid conditioner in adhesive system, is reported to have removed smear layer, which was present in cavities prepared for adhesive dentistry. Maleic acid with concentrations of 5% and 7% can be an alternative for 17% EDTA for smear layer removal. It has anti-microbial activity against <italic>E. faecalis</italic>, is less cytotoxic than EDTA, and is effective in smear layer removal.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>]</p><p>In most of the studies done to analyze the removal of calcium hydroxide from the root canal, where it has been placed as intra-canal medicament, the technique involved sectioning the teeth longitudinally and analysis of photos of specimens with digital image processor to measure the surface area covered with calcium hydroxide. Calcium hydroxide may be lost during sectioning, which may not help in the correct evaluation of the technique.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] Three-dimensional volume analysis with spiral CT is used in the field of medicine in various applications (Thoracic and abdominal aneurysm, intracranial aneurysm etc).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] Spiral CT volumetric analysis gives a more accurate measurement of pre-and post-removal calcium hydroxide from root canals.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] Till now, no study has been done using maleic acid and ultrasonic passive agitation to remove calcium hydroxide from root canals. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of 17% EDTA and 7% maleic acid combined with sodium hypochlorite and ultrasonic agitation in removal of calcium hydroxide placed as intra-canal medicament using 3 vehicles, distilled water, polyethylene glycol, and silicone oil. The volume of calcium hydroxide removed was analyzed with spiral-computed tomography.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>The calcium hydroxide formulations were selected on the basis of the vehicle used. Metapex is a commercially available product composed of calcium hydroxide, silicone oil, and iodoform (Meta Dental Corp Ltd., Elmburt). ApexCal contains calcium hydroxide and bismuth carbonate in a mixture of water, glycerin, polyethylene glycol, and auxiliary materials (Viola, Ivoclar Vivadent AG). The chemically pure 95% calcium hydroxide powder (Merck India Ltd. Mumbai) was mixed with distilled water in the ratio of 1:1 by weight, and barium sulfate was added for radio opacity.</p><p>Sixty single-rooted premolars were selected. Teeth with fractures, cracks, or any other defects were excluded. Teeth were stored in normal saline solution that was changed daily till sufficient numbers of teeth were collected. Access was prepared; working length was established 1 mm short of apical foramen. All canals were prepared by the same operator to a size 50 K file (Mani files, mani, inc Tochigi Japan) at working length using a step back technique. Irrigation was done with 5.25% sodium hypochlorite and 17% EDTA (Pulpdent Corporation 80 Okland Street Watertown MA, USA) using 5 ml disposable plastic syringe with 27 gauge needle (Endo Eze; Ultradent Products Inc. South Jordan UT, USA). After root canal preparation, a size 20 K file was passed 1 mm beyond the apex to remove any dentinal plug.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] A final rinse with 10 ml normal saline was performed, and root canals were dried with paper points. The teeth were stored in normal saline in airtight bottles in between procedures.</p><p>The teeth were divided into 3 groups consisting of 20 teeth each as A, B, and C.</p><p>Group A: Pure calcium hydroxide mixture withdistilled water.</p><p>Group B: ApexCal</p><p>Group C: Metapex</p><p>In each group, the medicament was placed in the canal using lentulo spiral (Mani files, mani, inc Tochigi Japan) ensuring extrusion through the apex. Access cavities were temporarily sealed with cotton pellets and IRM (Dentsply Int Mill ford DE, USA). The teeth were stored at 37&#x000b0; centigrade and 100% relative humidity for 7 days. The teeth were mounted in a plastic stand using modeling wax for taking spiral CT. After CT imaging, volume of the filling material in each tooth were estimated using Siemens Emotion duo model of spiral CT with the aid of Syngo software [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>].</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Spiral CT images of teeth filled with calcium hydroxide medicaments before and after retrieval using two reagents</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JCD-16-56-g001"/></fig><p>The teeth in each group were further divided into 2 sub-groups based on the material used for removal of medicament from the root canal. 17% EDTA was used for the first sub-group (A1, B1, and C1), and 7% maleic acid (Sd Fine-Chem Ltd., Mumbai, India.) was used for the second sub-group (A2, B2, and C2).</p><p>Protocol for removing the intra-canal medicaments was</p><p>Step 1: Master apical file 6 -7 vertical motions +5 ml of 5.25% NaOCl.</p><p>Step 2: 5 ml of 17% EDTA/7% maleic acid + ultrasonic agitation</p><p>Step 3: 5 ml of NaOCl + ultrasonic agitation</p><p>Step 4: Irrigation with saline.</p><p>Ultrasonic agitation was done using 25 K ultrasonic file (Mani files, mani, inc Tochigi Japan), which was mounted on a piezoelectric handpiece (Electro Medical Systems, SA) at a power setting of 5 and was passively activated for 1 minute at 2 mm short of working length.</p><p>A second spiral CT was done, and the volume of remaining material in each tooth was estimated [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. The removal efficacy was estimated as {(a-b) &#x000d7; 100/a}, where &#x02018;a&#x02019; was volume of material packed in the root canal and &#x02018;b&#x02019; was volume remaining after retrieval. The data obtained was statistically analyzed using Kruskal Wallis test to compare between groups. Mann Whitney U test was used for pair-wise comparison with Bonferroni corrections. The data was analyzed using statistical package for social sciences (SPSS, version 10.5).</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>As per Bonferroni correction for 3 group comparison, <italic>P</italic> value of less than or equal to 0.016 considered to be significant to adjust for type I error.</p><p>The removal efficiency for various groups was 94.89% (A1), 92.12% (A2), 84.55% (B1), 90.14% (B2), 65.99% (C1), and 88.65% (C2) [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>] [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>].

Viscous vehicles like polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol, glycerin promote a lower solubility of the paste when compared with aqueous vehicles, probably because of their high molecular weight, which minimizes the dispersion of calcium hydroxide into the tissues.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>]</p><p>Oily vehicles are non-water soluble substances that promote the lowest solubility of the paste within the tissues, and pastes containing this kind of vehicle may remain within the root canal for a longer period than the pastes containing aqueous or viscous vehicles.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>]</p><p>The removal of calcium hydroxide has been investigated using a range of products and techniques. The most frequently described method was instrumentation of root canals with a master apical file and copious irrigation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] Canal irregularities may be inaccessible for conventional irrigation procedures, and calcium hydroxide may remain in these extensions.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] Passive ultrasonic irrigation is more effective in dentine debris removal from root canal walls than syringe delivery of irrigant.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] Very few studies have been done combining manual and passive ultrasonic irrigation to remove calcium hydroxide from root canals.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>]</p><p>The calcium hydroxide removal efficacy of the intra-medicament can be calculated efficiently only if the amount removed can be compared with the amount filled or packed in the canal.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] The above procedure was followed in the present study also. When retrievability of the medicaments with 17% EDTA was evaluated, the silicone oil-based medicament resisted the removal to the maximum followed by polyethylene glycol and calcium hydroxide distilled water mixture (<italic>P</italic> = 0.001). The above findings were in agreement with the studies of Lambrianidis <italic>et al</italic>., and Nandini S <italic>et al</italic>., who stated that methyl cellulose and silicone oil vehicle resisted removal from root canal because of interaction of methyl cellulose and EDTA.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] The surface tension of the vehicle used in the medicament should be low to allow better penetration into inaccessible areas. The surface tension of any vehicle decreased significantly with addition of calcium hydroxide powder. Water has surface tension of 70.5 dynes/cm, which decreased to 66.5 dynes/cm with addition of calcium hydroxide.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>] Silicone oil is hydrophobic as it contains many methyl groups and has surface tension of 19 dynes/cm, which will provide better wetting and water-resistant properties.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>] Thus, in the present study, the medicament with distilled water would have been easy to remove. The surface tension value of polyethylene glycol is 43.50 dynes/cm, which is in between the values of distilled water and silicone oil.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>] The hygroscopic nature, water adsorption properties, and the surface tension values may account for the intermediate retrieval values for polyethylene glycol-based medicament in this study.</p><p>When the retrievability of the medicaments with 7% maleic acid was evaluated, the difference was not significant (<italic>P</italic> = 0.818).</p><p>In the groups where distilled water and propylene glycol were used as vehicle, 17% EDTA and 7% maleic acid showed almost same retrievable capability (<italic>P</italic> = 0.218 and <italic>P</italic> = 0.684).</p><p>In the group where silicone oil was used as vehicle, 7% maleic acid showed better retrieval capability of medicaments than 17% EDTA. Maleic acid has lesser surface tension than EDTA.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>] In this study, during initial root canal preparation, 17% EDTA and 5.25% sodium hypochlorite were used in combination for irrigation so as to remove smear layer. It is known that EDTA and sodium hypochlorite have similar surface tension levels, which are important for wetting capability and effectiveness in smear layer removal.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>] This may have enhanced the effect of maleic acid. The low surface tension and acidic nature of maleic acid may have also resulted in better penetration into the dentinal tubules.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Within the limitations of this study, it could be concluded that:</p><p>
