No lead in observational period was foreseen prior to randomisation, except for the SMILE-4 study. In this study, eligible patients entered a 4-day open-label phase prior to randomisation and were given zofenopril according to the up-titration scheme described below.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> The initial dose of zofenopril was 7.5&#x02005;mg two times per day on day 1 and 2, followed by 15&#x02005;mg two times per day on day 3 and 4 and 30&#x02005;mg two times per day from day 5 onward. Up-titration was allowed if systolic blood pressure remained &#x0003e;100&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg and if there were no signs or symptoms of hypotension. The doses of the active comparators were up-titrated as well: up to 10&#x02005;mg once daily for lisinopril and up to 5&#x02005;mg two times per day for ramipril. Randomised treatment was continued for 6&#x02013;48&#x02005;weeks and patients were seen at enrolment every 1&#x02013;6&#x02005;months, depending on the study. For all studies, duration of treatment and follow-up periods overlapped, the only exception being represented by the SMILE-1 study. In this trial, on completion of the 6-week double-blind treatment period, the patients stopped taking the study medication but continued treatment with their other medications for an additional 48&#x02005;weeks.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>This analysis was an individual patient data (IPD) analysis where the IPD were pooled. In this analysis, a one-step approach was used, the IPD were aggregated and the pooled data set was analysed using appropriate statistical methods. IPD pooled analysis improves the quality of data and produces more reliable results. Since all the four SMILE Studies provided information on fatal and non-fatal CV events, the primary study end point of this retrospective analysis was set to the 1&#x02005;year combined occurrence of death or hospitalisation for CV causes. In the SMILE-1 study, the primary end point was the combined occurrence of death or severe congestive heart failure during the 6&#x02005;weeks of treatment with zofenopril or placebo. In the SMILE-2 study, the primary end point was the 6-week occurrence of severe hypotension, either cumulative or related to study drug administration, with zofenopril or lisinopril, while occurrence of CV outcomes was a secondary end point. In the SMILE-3 study, the primary end point was the 6-month global ischaemic burden, defined as the occurrence of post-infarction angina, ischaemic abnormalities during rest or Holter ECG, or treadmill test, recurrent myocardial infarction or need for coronary revascularisation. Finally, in the SMILE-4 study, the primary end point was the 1&#x02005;year rate or CV mortality or morbidity (hospitalisation for CV causes).</p><p>For the purpose of the present pooled analysis, the efficacy end point was calculated after weighing for the number of participants contributing from each study. The efficacy analysis was carried out on the full analysis set (intention-to-treat population), made up of all randomised patients treated with at least one dose of study medication and documenting at least once the measure of the primary efficacy assessment, even in case of protocol violation or premature withdrawal from the study. The safety analysis was applied to all randomised patients who took at least one dose of the study medication, by assessing the incidence of adverse events and changes in laboratory data or ECG during the study. The measure of safety used in this pooled analysis was the rate of drug-related adverse events expressed also as the number of drug-related adverse events divided by the person-time at risk throughout the observation period.</p><p>The baseline characteristics and the distribution of variables in the study populations and subgroups were compared using a &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test (2&#x000d7;4 tables) for categorical variables and an analysis of variance (between groups, F-test) for continuous variables.</p><p>HRs and 95% CIs were calculated by a Cox proportional hazard regression model in which treatment group, gender (males vs females), country, age (&#x0003c;65 vs &#x02265;65&#x02005;years), body mass index (&#x0003c;30 vs&#x02265;30&#x02005;kg/m<sup>2</sup>) and CV risk factors (yes vs no) were included as covariates. CV risk factors were defined by the presence of previous angina pectoris, previous congestive heart failure, hypercholesterolaemia requiring lipid-lowering drug, previous peripheral artery disease or previous coronary revascularisation. In order to account for the different durations of follow-up among the four studies, the relative risk of CV morbidity and mortality was assessed using a time-dependent Cox regression model and corresponding survival curves were drawn. Heterogeneity for the primary study end point was assessed by the Q Cochrane's statistics.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Evaluations for the primary study end point were also made by subgroups of patients according to age, gender, diabetes, hypertension and CV risk factors.</p><p>All p values are two-sided and the minimum level of statistical significance was set at 0.05.

As a matter of fact, in zofenopril-treated patients, 70% of the risk reduction was achieved in the first 6&#x02005;weeks, while an additional 30% was reached at the end of the follow-up. These results are in agreement with previous data showing that treatment with ACEIs begun days to weeks after AMI improves clinical outcomes.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>
<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Given the peculiar pharmacological characteristics of zofenopril, we may suggest that most of the benefit is achieved with this drug through a primary vasculoprotective and cardioprotective effect, as shown in preclinical studies in animals<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>
<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> and in clinical studies in humans,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>
<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> as well as through the prompt blockade of the deleterious effects of neurohumoral activation.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></p><p>Our study also compared the effects of zofenopril with those of two other ACEIs (lisinopril and ramipril): treatment with zofenopril reduced the chance of occurrence of the combined end point slightly more than did lisinopril or ramipril, at least in the long term. The only other available large trial assessing the efficacy of different ACEIs after AMI is a non-randomised, observational study by Hansen <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> In this study, no differences were observed in the risk of mortality and reinfarction among trandolapril, ramipril, enalapril, captopril, perindopril and other ACEIs, suggesting a class effect rather than a specific activity of the single ACEI. Our results are in contrast with those of the study by Hansen <italic>et al</italic>, and do not support a class effect but, rather, support differences in the efficacy between different ACEIs. Although our data are quite consistent, being collected through double-blind, randomised, parallel-group, prospective studies with similar designs, we cannot exclude the fact that the superiority of zofenopril might simply be related to a larger number of participants included in this group and to some heterogeneity across the studies. Future direct comparative studies should explore this aspect in detail.</p><p>Safety results confirmed that when treatment with zofenopril is initiated at low dose within the first days or weeks of onset of symptoms and signs of AMI, and up-titrated to optimal dose within a week, its tolerability is good, comparable to that observed with the reference drugs, lisinopril and ramipril, and consistent with previous clinical observations in the same field.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></p><sec id="s4a"><title>Study limitations</title><p>Although the design of the four SMILE studies was very similar, there were some differences in the inclusion criteria, and treatment duration and follow-up, which might have biased the study results, particularly when direct comparisons between different active drug treatments were attempted. For instance, the SMILE-1 study included only those patients who were non-thrombolysed, the SMILE-2 and SMILE-3 included only thrombolysed patients, and the SMILE-4 study included both types of patients. The SMILE-3 study excluded patients with a LVEF &#x0003c;40%, while patients with left ventricular dysfunction were included in the SMILE-4 study. In the SMILE-1 study, active treatments lasted 6&#x02005;weeks, while observation continued for the subsequent 12&#x02005;months. In the other SMILE studies, treatment duration and observation coincided, but the time interval differed. In assessments of the differences between treatments, resulting variations in baseline characteristics might have tended to decrease the sensitivity of such analyses to show interaction. However, such differences are inherent to all pooled analysis and the bias introduced into ascertainment of the average effects among the patients is usually limited in size. This is particularly true in our case, because we adjusted comparisons for confounding variables and we used individual patients&#x02019; data instead of averages.</p><p>Another important study limitation concerns the interpretation of the results of the safety analysis. As a matter of fact, in the SMILE-2 study, the primary end point was a safety factor: the incidence of drug-related severe hypotension. This might explain why the proportion of patients with an adverse event was particularly high in the group of patients receiving lisinopril. Since the rate of adverse events was low in ramipril-treated patients of the SMILE-4 study, when data of these two different ACEIs were pooled together, differences were counterbalanced and thus elided.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The results of the pooled data analysis of the SMILE studies confirm the favourable effects of zofenopril treatment in patients with CHD. The reduction in mortality and morbidity observed in zofenopril-treated patients in comparison to placebo supports the fact that the ACE inhibition and specific pharmacological profile both contribute to the unbeaten efficacy of ACEIs in CHD. These results also strongly support the strategy of starting ACEIs early after AMI, in order to maximise their potential benefits. However, since the clinical benefits persisted during long-term treatment, this also suggests that ACEIs should not be withheld.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank Menarini International Operations, Luxembourg, SA, for the unconditioned support to the SMILE group.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Twitter:</bold> Follow Stefano Omboni at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://twitter.com/iitelemed">@iitelemed</ext-link></p></fn><fn><p><bold>Competing interests:</bold> CB: Boheringer Ingelheim, Menarini International, Sanofi, Amgen, Takeda, Novartis, Ely Lilly and Servier Consultancy.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Ethics approval:</bold> The main body was the Ethics Committee at the Hospital and University of Bologna.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Provenance and peer review:</bold> Not commissioned; externally peer reviewed.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ma</surname><given-names>TK</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Kam</surname><given-names>KK</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Yan</surname><given-names>BP</given-names></name><etal/></person-group>
