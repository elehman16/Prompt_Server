At initial contact, instruction significantly increased knee flexion (p=0.04), and foot (p=0.001) and ankle (p=0.03) plantarflexion. At mid-stance and toe-off, instruction significantly increased knee flexion (p=0.048 and p&#x0003c;0.001, respectively) and foot plantarflexion (p&#x0003c;0.001 and p=0.01, respectively).

Proponents of barefoot running, or running in minimalist footwear,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> claim that these reduce the risk of injury.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6&#x02013;8</xref> There are reports of biomechanical<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 9&#x02013;11</xref> and physiological differences<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> between shod and barefoot running conditions, which have been proposed to explain a theoretical basis for a potential reduction in injury risk. This has contributed to a growth in the popularity of minimalist footwear.</p><p>Some minimalist shoes do not appear to replicate the mechanics of barefoot running,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> but others appear to be effective in imitating barefoot conditions such as increased ankle plantarflexion on landing and reduced vertical loading rate.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> A forefoot striking pattern refers to where the ball of the foot first strikes the ground first.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> This forefoot strike pattern has been suggested to be associated with reduced injury prevalence.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 14 15</xref> A proposed mechanism for reduced injury risk with a forefoot strike (FFS) pattern, although not all authors report that increased vertical loading rates lead to a greater prevalence of running injury<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 16</xref> involves the reduction of vertical loading rate and peak loading.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 11 17</xref> In habitually minimally shod runners it has been shown that there is significant individual variability in vertical loading rate with some individuals shown to have increased vertical loading rate in barefoot conditions.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18 19</xref> This is not surprising given that recent work reports that habitual rearfoot strikers have different kinetic and kinematic responses to habitual mid/forefoot strikers during both shod and barefoot conditions.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> It has been shown that 12 weeks of running training in minimalist footwear can lead to a forefoot strike posture at follow-up when tested in both barefoot and shod conditions.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> However, an uninstructed progressive barefoot running programme of 8 weeks duration lead to individual variability in both ankle angle during landing, and the associated vertical loading rate tested under barefoot conditions; with only 25% of individuals demonstrating reduced vertical loading rate.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Thus, instruction regarding running style may be more important than footwear used when it comes to injury risk,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> although it is evident that footwear can affect running style.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
</p><p>To facilitate a forefoot strike without changing footwear, some trainers and authors have used verbal running instructions, for example &#x02018;run softer&#x02019;<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> or &#x02018;run on your toes&#x02019;.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> This aims to reduce vertical loading rate and peak loading<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> and encourage habitual rearfoot strike runners to replicate the sagittal plane joint kinematics of habitual FFS runners.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> No studies to date have explored the effects of both footwear and instruction in the same population. This is important because it will inform both clinical decision making for running prescription and rehabilitation and also future prospective studies on injury prevalence as a result of running in different types of footwear and with different running styles. Therefore, the main purpose of this study was to compare spatiotemporal parameters and lower limb kinematics during running in either minimalist footwear or standard running shoes (SRS) while considering the effect of running instructions.</p><p>The main hypothesis was that there will be significant differences in spatiotemporal parameters and in knee, ankle and foot kinematics as a result of both running in minimalist footwear and also in SRS plus running instructions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design</title><p>This was a randomised, within subject, repeated measures cross-sectional study.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Participants</title><p>The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the King&#x02019;s College London Research Ethics Committee (REC Protocol No: BDM/11/12&#x02013;66).

Importantly, we note that providing simple instructions to run &#x02018;lightly, softly and quietly&#x02019; when wearing conventional running shoes leads to similar lower limb kinematic changes to wearing minimalist footwear. This is the first study to demonstrate this finding. Both instruction and minimalist footwear can increase the extent of forefoot landing, while the combination of the two had the greatest effect. Wearing minimalist footwear without instruction induced a forefoot strike running pattern prior to landing (IC<sub>&#x02212;10%</sub>). This was not seen at initial contact (IC), which is in contrast to the findings of others<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 11 12 17</xref> presumably because the effect of footwear type was dwarfed by the much larger effect of instruction. The effect of footwear on the extent of plantarflexion prior to landing (IC<sub>-10%</sub>) was small (r=0.15) when compared with the larger effect of instruction on this variable prior to landing (r=0.47) or at initial contact (r=0.35).</p><p>From the clinical perspective some authors have proposed that the more forefoot strike running pattern may be associated with reduced lower limb injury risk.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 9 30</xref> Others have not found this to be the case<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 16</xref> and Tam <italic>et al</italic>
<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> emphasise that the link between minimalist footwear and running injury or performance has yet to be established using long term prospective studies. Some authors have observed a high incidence of foot bone marrow oedema<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> or metatarsal stress fracture in those transitioning rapidly (0&#x02013;2 months) from conventional to minimalist footwear<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> although it has been suggested that a gradual transition may reduce this risk.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Others have reported that forefoot running is beneficial for those with chronic exertional compartment syndrome<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> and may be associated with a lower incidence of overuse injuries.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> It seems that the clinical effect of footwear type and running style varies in different parts of the lower limb,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> which may increase the risk of certain injuries and reduce the risk of others.</p><p>We studied lower limb running kinematics during a 20&#x02009;s period following 2&#x02009;min of running, which was unlikely to produce fatigue. Longer bouts of running with a forefoot strike require strong contractions of the calf muscle complex, which could be associated with an increased incidence in injuries to the Achilles tendon.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Furthermore, such fatigue could lead to heel strike running pattern in minimalist footwear leading to an increased propensity for calcaneal fractures.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>
</p><p>The greater foot plantarflexion during the landing phase in the VI<sup>+</sup> condition (which equates to a mean change of 27&#x02009;mm into the forefoot strike posture when compared with the standard running shoe and no instruction condition (effect size r=0.28) can be explained by altered kinematics at both the knee and the ankle. With minimalist footwear and instruction, there was a mean increase in ankle plantarflexion prior to landing of 8&#x000b0; when compared with ankle angle during running with SRS and without instruction. The effect size for this difference was small (r=0.14). Similarly, there was a small effect (r=0.12) of minimalist footwear, equating to a mean increase of 3&#x000b0; in knee extension prior to landing, when compared with running in SRS alone. As was found in this study, others have shown that knee flexion angle at initial contact does not differ depending on type of footwear.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11 12</xref> Although there was a medium effect size (r=0.37) for the effect of instruction on ankle plantarflexion angle prior to landing it must be noted that the mean difference in ankle angle as a result of instruction was 0.3&#x000b0;. The effect of such small kinematic differences at the knee and the ankle, in terms of performance, injury risk and clinical significance is unknown. The contribution of each joint to the plantarflexion angle varies between footwear and instruction; when in minimalist footwear ankle plantarflexion increases and the knee is more extended. When under instruction both ankle plantarflexion and knee flexion increase.</p><p>We monitored kinematics in the lower limb only although clearly the human body is a series of connected segments, so the effect of footwear and instruction on other segments is not known. This could be particularly important in clinical terms if the relative position of the trunk was influenced in a manner thought likely to increase the risk of back pain. Furthermore, a limitation of the work presented is that we did not investigate kinetics, such as ground reaction forces, during the running conditions studied.</p><p>Our hypothesis that running in minimalist footwear and running in SRS plus instructions, leads to changes in spatiotemporal parameters, was only true for the effect of minimalist footwear. The increased cadence (a mean increase of four steps per minute, with effect size r=0.43) and decreased stride length, which equates to a mean 5&#x02009;cm reduction in stride length (effect size r=0.27) when in minimalist footwear corroborates the work of others.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11 33</xref> This is thought to occur to reduce vertical loading rate of the lower limb<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> such as occurs when running barefoot or in less cushioned shoes.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 35</xref> There have been reports of a reduced stance duration and stride length with increased cadence<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11 17 26 36</xref> in studies using treadmills with larger belt dimensions than used here, which may explain the different findings.</p><p>Our finding that instruction had no main effect is in contrast to that of Diebal <italic>et al</italic>
<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> who observed a significant reduction in stride length and stance time with an increase in cadence following a 6-week period of training combined with a package of instruction three times per week, for approximately 45&#x02009;min, which included the verbal cue to &#x02018;run quietly&#x02019;, a digital metronome to stabilise step cadence at 180 steps per minute and visual instruction <italic>via</italic> a video camera recording to facilitate forefoot strike technique. The varying levels of instruction, and the attempt to control cadence in the study by Diebal <italic>et al</italic>
<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> may account for the difference in findings.</p><p>Instruction to &#x02018;run in a light, soft and quiet way&#x02019; had greater effects on kinematics than wearing minimalist footwear without instruction. The large interindividual variations indicate that a number of subjects responded differently to the same instruction. This may be explained by the fact that less experienced runners have been reported to adopt lower preferred running speeds<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> and that treadmill speeds 10% greater than an individual&#x02019;s preferred speed significantly increases ankle plantarflexion at IC.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> It is possible that our less experienced runners exceeded their preferred running speed, which is supported by three subjects requesting to run at a reduced speed. Trainers and clinicians should carefully evaluate individual responses to instruction to achieve the desired effect on running style.</p><p>We studied only one type of minimalist footwear although there are a variety of different makes and models. The findings of this study demonstrate that instruction alone can influence running style in a way that may reduce the risk of injury and aid injury management and that this can be enhanced by the type of footwear. These findings should be considered in the context of a subject cohort with variable amounts of running experience and in light of this data being unable to reveal whether the kinematic changes observed with instruction would be sustained with longer bouts of running.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s3"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The kinematic adaptations observed following instruction suggests that changes in joint angles previously attributed to minimalist footwear alone may be similarly achieved with running instruction. Further research is warranted to explore the clinical utility of using minimalist footwear and/or instruction in reducing injury prevalence in runners.</p><p>Overall, the results of the current study support previous claims that adaptations in spatiotemporal variables may be attributable to minimalist footwear. However, the results also suggest that changes in joint angles previously attributed to minimalist footwear may be similarly achieved with running instruction alone. To explore the clinical implications arising from the observed effects of instruction and minimalist footwear, longitudinal prospective studies exploring injury rates and performance are warranted.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Acknowledgements:</bold> Primal Lifestyle for donating the Vibram FiveFingers.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> MGB, LB, LJMP, RMO, GO and DJW: planning, conduct, reporting/analysis.
