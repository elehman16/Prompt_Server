In the present study, an effort has been made to assess the effect of <italic>Sattvavajaya Chikitsa</italic> on both <italic>Shareera</italic> and <italic>Manasa Doshas</italic>. Similarly, the impact of <italic>Yukti-Vyapashraya Chikitsa</italic> on both kinds of <italic>Doshas</italic> has been observed. The psychosomatic disease selected for the study was <italic>Manasa-Dosha Ajeerna</italic>. The standard drug taken for <italic>Ajeerna</italic> was <italic>Shunthi</italic>, while for <italic>Sattvavajaya</italic> &#x0201c;Trance/Clinical Hypnosis&#x0201d; was applied on the patients. The study was carried out on 27 patients suffering from <italic>Ajeerna</italic> and having a significant stress score. Patients were divided into two groups with simple random sampling method: Group S was treated with <italic>Shunthi</italic> tablet, while in group PS, placebo (rice powder tablet) along with <italic>Sattvavajaya Chikitsa</italic> was provided to the patients. Duration of the treatment was 10 days. Classical signs and symptoms of <italic>Ajeerna</italic> were studied before and after treatment. Amongst the registered patients, 25 patients completed the course of treatment while 2 dropped out. Group S had shown significant improvement in <italic>Vataja</italic> and <italic>Kaphaja</italic> symptoms, while group PS showed significant effect on <italic>Pittaja</italic> symptoms. In <italic>Tamasika</italic>
<italic>Manobhavas</italic> causing <italic>Ajeerna</italic>, group PS had shown significant improvement, while group S showed significant and highly significant effect on <italic>Rajasika</italic> and <italic>Tamasika Bhavas</italic>, respectively.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>Dosha</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Manasa-Dosha Ajeeerna</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Sattvavajaya</italic></kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1-1"><title>Introduction</title><p>It is a well-accepted truth that body and mind follow each other in various consequences.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] This relationship between the body and the mind is actually a gross reflection of the inter-relationship between <italic>Shareera</italic> and <italic>Manasa Doshas</italic>. A vast difference of dimensions is observed at this particular stage which is actually a difference of extensions to which the matter and the fundamental forces have reached, respectively. Therefore, interrelationship of <italic>Doshas</italic> is generally understood on the basis of <italic>Panchbhautika</italic> constitution of <italic>Tridoshas</italic> and <italic>Trigunatmaka</italic> composition of <italic>Panchamahabhutas</italic>. This calculative way of prediction illustrates the schemata of quantitative relationship of both kinds of Doshas, but such a method of envisaging the <italic>Trigunatmaka</italic> composition of <italic>Shareera Doshas</italic> sometimes creates a controversy or confusion and may lead to fallacies, e.g. as per the quantitative parameters <italic>Kapha Dosha</italic> is &#x0201c;<italic>Tamobahula</italic>,&#x0201d; but Acharya Sushruta has indicated Kapha to be &#x0201c;<italic>Sattvagunopapanna</italic>.&#x0201d;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>]</p><p><inline-graphic xlink:href="Ayu-33-78-g001.jpg"/></p><p>Thus, in the aspect of quantity, <italic>Pitta</italic> dominates in <italic>Sattva</italic>, whereas in the aspect of quality, <italic>Sattva</italic> of <italic>Kapha</italic> overrules. This mystification can be solved only after analyzing the interrelationship of <italic>Doshas</italic> thoroughly. Till date, no debate has been done regarding the qualitative affiliation of both kinds of <italic>Doshas</italic>. Hence, the whole phenomenon of their evolution, functioning, and dissolution requires a deep study to better understand their interrelationship.</p><p><italic>Triskandha</italic> of Ayurveda, i.e. <italic>Hetu, Linga</italic>, and <italic>Aushadha</italic> all are pervaded by one or other shade of interrelationship of <italic>Doshas</italic>.

As <italic>Sattvavajaya</italic> is an <italic>Adravyabhoota Chikitsa</italic>, the mode of its action can be envisaged at the level of <italic>Trigunas</italic>. <italic>Jnana</italic> or knowledge is of two types &#x02013; <italic>Indriya-Sapeksha</italic> and <italic>Indriya-Nirapeksha Jnana</italic>. Till the output continues, one cannot concentrate well on one particular subject.

Due to these hurdles, intensity of mind (activities) may reduce. So, <italic>Raja</italic> and <italic>Tama</italic> subside and <italic>Sattva</italic> gets strength.

Actually, while describing the actions of <italic>Trigunas</italic>, <italic>Krodha</italic> has been included in both groups &#x02013; <italic>Rajasika</italic> and <italic>Tamasika Bhavas</italic>. It is obvious that generation of <italic>Krodha</italic> from each of them would have a separate mode of action. <italic>Raja</italic> as a part of Pitta can be correlated here, but involvement of <italic>Tamas</italic> requires a deep logic to get explained.</p><p>As described in <italic>Shreemad Bhagvat Geeta</italic>, due to <italic>Dhyana</italic> of <italic>Vishayas</italic>, one gets affiliated to them and when his desire is not fulfilled he gets caught by anger.

So, when they do not get the desired thing, they get irate and the sternness of their anger is so much severe that it may lead to <italic>Sammoha</italic>.
