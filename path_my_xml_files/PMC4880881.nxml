We intended to explore whether treatment by intra-articular injections with corticosteroid and distension is more effective than treating with corticosteroids alone or treatment-as-usual in a primary care setting in Norway.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In this prospective randomised intention to treat parallel study, 106 patients were block randomised to three groups; 36 (analysed 35) receiving steroid injection and Lidocaine (IS), 34 receiving steroid and additional saline as distension (ISD) and 36 had treatment-as-usual (TAU). Intervention groups received four injections within 8&#x000a0;weeks, assessed on 1st visit, at the 4th and 8th week. Outcomes were Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI), Numerical pain rating scale (NPRS) and passive range of motion (PROM). Postal assessment was repeated after 1&#x000a0;year for SPADI. Patients in the IS and ISD groups were &#x0201c;blinded&#x0201d; for intervention received and the assessor was &#x0201c;blinded&#x0201d; to group allocation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>At baseline there were no differences between groups in outcome measures. There were no statistical significant differences between the intervention groups in SPADI, NPRS and PROM at baseline, at short-term (4-and 8&#x000a0;weeks) or long-term (12&#x000a0;months). There were statistically significant differences (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01) in change scores at short-term for SPADI when comparing the IS and TAU groups (-20.8; CI-28.9 to -12.7), and the ISD and TAU groups (-21.7; CI-29.4 to -14.0), respectively for NPRS (-2.0; CI-2.8 to -1.1 and -2.2; CI-3.0 to -1.4), and for PROM, but not at long-term for SPADI (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.05).</p><p>Effect size (ES) at 8&#x000a0;weeks was large between both injection groups and TAU (ES 1.2). At 12&#x000a0;months ES was reduced to 0.3 and 0.4 respectively. Transitory side effects as flushing and after-pain were reported by 14&#x000a0;% in intervention groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This intention to treat RCT in primary care indicates that four injections with corticosteroid with or without distension, given with increasing intervals during 8&#x000a0;weeks, were better than treatment-as-usual in treatment of adhesive shoulder capsulitis. However, in the long run no difference was found between any of the groups, indicating that natural healing takes place independent of treatment or not.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/">https://clinicaltrials.gov/</ext-link> identifier: NCT01570985</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Adhesive capsulitis</kwd><kwd>Corticosteroid</kwd><kwd>Distension</kwd><kwd>Frozen shoulder</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>The Norwegian Medical Assocition</institution></funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Dr. Trygve Gythfeldt and wife&#x02019;s research fund</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Adhesive capsulitis of the shoulder, also called frozen shoulder, has a prevalence of 2 to 5&#x000a0;% of the general population, but among diabetic patients the prevalence ranged from 11 to 30&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. There is a strong correlation between adhesive capsulitis and other medical conditions such as diabetes, rheumatic disease, heart disease, hyperthyreosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Adhesive capsulitis occurs mostly in middle age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and women between 50 and 60&#x000a0;years are most commonly affected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Both shoulders can be affected simultaneously and/or the other side can be affected a few years later [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Shoulder stiffness and pain interferes considerably with activities of daily living, and may be associated with increased sick leave in people of working age and incapacity in the elderly.</p><p>Adhesive capsulitis is a long-lasting disorder with spontaneous onset of pain and progressive stiffness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. It generally involves reduced movement of the gleno-humeral joint in several planes, with most restriction of external rotation, some restriction of abduction and least affection of internal rotation carried out passively, also called the capsular pattern [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Adhesive capsulitis is primarily a clinical diagnosis and radiography can be complementary in the diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Pathophysiologically, thickening and contracture of the inferior capsule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], contracture of the rotator interval, coraco-humeral ligament and anterior capsule with a combination of synovial inflammation and capsular fibrosis, has been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Bunker et al. found the histo-pathological picture comparable to Dupuytren&#x02019;s disease of the hand with no inflammation and no synovial involvement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The natural history remains controversial. Earlier studies considered the condition as self-limiting, lasting for 2 to 3&#x000a0;years, reporting that the majority of patients would get almost complete recovery or full recovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Other authors report long-term pain and stiffness for several years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. For convenience, the condition is divided into three phases; the painful phase lasting from 3 to 9&#x000a0;months, followed by a freezing phase with progressive stiffness lasting from 4 to 12&#x000a0;months and finally, the recovery phase with gradual return of movement, lasting 5&#x02013;26 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Some have divided the condition into four stages, based on the correlation of findings on physical examination and arthroscopic examination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>Commonly used conservative therapies for adhesive capsulitis include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, intra-articular glucocorticosteroid injections, oral gluco-corticosteroid medication, physical therapy, manipulation under anaesthesia and hydrodilatation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. However, despite the amount of research in the topic, results still appear to be inconclusive regarding effectiveness of the different treatment modalities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In hydrodilatation or arthrographic distension procedures, an intra-articular injection is performed under fluoroscopy with local anaesthetics, normal saline and often with contrast medium. Most of the interventional studies with corticosteroid injections, with or without hydrodilatation (distension), have been done with single corticosteroid injection under fluoroscopy or ultrasound guided, either sub-acromial or intra-articular or both. Van der Windt et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] used up to a maximum of three intra-articular injections over 6&#x000a0;weeks. According to Cyriax&#x02019;s treatment method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], adhesive capsulitis is often treated with between three to six corticosteroid intra-articular injections with increasing interval between injections, which is also supported by others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. A short term efficacy of arthrographic distension with normal saline and corticosteroid versus placebo was demonstrated in a randomised controlled trial (RCT) in patients with painful stiff shoulder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. A systematic Cochrane review regarding efficacy of hydrodilatation concludes: &#x0201c;there is &#x0201c;silver&#x0201d; level evidence that arthrographic distension with saline and steroid provides short-term benefits in pain, range of movement and function in adhesive capsulitis. It is uncertain whether this is better than alternative interventions&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Hydrodilatation studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] did not demonstrate any statistically significant differences in functional outcome compared to steroid injection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p>The present study has followed the existing practice of treating patients with adhesive capsulitis in primary care in Norway. In a pilot trial, there was no clinically significant difference in overall results between corticosteroid alone and corticosteroid with distension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The aim of this study was to elucidate the effect, if any, of multiple corticosteroid injections with distension as compared to multiple corticosteroid injections alone, to treatment-as-usual.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p>This RCT comprises two parallel intervention groups and a control group allocating equal number of patients. The intervention period lasted 8&#x000a0;weeks, with a postal follow-up after 1&#x000a0;year. The patients were recruited from the city of Bergen and neighboring municipalities by referral from primary care (PC) practitioners from January 2010 to October 2013.</p><p>Included patients had to be above 18&#x000a0;years of age, should be able to understand and speak Norwegian, and have no contraindication for use of corticosteroids. Patients should have reduced passive range of motion (PROM) with a reduction of more than 30&#x000a0;% of two of three shoulder movements and none of the three movements (Abduction&#x02009;=&#x02009;ABD, External rotation&#x02009;=&#x02009;ER and Internal rotation&#x02009;=&#x02009;IR) should be normal. Patients with diabetes, asthma, pregnant women and breast feeding mothers were excluded from the study. Female patients in fertile age were asked about prevention.</p><p>Eligible patients were invited to participate in the study were randomly assigned to one of three groups according to serial no. on the closed envelope by one of authors (SPS). The block randomisation, using a block size of three, was carried out by one of the supervisors (AB). Possible permutations were strung together using a random cipher table. The resulting information on treatment was printed out and put in a closed envelope with the patient serial number outside. The envelope was to be opened after the inclusion of the patient. Treatment allocation was thereby &#x0201c;blinded&#x0201d; for both researcher and patient at the point of inclusion. The patients in the active intervention groups were not informed which treatment option (with or without distension) was carried out.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Intervention</title><p>Intra-articular injections were administered by landmarks using posterior approach thus preventing the patients from seeing the size of syringe used. This was to avoid possible bias as the patients might consider treatment with distension and corticosteroid to be superior to corticosteroid alone. The injections were administered by one of the authors (SPS) who is both a general practitioner and a physiotherapist at a primary care center in municipality of Bergen and has several years of experience in treating adhesive capsulitis by intra-articular injections both by landmarks and ultrasound guided.</p><p>Patients in the steroid alone group (IS) received Triamcinolone 20&#x000a0;mg injection, with Lidocaine 10&#x000a0;mg/ml 3&#x000a0;ml and a total of 4&#x000a0;ml solution. Those in the distension group (ISD) also received steroid and Lidocaine (Triamcinolone 20&#x000a0;mg, 3&#x000a0;ml Lidocaine), but with additional physiological Sodium chloride 9&#x000a0;mg/ml, comprising a total volume from 8&#x000a0;ml and upwards to 20&#x000a0;ml. Limiting factors for injected volume were difficulty in further injection and/or increasing pain during injection. Injection to IS and ISD groups were given after inclusion on day 1, after 7, 17, and 31&#x000a0;days from the start. Adherence to planned intervention was assessed continuously by one of the authors (SPS). Patients receiving treatment-as-usual (TAU) were informed about the possibilities of optional conservative treatment, such as physiotherapy or pain medication other than corticosteroid injections or per oral corticosteroid medication until 61&#x000a0;days after inclusion.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Outcome measures</title><p>The primary outcome was the Shoulder pain and disability index (SPADI), which measures a combination of pain and functional disability on a score from 0 to 100, a high score indicating more pain and disability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The second outcome measure was pain intensity on average for the previous 7&#x000a0;days, measured on a 10-point Numerical pain rating scale (NPRS), where 0 meant no pain and 10 meant unbearable pain. PROM was measured in sideways elevation (abduction), internal rotation (by &#x0201c;Hand behind back&#x0201d; method) and external rotation. A plurimeter, found to be a reliable gravity inclinometer, was used as the measuring instrument for PROM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. PROM was measured, also on the normal side, on all visits. PROM was measured in supine lying position for external and internal rotation, and for abduction in standing. The endpoint was when the arm could not be moved more or the pain became unbearable. To avoid discrepancies in measurements due to affection of movements of thumb joints, the distance in Hand-behind-back was measured in centimeters between the styloid process of the radius to the posterior inferior iliac spine. PROM was measured by a research collaborator (a GP) being unaware which group the patients were randomised to. The assessor who took PROM had experience in use of the plurimeter, and had shown acceptable inter-tester reliability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. The assessor made entries of the PROM on a separate paper so that confidentiality was maintained from the treating doctor throughout the study.</p><p>The time intervals between the consecutive treatments were 1, 1&#x000bd; and 2&#x000a0;weeks. The control group remained without treatment with corticosteroids in injection or tablet form until 61&#x000a0;days, but could use NSAIDs, Paracetamol or Codeine as needed. SPADI and NPRS were registered on the first visit, after 4 and 8&#x000a0;weeks. The 1&#x000a0;year follow-up for SPADI was only by postal communication.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Sample size</title><p>For SPADI, being the primary outcome measure, we considered an outcome of 20&#x000a0;% better or worse to be clinically significant. This represents a difference in score of 14 at the level of SPADI&#x02009;=&#x02009;70. Others have considered a difference in score of&#x02009;&#x02265;10 to represent clinically important change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. In a previous study where SPADI was a primary outcome measure, the variance in SPADI was 19.8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Given &#x003b1;&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.05, we calculated the sample size to be 31 in each group to have an 80&#x000a0;% power to detect a difference in mean SPADI score of&#x02009;&#x02265;14. With a 10&#x000a0;% drop out the number of patients required for the study to have the above mentioned power were calculated to be 34 in each group.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Differences in outcome between the groups were analyzed using repeated measure ANCOVA and regression based ANCOVA. In our analysis we have distinguished between short-term follow-up (4 and 8&#x000a0;weeks) and long-term follow-up (12&#x000a0;months). Since the 4 and 8&#x000a0;weeks data were not independent, we chose to analyze these data as multiple follow-up observations. This was done in a repeated measures ANCOVA model with 4 and 8&#x000a0;weeks observations as repeated measures to capture the main effect of treatment between groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] (p.197), and with pretest as a covariate to adjust for baseline differences between subjects. Similarly, we analyzed the long-term follow-up data in another ANCOVA model using a regression procedure with the 12&#x000a0;months observations as dependent variable, group as a categorical independent variable and pretest as a covariate. In an additional/secondary analysis we added other independent variables (specified) to both ANCOVA models to control for possible confounding.</p><p>Effect size (ES) for mean change in SPADI was also calculated by subtracting post-test score (8&#x000a0;weeks and 12&#x000a0;months) from baseline in two groups, dividing it by the standard deviation (SD) of the change score:<disp-formula id="Equa"><alternatives><tex-math id="M1">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

Added capsular distension did not significantly affect the outcome measures for SPADI, NPRS and PROM. However, at long-term follow-up, those who had received no intervention did equally well.</p><p>Earlier studies combining distension (10&#x000a0;ml) and corticosteroid versus distension alone and corticosteroid alone, have reported better results for distension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. While in studies by Corbeil et al. &#x00026; Tveit&#x000e5; et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] no significant differences between distension and non&#x02013;distension arthrography with corticosteroids were found, the main effect might therefore be attributed to corticosteroid alone. Comparing our results between ISD group and TAU group with Tveit&#x000e5; et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], our study has demonstrated larger improvement; for SPADI 24 versus 6, for ABD 15.4 versus 2, for ER 18.7 versus 2 and for IR 12.3 versus 3 respectively. A systematic review concluded with &#x0201c;silver level&#x0201d; evidence for short&#x02013;term efficacy in pain, ROM, and function of shoulder by arthrographic saline distension and corticosteroid in patients with adhesive capsulitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Studies with distension and corticosteroid causing capsular rupture performed in hospital settings have also shown significant results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. These and other case series studies in primary care with distension and capsular rupture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] are, however, not comparable to the present study, as capsular rupture was not the intended intervention. We cannot however rule out that capsular rupture might have occurred in some patients. Tveit&#x000e5; et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] have observed capsular rupture at a volume as low as 10&#x000a0;ml.</p><p>A dose of 20&#x000a0;mg Triamcinolone was a tradeoff dose between effect and side effects in both intervention groups and is the generally accepted and practiced treatment dose for adhesive capsulitis in primary care. A study by de Jong [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] has shown better effect with a dose of 40&#x000a0;mg Triamcinolone than with 10&#x000a0;mg, whereas another study by Yoon et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] found no significant difference in outcome between a dose of 20 and 40&#x000a0;mg Triamcinolone. In this study we used a series of injections, a total of four over a period of 8&#x000a0;weeks. Many studies with distension have only used a single corticosteroid injection, which makes comparison difficult. Only a few studies have used multiple injections and even fewer have used multiple injections with dilatation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. A review has concluded that multiple injections improve pain and ROM in short term from 6 to 16&#x000a0;weeks from the first injection. There is evidence that up to three injections can be beneficial and limited evidence that up to six injections is beneficial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>This study has followed the actual practice of treating these patients in primary care with intra-articular injections by landmarks, without fluoroscopic guidance. Some studies with ultrasound guided intra-articular steroid injections claim a short time superiority in pain reduction of about 2&#x000a0;weeks, compared to injections by landmarks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>], which we consider is little as compared to the extra resources required in terms of time and costs.</p><p>On 1&#x000a0;year follow-up all three groups had similar outcome, which reflects the natural history of the condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. But the major difference in pain relief (NPRS) and pain and function (SPADI) were recorded in the first 8&#x000a0;weeks in the intervention groups as compared to the control group. From the patient&#x02019;s perspective, pain relief leading to undisturbed sleep is of great importance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>], which is not so often accredited in studies measuring outcome over time.</p><p>One of the strengths of this study is that it is conducted in line with the actual practice in treatment of adhesive shoulder capsulitis in primary care in Norway, i.e. intra-articular steroid injection in gleno-humeral joint by landmarks. There are very few studies that are close to actual practice in treatment of shoulder adhesive capsulitis in primary care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. The procedure is safe and simple and easy to learn and cost effective. Only 15&#x000a0;% of patients reported transient side effects and the procedure was not experienced as particularly painful. The limitations of the study are lack of visual verification of delivery of medication in the joint. The injected volume varied from 8 to 20&#x000a0;ml and we cannot assert with certainty that the observed effect was due to distension and not to capsular rupture. Longer time taken in injecting the fluid in the joint might have introduced bias as patients might assume that he or she was in the distension group, which might have been considered the superior method by the patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This intention to treat RCT in primary care indicates that four injections with corticosteroid with or without distension, given with increasing intervals during 8&#x000a0;weeks, were better than treatment-as-usual in adhesive capsulitis of the shoulder. However, in the long run no difference was found between any of the groups, indicating that natural healing takes place independent of treatment.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Sincere thanks to Nils Ivar Aanes M.D. for being the &#x0201c;blinded&#x0201d; tester, Shruti Sharma M.D. for data entry and calculations of SPADI and for helping in postal follow-up.
