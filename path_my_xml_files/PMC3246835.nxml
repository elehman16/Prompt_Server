Introduction</title><p>The presented randomised controlled trial (RCT) with university students compared the effects of Brain Wave Vibration (BWV), Iyengar Yoga, and Mindfulness training on the mood, well-being, and immune function of healthy participants. BWV is an eclectic form of yoga and meditation, involving rhythmic movements of the head, neck, and body. It aims inter alia to tone up the brain's arousal systems including the brain-stem reticular activating system which is a core sleep-energy centre and part of the subcortical-cortical arousal axis controlling energy distribution in the brain and body which was discovered in the 1950s and led to some of the perennial arousal theories in Psychophysiology [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. It is a moving meditation designed to relax mind and body and release negative as well as positive emotions and to induce an increased awareness of the movement of energy [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. BWV may be performed sitting or standing; the practitioner first gently shakes their head back and forth from the left to right, then follows their own natural rhythm, and focuses on physical sensations and vibrations from the neck and head, which may spread to all parts of the body. BWV is believed to be most beneficial when practiced as part of a holistic fitness class in combination with other related yoga-style exercises, known as &#x0201c;Body and Brain Holistic Fitness Training&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;Dahn yoga&#x0201d;. These mind-body training exercises form part of the Health Smile Peace (HSP) movement, which was developed in South Korea by Il chi Lee in the 1980s, and are designed to optimize body and brain health and rebalance the energy systems of the body [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The evidence for the efficacy of BWV training is currently mostly anecdotal, although Jung et al. [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] conducted a trial where participants who had regularly trained in BWV were compared with healthy control participants. They reported an increase in positive affect and plasma DA levels together with a reduction in stress following BWV training, which warrants further research.</p><p>In the present study participants underwent a course of BWV training classes, which consisted of a series of Body and Brain Holistic Fitness exercises including BWV. As a comparator for some of the physical components of BWV training, a group of participants also took part in Iyengar Yoga classes. Iyengar yoga practice emphasises standing poses with the aim of building strength, concentration and meditation, and relieving stress. The physical poses aim to increase vitality and improve coordination and balance [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>A further group of participants underwent a course of Mindfulness classes, intended as a comparator for the &#x0201c;mental&#x0201d; components of BWV. Mindfulness practice is more cognitive, aiming for a present-centered awareness which is nonlaborative and nonjudgmental. Its central component involves self-regulation of attention to control concentration. It also focuses on stress reduction and positive state elevation [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>The efficacy of the interventions was evaluated pre- and postintervention by scales that were selected to measure behavioral, emotional, and cognitive arousal, negative affect, and mental concentration. In the case of the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS) [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], this was found apposite in disclosing changes in mood following Reiki in similar university samples to the one recruited here [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. It was anticipated that improvements in stress reduction would be found in all three groups following the intervention. It was also hypothesized that the BWV group would experience a substantive increase in their vitality levels, as is commonly reported following BWV training [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and following the theoretical involvement of the brain-stem arousal system described further in the Discussion.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>2. Materials and Methods</title><sec sec-type="subsection" id="sec2.1"><title>2.1. Participants</title><p>Following approval by the college Ethics Committee, 45 healthy participants were recruited to take part in the study over a period of four months, through college notice board advertisements. However, only 33 (18&#x02013;50 years; 21 females, 12 males) completed the study due to 12 dropouts (3 BWV; 6 Iyengar; 2 Mindfulness). Participants were awarded <italic>&#x000a3;</italic>20 on completion of the study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subsection" id="sec2.2"><title>2.2. Design</title><p>To assess mood, participants completed the DASS21 [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] at recruitment before they were randomized to the three groups. Then, to prevent the mood scores of the three primary groups, BWV, Iyengar, and Mindfulness, differing at baseline (e.g., [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]), each of the three groups was subdivided into participants with high total DASS scores with scores above 40/126 (High-Mood) and low total DASS scores with scores below 41/126 (Low-Mood). The High- and Low-Mood subgroups were not considered separately in the statistical analyses presented in the Results due to the small number of participants in a subgroup.</p><p>As each pair of High-Mood or Low-Mood participants was recruited, they were randomly allocated to the three groups using a computerised random number generator that created a number between 1 and 3, with an equal probability of generating any number. If &#x0201c;1&#x0201d; was generated, the participant was allocated to the BWV group, if &#x0201c;2&#x0201d; was generated, the participant was assigned to the Iyengar group, and if &#x0201c;3&#x0201d; was generated, the participant became a Mindfulness participant. This method ensured that there were equal numbers of High-Mood and Low-Mood participants in each of the three groups, so that the mood scores of the groups would not significantly differ at baseline. When participants dropped out, new recruits continued to be randomly assigned to the three groups by the method described, until the target sample of 12 participants in each group was reached. However, three of the 12 Iyengar participants droppedout at a stage when it was too late to replace them. The experimenter who conducted the randomisation had not met the participants and was naive to the scores of their preassessment measures.</p><p>Turning to statistical power, it was calculated using G-Power that the number of participants in each of the groups was insufficient for a significant difference to be observed between three independent samples of equal size. Predicting that there would be an effect size of 1, with an error probability of 0.05 and an allocation ratio of 1, the necessary sample size was calculated to be 15 in each group. Therefore the 12 participants in the BWV and Mindfulness groups and the 9 participants in the Iyengar group were underpowered for an effect of even the high predicted magnitude to be detected. While it would have been preferable to employ a larger sample size to increase statistical power, this was regretfully not possible.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subsection" id="sec2.3"><title>2.3.

Mindfulness has many purported benefits, both in enhancing one's life and in dealing with difficult experiences and conditions such as stress, anxiety, and depression [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The classes involved various mindfulness exercises, such as sitting and body-scan meditations and group and pair work where participants shared their experiences and enquired into those of others. The classes also involved poetry and exercises to clarify intentions and promote self-understanding. As with the Iyengar yoga classes, the mindfulness class exercises varied from class to class, and thus no timeline is included. Participants were given a 10-minute sitting meditation to practice at home six days a week, and they were also asked to keep a diary to record events.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="subsection" id="sec2.4"><title>2.4.

Discussion</title><p>There were significant improvements for the sample as a whole for many of the outcome measures. However, separate group analyses disclosed that only for the Stress and Mindfulness scales were effects significant for all three interventions, with the majority of improvements found for one or two groups only. There was only one significant interaction between Group and Session which was found for Absorption and this strongly characterized training in Mindfulness. Considering reliable improvements as defined by Group effects with <italic>P</italic> &#x02264; 0.01, BWV training advantaged the Total DASS mood score (<italic>P</italic> = 0.009), the Subjective Vitality Scale (<italic>P</italic> = 0.014), and the item &#x0201c;I have felt tense&#x0201d; (<italic>P</italic> = 0.006); Mindfulness training, aside from absorption (<italic>P</italic> = 0.006), advantaged Stress (<italic>P</italic> = 0.003); Iyengar yoga did not result in any improvements reaching the <italic>P</italic> &#x02264; 0.01 level. Considering further group effects, the most improvements were seen following training in Brain Wave Vibration. BWV training was alone in producing significantly better Depression and Sleep Latency. The increase in vitality as evinced by the total SVS score was endorsed by the Visual Analogue Scale item &#x0201c;I have had high vitality levels&#x0201d; which approached significance. Turning to Iyengar training, improvements were found for Total DASS and SVS vitality&#x02014;improvements found with the BWV intervention, but not with Mindfulness training. The Mindfulness group on the other hand produced improvements in several items that were not seen following other interventions. As noted above, Mindfulness significantly increased absorption, which is in keeping with the findings of Lau et al. [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], who found the Tellegen Absorption Scale to be positively correlated with subscales of the Toronto Mindfulness Scale. Mindfulness training was also the only one to result in significant improvements in the VAS items &#x0201c;I have felt calm&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;I have felt grounded&#x0201d;. In addition, Mindfulness training shared with BWV training reductions in the VAS vitality item and in daytime sleepiness.</p><p>The sample as a whole also had a tendency towards an increase in the stress hormone salivary cortisol, despite improvements in both stress and sleep subscales. This relation has been observed following other mind-body interventions, where in one study an increase in plasma cortisol accompanied in the face of exam stress resilience in lymphocyte suppression [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], in another resilience in succumbing to an influenza epidemic [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], and has been correlated with reductions in tiredness [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. While cortisol may be linked with chronic stress, in the short term it is also associated with preparedness, as with its rise on waking [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>It is possible that the positive effects disclosed by the trial may have been stronger if the sample size had been larger, for the 12 participants per group were underpowered for a between-group effect of even a very large magnitude to be detected. The benefits of the trial may also have been limited by the general good health of the university students&#x02014;it is possible that if the trial were conducted with a patient sample, then greater group differences may be observed. A further shortcoming of the trial was that no follow-up data were collected; so it is not known for how long the observed benefits were maintained. Additionally, the participants only trained for the relatively short period of five weeks. It would also be of interest to investigate whether participants who attended a greater number of classes would demonstrate greater improvements, since, for example, benefits following BWV are reported to manifest more strongly after a longer training period [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and 5 weeks would generally be regarded as a short period to achieve sustained benefits from Ivengar yoga.</p><p>Given that the research design, university participant sample, and time in the academic year in the present study were similar to controlled studies of Reiki [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] some comparisons may be made between the trial outcomes. In the first Reiki study [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] there was also a reduction in Stress on the DASS and this was found to be accompanied by an improvement on the Illness Symptom Questionnaire. In the second study [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], where participants were selected on similar mood criteria as in the present study and divided into high- and low-mood groups, while there was no improvement in illness symptoms, there was a reduction in both DASS Anxiety and Stress. These reductions were found to be specific to the high- (negative) mood subgroup following Reiki, and importantly they were sustained at follow-up.</p><p>Turning to a number of theoretical issues, considerations have been given to the construction of scalar measures to capture the impact of mindfulness training [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Here it is of interest that while all three interventions disclosed improvements on the Mindfulness Attention Awareness Scale [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], it was the Tellegen Absorption Scale [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] that differentiated the meditational effects of Mindfulness training compared with Iyengar yoga and BWV. Indeed Absorption was the only reliable differential characterization of a single intervention in the present trial. Absorption is in keeping with the particular cognitive aspect of mindfulness training when compared with the physical exercise components of both Iyengar yoga and BWV training.</p><p>BWV in terms of measured outcome was successful in benefitting both ends of the mood/arousal continuum. This was in keeping with the putative involvement of the brain-stem arousal sleep/wake regulatory systems [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The brainstem reticular (netlike) formation first arose in the 19th century and from the middle of the 20th century gained prominence following electrophysiological studies of Moruzzi and Magoun [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] as a neuronal system responsible inter alia for the regulation of arousal [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In evolutionary terms it is the oldest part of the brain situated at the junction between the spinal cord, cerebellum, and higher limbic and cortical structures and thereby strategically situated through its white and gray matter for roles in the mediation, modulation, and connectivity of vital functions necessary for life including cardiovascular control, and with devastating consequences in the case of even small lesions such as irreversible coma. The historical homogeneity of the reticular formation has given way to functional, anatomical, and biochemical heterogeneity [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. It receives impulses from the musculoskeletal frame, internal milieu, viscera, and vestibular organs which map the state of the organism and through ascending and descending systems allows regulation of homeostasis in collaboration with thalamocortical and hypothalamic systems. Impulses from all sensory systems underpin its essential role in the control of sleep/wakefulness transitions. Through sensory gating to the cortex fundamental processes for attention such as habituation are controlled. Coincidental with increased alertness and attention there is increased blood flow in the midbrain reticular formation and intra thalamic nuclei [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. With regard to somatic motor control axons from reticulospinal tracts send signals in order to maintain balance, tone, and posture. It is hypothesised that the rhythmic actions of the BWV protocol as well as the focusing of attention on the actions facilitate such regulatory processes.</p><p>While BWV was effective in reducing overarousal as indexed by measures of stress and tension, as was the case with the other two interventions, BWV was alone in having an impact on the low end of the arousal dimension manifested in the reduction in depression. This was also the implication from a cross-sectional investigation of practitioners and controls [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] where positive affect was higher in practitioners and there was a nonsiginificant trend for negative affect to be reduced. BWV was also distinguished by its benefits for shortening the time taken to fall asleep seen in the Sleep Latency score. BWV training also reduced daytime sleepiness, as did Mindfulness training. An improvement in sleep has been a common anecdotal report by BWV practitioners, as has an increase in energy and vitality. Here the latter outcome as measured by the Vitality scale was shared with Iyengar yoga. This is the first controlled trial of this form of mind-body training and the results are sufficiently provocative to warrant further investigation of a unique integration and evolution of meditational and yogic practice.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>5. Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, substantive benefits to measures of mood and well-being were seen in all three of the groups in this trial, while in no measure was a significant negative change seen in any group, suggesting that all three practices are beneficial. Regarding the BWV group, the substantive improvements in mood, sleep subscales, vitality, and mindfulness, while not significantly greater than the improvements in the other groups, are in accordance with the reported benefits of BWV [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and with hypothesis. Further randomised controlled trials of the effects of BWV training are warranted to explore the effects found and to isolate which exercises give rise to them, preferably employing larger sample sizes in order to increase statistical power.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>The support of the Korean Institute of Brain Science is gratefully acknowledged to include a postdoctoral fellowship for the first author.</p></ack><app-group><app><title> Appendices</title><p>See Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab7">7</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab8">8</xref>.</p></app></app-group><ref-list><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Moruzzi</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Magoun</surname><given-names>HW</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Brain stem reticular formation and activation of the EEG</article-title><source><italic>Electroencephalography and Clinical Neurophysiology</italic></source><year>1949</year><volume>1</volume><issue>1&#x02013;4</issue><fpage>455</fpage><lpage>473</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">18421835</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Duffy</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name></person-group><source><italic>Activation and Behavior</italic></source><year>1962</year><publisher-loc>New York, NY, USA</publisher-loc><publisher-name>John Wiley &#x00026;
