 nervosa were randomised to one of two treatment conditions: manual-based CBT
 delivered in an individual therapy format involving 20 sessions over 18 weeks
 and participants who were predicted to be non-responders after 6 sessions of
 CBT had fluoxetine added to treatment; or a stepped-care approach that began

 1979<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref> a substantial
 treatment literature has been published on this condition. Both
 antidepressants and certain structured manual-based psychotherapies have been
 shown to be effective. In the antidepressant literature much of the research
 has focused on the use of fluoxetine, which appears most effective at 60
 mg/day and in the USA remains the only Food and Drug Administration approved
 drug for this
 condition.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref> Much of
 the psychotherapy literature has focused on the use of
 cognitive&#x02013;behavioural therapy (CBT), which is widely viewed as the
 treatment of choice for bulimia
 nervosa.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref> The
 question as to whether or not a combination of antidepressants and CBT should
 be used remains
 open.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>
 In further research, a number of guided self-help studies based on CBT have
 been published for people with bulimia nervosa in several small-scale trials.
 This literature has been recently reviewed suggesting that such abbreviated
 treatments are promising by themselves and may form a useful first step in a
 stepped-care
 approach.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></p><p>Brief therapies provided by less skilled therapists may be useful in that a
 point of concern that has surfaced in the bulimia nervosa treatment literature
 is that the majority of patients who are seen by practitioners in the
 community do not receive manual-based
 interventions.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>
 Also, most therapists do not use CBT as their primary treatment
 technique.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>
 Therefore, efficacious manual-based approaches for bulimia nervosa are not
 being widely utilised or disseminated. In the current study
 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="Clinicaltrials.gov">Clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>
 registration number: NCT00733525) we attempted to synthesise these various
 observations to undertake a randomised trial comparing CBT, augmented by the
 use of fluoxetine if indicated, with a stepped-care approach using an adaptive
 treatment
 strategy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref> An
 adaptive treatment strategy is a rule for adapting a treatment plan based on
 the changing clinical condition of a patient due to response to a previous
 treatment or treatments. Hence, the stepped-care sequence began with treatment
 using manualised guided self-help CBT, with the addition of fluoxetine if the
 response based on an algorithm was not sufficient, and then with a full course
 of CBT for those who failed to achieve abstinence from binge eating and
 purging. The algorithm was based on data from an earlier study in which we
 developed a formula to attempt to predict a high likelihood of non-response to
 CBT.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref> This is
 discussed in the Method in detail. This treatment sequence was designed to
 provide treatment wherein the first two steps would not require specialist
 care, with only those who were still symptomatic after these steps receiving
 specialist care (CBT). The use of shorter initial treatment was based on the
 findings of a previous multisite trial in which a full course of CBT was
 followed by interpersonal
 therapy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref> The
 combination and sequencing of two lengthy therapies led to a high drop-out
 rate with little evidence of additional benefit. Our primary hypothesis was
 that the stepped-care sequence would be more effective than the CBT/fluoxetine
 one as it allowed for more individualised treatment. This additional treatment
 could be added based on the needs of the individual participants. Therefore,
 participants who could benefit from more modest, less intensive intervention
 could be treated without exposure to a full course of CBT. We also
 hypothesised that it would be more cost-effective (the cost-efficacy analysis
 will be published as a separate paper).</p><p>A previous randomised trial of the treatment of bulimia nervosa with
 CBT<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref> found that a
 high-risk stratum with low scores on the Social Adjustment
 Scale<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref> and high
 scores on the Shape Concerns Scale from the Eating Disorder
 Examination<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>
 moderated outcome such that those in the high-risk stratum did better if they
 received CBT. Hence in the present study we hypothesised that participants
 with poorer social adjustment and higher shape concerns (high-risk stratum)
 would show greater improvement in the CBT/fluoxetine sequence.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Method</title><sec><title>Participants</title><p>The participants for this study met criteria for either purging or
 non-purging bulimia nervosa as defined by
 DSM&#x02013;IV.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>
 Both males and females were included. Participants were 18 or older. Potential
 participants were excluded for the following reasons: current active
 psychotherapy for their eating disorder; alcohol or drug misuse or dependence
 in the previous 6 months; acute suicidal risk; a medical illness that would
 preclude safe study participation; and a history of psychotic disorder.
 Participants were recruited by referral from clinicians at the clinical sites
 involved and through mailings to clinicians in the areas in which the study
 was conducted, as well as by advertisements in the media. A total of 1128
 potential participants were screened by telephone
 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>). Of these, 416 were
 assessed at the four clinical sites, and 293 were randomised into the study,
 147 to the CBT group and 146 to the stepped-care group. The overall design is
 shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>. Written
 informed consent was obtained from all participants after the procedures had
 been fully explained.</p></sec><sec><title>Cognitive&#x02013;behavioural therapy</title><p>The manualised CBT used in this trial in both treatment arms was also used
 in two recent large multicentre trials of bulimia
 nervosa.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>
 This treatment was first described in 1981 and subsequently studied in
 numerous randomised
 protocols.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>
 In the present study participants received 20 sessions of 50 min with 4
 sessions in the first 2 weeks of treatment for a total treatment duration of
 18 weeks.</p></sec><sec><title>Assisted self-help therapy</title><p>The self-help book <italic>Overcoming Binge Eating</italic> was developed by
 Fairburn<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref> to
 parallel the CBT manual. Participants were seen for approximately 20 min on
 eight occasions with weekly sessions for 4 weeks, diminishing to bi-weekly and
 then to monthly, for a treatment duration of 18 weeks. The focus of treatment
 was on the participant using the book as the main source of information
 regarding behaviour change. Participants were told that if they were unable to
 gain sufficient control over their bulimic behaviour with the use of the
 self-help manual they would be offered medication and, if abstinence was still
 not achieved, full CBT would also be offered.</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Screening, interviews, enrolment and withdrawals.</p><p>BMI, body mass index; CBT, cognitive&#x02013;behavioural therapy.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="392f1c"/></fig></p><p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Study design.</p><p>CBT, cognitive&#x02013;behavioural therapy.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="393f2c"/></fig></p></sec><sec><title>Medication management</title><p>Fluoxetine was offered to supervised self-help participants and to those
 CBT participants who were predicted to be non-responders using the algorithm
 described below. The drug was initiated at a dose of 20 mg. The patients were
 seen for medication management for 20 min visits at 2-week intervals for five
 visits and then monthly. During the medication management visits, which were
 also manual driven, the time was devoted to a discussion of medication
 side-effects, toxicity and response. After 2 weeks on medication if the
 participant remained symptomatic, the dosage was increased to 40 mg, and after
 2 additional weeks, if the participant continued to have bulimic symptoms, the
 dosage was increased to 60 mg.</p></sec><sec><title>Rationale for early triage of non-responders to medication</title><p>In a prior study conducted by this group, we determined whether it was
 possible to detect clinically useful outcome predictors using signal detection
 analysis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref> The
 best predictor of successful outcome was a 70% or more reduction in frequency
 of purging by the end of session six. We believed that this was a clinically
 useful finding and incorporated it into the present protocol. Those in the
 stepped-care group and those in the CBT/fluoxetine group were offered
 fluoxetine after session six (week 10 of treatment for the stepped-care group
 and week 4 for the other group). It should be noted that participants could
 refuse the medication offer and still continue in the study given the
 effectiveness design.</p></sec><sec><title>Stepped-care sequence</title><p>Stepped-care began with therapist-assisted self-help followed by fluoxetine
 if the participant was predicted to be a non-responder. At the end of
 self-help treatment (18 weeks) participants who had not achieved abstinence
 were offered full CBT for a further 6 months. Medication, if utilised, was
 continued until the 1-year follow-up assessment.</p></sec><sec><title>Therapy training and supervision</title><p>Therapists for self-help were Masters-level or PhD-level clinical
 psychologists or clinical psychiatric nurse specialists who did not specialise
 in eating disorders and had not been formally trained in CBT beyond a 1-day
 training session. Therapists for CBT were PhD-level clinical psychologists
 with experience in treating people with bulimia nervosa with CBT. The number
 of therapists varied from two to four across the sites.</p><p>The overall treatment supervisor was S.A. He, along with C.G.F., oversaw
 training in both the CBT and the self-help condition. Training in medication
 management was overseen by J.E.M. Each therapist treated two individuals with
 bulimia nervosa with weekly supervision before being certified. All sessions
 were audiotaped. After the initiation of the study the CBT and self-help
 therapists met separately with their site supervisors each week. Audiotapes
 were used in supervision.</p><p>Assessors who had been trained in the administration of the Structured
 Clinical Interview for DSM&#x02013;IV I and II (SCID&#x02013;I,
 SCID&#x02013;II)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>
 and the Eating Disorder Examination
 (EDE)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref> were
 available at all treatment sites. Assessors met at the start up meeting and
 reviewed the EDE protocol in detail. They each rated two EDE tapes, discussing
 differences in interpretation. At 3-month intervals the data centre sent a
 tape selected from one of the sites to the other sites for each assessor to
 rate. These ratings were examined for differences and feedback returned to
 each rater. The overall interrater agreement ranged from 0.91 to 0.99.
 Assessors were masked to treatment assignment. However, the mask was not
 systematically examined, and unmasking may have occurred unintentionally
 during the interviews due to participants&#x02019; reports.</p><p>The following instruments were used.</p><p><list list-type="alpha-lower"><list-item><p>Eating disorder symptoms:</p><p><list list-type="roman-lower"><list-item><p>Eating Disorder Examination

 </p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>In a previous
 study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref> <italic>post
 hoc</italic> analyses revealed strata in which the outcomes of treatment differed.
 Hence randomisation for the present study included two strata, the first
 denoted here as the high stratum: SAS &#x0003c;2.2 (participants having a 53%
 chance of abstinence with CBT) combined with shape concerns &#x0003c;4.6
 (participants having a 48% chance of success) and a second stratum denoted
 here as the low stratum: with SAS scores &#x0003e;2.2 and shape concerns &#x0003e;4.6
 (with a 13% chance of success with CBT). Staff at the data coordinating centre
 performed the randomisation separately for each site and stratum using
 Efron&#x02019;s biased coin design.</p><p>Relative to power, with a sample size of <italic>n</italic> = 259, using a 5%
 two-tailed test seeking 80% power, we concluded that we could detect an effect
 size slightly over 0.3 (standardised mean difference between treatment
 groups). The primary analysis was by intention-to-treat using an ANOVA with
 the site &#x000d7; treatment to test the primary hypothesis that relates to the
 main effect of treatment. Main effects of site and risk stratum were expected
 and were removed to get a valid evaluation of the main effect of treatment.
 Interactive effects were also included in the model because interactive
 effects that are present but ignored can bias the estimation of both the main
 effects and of the variance and thus produce biased tests for the main effect
 of interest. Interactive effects of treatment with either site or risk stratum
 or their interaction would indicate that the size of the treatment effect is
 heterogeneous over site or risk stratum. If the heterogeneity is over risk
 strata, this might indicate a moderating effect on treatment of the variables
 used to stratify. It may be that one treatment strategy is more effective in
 one stratum than the other, and perhaps even that one treatment strategy is
 more effective in one stratum, but the other is more effective in the other
 stratum. When site &#x000d7; treatment interactions were found, special effort
 using exploratory data analysis techniques were used to try to identify the
 site characteristics that might account for such differential treatment
 effects.</p><p>The primary outcome variables were frequency of objective binge eating
 episodes and frequency of compensatory behaviours, defined as the total of
 episodes of vomiting, laxative use, diuretic use, fasting and driven exercise
 as measured on the EDE. Based on results of previous studies, square root
 transformations of these measures were used to stabilise the variance and thus
 to permit use of parametric test and estimation procedures. The frequency of
 objective binge eating episodes and compensatory behaviours were used in two
 ways to measure the effects of treatment. The first outcomes measure is
 abstinence defined as no binge eating episodes and no purging episodes of any
 kind in the past 28 days. The second outcome measure is a modified application
 of DSM criteria used to measure remittance. We defined remission to be no
 longer meeting DSM&#x02013;IV criteria for binge eating and purging, leading to
 a binary outcome of success or failure. These were examined at the end of
 treatment and at the 1-year follow-up, to examine both acute treatment effects
 and maintenance of treatment effects.</p><p>When post-test data were missing, the baseline value was carried forward
 (BOCF). When missing 1-year follow-up data occurred, the 6-month data were
 used (last observation carried forward, LOCF). If both follow-up assessments
 were missing, then the conservative method of BOCF was used.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Baseline characteristics and drop out</title><p>Data on baseline characteristics including means and standard deviations

 previous psychiatric hospitalisations were more likely to drop out at Cornell

 (<italic>F</italic>(1,262) = 3.5, <italic>P</italic> = 0.02). Those individuals in the CBT
 group with major depression were more likely to drop out at Cornell, North
 Dakota and Stanford, and less likely to at Minnesota. Those individuals in the
 stepped-care group with a history of depression were less likely to drop out
 at Cornell, and more likely to at Minnesota. There was no relationship between
 depression and drop out at North Dakota or Stanford (<italic>F</italic>(3,263) = 2.9,
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.04). The CBT participants with lower global EDE scores were
 more likely to drop out at Cornell and North Dakota; at Minnesota and
 Stanford, higher global EDE was associated with dropping out. Participants in
 the stepped-care group with lower global EDE assigned were more likely to drop
 out at Cornell, North Dakota and Stanford, whereas higher EDE scores were
 associated with drop-out status at Minnesota (<italic>F</italic>(3,263) = 3.2,
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.02). Finally, those in the CBT group with high purging levels
 were more likely to drop out at Cornell, those with lower levels of purging
 had higher drop-out rates at Stanford. Purging level was not related to
 drop-out status in the CBT group at Minnesota or North Dakota. Participants
 with lower purge rates who received stepped-care were more likely to drop out
 in North Dakota; a higher rate of purging was associated with drop-out status

 by site and treatment are shown in online Table DS1. In the CBT group, 122
 (82.3%) participants were assessed at end-of-treatment and 115 (78.8%) in the
 stepped-care group. Of those randomised to the CBT group, 117 (79.6%) were
 available for at least one of the follow-up assessments and 116 (79.4%) of
 those randomised to stepped-care were available for at least one follow-up.
 The abstinence rates were low; 15% in the CBT group at end-of-treatment and
 18% at the 1-year follow-up, compared with 11% and 26% respectively in the
 stepped-care group. These percentages were not significantly different.
 Remission rates were 57% at end-of-treatment and 44% at follow-up in the CBT
 group, and 52% and 32% in the stepped-care group. Examining remission there
 were no significant treatment differences or site &#x000d7; treatment
 interactions. There was, however, a significant difference favouring the
 stepped-care arm for objective binge eating episodes (<italic>F</italic>(1,276) =
 4.87, <italic>P</italic> = 0.028) and compensatory behaviours (<italic>F</italic>(1,276) =
 4.9, <italic>P</italic> = 0.027) at 1-year follow-up. Results on the completer
 analysis on these variables are not different and are not shown. For the
 secondary measures, the stepped-care arm was more successful in reducing BDI
 (<italic>F</italic>(1,275) = 4.9, <italic>P</italic> = 0.027) and YBC&#x02013;EDS rituals
 (<italic>F</italic>(1,276) = 4.0, <italic>P</italic> = 0.047) at follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Risk-strata effects</title><p>There were significant risk strata &#x000d7; treatment interactions for
 abstinence at post-test (<italic>F</italic>(1,277) = 10.7, <italic>P</italic> = 0.001). At
 post-treatment, low-stratum participants (predicted to have a better outcome)
 in the CBT group arm were more likely to achieve abstinence than those in the
 stepped-care group (17% compared with 8%.) However, for the high-risk stratum
 (predicted to have a worse outcome) the pattern was reversed. Only 4% of those
 participants in the CBT group were abstinent compared with 25% of the
 stepped-care group. Similar patterns were found for compensatory behaviours
 (<italic>F</italic>(1,276) = 6.6, <italic>P</italic> = 0.010), EDE restraint
 (<italic>F</italic>(1,276) = 4.8, <italic>P</italic> = 0.028), global EDE (<italic>F</italic>(1,276) =
 4.4, <italic>P</italic> = 0.037) and BDI (<italic>F</italic>(1,275) = 4.7, <italic>P</italic> =
 0.031). At follow-up, stepped-care was more successful in reducing BDI levels
 in the high-risk stratum (<italic>F</italic>(1,275) = 7.0, <italic>P</italic> = 0.009).</p></sec><sec><title>Site effects</title><p>There was a site &#x000d7; treatment interaction for BDI at post-test
 (<italic>F</italic>(3,275) = 4.1, <italic>P</italic> = 0.007), indicating heterogeneity of
 treatment across the various sites. Participants at Cornell and Stanford had
 lower scores when in the CBT group, whereas participants at Minnesota and
 North Dakota had lower scores when in the stepped-care group.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><sec><title>Main findings</title><p>At the end of treatment both in the intent-to-treat and completer samples
 no differences were found between them in inducing recovery (no binge eating
 or compensatory behaviours for 28 days) or remission (no longer meeting
 DSM&#x02013;IV criteria) in this multicentre out-patient study of participants
 with bulimia nervosa. However, at the end of the 1-year follow-up the
 stepped-care arm was significantly superior to the CBT arm in terms of
 reducing binge eating and all compensatory behaviours (vomiting, laxative
 abuse, diuretic abuse and excessive exercise). Differences were found between
 treatments based on the hypothesised moderator derived from a previous
 study.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref></p><p>Hence, there are three main findings from this trial. First, at the end of
 treatment a brief supervised self-help version of CBT delivered by less
 experienced therapists plus fluoxetine for those who needed it as judged by
 the algorithm was as effective as standard CBT plus fluoxetine, again based on
 the algorithm. This suggests that therapist-assisted self-help based on CBT is
 a possible alternative to immediate CBT if used in a stepped-care sequence.
 The second finding is that the entire stepped-care sequence (self-help,
 followed by fluoxetine for those who did not achieve abstinence, followed by
 full CBT for those not achieving abstinence) was more effective at follow-up
 than CBT followed by fluoxetine for those who were predicted to be
 non-responders. This suggests that a more individualised treatment with
 sequential changes to treatment based on response to treatments is both
 acceptable and more effective. It is of note that the first steps in the
 stepped-care sequence possibly could be carried out in non-specialist settings
 and at less cost than CBT. However, it remains unclear what qualifications are
 required for someone to be able to deliver self-help appropriately. For
 example, in a study by Walsh <italic>et al</italic>, nurses who received minimal
 training were not able to provide assisted self-help in a form that provided
 additional benefit to fluoxetine treatment in participants with bulimia
 nervosa.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref> The third
 finding is that participants in the high-risk stratum showed superior
 improvement in the stepped-care arm of the study. This is a somewhat puzzling
 finding and contrary to our hypothesis. One possibility is that guided
 self-help is better adapted to participants with poorer social adjustment than
 CBT. For example, fewer and shorter therapy sessions may be easier for such
 individuals to manage. Moreover, the therapy is primarily delivered via a
 book, giving the individual more flexibility in carrying out the needed
 behaviour changes.</p></sec><sec><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>In planning this study there was some trepidation about sequencing
 self-help with CBT in that we thought that participants might consider
 themselves already familiar with the concepts and be less willing to engage in
 full CBT. However, anecdotal reports from the therapists in this study
 suggested the opposite, as does the data.</p><p>In considering the results of this study, one must also consider the
 available research on self-help in bulimia nervosa. In
 some,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>
 but certainly not all prior
 work,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>
 self-help has performed as well as CBT, generally in small, short-term trials.
 This suggests that a pure self-help arm may have been of utility in the
 current design. One limitation to the current study is the fact that
 participants were not randomised to treatments but to treatment arms
 containing different sequences of treatment. Hence the study did not test the
 effectiveness of individual components within the sequences. However, such a
 study would have been larger and more expensive. Instead, this was designed as
 an effectiveness trial to better mimic what happens in clinical practice,
 wherein individuals can elect or decline additional therapies. Another point
 to be noted is that fluoxetine was titrated to 60 mg rather than being started
 at that dose. Titration is often used in clinical practice, although the drug
 can be safely started at 60
 mg.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref> Another
 limitation is that potential participants with certain comorbidities were
 excluded, resulting in the selection of a patient population with a higher
 likelihood of response. Finally, the participant sample was restricted to
 those with bulimia nervosa. Therefore, the results cannot be generalised to
 those with eating disorders not otherwise specified whose condition resemble
 that of those with bulimia nervosa.</p><p>Among the strengths were the large sample size, the use of four treatment
 sites, central training and ongoing supervision of assessors and therapists,
 the use of manual-based approaches to all the therapies involved including
 medication management, and careful oversight among the different sites in
 terms of initiating and monitoring the study, as well as central monitoring of
 assessments and treatment by the data and coordinating centre.</p><p>Some aspects of the results were surprising and raise interesting
 questions. The first is that the abstinence rates in the present study were
 lower than that of two other large studies in those with bulimia
 nervosa.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>
 However, it should be noted that at the end of treatment remission rates were
 similar across these studies. It seems unlikely that the quality of the
 therapy delivered in the current protocol was less than that in the other two
 studies since many of the therapists were the same.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Funding</title><p>The active drug was provided by <funding-source>Eli Lilly</funding-source>.
