It is currently unknown whether patients who fail to respond to the first onabotulinumtoxinA treatment cycle will respond to subsequent treatment cycles. To help inform decisions about treating non-responders, we examined the probability of treatment cycle 1 non-responders responding in cycle 2, and cycle 1 and 2 non-responders responding in cycle 3.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Pooled PREEMPT data (two studies: a 24-week, 2-cycle, double-blind, randomised (1:1), placebo-controlled, parallel-group phase, followed by a 32-week, 3-cycle, open-label phase) evaluated onabotulinumtoxinA (155&#x02013;195&#x02005;U) for prophylaxis of headaches in persons with CM (&#x02265;15&#x02005;days/month with headache &#x02265;4&#x02005;h/day). End points of interest included the proportion of study patients who first achieved a &#x02265;50% reduction in headache days, moderate/severe headache days, total cumulative hours of headache on headache days, or a &#x02265;5-point improvement in Headache Impact Test (HIT)-6.

<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> but treatment options are currently limited.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> The only agent approved in patients with CM for use as headache prophylaxis is onabotulinumtoxinA. OnabotulinumtoxinA is typically given every 12&#x02005;weeks following the standard treatment protocol and dose used in the Phase III studies and described on the approved labelling.</p><p>Migraine attacks may occur over a number of years, and the benefits of many preventive treatments develop slowly, over weeks to months.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> In patients who have not yet demonstrated a robust response, clinicians must decide whether to continue treatment or move on to another therapy. Since onabotulinumtoxinA is administered every 12&#x02005;weeks, decisions about continuing therapy are made based on response in the past 4&#x02005;weeks of a 12-week treatment cycle. The decision to offer a second treatment cycle in patients who do not respond to the first cycle should be based in part on research regarding the proportion of patients who do not respond to the first cycle but subsequently respond in treatment cycle 2. Similarly, the decision to offer a third cycle of treatment should be informed by data concerning the proportion of patients who do not respond in treatment cycles 1 and 2 who do respond in cycle 3.</p><p>The Phase III REsearch Evaluating Migraine Prophylaxis Therapy (PREEMPT) clinical programme is a combination of the two largest clinical trials of the CM population. These well-designed, placebo-controlled trials showed results that, among patients with CM, onabotulinumtoxinA was effective, safe and well tolerated in the treatment of headaches.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9&#x02013;11</xref> Across the 56-week trial, patients treated with onabotulinumtoxinA were shown to have better outcomes compared with placebo-treated patients.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> However, it is unclear whether patients who fail to respond to the first onabotulinumtoxinA treatment cycle will respond to subsequent treatment cycles.</p><p>In this context, the definitions of response and responder rates are crucial.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> In many headache studies, the proportion of patients who achieve a &#x02265;50% reduction in a headache outcome measure relative to baseline is often used. This &#x02265;50% responder rate has traditionally been considered clinically meaningful in episodic migraine (EM).<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> A &#x02265;30% reduction from baseline in headache symptom measures has been suggested to be clinically meaningful in studies of CM because of the greater severity and complexity of CM relative to EM.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Farrar <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> identified a 30% change on the pain scale as a clinically meaningful change. In the present report, we evaluated &#x02265;50% and &#x02265;30% responder rates using a number of end point measures.</p><p>Using &#x02265;50% responder rates as our outcome of primary interest, we examined response rates to the first treatment cycle on measures of headache days, moderate to severe headache days, and hours of headache on headache days, as well as a change in the Headache Impact Test (HIT)-6 score of &#x02265;5 points. For each end point, we examined the proportion of all onabotulinumtoxinA patients who first became responders in cycle 2, even though they did not achieve &#x02018;responder&#x02019; status in the first treatment cycle. For those who did not respond in either treatment cycle 1 or 2, we examined rates of first responders in cycle 3 among all onabotulinumtoxinA patients. Finally, we repeated these analyses using a more liberal definition of response (&#x02265;30% improvement) to define response for each of the three key end points (headache days, moderate to severe headache days and hours of headache on headache days). We hope that these data will help clinicians make decisions about when to continue onabotulinumtoxinA treatment in the setting of lack of response to initial treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design</title><p>The PREEMPT study design and methodology have been described in full in the primary publications.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>

<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> All efficacy analyses used the intent-to-treat population including all randomised patients (analysed as randomised rather than as treated). The two studies were run almost simultaneously under essentially identical data-collection protocols. In this post hoc analysis, first-time responders for a given treatment cycle were defined as patients who had never responded to any previous treatment cycle. Notably, the denominators were not decreased for patients who had previously responded; thus, the responder rates are additive across treatment cycles. A prespecified modified last-observation-carried-forward methodology (mLOCF) was used to impute missing data.</p><p>The impact of headache on psychological distress, functioning and vitality was measured using change from baseline in the HIT-6 score, and responders were defined as patients with a change from baseline in the individual HIT-6 score of &#x02265;5 points, which is considered a clinically meaningful improvement for an individual patient.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> As described above, the additive first-time responder proportions for a given treatment cycle were based on the count of responders who had not responded to any previous treatment cycle; the denominators were not decreased for previous responders.

We performed this post hoc analysis to determine the probability of response to the second treatment cycle, given a lack of response to the first cycle, and to determine the probability of response to the third treatment cycle, given a lack of response to the first two cycles. We believe these data may be helpful for physicians who want to optimise onabotulinumtoxinA treatment plans for patients with CM who have not responded to initial treatment cycles.</p><p>Combined data from the PREEMPT studies provide the largest CM clinical trials data set collected to date for examining issues of onset of treatment effects. The analysis in this paper is consistent with earlier findings showing onabotulinumtoxinA to be an effective prophylactic treatment for CM; onabotulinumtoxinA is shown to demonstrate clinically meaningful improvements during the first treatment cycle in multiple headache symptom measures, as defined by a &#x02265;50% improvement in a headache measure.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Forty-nine per cent of patients demonstrated a &#x02265;50% improvement for frequency of headache days, and 54% of patients demonstrated a &#x02265;50% improvement in cumulative headache hours on headache days. Of the patients who did not gain a benefit of a &#x02265;50% response after the first treatment cycle, 11% and 12% of all onabotulinumtoxinA patients achieved a &#x02265;50% improvement after the second treatment cycle, and 10% and 7% reached a &#x02265;50% improvement after the third treatment cycle in headache-day frequency and cumulative headache hours on headache days, respectively. The additive first-responder proportions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="JNNP2013307149TB1">table 1</xref>) imply conditional first-responder percentages of 22% and 26% of previous non-responders, respectively, for the second and third treatment cycles. Similarly, for a responder threshold of 30% improvement in headache-day frequency (<xref ref-type="table" rid="JNNP2013307149TB3">table 3</xref>), the additive first-responder proportions imply conditional first-responder percentages of 33% and 28% of previous non-responders, respectively, for the second and third cycles.</p><p>In addition, 56% of patients responded with an improvement in headache impact (&#x02265;5-point improvement from baseline in the total HIT-6 score) during the first treatment cycle. Another 15% responded to this measure of disability during the second treatment cycle, and an additional 8% responded during the third treatment cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JNNP2013307149F2">figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="JNNP2013307149TB4">table 4</xref>). Correspondingly, the conditional first-responder percentages were 33% and 26% of previous non-responders, respectively, for the second and third treatment cycles.</p><p>These analyses suggest that patients with CM who do not have the desired treatment response after the first cycle of onabotulinumtoxinA treatment may indeed experience clinical improvement after one or two additional treatments, as indicated by a robust clinical improvement (a &#x02265;50% improvement from baseline), as well as significantly reduced headache-related disability and improved functioning and overall quality of life.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Although many patients will respond after the first treatment, for those who do not respond initially, it is important to continue therapy for an additional 1&#x02013;2 cycles before categorising patients as non-responders.</p><p>The PREEMPT clinical trials were well designed, and a large number of patients completed the study. The large sample size leads to relatively precise estimates of first-responder rates. We are using the active treatment arm of the clinical trial to mimic a clinical experience. The study supports the inference that incremental responses will occur with additional cycles of onabotulinumtoxinA treatment, but it does not rigorously support the notion that the response is due solely to onabotulinumtoxinA, and extending the responder analysis to the placebo group would not achieve that goal. A study designed to test the benefits of a subsequent treatment cycle of onabotulinumtoxinA in non-responders to the first cycle would randomise non-responders to active drug versus placebo in a double-blind fashion. The group of patients who do not respond to placebo for the first cycle are not comparable to the group who did not respond to onabotulinumtoxinA, and therefore, response rates to placebo in placebo nonresponders is not the relevant comparison.</p><p>The recommendation to administer 2&#x02013;3 treatment cycles of onabotulinumtoxinA in order to determine clinical response is in agreement with the migraine treatment guidelines, which state that clinical benefit from preventive medications may take time to occur, and an adequate trial of preventive treatment is recommended before deeming it ineffective.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20&#x02013;23</xref> Based on the current notion of the pathophysiology of CM, the mechanism of action of onabotulinumtoxinA supports the clinical results presented. Migraine is a complex neurobiological system disorder comprising sensory pathways, emotional networks, autonomic systems and cortical functions.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Some aspects of CM and some associated symptoms reflect abnormal excitability in central and peripheral neurons, in particular those of the trigeminal neural and vascular structures; additionally, the clinical presentation involves peripheral and central sensitisation. The neurobiological substrate of this system disorder involves proinflammatory mediators and/or upregulation of sensory receptors or ion channels found on nociceptive nerve endings.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>
<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Furthermore, akin to other pain disorders, the dynamic process of time-dependent neuroplasticity with increased synaptic strength (&#x02018;gain&#x02019;) and enlargement of receptive fields plays a key role and would need to be reversed with treatment.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22&#x02013;24</xref></p><p>OnabotulinumtoxinA blocks the release of neuropeptides, neurotransmitters and the surface expression of pain receptors and ion channels on nerve membranes and, consequently, facilitates the gradual reversal of peripheral sensitisation, which then indirectly reduces central sensitisation associated with chronic pain.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>
<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Contributors to time-dependence and treatment-dependence include the following: (1) receptor downregulation takes time; it is not a rapid process. Although individual neurons may respond promptly, as a population of neurons, the effect is more gradual. (2) Not all involved peripheral nerves (c-fibre afferents) are affected to the same degree with each administration: some nerves are maximally or submaximally impacted and some are not within the zone of injection. (3) Central sensitisation requires time to recalibrate towards a normal state, and simply removing the peripheral stimulus may not result in prompt resolution of the central signature. Indeed, once initiated, central sensitisation may persist after the peripheral stimulus is removed.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></p><p>The resolution of central and peripheral sensitisation is time-dependent, and involves the reversal of a potentiated state.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>
<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Repeat dosing may be required to ensure sufficient time for decreased peripheral inputs to enable resolution of individual cellular and related biological system changes associated with sensitisation.</p><p>We suggest that clinicians who treat patients with CM discuss these expectations of efficacy when starting onabotulinumtoxinA treatment and recommend that their patients maintain a diary to track their response to treatment. As with many prophylactic agents, sustained exposure to the drug for several months (eg, 6&#x02005;months) is often required to fully evaluate response to the treatment. Owing to the unique delivery and mechanism of action of onabotulinumtoxinA, this may be achieved with up to three repeated treatments, as demonstrated in this study. At least two or three treatments with onabotulinumtoxinA are recommended to determine responsiveness.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to acknowledge Mitchell Brin, MD, of Allergan, Inc., for his contributions to the Mechanism of action section.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> SDS made substantial contributions to the conception and design as well as analysis and interpretation of the data; he drafted the manuscript and gave final approval of the version to be published.
