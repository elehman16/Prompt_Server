restriction increases muscle cross-sectional area and strength. This form of training is
used in rehabilitation; therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the effect of one
occlusion training session on the cardiovascular response to bouts of exercise. [Subjects
and Methods] Two groups took part: a control group without blood flow restriction and an
experimental group with blood flow restriction. A single training session was used with
the exercise intensity set at 40% of the one repetition maximum. Maximum voluntary
contraction, arterial blood pressure, and electrocardiogram measurements were performed.
[Results] Heart rate was slightly higher in the control group. The performed training had
no effect on diastolic blood pressure in either group, however, a tendency for a small
systolic blood pressure increase was observed during the session in the experimental
group. JT interval changes did not reveal significant differences between groups. There
were no significant changes in ST-segment depression during the exercise or at rest. A
lower tendency for JT/RR increases was observed during the repeated exercise tasks with
partial blood flow restriction. [Conclusion] Low intensity exercises carried out with a
partial blood flow restriction do not result in significant overload of cardiac
function.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Low intensity occlusion training</kwd><kwd>Foot articulation</kwd><kwd>Cardiovascular system</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Exercise is one of the most powerful non-pharmacological method of affecting cells and
organs in the body<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Regular aerobic and
resistance exercise training has a positive long-term impact on the cardiovascular system,
which is a biologically complex adaptive system that is characterized by a variety of
complex reactions to different training loads<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>While performing exercise, it is important that the body is supplied with oxygen and energy
substances. This transporting function is performed by the cardiovascular system<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. The power to transport these substances to
cells is provided by the heart pushing the blood containing them. It has been known for long
that blood flow intensification or even more accurate blood flow redistribution during
exercise can increase blood supply to working muscles and consequently increase working
capacity<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Nowadays, athletes and
coaches are looking for the most efficient training method so as to achieve maximum results
and to maintain these results for the longest possible period of time in order to minimize
the probability of injury. Recently, an unconventional training method has been developed
that uses blood flow restriction in the musculoskeletal system, otherwise known as the
&#x0201c;Kaatsu&#x0201d; methodology. An example of this is a walking workout using blood flow restriction,
which has been proven to be a useful method of improving muscle function, including muscle
hypertrophy, strength, and endurance.</p><p>Everyone aims to train less and show better results. One of the potential ways to achieve
this could be training with blood flow restriction<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Training with less weight reduces
stress on joints and therefore minimizes the possibility of getting injured. Recently, blood
flow restriction combined with low-intensity resistance exercise has been suggested as a
useful exercise protocol to gain muscular strength and mass without an increase in blood
pressure<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Exercises with blood
restriction are also beneficial for enhancing muscle mass and strength. Some authors have
suggested using as little as 20% of the maximum repetition weight during the training with
blood restriction.</p><p>As it is almost impossible to evaluate large arterial function directly, various
noninvasive methodologies have been used to evaluate arterial function in humans. Recording
of an electrocardiogram (ECG) is one of the most practical noninvasive methods. In
application of the ECG in sports physiology, ST-segment depression is the key index that
refers to the degree of the occurrence of myocardial ischemia. This is of special
significance in adolescent or young athletes, as it can be used to recognize unphysiological
states during workouts.</p><p>Together hereditary and congenital abnormalities of the heart are the most common causes of
nontraumatic death in sport in young athletes. In middle-aged recreational athletes, more
than 90% of sudden cardiac deaths occur in males, and more than 90% are caused by
atherosclerotic coronary artery disease<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Such findings encourage a greater interest in noninvasive ECG
methods of research and in questioning the meaning of ST-segment depression at different
workout and rest stages.</p><p>JT and or QT intervals are important when it comes to prolonged ventricular repolarization.
Basically, corrected QT or JT interval (&#x02191;QTc, &#x02191;JTc) indices increases sudden death and other
risks<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, some ECG parameters
observed in a minority of athletes present diagnostic conundrums. The JT interval
(<italic>measured from the J-point up to the end of the T-wave</italic>) describes the
duration of ventricular repolarization, and shortening of the JT interval during physical
load correlates with the increase in metabolic rate in the myocardium<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Our hypothesis states that the training gain achieved by training with the circulatory
restriction applied during low-intensity exercising lies within the physiological limits of
the cardiovascular system. The aim of this study was to the effect of a single occlusion
training session on the cardiovascular response to bouts of exercise.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>All subjects provided written informed consent before participation in the study. The
subjects in the study were amateur athletes in track and field with 4&#x02013;6&#x02005;years of training
experience, and they participated in two groups: a control group without blood flow
restriction and experimental group with blood flow restriction (n=24, mean age 22.5 &#x000b1;
1.5&#x02005;years; body mass index 24.7 &#x000b1; 0.5&#x02005;kg/m<sup>2</sup>). The weight and body mass index
(BMI) (TBF-300 body composition scale; Tanita, UK Ltd., West Drayton, UK) of the subjects
were estimated while they were seminude (shorts and T-shirts). None of the subjects
exercised for at least 12 hours and before the test or ate for at least 2 hours before the
test. The physical load test was carried out during the competitive period of the sports
season.</p><p>The study was designed to determine the effects of a single occlusion training session on
the cardiovascular system. The participants underwent circulatory restriction with a
40-mm-wide cuff applied the groin<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
participants were seated on a calf muscles trainer, and the cuff air pressure was set at 120
mmHg (the approximate resting systolic blood pressure for each participant<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. In this study, the calf muscles
(<italic>m. gastrocnemius and m. soleus</italic>) and the sole flexion muscle (<italic>m.
flexor digitorum brevis</italic>) were impacted by the occlusion. As part of a coherent
muscular system, these muscles experience their maximum loads during locomotion.</p><p>Foot flexor muscle strength was measured using a dynamometer. The participants sat holding
the dynamometry device with both hands. The knee of the working leg was fixed at an angle of
90&#x000b0;, and the ankle was fixed at an angle of 70&#x000b0;. The dynamometer was adjusted according to
the foot size of the participant. Maximum voluntary contraction (MVC), measured in newton&#x02019;s
(N), was performed three times, and the highest value was recorded. MVC was measured only
before training in order to choose the individuals training workload.</p><p>Arterial blood pressure (ABP), an important cardiovascular functional parameter, was
measured using the cuff method and by listening to the &#x0201c;Korotkoff tones.&#x0201d; ABP was measured
before and after each set.</p><p>A computerized analysis system &#x0201c;Kaunas-load&#x0201d; was employed for continuous 12-lead ECG
registration and analysis. Changes in RR interval or heart rate (HR), JT interval,
ST-segment depression (<italic>sum of negative values for 12 leads</italic>), and in ratio
of the JT/RR intervals were analysed.</p><p>As shown in other studies, low-intensity resistance exercise training with occlusion
(20&#x02013;50% MVC) increases both muscle cross-sectional area and strength<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, we used a single session of training with an
exercise intensity of 40% MVC. Foot flexor muscle conditioning training was conducted as
follows: three exercises comprising of the three sets of eight repetitions per set for each
leg. A 2.5-min rest period was provided between exercises, and a 30-sec rest period was
provided between sets. The participants were asked to lift the weight in time with a
metronome (30 movement cycles per minute)<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Occlusion was applied before the exercise and was removed after
each set of three exercises (3 sets, 3 exercises per set, and 8 repetitions per
exercise).</p><p>The arithmetic mean (x), standard deviation (s), and the arithmetic mean of the error
(s<sub>x</sub>) were calculated. A two-way independent samples Student&#x02019;s t-test was used
to determine how reliable the mean difference was for performance indicator results. A
significant difference between compared values was indicated when the error did not exceed
5% (p&#x0003c;0.05).</p><p>This study was approved by the Regional Biomedical Research Ethics Committee (Lithuanian
University of Health Sciences, Kaunas, Lithuania) (No: BE-2&#x02013;10, 26&#x02013;03-2015).</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The results of the research showed that before the exercise, the average HR was 69.1 &#x000b1; 4.0

between groups. The applied occlusion had no influence on ST-segment depression during
exercise or at rest. JT/RR values registered before exercise during the rest and while at
first set of exercises were not significantly different; however, a tendency for a lower
increase in JT/RR during the repeated exercise sets performed with partial circulatory
restriction was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Fig. 2</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_002" position="float"><label>Fig. 2.</label><caption><p>Dynamics of JT/RR during exercise and at rest</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jpts-28-3288-g002"/></fig>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The cardiovascular system, is a vital body system and the model of human body response to
exercising<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup> outlines it as the most
important part of the supplying systems. Results obtained during this study revealed that
the increase in HR during the exercise was more notable in the control group compared with
the experimental group. It was also determined that the application of the partial
circulation restriction caused lower JT/RR ratio values in the ECG. In assessing these
findings it is important to discuss the physiological meaning of these indicators. As it was
shown by other authors<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>, the JT/RR ratio
allows depiction of the mobilization of the cardiovascular system during exercising. If we
were to multiply the abovementioned ratio by 60, it would allow us to depict the situation
over time, that is, how many seconds per minute the heart (myocardium) was contracted and
consequently how long the cardiac musculature was at rest. The data from this study indicate
that cardiac muscle strain was slightly lower when the low-intensity exercise was carried
out with a partial circulatory restriction.</p><p>The present study found that systolic and diastolic ABP were higher throughout the entire
study. Higher changes in ABP were observed in the experimental group<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. This corresponds to the findings of other research
showing that application of occlusion increases vascular wall elasticity<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. It is important to note that vascular
wall elasticity is one of the main factors that affect diastolic arterial blood pressure.
The fact that certain blood vessels were clamped during the research could have also
influenced the increase of diastolic ABP. Performing the exercised with partial circulatory
restriction is not just healthier for joints (as smaller weights are used); a previous study
also showed that no manifestations of thrombosis where observed when using occlusion<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Partial blood flow restriction had no significant effect on coronary vessel function. This
was evident from the ECG ST-segment depression rate of change. The heart reserve possibility
of largely depends on whether the demand for oxygen is satisfied and on as how quickly and
sufficiently oxygen is delivered to the heart during the exercise. When the myocardium is
insufficiently supplied with blood there is a lack of oxygen in the myocytes. When coronary
heart blood vessels are insufficiently supplied with blood, during the exercise, changes
occur in the balance of metabolic processes and subsequently in electric potentials of
myocytes. As a result of these processes, ST-segment depression is visible in ECG records.
Thus assessment of the degree of ischemic episodes during exercise is also essential and
indicates the functional state of the heart.</p><p>Partial blood flow restriction had an ambiguous effect on blood pressure changes during the
exercise. Systolic ABP values continued to be higher during the exercise, while changes in
diastolic ABP were not registered. Repeating the exercise increased fatigue, and the body
was forced to mobilize more and more resources to perform a given exercise task. Therefore,
in the analysis of the research results, we assessed manifestations of variations in
functional indices of the cardiovascular system, i.e., changes of mobilization and recovery.
We concluded that when a partial blood flow restriction was applied during repeated
exercise, the heart mobilization and recovery features were better reflected in the JT/RR
ratio than in HR.</p><p>In assessment of manifestations of HR fluctuations, it was found that the amplitude of HR
change in response to exercise repetitions remained the same, while the increase in
mechanical work duration of the myocardium, as indicated by the JT/RR ratio, was lower,
which can be interpreted as indicating that the heart could perform its pumping function
with more ease. This was confirmed by the changes in JT in the ECG data, which demonstrated
changes in exactly the same direction. The physiological sense of JT can be defined as
follows: The JT interval in a recorded ECG is measured from the connection point J to the
end of the T wave (point J corresponds to the moment when the ECG curve after the S wave
returns to isolines). The JT interval indicates ventricular repolarization processes and can
be used as an indicator of the repolarization duration. Also JT interval variation is
related to changes in the intensity of myocardial metabolism<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Despite all the provided positive conclusions on the subject, we cannot affirm that
exercise should be performed only by applying the occlusion training method. Firstly, it
requires special equipment, the ability to use the special equipment, and knowledge of the
application procedures. Secondly, there are authors who claim that training with occlusion
does not provided reliable results<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. On
the other hand, in a study made by Maior in 2015, an interesting conclusion was drawn that
is application of occlusion training is more effective when movement is carried out through
one joint<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus, no unanimous conclusion can be made at present, but perhaps
scientists will carry out more research in the future to determine the body&#x02019;s response to
applying blood flow restriction with different pressure levels.</p><p>In summary we conclude that applying partial blood flow restriction with occlusion training
in the groin area resulted in a lower degree of HR increase in response to repeated exercise
compared with training without occlusion. However, this partial blood flow restriction does
not increase the myocardium load and has no significant effect on coronary vascular
function. Partial blood flow restriction affects the change in blood pressure during
exercise in an ambiguous way. Systolic ABP values continue to be higher during the change in
blood pressure, while diastolic ABP changes are not expressed. In conclusion, this study
confirmed the hypothesis that there is no additional strain on cardiac functioning during
occlusion training carried out by exercising with partial blood flow restriction in the
groin area.</p><p>The results obtained during the study suggest that such kind of occlusion training could be
applied for health training and rehabilitation purposes. Occlusion training by using a low
intensity of exercise triggers changes in muscular tissue similar to high-intensity exercise
training. Meanwhile, the cardiovascular system during exercise does not experience higher
overload, which could be a risk factor for cardiac patients and physically inactive persons.
This type of exercising could be considered safe.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Shalaby</surname><given-names>MN</given-names></name><name><surname>Saad</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Akar</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>The role of aerobic and anaerobic training programs on
