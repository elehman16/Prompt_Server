current stimulation (tDCS) during task-related training (TRT) on the gait ability of
patients with chronic stroke. [Subjects and Methods] The participants were 24 patients who
were diagnosed with hemiplegia due to stroke. Three groups were created: subjects who
performed TRT for general exercise therapy (TRT), subjects who received sham tDCS during
TRT for general exercise therapy (TST), and subjects who received tDCS during TRT for
general exercise therapy (TT). [Results] The stance phase symmetry profile, the swing
phase symmetry profile, and gait velocity all decreased significantly in the TT group
compared with the TRT group. However, there was no significant difference in the step
length symmetry profile among the groups. [Conclusion] A application of tDCS, that affects
the excitatory regulation in the cortical motor area, is an effective rehabilitation
method for gait improvement.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Gait</kwd><kwd>Hemiplegia</kwd><kwd>Transcranial direct current stimulation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Forty percent of patients with stroke have moderate functional damage after onset<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>, and their clinical symptoms are disorder in
consciousness, senses, language, cognition, and movement. In particular, their gait
abilities are limited because of disorder in movement<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. It was reported that task-specific training is more effective than
traditional training methods at improving the gait ability of patients with stroke<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Task-related training (TRT) effectively provides patients with a variety of sensory
stimulations and functional activities and consists of tasks that help improve the
performance of daily living activities<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>As another alternative to improve functional activities of patients with stroke, invasive
and non-invasive nerve-stimulation methods that help regulate the imbalance of excitability
in the cerebral cortex of the damaged brain after brain lesions have been actively
studied<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Transcranial direct current
stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive method of brain stimulation, and it has recently been
highlighted as a method of rehabilitation after brain lesions<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. tDCS increases or decreases activation in the cerebral cortex by
applying a weak direct current supplied by two electrodes placed on the scalp<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Experimental studies of cortical stimulation in stroke models have reported that a
combination of tDCS and rehabilitation has a positive effect on the combination of
peripheral activities and central stimulation<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Most human studies have investigated the effect of a single
stimulation of tDCS on upper extremities, and only a few studies have investigated the
combination of a stimulation of excitability in the cerebral cortex and rehabilitation
therapy.</p><p>Therefore, this study determined the effects of application of tDCS during TRT on the gait
ability of patients with chronic stroke, to provide basic data for rehabilitation programs
aiming to improve gait ability.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>From among 267 patients who were admitted to C Rehabilitation Hospital in Gwang-ju City,

with stroke, to establish its applicability in rehabilitation programs for gait ability
improvement.</p><p>Various exercise conditions are presented to patients with stroke to help them use the
optimal strategy for solving motion problems and achieving functional proficiency<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, active learning is
meaningful for solving problems assigned as functional tasks, with practical tasks being
more useful than abstract tasks<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Theilman et al.<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup> emphasized the
importance of providing goal-directed training, which consists of meaningful functional
tasks which involve functional motions. Their study results are consistent with the results
if our present study, and they showed that performing functional tasks rather than simple
muscle strengthening led to significant improvements in gait. Hummel et al.<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup> used tDCS to stimulate the M1 receptor of
patients with chronic stroke twice per day for 10 days and reported that the performance
time was improved (11.75% + 3.61%). Also, when normal persons received the same treatment,
they showed an improved performance time (10.96%+2.75%) too, indicating that repeated tDCS
for a short time during TRT can elicit behavioral effects because of the efficiency of the
training.</p><p>The recovery of symmetry in gait elements of patients with stroke is very important for the
success of the physical therapy<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. A
general problem found with gait abilities of stroke patients is the asymmetric and rapid
transfer of the center of gravity to the non-paralyzed side because of the instability of
the paralyzed lower extremity. As a result, the stance phase of the paralyzed side and the
swing phase of the non-paralyzed side become shorter, reducing the step length<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. Furthermore, gait velocity becomes
slower<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. In this study, reductions in
the swing phase symmetry profile, the stance phase symmetry profile, and velocity were found
in the TT group which were significant when compared with the TRT group (p&#x0003c;0.05). These
results indicate that both the paralyzed and non-paralyzed sides showed improvements in the
time and ratio of the gait cycle together with an increase in gait velocity, thus improving
the swing and stance phase symmetry profiles, as suggested by previous studies<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, the improvement in velocity
was due to improvement in the symmetry of gait of the subjects&#x02019; paralyzed and non-paralyzed
sides, indicating that tDCS during TRT is effective at improving the gait ability of
patients with stroke.</p><p>Based on this result, the application of tDCS during TRT is an effective rehabilitation
training method, and this study has provided basic data to support such a conclusion.
However, the number of subjects, 24 was small; therefore, the results cannot be generalized
to all patients with hemiplegia due to stroke. In addition, the consistency of the effect of
the training was not verified. Therefore, these two limitations should be addressed in
future studies.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This paper was supported by research funds provided from Howon University.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Cha</surname><given-names>HK</given-names></name><name><surname>Ji</surname><given-names>SG</given-names></name><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>MK</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Effect of transcranial direct current stimulation of
