The aim is to learn the effect of pupil&#x02019;s gender on their motivational level and the psychological consequences that might arise in the cognitive, affective, and behavioural domains. A quasi-experimental study was carried out at four schools in Mexico, with 12 physical education teachers and 40 natural groups of pupils aged between 11 and 17 (<italic>M</italic> = 13.17). The groups were randomly assigned to either an experimental group (24 groups, 447 pupils) or a control group (16 groups, 474 pupils). A prior training programme was carried out with the teachers in the experimental group to enable them to support the psychological need for autonomy, competence, and relatedness. Initial and final measurements were taken in both groups, and the results revealed that independently of the programme used, girls showed higher motivation and positive psychological consequences in the teaching of dance compared to the male participants. In conclusion, it is important to continue with research and set a methodology that addresses those differences, dedicating the necessary time and treatment to resolve their questions and necessities.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The authors received no specific funding for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="0"/><table-count count="3"/><page-count count="14"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are within the paper.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All relevant data are within the paper.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Art and pedagogy are supported by the same educative principles, respect for the pupils&#x02019; questions and guiding them to find their own answers [<xref rid="pone.0174393.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], and so, both disciplines must coexist in the teaching of dance. In this regard, the pedagogy that develops the activities of the artistic-expressive dimension has led teachers to suggest ideas without imposition, use active/inductive methods, respond differently to mistakes and negative experiences, promote discussion during feedback, maintain a receptive style, and have the attitude to learn at the same time as pupils; in sum, let teachers to experiment with a creative teaching-learning process [<xref rid="pone.0174393.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], which is shown by current intervention programmes that are developing for dance teaching [<xref rid="pone.0174393.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>The activities of the artistic-expressive dimension stimulate motor creativity, using generally open premises that help to generate singular answers and encourage frequent improvisation by pupils [<xref rid="pone.0174393.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Hence, improvisation is used in dance as a technique to develop divergent thought [<xref rid="pone.0174393.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0174393.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. These premises might be shown through different teaching procedures, such as an adequate level of practice and conditioning, the use of feedback, the stimuli of critical thought, the use of skills to perform, or giving different guidelines [<xref rid="pone.0174393.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. During dance classes, practice and conditioning might be easily changed through interaction with other pupils or object manipulation, and tasks can be shown through the use of metaphors or other verbal resources.</p><p>In accordance with this creative approach, which combines the pedagogy dimension with the artistic-expressive dimension, the following questions emerge: would the pupils&#x02019; expressive and creative capacities be improved by the teacher&#x02019;s expressive and creative capacity? Can we develop these skills during teacher training? Dance and education domains share similar characteristics: a common interest with respect to motivating others and being more effective in the learning-teaching process. Hence, as described in detail previously [<xref rid="pone.0174393.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], creativity work has been associated with motivation [<xref rid="pone.0174393.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0174393.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], emphasising in several studies the teacher&#x02019;s role as a key element in the type of motivation shown by pupils in physical education [<xref rid="pone.0174393.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0174393.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>These works are focused on the study of motivation through the postulates of Self-Determination Theory [<xref rid="pone.0174393.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0174393.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], which considers that motivation is a continuum that ranges from higher to lower levels of self-determination, which refers to the degree to which behaviors are volitional and involuntary. The higher degree of self-determination is intrinsic motivation, defined by performing an activity that produces a pleasant feeling when participating in the activity. This type of motivation has been associated with positive consequences such as enjoyment, effort, usefulness, or adherence to physical education [<xref rid="pone.0174393.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0174393.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], and also with the development of positive behaviour in physical education [<xref rid="pone.0174393.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The second degree of motivation is extrinsic motivation, in which the behaviour for an activity is unrelated to the person themselves and appears to be related to outside interests. In this type of motivation there are different sublevels, listed in descending order with reference to the self-determination level: identified regulation, introjected regulation, and external regulation [<xref rid="pone.0174393.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Finally, the lowest level of self-determination is amotivation, in which the subject does not know exactly why to keep practicing.</p><p>In accordance with this theory, the type of motivation shown by a person depends on the satisfaction of their basic psychological needs [<xref rid="pone.0174393.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], on autonomy (the feelings of volition and the sense that the individual has personal control of his or her own behaviour), competence (the development of an effective interaction and sense of accomplishment with the environment), and relatedness (the feeling of connection and the development of belongingness within the social context in which the activity is performed). Therefore, it might be possible increase pupils&#x02019; motivation and their positive consequences in physical education if the teacher uses a more creative methodology that includes strategies to support the satisfaction of these three needs [<xref rid="pone.0174393.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0174393.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Specifically, a teacher can use specific autonomy support strategies, refer to the use of cognitive teaching styles to give the students the responsibility of choosing the tasks that they will perform as well as allow pupil freedom in decision-making [<xref rid="pone.0174393.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Likewise, competence support strategies are aimed at optimising pupils&#x02019; perception of their skill through activities that are adjusted to their level and that provide a sufficient time frame to achieve the proposed aims, while providing positive feedback and acknowledging their efforts and progress [<xref rid="pone.0174393.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0174393.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Finally, relatedness support refers to the teacher&#x02019;s resources for creating learning environments that promote feelings of inclusion, integration, trust, and respect among the classmates [<xref rid="pone.0174393.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>Nevertheless, when testing pupil motivation, it is crucial to study the effect of gender, because whereas boys show a more self-determined motivation towards physical education in general [<xref rid="pone.0174393.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0174393.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], girls show less enjoyment, interest, and pleasure during these classes [<xref rid="pone.0174393.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0174393.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Conversely, regarding dance and artistic-expressive activities, girls show a greater interest than boys in this type of activity [<xref rid="pone.0174393.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0174393.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The teaching of dance is very particular and the current tendency is to set programmes where pupil creativity is promoted, because it is shown that if an adequate structure and set of classes is performed, we are helping to establish social bonds between the genders where they have to help each other, avoiding comparison between them [<xref rid="pone.0174393.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Therefore, the aim of this study is to learn whether gender differences exist in the motivational processes (the perception of teacher support of the basic psychological needs, the perception of the satisfaction of these needs, and the self-determination level), in the cognitive (usefulness of dance), affective (enjoyment and effort), and behavioural (positive behaviour) consequences that pupils show, after applying a dance teaching programme in the school developed by the teacher that is based on creativity and the development of strategies to support autonomy, competence, and relatedness.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Method</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>Insofar as ethical rules are concerned, the study previously received the approval of the Ethics Committee of the University of Extremadura.

Six of these 12 teachers were assigned to the experimental group, developing with them an intervention programme based on creativity and incorporating skills into their teaching style to increase pupil motivation. The other six teachers were assigned to the control group and only had to apply the content without including the programme.</p><p>The teachers in the experimental group had to apply a creative methodology as described in detail previously [<xref rid="pone.0174393.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], where the pupils are the ones that start and assume responsibility for their learning whilst the teacher acts as a mentor in the teaching process (Kassing &#x00026; Jay, 2003). It is based on the creativity or ability to create different motor and expressive responses when a problem arises (Kassing &#x00026; Jay, 2003). Furthermore, they had to attend a seminar on the theory of self-determination, which stressed the importance of supporting the need for competence, autonomy, and relatedness. Subsequently, they were given a document in which every one of the strategies that must be applied in each of the 12 sessions of the didactic unit appeared. Several sessions were used to provide examples of how these strategies may be pedagogically applied (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0174393.t001">Table 1</xref>). The strategies were taken from [<xref rid="pone.0174393.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], in which each strategy appears that support the autonomy, competence, and relatedness needs, adapted to the dance context. These are as follows:</p><p>To support autonomy: use the democratic leadership style to foster pupils&#x02019; active participation; try not to control or put too much pressure on the pupils in order to reduce competitiveness; make it possible for them to choose some activities by specifying the rules; explain the objective of the activity so that there is greater engagement; use rewards related to practice and place emphasis on the pupils&#x02019; social skills.</p><p>To support competence: adapt the exercises to the pupils&#x02019; level; design activities where success is evaluated through intrapersonal instead of interpersonal indicators in order to foster effort and personal improvement; provide positive feedback so that pupils feel more secure and more aware of the triumphs they achieve; provide objectives and feedback regarding the process and not the result in order to increase the skill level perceived by the pupils; propose different and accessible short-, medium-, and long-term objectives that adapt to the pupils&#x02019; needs.</p><p>To support relatedness: set aside some moments during the session for pupils to be able to establish personal relations and deal with unrelated topics; form mixed gender groups to boost the integration of all pupils; educate the pupils in social skills so that they learn to show empathy towards each other and towards the teacher; create cooperative exercises in order to encourage pupils to make mutual and dynamic group decisions that provoke the exchange of opinions and establish strong and long-lasting relationships.</p><p>To ensure proper implementation of the intervention programme, a training programme with seven observers was developed (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0174393.t001">Table 1</xref>). These observers were dance degree students who were interested in participating to acquire further knowledge of dance education. This training programme was similar to that which the experimental groups received in that it insisted on the correct/ incorrect application of each strategy.</p><p>Once the various training programmes had been developed, we proceeded to the implementation. A quasi-experimental design was used, with 40 natural groups already established by a school centre, so it was not possible to respect randomisation. These groups were divided into 16 control groups (<italic>n</italic> = 474) and 24 experimental groups (<italic>n</italic> = 447). Both groups received the same dance teaching programme, but with the experimental group a motivational intervention programme based on creativity was also developed. The research was performed throughout the first term at a secondary education centre, with two weekly 50-minute sessions distributed throughout the week that took place in the gymnasium of the centre.</p><p>To collect the research data, two measurements were carried out, pre and post. The pre-measurement was carried out during the first session of each group, before this session was given, and the post-measurement was taken at the end of the process in both groups. Data collection consisted of administering a questionnaire to the pupils, which they completed in the classroom without the presence of the teacher and in a climate that enabled them to concentrate without any type of distraction for 20 minutes. The principal investigator was present at all times to explain any doubts and make sure that the process was strictly followed.</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Data was analysed using the SPSS 18.0 statistical package.

Afterwards, a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) with the data collected in the pre-test was developed, including the group (the control group and the experimental group) and gender (male, female) as independent variables, to observe the homogeneity of the sample. Finally, to observe the gender differences, a three-factor repeated measures analysis of variance was performed, with two inter-subject factors (two-level gender and two-level group) and one intra-subject factor (two-level time of measurement), with the aim of comparing the interaction between teaching technique and pupils&#x02019; gender in the pre-test and post-test.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec014"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec015"><title>Descriptive statistics and reliability analysis</title><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0174393.t002">Table 2</xref> shows the descriptive statistics of the study variables with the pre-test and post-test data.

variables.</p><p>To begin with, regarding the pupils&#x02019; perception of basic psychological needs support, significant differences were found at the multivariate level in agreement with the gender

psychological needs, the perception of satisfaction of these needs, and the self-determination level), in cognitive (the usefulness of dance), affective (enjoyment and effort), and behavioural (positive behaviors) consequences that pupils show, after apply a dance teaching programme in school developed by the teacher, based on creativity and the development of strategies to support autonomy, competence, and relatedness.</p><p>After the research was conducted, statistical analysis showed the existence of significant differences regarding gender, but these differences were not associated with the programme they belonged to (the control or experimental group), not with the time of measurement (pre-test or post-test). Therefore, results demonstrated that, independently of the application of an intervention programme based on the creativity and orientated to promote pupils&#x02019; motivation, girls showed a greater perception of teacher support of their basic psychological needs, higher satisfaction of those needs, greater self-determined motivation (intrinsic motivation and identified regulation), a higher perception of the usefulness of dance, greater enjoyment, greater effort, and more positive behaviour than boys regarding educative dance. Nevertheless, boys showed greater amotivation than girls towards this discipline.</p><p>In line with these results, other studies have revealed the existence of differences between the genders in the motivation shown towards dance, and so, girls always show greater motivation and interest in this discipline [<xref rid="pone.0174393.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0174393.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], whereas boys revealed less motivation because they consider that it is an eminently feminine discipline, and they have valued themselves with fewer qualities than the female gender to develop this activity for social and cultural reasons [<xref rid="pone.0174393.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0174393.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Therefore, the outcomes found were quite relevant because they let us explain that differences emerged in motivation and interest between boys and girls respecting dance, there was a strong tendency of a feeling and an unshakable perception over time, and this is possibly related to the ideas that have traditionally existed about this discipline. According to this issue, research has demonstrated that boys and girls usually show competence and motivation in those physical activities that they consider adequate regarding their gender [<xref rid="pone.0174393.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] and this aspect will determine their choice of physical activities and their answers to certain activities that are taught in physical education [<xref rid="pone.0174393.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].</p><p>As described in detail previously [<xref rid="pone.0174393.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], boys and girls are aware of their social expectations in terms of their participation in physical and sport activities, while boys traditionally show a desire for physical contact sports as central experiences when establishing an acceptable masculine identity[<xref rid="pone.0174393.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>],girls have a greater preference for artistic-expressive activities such as dance [<xref rid="pone.0174393.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0174393.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Accordingly, contrary to what happens in the teaching of dance, in the domain of physical education in general, investigations have suggested that girls had lower motivation [<xref rid="pone.0174393.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0174393.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0174393.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and showed less enjoyment and commitment during these classes [<xref rid="pone.0174393.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0174393.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], possibly because this subject has traditionally focused the learning on competence and physical attitude [<xref rid="pone.0174393.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], and the methodology of learning used in the curriculum has followed a more traditional perspective focused on the teacher, which has led to physical education being defined as hegemonic, orientated to the sport and the competitive masculine culture, and being underestimated in its social, cognitive, and affective aspects [<xref rid="pone.0174393.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0174393.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0174393.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].</p><p>As can be seen, the main limitation found in this study consisted of the complexity of changing this tendency, and maybe due to this aspect, a motivational intervention programme is not enough to decrease the differences in the interest of both genders regarding dance. This assessment revolves around the stereotypes created around dance, and even more in the Mexican context that this research was developed, characterised by behaviour typical of a socially unshakable patriarchal and sexist education system [<xref rid="pone.0174393.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>].</p><p>Possibly, with the aim of achieving success in the desired effects of intervention, a methodology might be set that attends to these differences and gives time and the necessary approach to resolve their questions and necessities. And certainly, this methodology is based on creativity [<xref rid="pone.0174393.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] because it is the way that teachers try to better approach the pupils&#x02019; preferences and connect with their aims, content, and procedures [<xref rid="pone.0174393.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0174393.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0174393.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]</p><p>But creativity in the domain of dance requires a large amount of pupil comprehension because it is a principle that might decrease their competence and motivation [<xref rid="pone.0174393.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] due to the difficulty of this type of content, which resides in the performances that teachers have to develop, such as pupil autonomy in front of their peers and using uncommon motor patterns [<xref rid="pone.0174393.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Hence, one of the conclusions that we can take from this study is that, although this research has used a creative methodology to develop the content and increase the motivation of both genders, this purpose was not achieved, because it requires continuity and the time dedicated to this content in the school was limited to only a one hour class of dance per week. The increase of the frequency, as well as the length and application of this content in different educative levels, might promote a significant improvement in the motivation and assessment of the activity on the part of the male participants, but further investigation is necessary regarding this issue.</p><p>Moreover, another limitation that was found was the length of the teacher training in the motivational strategies: it was insufficient according their own statements, because sometimes they felt unsteady in the application of the strategies due to the relationship of some dance content modified by the pupils&#x02019; background and the conflicts that might appear in the classroom. Thereby, it might be interesting in the future to extend such training to promote the comprehension and the adaptation to the learning situations regarding conflicts.</p><p>Therefore, another conclusion is the importance of promoting the initial training of teachers with regard to the methodological treatment of dance content in school, with the aim of improving the teaching-learning process and regularising this type of content within any General Educative System, independent of the society in which it is applied.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank the participation of teachers and pupils in this study.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0174393.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Davies</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Jindal-Snape</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Collier</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Digby</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Hay</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Howe</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name>. <article-title>Creative learning environments in education- A systematic literature review</article-title>. <source>Think Skills Creativ</source>. <year>2013</year>; <volume>8</volume>: <fpage>80</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>91</lpage>.</mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0174393.ref002"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><name><surname>Allen</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name>. <chapter-title>Drama in school, its theory and practice</chapter-title>
