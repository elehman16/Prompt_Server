Antipsychotic medication has been the primary treatment approach, and there are a variety of different choices available. Lurasidone is a second-generation (atypical) antipsychotic agent that is approved for the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar depression. Three long-term studies of lurasidone have examined time to relapse in persons with schizophrenia, including a classic placebo-controlled randomized withdrawal study and two 12-month active comparator studies (vs risperidone and vs quetiapine extended-release). Lurasidone 40&#x02013;80 mg/d evidenced superiority over placebo (number needed to treat [NNT] vs placebo for relapse, 9). Lurasidone 40&#x02013;160 mg/d was noninferior to quetiapine extended-release 200&#x02013;800 mg/d on the outcome of relapse, and was superior on the outcome of avoidance of hospitalization (NNT 8) and the outcome of remission (NNT 7). Lurasidone demonstrated a lower risk for long-term weight gain than the active comparators. Demonstrated differences in tolerability profiles among the different choices of antipsychotics make it possible to attempt to match up an individual patient to the best choice for such patient based on past history of tolerability, comorbidities, and personal preferences, potentially improving adherence.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>antipsychotic</kwd><kwd>lurasidone</kwd><kwd>relapse</kwd><kwd>tolerability</kwd><kwd>schizophrenia</kwd><kwd>weight gain</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Optimal management of schizophrenia requires adequate symptom control and avoidance of exacerbation or relapse.

Inclusion criteria included the following: duration of illness &#x02265;1 year; in a nonacute phase of illness for &#x02265;8 weeks; no change in antipsychotic medications, other than minor dose adjustments for tolerability purposes, for &#x02265;6 weeks before screening; no hospitalization for psychiatric illness for &#x02265;8 weeks; and moderate or less severity rating on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) items of delusions, conceptual disorganization, hallucinations, and unusual thought content. Among the exclusion criteria were treatment with risperidone within 6 weeks before baseline, or a history of a poor or an inadequate response, or intolerability to risperidone. Patients who had been treated with a stable dose of antidepressants or mood stabilizers for &#x02265;1 month before the baseline visit were allowed to continue this treatment during the study; otherwise, subjects were not permitted to begin treatment with these agents after the screening visit. Although the primary outcome measure was the number of participants with adverse events, efficacy outcomes included relapse rate, PANSS total score, and the Clinical Global Impressions-Severity (CGI-S) score. Relapse was defined as worsening of the PANSS total score by 30% from baseline and CGI-S &#x0003e;3; rehospitalization for worsening of psychosis; or emergence of suicidal ideation, homicidal ideation, and/or risk of harm to self or others.</p><sec><title>Relapse</title><p>A small proportion of subjects in the study experienced a relapse (114/608, 19%). The rate of relapse among lurasidone-treated patients was 20% (82/410), and that for risperidone-treated patients, 16% (32/198), yielding a number needed to treat (NNT) value of 27 (not statistically significant [ns]) in favor of risperidone (for a brief overview of NNT, see <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="bx1-ppa-10-1529">Box 1</xref>). For both treatment groups, the Kaplan&#x02013;Meier estimates of the probability of relapse were less than 0.5 at month 12; therefore, the median survival time to relapse could not be calculated for either treatment group. The relapse hazard ratio comparing lurasidone vs risperidone was 1.31 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.87&#x02013;1.97; <italic>P</italic>=0.194). Because the study was powered to test the noninferiority of lurasidone relative to risperidone on the basis of the assumption of expected relapse rates of 35% for both treatment groups after 1 year, the noninferiority test was uninterpretable because the actual relapse rates were substantially lower than initially predicted.</p><boxed-text id="bx1-ppa-10-1529" position="float"><label>Box 1</label><caption><title>What is NNT?</title></caption><p>An NNT is a measure of effect size that is clinically intuitive. NNT answers the question: &#x0201c;How many patients would you need to treat with Intervention A instead of Intervention B before you would expect to encounter one additional positive outcome of interest?&#x0201d; For the outcome of avoidance of relapse, an NNT of &#x0201c;x&#x0201d; for a test medication vs placebo would mean you would have to treat &#x0201c;x&#x0201d; number of patients with the test medication instead of with placebo before expecting to avoid one additional relapse. The lower the NNT, the more robust the intervention is when compared to the alternative. NNT is a different concept than <italic>P</italic>-value, which relates to &#x0201c;statistical&#x0201d; significance. NNT is a measure of &#x0201c;clinical&#x0201d; significance. A <italic>P</italic>-value, even as low as <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.00001, does not necessarily mean that a result is clinically relevant. To determine possible clinical relevance (ie, clinical significance) effect size, such as NNT, needs to be evaluated.</p><p>NNT is simple to calculate:
<list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>A = frequency of outcome for Intervention A</p></list-item><list-item><p>B = frequency of outcome for Intervention B</p></list-item><list-item><p>NNT =1/(A&#x02013;B), rounded up to a whole number</p></list-item></list></p><p>For example, if giving a test medication results in relapse of 25% over a 12-month period and giving placebo results in relapse of 50% over a 12-month period, NNT for avoidance of relapse for the test medication vs placebo is 1/(50%&#x02013;25%)=1/(0.50&#x02013;0.25)=1/(0.25)=4. Thus, for every four persons given the test medication instead of placebo, you would expect to avoid one additional relapse event.</p><p>A rule of thumb is that NNT values vs placebo &#x0003c;10 denote potentially useful interventions. Most psychotropic medications for most indications have NNT values between 3 and 9 for clinically relevant definitions of response or efficacy. The lower the NNT, the more often desired outcomes are encountered.</p><p>An additional tutorial for the use of NNT can be found at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4140623/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4140623/</ext-link> and guidance on interpretation is further available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ijcp.12142/full">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ijcp.12142/full</ext-link>.

Rates of akathisia in the double-blind phase were 2.1% for subjects receiving lurasidone and 2.8% for those receiving placebo. The discontinuation rate due to adverse events (including the adverse event-related relapse criterion of worsening of schizophrenia) during the double-blind phase was 14% for lurasidone and 16% for placebo. Minimal changes in weight, lipids, glucose, and prolactin were observed.

All-cause discontinuation rates were 48% and 58%, for lurasidone- and placebo-treated subjects, respectively, resulting in an NNT of 10 (ns), with a Kaplan&#x02013;Meier probability of all-cause discontinuation at the week 28 endpoint of 58% for the lurasidone group vs 70% for placebo (log rank test, <italic>P</italic>=0.070).</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The efficacy of lurasidone for the maintenance treatment of patients with schizophrenia was tested in three multicenter, randomized, controlled trials,<xref rid="b10-ppa-10-1529" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b12-ppa-10-1529" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> including a placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal study.<xref rid="b12-ppa-10-1529" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Superiority to placebo and noninferiority to quetiapine XR has been evidenced, with an uninterpretable relapse outcome when lurasidone was compared with risperidone.

Indirect comparison reveals a degree of overlap for the 95% CIs among the agents, including lurasidone vs aripiprazole, brexpiprazole, cariprazine, olanzapine, paliperidone, and ziprasidone. Although there is no overlap in the 95% CIs for lurasidone vs quetiapine XR, this indirect comparison is difficult to interpret, particularly in the face of noninferiority for probability of relapse that was observed when lurasidone was directly compared with quetiapine XR.<xref rid="b11-ppa-10-1529" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> An important caveat is that randomized withdrawal studies can differ substantially in terms of open-label stabilization periods (if any), stabilization criteria, length of observation, and relapse criteria.
