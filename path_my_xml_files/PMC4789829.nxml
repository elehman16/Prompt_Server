The improvement in total endoscopic intensity score was significantly higher in the three budesonide groups compared with placebo. Dysphagia improved in all groups at the end of treatment; however, improvement of dysphagia persisted only in those treated with BET1 (p=0.0196 vs placebo). There were no serious adverse events.

It is available in various pharmaceutical formulations for a variety of GI and pulmonary indications.

Patients were centrally randomised in a 1:1:1:1 ratio via an Interactive Web Response System, to receive treatment with either 2x1 mg/day (BET1) or 2x2 mg/day (BET2) or oral BVS 2&#x000d7;5&#x02005;mL (0.4&#x02005;mg/mL)/day or placebo, for 14&#x02005;days. In order to maintain the study blinding when using different pharmaceutical preparations, a double-dummy design was used. Therefore, both formulations, that is, BETs (containing budesonide or placebo) as well as oral BVS (containing budesonide or placebo) were taken by all patients in divided doses twice daily. Depending on the treatment group, either the BET or the oral BVS contained budesonide or placebo, respectively. Patients received the study medication marked with their randomisation number, sufficient for the entire treatment period of 2&#x02005;weeks, at the baseline visit. Patients were instructed to administer the study drugs after a meal. First, the tablet was to be placed on the tip of the tongue and pressed gently against the hard palate until it had completely disintegrated by contact with saliva. The components dissolved in saliva were then to be swallowed (5&#x02013;10 swallows within 90&#x02013;120&#x02005;s). At least 15&#x02005;min after ingestion of the tablet, 5&#x02005;mL of the viscous suspension were swallowed. Patients were further instructed to avoid eating, drinking or oral hygiene procedures for 30&#x02005;min after study drug administration. Compliance was assessed using patient's diary cards which recorded time of breakfast and evening meal, time of study drug administration and time of oral hygiene on a daily basis. Furthermore, compliance was recorded by counting (blister and tablets) or weighing (bottles) the trial medication returned at the end of treatment (EoT)/withdrawal visit.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Endoscopy</title><p>Upper endoscopy was performed at screening and at EoT by the same board-certified gastroenterologist, using conscious sedation with either propofol or midazolam under the decision and responsibility of the physician. The following endoscopic abnormalities were recorded and classified as either absent (0), mild (1), moderate (2) or severe (3): white exudates, furrows, oedema, fixed rings, crepe paper sign, short-segment stenosis, long-distance stenosis. Thus, the total endoscopic intensity score ranged from 0 to 21. In addition, a global assessment of endoscopic appearance was determined using a 100&#x02005;mm visual analogue scale (VAS).</p><p>During both endoscopies, two biopsies each from the distal, mid and proximal oesophagus were obtained, preferably from visible lesions. In addition, two biopsies each from the antrum, corpus and duodenum were obtained during screening endoscopy, unless this had already been done during a previous upper endoscopy within 12&#x02005;months prior to screening. The biopsies were immediately placed into separate tubes with neutral-pH-buffered 4% paraformaldehyde solution and sent to the primary central pathologist (MV for Germany and Belgium, CB for Switzerland).</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Histology</title><p>The processing and analysis of the biopsy samples were performed according to a standard operation procedure, to which both pathologists and their team members consented and adhered. From the paraffin-embedded oesophageal biopsies 10 sections were cut for H&#x00026;E staining, an additional five sections for Van Gieson and five sections for alcian blue (AB) periodic acid-Schiff (PAS). Gastric biopsies were stained with H&#x00026;E, alcian blue and periodic acid Schiff (ABPAS) and either Warthin Starry stain or Hp-Giemsa stain, and duodenal biopsies with H&#x00026;E and ABPAS stain.</p><p>On each oesophageal biopsy specimen, all levels were surveyed and the eosinophils in the most densely infiltrated area were counted in 5&#x02005;hpfs and the numbers entered into an electronic database. Biopsies from Switzerland were assessed by CB using a Zeiss-Axio Imager A1 microscope with Carl Zeiss Pl 10&#x000d7;/23 ocular (field number: 23) and a Zeiss EC Plan-Neofluar 40&#x000d7; objective, resulting in an area of microscopic field of 0.260&#x02005;mm<sup>2</sup>. MV assessed the biopsies from Germany and Belgium using an Olympus AX70 microscope with Olympus SWH 10&#x000d7;-H/26.5 ocular (field number: 26.5) and PLANAPO 40&#x000d7; objective, resulting in an area of microscopic field of 0.345&#x02005;mm<sup>2</sup>.

Oral topical corticosteroids have been proven efficacious in children and adults and are therefore considered to be first-line medical treatment in patients with active EoE.</p><p>This multicentre, randomised controlled trial is the first study examining efficacy and safety of two different formulations of budesonide which target the oesophagus&#x02014;BET and BVS&#x02014;for treatment of adult EoE. Furthermore, this is to date the largest trial, including 76 patients in total, and compares two different dosages of the drug. The results of this study clearly demonstrate that short-term treatment with budesonide administered either as BET or as BVS has a profound anti-inflammatory effect throughout the entire oesophagus and, additionally, significantly improves endoscopic abnormalities.</p><p>Up to now, the traditional primary end point in EoE trials has been the degree of eosinophilic inflammation of the oesophagus. In this trial we have adopted this concept and have also used the histological response as the primary end point, despite the knowledge that symptoms have to be respected as the key end point. We have used the mean number of eosinophils per mm<sup>2</sup>&#x02005;hpf as the key metric for the primary and co-primary end points, calculated from a large number of histological slides obtained from biopsies from the entire oesophagus. We used this extensive assessment strategy to be as accurate as possible in determining the anti-inflammatory effects of treatment throughout the oesophagus. On the other hand, the histological remission rates based on the peak number of eos/mm<sup>2</sup>&#x02005;hpf were quite similar in our study, suggesting that the more extensive determination of mean number of eosinophils per mm<sup>2</sup>&#x02005;hpf might not be necessary in clinical routine practice.</p><p>Of note, comparisons between individual trials in EoE are hampered by differences in study designs, definitions of histological response, and even technical differences such as the area of high power fields among different microscopes. Nevertheless, the histological remission rates observed in our study confirm, or even seem to exceed, those from previous randomised controlled trials in adult and paediatric EoE which essentially studied swallowed nebulised corticosteroid formulations originally designed for pulmonary treatment.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15&#x02013;18</xref> Interestingly, all patients in this trial who received budesonide effervescent tablet 1&#x02005;mg twice daily achieved histological remission, and therefore no additional benefit could be shown for the higher dose of 2&#x02005;mg twice daily. Similarly, all patients who completed treatment with the viscous suspension reached histological remission. This impressive effect could be explained by the higher dose of budesonide (2&#x02005;mg twice daily) used in our study compared with previous studies examining viscous suspensions.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16&#x02013;18</xref></p><p>So far, three randomised controlled trials of budesonide in EoE have been published. Major differences between these trials include mode of drug delivery, treatment duration and patient selection. In the study by Straumann <italic>et al</italic>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> 18 adult or adolescent patients with EoE were exposed to a viscous budesonide suspension at a dose of 2&#x000d7;1&#x02005;mg per day given for 15&#x02005;days. The patient population (including the number of patients with previous steroid exposure), the histological remission and response rates as well as the improvement in endoscopic abnormalities were comparable with our observations. Dohil <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> reported on 15 paediatric patients exposed to viscous budesonide suspension for 3&#x02005;months at a daily dose of 1 mg or 2&#x02005;mg depending on the patient's body weight. Importantly, all patients received concomitant lansoprazole. In that trial, 13 patients (87.5%) were classified as responders based on the mean peak eosinophil count per hpf, which may not be the optimal histological metric to determine histological response. Nevertheless, the differences to placebo were striking. Finally, Dellon <italic>et al</italic> compared topical budesonide 2&#x000d7;1&#x02005;mg per day delivered either as viscous suspension or in a nebulised form taken orally by 25 adult, steroid-naive patients with EoE for a duration of 8&#x02005;weeks.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> This elegant study clearly demonstrated superiority of the viscous suspension over the nebulised application form with regards to the mucosal contact time of the drug as well as histological and endoscopic responses.</p><p>With respect to endoscopic abnormalities, we observed significant improvement in endoscopic signs of acute inflammation, that is, white exudates, furrows and oedema, in all three budesonide groups. Fixed rings, which are regarded as an endoscopic sign of long-standing EoE, improved numerically in all three budesonide groups, but statistical significance versus placebo was only observed in the high-dose effervescent tablet group. Overall, the endoscopic response to budesonide treatment was very similar between our trial and previous trials in adult patients with EoE.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>
<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p><p>The evaluation of dysphagia in EoE remains a challenge as long as validated scores are lacking. Poor correlation between severity of symptoms and histological activity is a well-recognised problem and has been described in various EoE trials.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>
<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21&#x02013;24</xref> In our study we used the same dysphagia score that was used in the study by Straumann <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> and observed significant improvement of dysphagia at the EoT in all four groups, including the placebo group. The reasons for the significant symptom response in the placebo group remain obscure, but illustrate that in EoE meaningful readouts should include biological markers as well as patient-reported outcomes.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> However, the endoscopic score for fixed rings at baseline was somewhat lower in the placebo group compared with the active budesonide group, which could have influenced at least the symptom response to placebo. Of note, sustained improvement of dysphagia 2&#x02005;weeks after termination of treatment was only observed in patients exposed to budesonide, indicating a symptomatic benefit for active treatment over placebo, and suggesting that treatment with topical steroids for longer than 2&#x02005;weeks may be necessary to differentiate the effects of budesonide and placebo on symptom relief.</p><p>In our study, short-term topical treatment with two new budesonide formulations was safe up to a daily dose of 4&#x02005;mg budesonide. The very low frequency of systemic side effects, including adrenal suppression, is clearly the pharmacodynamic result of the favourable pharmacokinetic profile of the study drugs. Previously, it has been shown that only about 9% of budesonide from the effervescent tablet reaches the systemic circulation in patients with active EoE.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> In contrast, oesophageal fungal infection (hyphae) occurred in some patients receiving budesonide. It is noteworthy that not all macroscopically suspected fungal infections were confirmed by the Grocott staining. White exudates in EoE might be taken as fungal plaque and <italic>vice versa</italic>. Therefore, it is prudent to examine patients with EoE carefully by histopathology. The frequency of oesophageal fungal infection in our study was similar to those frequencies reported in previous EoE trials of topical steroids.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>
<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>
<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></p><p>Our study may have a potential limitation because we did not incorporate the definition which is currently proposed for exclusion of PPI-responsive oesophageal eosinophilia (PPI-REE), that is, PPI administered twice daily for 8&#x02005;weeks. At the time of planning the study, the PPI-REE issue had just been addressed and summarised in the consensus guideline by Liacouras <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> However, at that point it remained entirely unclear whether PPI-REE represents a distinct disease entity that differs from classic EoE, or is just a subphenotype of EoE. Moreover, no valid criteria with regards to the type, dose and duration of PPI treatment were available; indeed, randomised placebo-controlled trials of PPI in EoE are still lacking and PPI therapies are not formally approved for the treatment of EoE. Finally, recent studies have shown EoE and PPI-REE to be indistinguishable based on clinical, endoscopic, histological and biochemical assessments.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>
<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Very recently, extensive transcriptome analyses have demonstrated a significant molecular overlap between PPI-REE and EoE, suggesting that PPI-REE is likely to represent a continuum of the same pathogenic allergic mechanisms that underlie EoE and thus may constitute a subphenotype of EoE.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></p><p>Another limitation of our study may be that it focuses exclusively on the induction of remission of an active eosinophilic inflammation. It does not address the issue that EoE is a chronic inflammatory disease which untreated may show a progressive course resulting in fibrosis and consequently stricture formation. It therefore requires a long-term therapeutic strategy. However, the problem of finding an efficient and safe long-term medical therapy is still unsolved. First studies indicate that long-term treatment with low-dose budesonide may be efficient in maintaining a long-term remission and in preventing bolus obstructions.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>
<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Based on the promising results of the present study, further prospective studies are warranted in order to define the optimal schedules for long-term treatment in paediatric and adult patients with EoE.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Web figures</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="gutjnl-2014-308815-s1.pdf" orientation="portrait" id="d36e1400" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><caption><title>Web table</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="gutjnl-2014-308815-s2.pdf" orientation="portrait" id="d36e1405" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Correction notice:</bold> This article has been corrected since it published Online First.
