The right eye of each patient was randomised at the surgical centre using a coin toss to either one of the procedures; the other eye automatically received the other technique.

Custom ablation (OZ 6.5 mm, TZ 1.25 mm) was then performed with the LADARWave 4000 laser. Following photoablation, 0.002% MMC was applied to the stromal bed for 1 min. The solution was applied by filling the barrel of a 7.0 mm Hoffer marking trephine centred over the pupil. The MMC was dried after 60 s using a sterile microsponge. The eye was then copiously irrigated with 30 cm<sup>3</sup> of balanced salt solution to wash out residual MMC. A bandage contact lens (New Vues, CIBA, Duluth) was placed at the end of the procedure.</p><p>After topical anaesthesia and corneal marking, the LASIK flap was cut using a Moria M2 (Moria, Antony, France) microkeratome. &#x0201c;Ring and stop&#x0201d; was chosen accordingly to achieve a 9 mm diameter flap. Custom ablation was then performed. Corneal irrigation and flap repositioning were done following photoablation.</p><p>No offset or laser nomogram adjustment was used in the two groups. Surgeries were performed by both authors.</p><p>All operated eyes received the same postoperative drug regimen. Tobramycin 0.3% plus dexamethasone 0.1% drops were given four times daily for 15 days; artificial tears were given five times daily for at least 3 months. Patients were instructed to take pain-relief tablets if necessary. The bandage contact lens in PRK eyes was removed after complete corneal reepithelialisation.</p><p>No enhancements were performed in any eye during 12 months&#x02019; follow-up.</p></sec><sec id="s1c"><title>Patient assessment</title><p>The preoperative visit involved a comprehensive ophthalmological examination including UCVA, BSCVA, cycloplegic refraction, corneal topography, aberrometry, central ultrasound pachymetry (USP), slit-lamp microscopy and contrast sensitivity. Follow-up examinations were scheduled at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after surgery, and involved the same tests and assessments performed during the preoperative visit.</p><p>UCVA and BSCVA were measured using the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study visual acuity chart (ETDRS, logMAR notation). Cycloplegic refraction and aberrometry (LADARWave 4000, Alcon Laboratories) were performed 40 min after two drops (5 min apart) of 1% cyclopentolate. All aberrations were measured to the fifth Zernike order using a 6.5 mm pupil.</p><p>At each follow-up, a satisfaction questionnaire was administered prior to any other testing. Patients were asked to assess their vision in each eye as bad, reasonable, good or excellent; they were also asked to rate ocular pain, far vision difficulty, near vision difficulty, glare, photophobia, vision fluctuation, image distortion and foreign-body sensation in each eye. Each characteristic was grade on a 0 to 3 scale, with 0 indicating an absence of symptoms and 3 indicating the worst symptom.</p><p>Contrast sensitivity (Optec 6500, FACT, Stereo Optical Co, Chicago) was determined in each eye with the BSCVA at spatial frequencies of 1.5, 3, 6, 12 and 18 cycles per degree in mesopic and photopic conditions. The log base 10 contrast sensitivity values were used to construct a graph for each spatial frequency tested.</p><p>Biomechanical properties of the cornea were determined using the Ocular Response Analyser (ORA, Reichert, Depew, New York) at 1-year follow-up. Corneal hysteresis (CH) and corneal resistance factor (CRF) were measured in both eyes of patients.</p><p>Statistical analysis was done using analysis of variance with repeated measures (over time and between treatments, Bonferroni) using the statistics software SPSS 12 (SPSS, Chicago). The definition of statistical significance was set at p&#x0003c;0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><p>Forty-four patients (88 eyes) were enrolled in this study.

More eyes achieved the supranormal UCVA of &#x02212;0.2 or better in MMC-PRK (52%) than in LASIK (31%) eyes at the 1-year follow-up. Seventy-four per cent of MMC-PRK and 43% of LASIK eyes gained one or more BSCVA lines at 12 months postoperatively. There were no differences in SE at last follow-up, and both groups presented a mean hyperopic shift around 0.5 D 1 year after surgery. However, MMC-PRK treatments appeared more precise (lower SDs in MMC-PRK eyes), and more eyes were myopic after LASIK surgery and hyperopic after MMC-PRK.

Total RMS, HOA, defocus, astigmatism, spherical aberration and other aberrations were lower in eyes that had received MMC-PRK surgery. We conjecture that the absence of a flap interface and the modulation of corneal wound healing with MMC resulted in less induction of aberrations. It is unclear whether the decreases in aberrations are clinically relevant, but MMC-PRK eyes had better refractive outcomes, had better contrast sensitivity scores and were better rated in terms of visual satisfaction. Porter <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> reported a significant increase in higher-order aberrations of approximately 30% 2 months after cutting a Hansatome (Bausch &#x00026; Lomb, Rochester, New York) microkeratome LASIK flap without laser application. Pallikaris <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> also found a significant increase in total higher-order wavefront aberrations following flap formation. Some studies have demonstrated that femtosecond laser flap formation results in a smaller increase in higher-order aberrations than mechanical flap creation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref></p><p>Several authors have reported significant correlations between increased higher-order aberrations and decreased contrast sensitivity, especially total HOA, coma and spherical aberrations.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref> Other authors have reported the correlation between visual symptoms and ocular aberrations, such as monocular diplopia with coma, and starburst and glare with spherical aberration.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref> In the present study, MMC-PRK eyes had lower aberrations and better mesopic and photopic contrast sensitivity scores than LASIK eyes. Surface ablation eyes scored higher in terms of the visual-satisfaction questionnaire.</p><p>Corneal hysteresis and corneal resistance factor are biomechanical properties of the cornea which reflect its viscoelastic properties. Corneal hysteresis has been previously shown to decrease following LASIK surgery.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref> Corneal hysteresis and corneal resistance factor values also have been shown to be significantly decreased in keratoconic eyes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref> We found a statistically significant difference in corneal hysteresis and corneal resistance factor between LASIK and MMC-PRK eyes 1 year after surgeries. In our study, eyes that had received MMC during PRK showed a lower CH and CRF than LASIK eyes. One weakness of our study is that we did not measure preoperative corneal hysteresis and corneal resistance factor in both groups. Kirwan and O&#x02019;Keefe<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref> found a statistically significant decrease in hysteresis 3 months after LASIK and LASEK with similar decrements in both treatments groups. The authors also found a moderately strong correlation between central corneal thickness (CCT) and hysteresis. In our study, MMC-PRK eyes had statistically significant thinner corneal measures than LASIK eyes 1 year after surgeries. We are not sure whether the lower hysteresis values found in MMC-PRK eyes are related to reduced biomechanical integrity of the cornea or are a result of the lower postoperative CCT found in PRK with MMC eyes. Future studies are needed to determine the Ocular Response Analyser accuracy to measure the biomechanical properties of the cornea and its clinical relevance.</p><p>In the current study, wavefront-guided PRK with 0.002% MMC was more effective than wavefront-guided LASIK for correction of moderate myopia during the 1-year follow-up. Surface ablation eyes presented a better UCVA, BSCVA, aberrometry and contrast sensitivity, and were better rated in a subjective questionnaire than LASIK eyes. However, before widespread use of prophylactic 0.002% MMC can be implemented, further research is necessary to determine the optimal concentration and exposure time, and the long-term corneal side effect of mitomycin C exposure.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Competing interests:</bold> None.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p>Ethics approval: This study was
