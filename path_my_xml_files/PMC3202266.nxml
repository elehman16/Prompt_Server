Starch obtained from the rhizomes of two plants viz., <italic>Curcuma angustifolia</italic> Roxb. (Fam. Zingiberaceae) and <italic>Maranta arundinacea</italic> Linn. (Fam. <italic>Marantaceae</italic>) are used as <italic>Tugaksheeree</italic>. In the present clinical study, the efficacy of <italic>Tugaksheeree</italic> was studied on 67 patients of <italic>Amlapitta</italic>. A 0 total of 84 patients suffering from <italic>Amlapitta</italic> were selected from the O.P.D. and I.P.D. sections in the department of Dravyaguna, I.P.G.T. and R.A., Hospital, Jamnagar, and were randomly divided into two groups. Thirty four patients completed the treatment course in Group I, and 33 patients completed the treatment course in Group II. The efficacy of drug <italic>Tugaksheeree</italic> was studied through internal administration of the starches of <italic>C. angustifolia</italic> Roxb. (Fam. <italic>Zingiberaceae</italic>) in Group I and <italic>M. arundinacea</italic> Linn. (Fam. <italic>Marantaceae</italic>) in Group II with the dose of 4 g TID with water for 30 days. Both the drugs were found highly effective in treating <italic>Amlapitta</italic>. They significantly relieved the cardinal symptoms viz., <italic>Avipaka, Tikta-amlodgara, Daha, Shoola, Chhardi</italic> and the associated symptoms viz., <italic>Aruchi, Gaurava, Udaradhmana, Antrakujana, Vit bheda, Shiroruja, Angasada</italic>, and <italic>Trit</italic>. Statistically significant increase in body weight was noticed in both the groups. This may be because the drugs corrected the <italic>Agni</italic> and acted as <italic>Brihmana</italic> and <italic>Dhatupushtikara</italic>. Both the drugs did not produce any side effects. Therefore, both these drugs (<italic>C. angustifolia</italic> Roxb. and <italic>M. arundinacea</italic> Linn.) can be used as substitutes for each other.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>Tugaksheeree</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Curcuma angustifolia</italic> Roxb. <italic>and Maranta arundinacea</italic> Linn.
