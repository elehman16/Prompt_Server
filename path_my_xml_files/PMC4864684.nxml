The progressive ventricular hypertrophy, which is known to occur in hypertensive patients, leads to diastolic dysfunction. This diastolic dysfunction worsens whenever there is tachycardia in the perioperative period and may lead to myocardial infarction resulting in severe morbidity and even mortality.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] In poorly controlled hypertensive patients, a more severe hemodynamic response to laryngoscopy and intubation can be observed when compared with well-controlled hypertensive patients.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>A variety of pharmacological agents namely opioids, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, combined alpha and beta blockers, lignocaine, and alpha-2 receptor agonists have been used to maintain stable hemodynamics in the perioperative period. Fentanyl is a popular choice for control of hemodynamics in the perioperative period. However, it is associated with side effects such as respiratory depression and increased incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV).[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Dexmedetomidine, a highly selective alpha-2 agonist, has sympatholytic, antinociceptive, sedative, and anti-sialagogue properties without causing respiratory depression.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>Numerous studies have shown the benefit of dexmedetomidine in blunting the stress response to laryngoscopy and intubation.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Literature is scarce regarding the role of dexmedetomidine in providing stable intraoperative hemodynamics in hypertensive patients. Hence, we designed this double-blinded randomized controlled trial to compare the effect of infusions of dexmedetomidine and fentanyl on intraoperative hemodynamics, recovery characteristics, and PONV in hypertensive patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><p>Ethical approval for this randomized double-blinded controlled study (SEC/2011/4/50) was given by the Institute Ethics Committee (Human Studies), in a statement dated February 2, 2012. The sample size was calculated based on a previous study in hypertensive patients by Uysal <italic>et al</italic>., at a significance level of 5%.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Fifty-seven hypertensive patients were enrolled for the study between March 2012 and January 2014 conducted in the operation theaters of a Tertiary Care Teaching Hospital. Hypertensive patients aged 18&#x02013;70 years scheduled for major surgery were included in the study. The patients with uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure [BP] &#x0003e;160 mm Hg or diastolic BP &#x0003e;100 mm Hg), history of ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, impaired liver or renal functions, and suspected full stomach patients including pregnant patients were excluded from the study. Patients with anticipated difficult airway, laparoscopic procedures, and those with expected blood loss &#x0003e;25% of blood volume were also excluded from the study.</p><p>The patients were randomized into dexmedetomidine (Group D) and fentanyl (Group F) groups using a computer-generated randomization table. The patients, the attending anesthesiologist, and the primary investigator were blinded to the study drug allocated to patients. Sequentially numbered opaque sealed envelope technique was used for blinding the anesthesiologists attending to the patients [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>].</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>CONSORT flow diagram for the present study</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AER-10-332-g001"/></fig><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Anesthetic management</title><p>All the patients were premedicated with tablet famotidine 20 mg and tablet diazepam 5 mg on the night before and on the morning of the surgery.

Dexmedetomidine or fentanyl 100 &#x000b5;g was loaded in a 50 ml syringe and diluted with normal saline (concentration 2 &#x000b5;g/ml). The attending anesthesiologist was blinded to the study drug. Intravenous infusion of the study drug was started to deliver 1 &#x000b5;g/kg bolus over 10 min. Midway through the bolus infusion (after 5 min), fentanyl 1 &#x000b5;g/kg was given intravenously in both groups. After 7 min of starting the bolus infusion, patients were induced with intravenous thiopentone 2.5% titrated to loss of eyelash reflex. Vecuronium bromide 0.1 mg/kg was used for muscle relaxation. The patients were manually ventilated with nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O) and O<sub>2</sub> mixture (66% +33%) with isoflurane 1&#x02013;1.3 minimum alveolar concentration (MAC). At the 10<sup>th</sup> min, laryngoscopy and intubation were done using appropriate size endotracheal tube and the infusion rate of the study drug was changed to 0.5 &#x000b5;g/kg/h.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-2"><title>Maintenance</title><p>Anesthesia was maintained on controlled ventilation with N<sub>2</sub>O in O<sub>2</sub> mixture (66%:33%) with isoflurane between 0.7 and 2 MAC. If mean arterial pressure (MAP) dropped &#x0003e;20% from the baseline, isoflurane concentration was reduced up to 0.7 MAC for 3 min. If MAP failed to normalize, boluses of intravenous mephentermine 1.5 mg were used until MAP normalized to within 20% from the baseline. If HR or MAP increased by &#x0003e;20% of the baseline, isoflurane concentration was increased up to 2 MAC and intravenous fentanyl 10 &#x000b5;g boluses were given if MAP failed to normalize. A fall in the HR to &#x0003c;50/min was treated with atropine 0.3 mg intravenously. HR, MAP, and end-tidal isoflurane concentrations were recorded every 1 min for the first 5 min and every 10 min thereafter. The requirement of additional boluses of fentanyl and mephentermine were noted.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-3"><title>Recovery</title><p>Study drug infusion and isoflurane were stopped at the end of the surgery. Neuromuscular blockade was reversed with neostigmine 50 &#x000b5;g/kg and glycopyrrolate 10 &#x000b5;g/kg. The time for eye opening on call or spontaneously was noted as the recovery time. On adequate reversal, patients were extubated and monitored in the PACU for 2 h. The time of the first request for analgesia and the occurrence of PONV were noted.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The analysis was carried out using SPSS 16 statistical software (SPSS 16.0 by IBM).

MAP was significantly lower in the dexmedetomidine group, and those patients received more mephentermine boluses than those who received fentanyl infusion.</p><p>Many previous studies, including that by Patel <italic>et al</italic>., found a significant decrease and less variability in the HRs of patients who received dexmedetomidine, and a low and stable systolic and diastolic BPs as well. However, Patel <italic>et al</italic>. had administered the maintenance dose of dexmedetomidine while the others administered a 1 &#x000b5;g/kg loading dose alone.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Lawrence and De Lange had also demonstrated lower perioperative serum catecholamine concentrations in the dexmedetomidine group.</p><p>The requirement of isoflurane was found to be significantly less in the patients who received dexmedetomidine than in those who received fentanyl.

Any sympathetic response during emergence from anesthesia can increase morbidity. In our study, by continuing a maintenance infusion of the drug throughout surgery, we achieved lower but comparable HRs at extubation in both the groups. However, the hypertensive response was significantly lower in the dexmedetomidine group compared to the baseline unlike that seen with fentanyl, indicating better control of BP compared to fentanyl.</p><p>The time to recovery from anesthesia and extubation after stopping the infusion, in our study, was found to be comparable. In the study by Patel <italic>et al</italic>., the test group received dexmedetomidine maintenance infusion of 0.2&#x02013;0.8 &#x000b5;g/kg/h after the bolus dose, while the control group did not receive an infusion.
