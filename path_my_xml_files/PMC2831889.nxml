After a one week washout period, each group then used the opposite mouthwash for 7 days. At baseline and after 7 days, oral malodor was evaluated with Organoleptic measurement (OM), and analyzed the concentrations of hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S), methyl mercaptan (CH<sub>3</sub>SH) and dimethyl sulfide ((CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>S), the main VSCs of human oral malodor, were assessed by gas chromatography (GC).

Future research is needed to examine long-term effects, as well as effects on periodontal diseases and plaque accumulation in a well-defined sample of halitosis patients and broader population samples.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00748943</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The mouth is home to hundreds of bacterial species that produce several fetid substances as a result of protein degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Oral malodor, also called halitosis or bad breath, is a general term used to describe an offensive odor emanating from the oral cavity. It is caused by several factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Although some extraoral condition (nasal inflammation, diabetes mellitus, uremia, etc.) have been suggested causes of oral malodor, clinical studies have shown that intraoral causes such as gingivitis, periodontitis and tongue coating are the main sources of the disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In particular, it has been found that periodontal bacteria produce several malodorous compounds such as volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs). Most of the major compounds contributing to oral malodor are VSCs such as hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S), methyl mercaptan (CH<sub>3</sub>SH) and dimethyl sulfide ((CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>S). The substrates for VSCs are largely sulfur-containing amino acids (i.e. cysteine, cystine and methionine) that are found in saliva, gingival crevicular fluid and tongue coating debris [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p><italic>In vitro </italic>studies have demonstrated that oral gram-negative anaerobic bacteria such as <italic>Prophyromonas gingivalis (P.g.), Fusobacterium nucleatum (F.n.), Tannerella forsythensis (T.f.), Treponema denticola (T.d.)</italic>, and several species of other oral bacteria can produce VSCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. These bacteria can be isolated from the subgingival plaque in gingivitis or periodontitis patients, and from the saliva and the dorsum of the tongue in healthy subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Odor outcomes are significantly correlated with total counts of bacteria and higher numbers and proportions of certain gram-negative anaerobes, in particular <italic>F.n</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. <italic>Prophyromonas gingivalis, F. n., and T.f</italic>., which are gram-negative anaerobic rods, actively produce VSCs such as H<sub>2</sub>S and CH<sub>3</sub>SH. <italic>Treponema denticola</italic>, which is a helical microorganism, also produces VSCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>Antibacterial agents such as chlorhexidine (CHX), cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC), triclosan, essential oils, zinc salts, hydrogen peroxide, sodium bicarbonate and chlorine dioxide (ClO<sub>2</sub>) have been tested, either alone or in different combinations with mechanical devices, for their efficacy to reduce oral malodor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. CHX being the most studied antimicrobial agent has also been tested for its efficacy in the treatment of oral malodor. Results from a case series study in halitosis patients suggested a significant effect of 0.20% or 0.12% CHX rinsing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Although CHX is considered the most effective oral antiseptic agent, the use of CHX for extended periods of time is related to some side-effects, such as tooth and tongue staining, bad taste and reduced taste sensation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>Previous studies have suggested that ClO<sub>2 </sub>and the chlorite anion (ClO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>) directly oxidize VSCs to non-malodorous products and, through this oxidation, consume the amino acids such as cysteine and methionine, which act as precursors to VSCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Moreover, the chlorite anion is powerfully bactericidal to microorganisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Recently a mouthwash containing ClO<sub>2 </sub>has become available on the Japanese market (ClO2 Fresh<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Bio-Cide International, Inc., Oklahoma, USA and Pine Medical Co., Tokyo, Japan). Shinada, et al. reported that the ClO<sub>2 </sub>mouthwash was effective at reducing morning oral malodor for 4 hours when used by healthy subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Its clinical efficacies on oral malodor have been evaluated and reported only in short duration (maximum 96 h) trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Moreover, no clinical study has investigated its microbiological efficacy on periodontal and malodorous bacteria.</p><p>Some mouthwash trials of healthy subjects reported that a significant positive correlation was observed between the reduction in salivary and tongue coating bacteria and oral malodor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In this study, because of the difficulties in standardizing tongue dorsum samples, we monitored only the salivary bacteria.</p><p>Because the effective antimicrobial action of a mouthwash containing ClO<sub>2</sub>has been verified <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], the hypothesis tested in this study is that a ClO<sub>2 </sub>mouthwash will also effectively reduce oral malodor and periodontal and malodorous bacteria in saliva. Thus, the aim of this study was to assess the inhibitory effects of a mouthwash containing ClO<sub>2 </sub>used for 7 days on morning oral malodor and on salivary periodontal and malodorous bacteria.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>Subjects were 15 healthy male volunteers aged 19-38 years (mean age 22.9 &#x000b1; 6.2 years) who had no medical disorders, were not undergoing antibiotic or other antimicrobial therapy, and were non-smokers. The subjects received verbal and written information about the study and signed consent forms to participate. An oral examination was conducted to assess oral status of the subjects prior to the experiment. We excluded females because their menstrual cycle might affect oral malodor on the crossover design with one week washout [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. No subjects reported usually using commercial mouthwash, antibacterial tooth paste, tongue brush and dental floss.</p><p>All dental examinations were conducted by the one trained examiner for all subjects, both for baseline and for follow-up examinations. The examiner was blind to the assignment of subjects to Experimental or Placebo groups.</p><p>The sample size was estimated using an expected mean organoleptic measurement (OM) score difference of 1, a within-subject variance around the mean OM score difference of 0.5, a significance level of 5%, and a power of 80%. The results indicated a required sample size of 15 subjects for a crossover design.</p></sec><sec><title>Study design</title><p>This clinical trial was a randomized, double blind and crossover design with a one week washout period between the crossover phases. The subjects were randomly assigned to two groups using computer-generated random numbers. Allocation of subjects was generated by one person who was not related with the researchers or subjects of this study, using a random number table. Assignment of subjects was held in a secure and sealed file and only decoded at the end of this trial.</p><p>In the first test phase, the group 1 subjects (N = 8) were instructed to rinse with 10 ml of the experimental mouthwash containing ClO<sub>2 </sub>for 30 seconds twice per day (after waking and before sleeping) for 7 days, and those in group 2 (N = 7) to rinse with the placebo mouthwash without ClO<sub>2</sub>. In the second test phase, after a one week washout period, each group then used the opposite mouthwash for 7 days. At baseline, and after 7 days, oral malodor was evaluated by the organoleptic measurement (OM) and gas chromatographic (GC) methods. Concentrations of H<sub>2</sub>S, CH<sub>3</sub>SH and (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>S were evaluated with GC. Clinical outcome variables included plaque and gingival indices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], tongue coating index (TCI) and tongue discoloration index (TDI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Subjects continued their usual oral hygiene practices during the study, except for the morning of each clinical assessment.</p><p>Samples of the resting whole saliva were collected into a sterile plastic tube over a 5 minutes period, prior to oral status assessments, and were immediately sent to the BML dental laboratory (BML Inc., Saitama, Japan). They were microbiologically investigated by an Invader PLUS technology which was applied to detect the presence and quantification of <italic>F.n., P.g., T.f</italic>. and <italic>T.d</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><p>There were no significant differences in any malodor measures between the two groups at either the first or second baseline measurements before mouth rinsing. Similarly, there were no significant differences between the first and second baseline measurements after one week washout period. Hence, we concluded that the oral condition returned to baseline during the one week washout period, and that one week washout was sufficiently long enough for an explorative trial such as this short trial for 7 days.</p><p>Subjects reported their perception of any side effects or compliance issues in rinsing for 7 days with both mouthwashes, and the time schedules they used for the mouth rinsing over the 7 day period. The experimental (with ClO<sub>2</sub>) and the placebo mouthwashes (without ClO<sub>2</sub>) were prepared by Pine Medical Co. for this study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Neither the examiner nor the subject knew whether the mouthwash was experimental or placebo. The contents of each mouthwash were as follows. The experimental mouthwash (ClO2 Fresh<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) contained 0.16% (w/w) sodium chlorite (NaClO<sub>2</sub>) with an efficacy of 0.10% (w/w) chlorine dioxide (ClO<sub>2</sub>), glycerin, mint oil, 1.13% (w/w) citric acid (a pH adjusting agent) and distilled water, the pH was 5.65, and oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) 588 mv. The placebo mouthwash contained glycerin, mint oil and distilled water; essentially the same contents as those in the experimental mouthwash except for the ClO<sub>2</sub>, with a pH5.83, and ORP of 610 mv. Both mouthwashes were thoroughly membrane filtered and put into plastic bottles sealed with a screw-cap. An independent person, outside this trial filled white, opaque bottles, coded either A or B with the Placebo or Experimental solution. Neither examiners nor subjects in the research group knew which were the Experimental or Placebo solution until the trial was completed.</p></sec><sec><title>Oral malodor assessments</title><p>Measurements were conducted at around 9 am to evaluate morning breath odor. Subjects were instructed to abstain from eating strong-smelling foods for at least 48 hours, from using scented cosmetics for 24 hours and from drinking alcohol for 18 hours before the assessment. In addition, they were advised not to ingest any food or drink, and to omit their usual oral hygiene practice on the morning of the assessment day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Oral malodor was evaluated before rinsing (at baseline) and after using the mouthwash for 7 days.</p><sec><title>Organoleptic measurement (OM)</title><p>The OM score was measured by two trained judges after subjects closed their mouth for 3 minutes. Judges were asked to rate malodor on a 0-5 scale, where a score of 0 = represented absence of odor, 1 = barely noticeable odor, 2 = slight malodor, 3 = moderate malodor, 4 = strong malodor and 5 = severe malodor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. If two judges gave different scores a mean score was used as the representative score for the subject. The inter-examiner reliability, using Cohen's kappa test, was 0.72-0.76.</p></sec><sec><title>Gas chromatography (GC) analysis</title><p>The GC analysis was carried out using a GC8A gas chromatograph (Shimadzu Co., Kyoto, Japan), equipped with a flame photometric detector. After subjects closed their mouth for 3 minutes, the Teflon<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>tube connected to the auto-injector was gently inserted into the center of the oral cavity through the lips and teeth, while the lips remained closed. Following aspiration of 20 mL of mouth air with a syringe connected to the outlet of the auto-injector, a 10 mL sample of air was transferred to the column and chromatograph [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. A sulfur chemiluminescence detector that specifically responds to sulfur was used. VSCs were identified by characteristic retention times and were quantified via comparison of their peak area with that of dilutions of standards. Standard gases of H<sub>2</sub>S, CH<sub>3</sub>SH and (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>S were prepared with a PD-1B permeater (Gastec Co., Kanagawa, Japan). Before the assessment, the ambient air was used for a baseline calibration.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Oral status assessments</title><sec><title>Plaque index (PI) and Gingival index (GI)</title><p>The clinical assessments of PI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] and GI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] were performed on the four sites (buccal, lingual, mesial and distal) of the six key teeth (FDI tooth number; 16, 12, 24, 36, 32, 44) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Each of the sites is given a score from 0-3 depending on the severity of the periodontal or gingival condition. All measurements were performed by the same examiner, who was blind to which mouthwash was used.</p></sec><sec><title>Tongue coating index (TCI)</title><p>The original index was proposed by Winkel and used by G&#x000f3;mez [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. The index was modified slightly by dividing, the dorsum of the tongue, into nine sections. The dorsum of the tongue is firstly divided into three parts: a posterior, a middle and an anterior part. Sub division is then made with middle and two lateral areas for each of the posterior, middle and anterior thirds of the tongue. Presence of tongue coating is recorded for each of these sections, provided the coating is covering more than 1/3 of each section. The tongue coating in each of the nine sites was scored: 0 = no coating; 1 = light coating; and 2 = thick coating. The "light" category was a thin tongue coating with the papillae clearly visible; and the "thick" category was assigned when a dense coating totally obscured the papillae and they were not visible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. The tongue coating value was obtained by the addition of all nine scores, giving a range 0-18. The scores were measured by one trained examiner.</p></sec><sec><title>Tongue discoloration index (TDI)</title><p>In the nine sites of the tongue, each site was scored: 0 = no discoloration; 1 = light discoloration; and 2 = severe discoloration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. The tongue discoloration value was obtained by the addition of all nine scores, range 0-18. The scores were measured by one trained examiner.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Microbiological study</title><p>The microbiological samples were collected and processed according to a strict protocol within a commercial laboratory (BML Inc.: Dental Laboratory, Saitama, Japan).

Primary probes and Invader oligos were designed with the Invader technology creator (Third Wave Technologies, Madison, WI, USA) and were based on sequences in the amplified regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Template DNA was added to a 15-&#x003bc;l reaction mixture containing primers for each species, 50 &#x003bc;M deoxynucleotide triphosphate, 700 nM primary probe, 70 nM Invader oligo, 2.5 U PCR enzyme (AmpliTaq Stoffel fragment, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA), and Invader core reagent kit (Cleavase XI Invader core reagent kit, genomic DNA, TWT), which consisted of fluorescence resonance energy transfer mix and enzyme/MgCl<sub>2 </sub>solution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The reaction mixture was preheated at 95&#x000b0;C for 2 min, and a two-step PCR reaction was carried out for 35 cycles (95&#x000b0;C for 1 sec, 63&#x000b0;C for 1 min) in the real-time PCR system (LightCycler 480, Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland). The fluorescence values of carboxyfluorescein (FAM) (wavelength/bandwidth: excitation, 485/20 nm; emission, 530/25 nm) were measured at the end of the incubation/extension step at 63&#x000b0;C for each cycle.</p><p>The limit of detection of the m-Invader PLUS was determined for each species with dilutions of bacterial DNA.

Means and standard deviations of the clinical indices were calculated, following which the oral examination scores between the two mouthwashes were compared by the Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic>-test. The differences of the oral examination scores between, before and after rinsing at baseline and after 7 days use of the mouthwash were analyzed with the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The concentrations of VSCs were log transformed before statistical analysis to make VSCs values approximate normal distribution. Therefore the log transformed concentrations of the VSCs between the two mouthwashes were compared by independent Student's t-test, and those between before and after rinsing at baseline and after 7 days were analyzed with paired t-test. Bacterial counts were log transformed before statistical analysis. Because the detection threshold for this method was 10 copies of bacterial DNA per reaction, we change the bacterial number of not-detected samples to the detection threshold, 10 copies and were log transformed. The mean number counts were calculated using the data of 15 subjects. Data were analyzed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with adjustment for PI, TCI and volume of resting saliva as previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] had reported a positive association between these factors and bacterial counts.</p><p>For all the analyses, a 5% significance level was used to reject the Null Hypothesis.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethical approval and registration</title><p>The Ethical Committee for Human Research at Tokyo Medical and Dental University approved this clinical study (No.238).

The results of this study demonstrate that rinsing with a mouthwash containing ClO<sub>2</sub>, used over a 7-day period, was effective in reducing morning oral malodor, plaque, tongue coating accumulation and the counts of <italic>Fusobacterium nucleatum </italic>in saliva in healthy subjects.</p><p>Chlorine dioxide (ClO<sub>2</sub>) is a stable free radical. It is readily soluble in water forming a light clear yellow-colored solution in which it can remain intact for considerable periods of time. Oral rinses containing ClO<sub>2 </sub>are now utilized in dental practices as a topical antiseptic for the oral cavity or for dentures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Previous studies have suggested that ClO<sub>2 </sub>and ClO<sub>2</sub><sup>- </sup>are chemically reactive oxidants with powerful reducing capacity on VSCs. Lynch et al. reported that reaction of L-cystein, a thiol compound which contribute substantially towards oral malodor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], with ClO<sub>2</sub><sup>. </sup>and/or ClO<sub>2</sub><sup>.-</sup>, which contained 0.10% (w/v) ClO<sub>2 </sub>(the same as the experimental mouthwash used in this study), yielded the disulfide cystine as a major product. The processes for the oxidation of thiols through the consecutive, two-step reaction sequence involving ClO<sub>2</sub><sup>. </sup>and/or ClO<sub>2</sub><sup>.- </sup>are shown as the following equations: (1) RSH (e.g. CH<sub>3</sub>SH) + ClO<sub>2</sub><sup>. </sup>&#x02192; RS<sup>. </sup>+ ClO<sub>2</sub><sup>.-</sup>+ H<sup>+</sup>; (2) 2RS<sup>. </sup>&#x02192; RSSR (e.g. CH<sub>3</sub>SSCH<sub>3</sub>); (3) 4RSH + ClO<sub>2</sub><sup>.- </sup>&#x02192; 2RSSR + Cl<sup>- </sup>+ 2H<sub>2</sub>O [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Grootveld et al. reported that the oral rinse containing ClO<sub>2 </sub>suppressed saliva numbers of <italic>Streptococcus mutans </italic>and lactobacilli <italic>in vivo</italic>, observed reflecting the bacterocidal action of oxohalogen oxidants present [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Though a few subjects reported a problem of a chloric smell, chlorite anion is powerfully bactericidal to malodorous microorganisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Chlorine dioxide penetrates the bacterial cells and reacts with vital amino acids in the cytoplasm to kill the organism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. It is reported to exert its bactericidal effects by fixing cellular membrane proteins as a result of its oxidizing potential in a similar manner to oxidizing agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].</p><p>Several methods have been developed to identify these microorganisms, many of which are polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based bacterial detection systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Most of the reported PCR-based diagnostic systems are qualitative analysis methods and are therefore unsuitable for the accurate evaluation of bacteria causing oral malodor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. A real-time PCR assay has been developed for the quantitative detection of DNA copy numbers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. In this study we used a newly developed Invader PLUS technology. This is a sensitive, rapid method for detection and quantification of nucleic acid. While the original technology is based on the amplification by PCR of the target sequence followed by its detection using the Invader technology, the current modification allows simultaneous PCR amplification and Invader reaction. This allows simpler design and faster results. This technology has been applied for the quantification of periodontitis-related bacteria; <italic>F.n.; P.g.; T.f</italic>., and <italic>T.d</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><p>VSCs have been shown to result from the bacterial putrefaction of proteins with sulfur-containing amino acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. These proteins are derived from tongue epithelial cells and white blood cell debris [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Bacteria such as <italic>P g., F.n., T.f., T.d</italic>., and several species of other oral bacteria associated with gingivitis and/or periodontitis are known to produce large amounts of VSCs, which are malodorous. Periodontal disease causes high concentrations of VSCs in mouth air. The concentrations of CH<sub>3</sub>SH are significantly higher in patients with periodontal disease than those in orally healthy individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Although the current study was conducted with orally healthy subjects, the results suggest that a mouthwash containing ClO<sub>2 </sub>might reduce bacterial load (as seen in <italic>F.n</italic>. reduction) and lower oral malodor in patients with periodontal disease.</p><p><italic>F.n</italic>. produces both H<sub>2</sub>S and CH<sub>3</sub>SH from the saliva, dorsum of the tongue and sub-gingival plaque [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. <italic>F.n</italic>. is considered a 'bridge-organism' that facilitates colonization of other periodontal malodorous bacteria especially <italic>T.f</italic>. by coaggregation-mediated mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Moreover it was reported that <italic>F.n </italic>was an important bacterium in the development of complex dental plaque biofilms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Therefore the results of this study suggested that the reducing effects on morning oral malodor, plaque and tongue coating accumulation, was partially caused by reducing the counts of <italic>F. n</italic>. In this study, however, we were unable to find a statistically significant reduction of <italic>P.g., T.f</italic>. and <italic>T.d</italic>. bacterial load using the ClO<sub>2 </sub>mouthwash. Though we found a significant effect on plaque accumulation using the ClO<sub>2 </sub>mouthwash over a 7-day period, this was not translated into a significant inhibitory effect on gingivitis. Previous reports showed that the rinsing by CIO<sub>2 </sub>mouthwash reduced salivary bacteria such as <italic>Streptococcus mutans </italic>and <italic>lactobacilli </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. However there is no report about periodontitis-related bacteria. In this study, we demonstrated that 7-day rinsing by CIO<sub>2 </sub>mouthwash reduced oral malodor and only <italic>F.n</italic>. counts in saliva. The prevalence of <italic>F.n</italic>. was highest in saliva and it had shown a high capability of producing VSCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. On the other hand, the prevalence of the periodontal disease-associated bacteria such as <italic>P.g</italic>. and <italic>T.d</italic>. were lower than <italic>F.n</italic>. in saliva of these healthy subjects. Kurata et al. reported that the prevalence of <italic>P.g</italic>., <italic>T.f</italic>. and <italic>T.d</italic>. in saliva was related to periodontal health status and VSC levels in mouth air in patients with periodontal disease, however the prevalence of these bacteria was low in patients without periodontal disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. We need therefore to examine the long-term effects of ClO<sub>2</sub>, on periodontal diseases and microbiological activities, and use a larger sample size in future research.</p><p>The finding that there was no difference in the level of tongue coating between the experimental and placebo mouthwash may relate to the mechanism of using both mouthwashes in a 'gargling' fashion. For example, Hakuta et al. reported that 'gargling' with water everyday reduced the tongue coating of the elderly subjects in her study of oral function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>].</p><p>Frascella tested the effectiveness of a ClO<sub>2</sub>-containing mouthwash at different points of time for a total of 96 hours after rinsing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The results showed a significant improvement in OM scores and VSC levels measured by a portable sulfide monitor when the tested mouthwash was compared to a water control. The mean VSC concentration in the test group maintained its effective level at 8 hours after rinsing. In the present study, the interval from the last rinsing (before sleeping) with the experimental mouthwash to the assessment of subjects oral malodor was an average 8.80 (range 6 to 11) hours. We found that rinsing with ClO<sub>2 </sub>dramatically reduced the concentrations of all three kinds of VSCs, on the morning of the assessment day. However after the one week washout period, the VSCs level returned to those at the baseline. It is suggested that residual ClO<sub>2 </sub>remaining in the saliva or oral cavity may have reduced VSC level for at least about 9 hours. Further research should define the maximum effective time on VSC reduction and that trials should be conducted over longer time periods, 2-4 weeks or longer.</p><p>Recently, many over-the-counter mouthwashes have been used in the treatment of oral malodor. Some of these products merely mask malodor. The optimal mouthwash to treat oral malodor would be an antiseptic agent with proven long-lasting efficacy for reduction of OM and VSC concentrations, with no or few side effects. Chlorhexidine-containing mouthwashes inhibit formation of VSCs and are effective oral antiseptics with antiplaque and antigingivitis effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Although CHX is considered the most effective oral antiseptic agent, G&#x000fc;rgan et al reported using 0.2% alcohol-free CHX mouthrinse for 1 week caused more irritation to oral mucosa, greater burning sensation, and increased altered taste perception compared to the placebo rinse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Listerine<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>(Johnson and Johnson, New Jersey, USA), a mouthwash containing essential oils, may also have antiplaque and antigingivitis activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. However, its high alcohol concentration reduces taste sensation and can cause oral pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. Zinc ions inhibit oral malodor but again had a taste problem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. Triclosan and cetylpyridium chloride (CPC) are antimicrobial agents widely used as antiseptic agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. However, their clinical reduction of VSCs is questionable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>].</p><p>ClO<sub>2 </sub>is used widely in various fields for its safe and high antibacterial action [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Sodium chlorite (NaClO<sub>2</sub>), equivalent to ClO<sub>2</sub>, the traditional ingredient in almost all oxygen supplementation today, is a non-toxic substance approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as an antimicrobial agent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. We found ClO<sub>2 </sub>not only to be effective at reducing oral malodor, but also none of the volunteers complained about tongue stimulation or discoloring with the 0.10% ClO<sub>2 </sub>(0.16% NaClO<sub>2</sub>) mouthwash. For some subjects, the taste and smell of this mouthwash were disagreeable. This may be resolved in new formulations which masks these problems.</p><p>Kimoto et al investigated the antibacterial effects of a mouthwash containing ClO<sub>2 </sub>and it's cytotoxicity on human oral cells, for the purpose of using ClO<sub>2 </sub>as a bactericidal agent for natural teeth, dental implants and generally within the oral cavity. Their results suggest that the mouthwash containing ClO<sub>2 </sub>is harmless for human cells and possible to use as a bactericidal agent for dental implants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. A proliferation of oral bacteria during sleep is responsible for the release of offending gases, most of which are VSCs. This is often described as "morning bad breath" and occurs even in healthy people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. A substantial proportion of healthy people complain of this form of oral malodor. Healthy individuals who suffer from bad breath are likely to use mouthwashes containing several masking or antimicrobial agents. Therefore, recent papers have pointed out the relevance of comparative studies to verify the efficacy of the mouthwashes on "morning bad breath" in healthy subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. Most former mouthwash studies used healthy subjects with no complaints about oral malodor, often lacked an adequate control and were evaluated only over a short-term effect of the agent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. Our study also investigated only the short-term effects of the mouthwash in healthy subjects. It is not known therefore whether the same results would be obtained from patients presenting with halitosis as a clinical problem. Future research is needed to examine long-term effects, as well as effects on periodontal diseases and plaque accumulation in a well-defined sample of halitosis patients. It is also recognized that comparative efficacy studies need to be performed against the known effective mouthwashes containing CHX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Additional research should also be conducted in broader population samples, including females. Nonetheless, in this explorative study, the OM score was improved and VSCs concentrations were significantly reduced using the ClO<sub>2 </sub>mouthwash. Therefore, the mouthwash clearly demonstrated an anti-malodor effect on morning breath, potentially without any measurable side effects in healthy subjects.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results showed that a mouthwash containing ClO<sub>2 </sub>improved morning bad breath measured with the OM and reduced the concentrations of H<sub>2</sub>S, CH<sub>3</sub>SH and (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>S measured by gas chromatography in healthy subjects. Moreover ClO<sub>2 </sub>mouthwash used over a 7-day period was effective in reducing plaque, tongue coating accumulation and the counts of <italic>Fusobacterium nucleatum </italic>in saliva. However, future studies are needed to examine more long-term effects of the mouthwash in halitosis patients and broader population samples.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no conflict of interests.
