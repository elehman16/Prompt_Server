Differences in disease risk between cigarettes and snus have led some public health scientists to believe that if smokers completely switched to snus, then reduced tobacco-related mortality and morbidity would likely ensue.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1&#x02013;5</xref> For example, the significant reduction in smoking among Swedish men leading to reductions in lung cancer, cardiovascular and all causes mortality, compared to other European Union countries,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> has been attributed to substitution of cigarettes with snus. Smokers who switch to snus appear to have similar risks for cancer and cardiovascular disease as those who quit tobacco.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><p>Furthermore, several cross-sectional survey studies conducted in Scandinavia<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9&#x02013;11</xref> and the USA<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> show that smokers who have ever used or used snus or snuff daily have a higher probability of quitting smoking than non-snus or non-snuff users. Survey studies conducted in Scandinavia<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> and USA<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> also show that snus or snuff, compared to medicinal nicotine, is more frequently used and/or leads to greater smoking cessation success, particularly among men.</p><p>Cross-sectional studies, however, do not distinguish whether or not the findings reflect differences in the characteristics of the population who use snus to quit smoking or the effects of the products themselves. A randomised clinical trial would help determine if snus compared to medicinal nicotine leads to higher rates of stopping smoking as a result of complete switching or a greater reduction in smoking and consequent reduction in exposure to harmful constituents. Besides a small pilot study that we conducted,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> no such clinical trial has been reported in the literature.</p><p>The primary goal of this study was to compare snus versus nicotine gum on the extent to which smokers can completely switch to these products, the pattern of product use and effects on biomarkers of exposure. The secondary goals were to compare the effects of both products on withdrawal symptom relief, product evaluation and adverse events.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Participant recruitment</title><p>Cigarette smokers interested in completely switching to snus or nicotine gum were recruited from Minneapolis/St Paul, Minnesota, and Eugene, Oregon, between May 2010 and May 2013, using internet and local media advertisements. Participants were followed through June 2014. Interested smokers who telephoned the research clinics were briefly informed about the study and screened for eligibility. Eligibility criteria included: (1) 18&#x02013;70&#x02005;years old; (2) smoking at least 10 cigarettes daily for the past year, (3) in good physical and mental health (no unstable or untreated medical or psychiatric condition); (4) no contraindications for medicinal nicotine; (5) no regular use of other nicotine or tobacco products; and (6) if female, not pregnant or nursing. Eligible participants attended the research clinic for an orientation visit, provided informed consent and engaged in more thorough screening, including assessment of their medical and tobacco use history, and nicotine dependence, using the Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> and pregnancy testing. This study was approved by each site's Institutional Review Board, and a Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) met annually to monitor study progress and adverse events.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Products</title><p>The oral tobacco product chosen was Camel snus (Winterchill and Robust, 2.5 and 2.6&#x02005;mg nicotine/pouch, respectively, distributed by Reynolds American Inc). These snus products were chosen because of the higher levels of unprotonated nicotine in them compared to other US manufactured snus products and prior research showing that suppression of smoking is greater with oral non-combusted products with higher nicotine levels.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Participants who experienced adverse effects from these doses were provided Frost or Mellow (1.5 and 1.3&#x02005;mg nicotine/pouch, respectively). A Swedish snus product with even higher levels of nicotine may have been preferable to compare with the Swedish experience. However, our prior preference study showed that no smoker chose the Swedish snus (General Snus).<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Nicotine gum (4&#x02005;mg Nicorette distributed by GlaxoSmithKline) was chosen as the medicinal nicotine product, and participants who experienced adverse effects were down-titrated to 2&#x02005;mg nicotine gum.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Study design</title><p>Participants were informed that the study examined the effects of snus versus nicotine gum on smoking behaviour and potential health effects. During an initial 1-week baseline data collection, participants reported the number of cigarettes and symptoms associated with withdrawal (Minnesota Nicotine Withdrawal Scale, MNWS<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>
<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) using an Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system at the end of each day. Other baseline measures were collected at the clinic visit (see below).</p><p>After the baseline period, participants were randomised to one of the two treatment conditions for 12&#x02005;weeks. Randomisation lists (separate for each site) used block sizes of 10. In both conditions, participants were encouraged to use only the assigned product and at least 6&#x02013;8 pieces a day for about 30&#x02005;min each or optimally every 1&#x02013;2&#x02005;h, and more if necessary. Per instructions described for nicotine gum, all participants (regardless of randomisation group) were advised to reduce consumption by half during weeks 7&#x02013;9 and three-quarters between weeks 10&#x02013;12 to minimise the risk of persistent use or withdrawal from the products when they were no longer provided. Although any non-assigned tobacco or medicinal product use was discouraged, accurate self-report was stressed.</p><p>After product assignment, participants returned to the clinic weekly for 2&#x02005;weeks and bi-weekly for the remaining 10&#x02005;weeks. At the clinic visits, participants were asked to return all unused product (with the amount used and returned logged in our records) and new products were dispensed, outcome measures collected and brief 10&#x02005;min standardised behavioural and compliance counselling was provided. The topics covered in the session were based on the <italic>Clearing the Air</italic> treatment manual<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> and provided to each participant. Trained counsellors were given a worksheet that described the topics to be covered for each session. Total number of clinic visits was 8 with one phone call at week 10. Follow-up sessions occurred at 13 and 26&#x02005;weeks from the onset of treatment, with two follow-up calls at weeks 19 and 39 (not included in the analysis). Participants were reimbursed a total of $360 for visit attendance and blood draws.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Measures</title><p>Throughout treatment, participants reported product use and any cigarettes smoked on a daily basis using the IVR system. Other measures collected at the baseline and treatment clinic visits included the past week's MNWS, adverse events, vitals and alveolar carbon monoxide (CO).

There was a statistically significant difference by site (p=0.021), with those participants in Minnesota experiencing lower withdrawal. In addition, craving significantly decreased over time (p&#x0003c;0.0001), though it did not differ significantly by product or site.</p><p>For the product Satisfaction and Psychological Reward scales, significant study week (p&#x0003c;0.0001 for both scales), product (p&#x0003c;0.0001 and p=0.009, respectively) and product by study week effects (p=0.001 and p=0.005, respectively), were observed. Usual brand cigarettes were more satisfying and psychologically rewarding than either of the products (p&#x0003c;0.0001 both products and scales, respectively), and those assigned to nicotine gum reported greater satisfaction and psychological reward than snus users. Site differences were also observed (p&#x02264;0.0001), with those users in Minnesota reporting higher scale scores. Likewise, for Sensation in Mouth, study week (p&#x0003c;0.0001), product (p&#x0003c;0.0001) and product by study week (p&#x0003c;0.0001), effects were statistically significant, though site was not. Gum users reported higher scores on this scale than snus users, and usual brand cigarettes were rated lower than either product (p&#x0003c;0.0001 and p=0.007, respectively), indicating that mouth sensation may not be as highly associated with cigarette smoking. Although no product effects were found for Aversion, study week effects (p&#x0003c;0.0001) showed significantly higher scores for the study products compared to usual brand cigarettes and a significant site effect (p=0.003), with those in Minnesota reporting greater aversion to the products.</p><p>The adverse events that were experienced were typical of those found with nicotine gum, and only a few differences were observed between the two study products (see online supplemental table). It appears that gum and snus led to experiences of dry mouth, excessive salivation, dizziness, light-headedness (snus users), nausea, stomach aches, sore jaw, belching, hiccups, sore throat, mouth sores and, interestingly, a reduction in anxiety, and for snus users, a reduction in reported headaches. Significant differences were observed between snus and nicotine gum for excessive salivation (p&#x0003c;0.0001), headaches (p=0.022) and mouth sores (p=0.020); more snus users experienced excessive salivation and mouth sores but fewer experienced headaches compared to nicotine gum users.</p></sec><sec id="s3e"><title>Cigarette and product use at the end of treatment and follow-up</title><p>In the intent-to-treat analysis, at the end of the treatment phase (week 12), no significant differences were observed for 7-day cigarette avoidance between nicotine gum and snus (24.6% vs 21.9%, respectively) or for continuous cigarette avoidance from week 2 to end of treatment (9.7% vs 5.6%, respectively). Similarly, at week 26, no significant differences between nicotine gum and snus were observed for 7-day cigarette avoidance (15.4% vs 11.2%, respectively) and continuous cigarette avoidance (5.1% vs 2.6%, respectively), or for point prevalence (9.7% vs 5.6%, respectively) and continuous (3.6% vs 2.0%, respectively) avoidance of all nicotine products. There were no statistically significant differences by site for any of these outcomes.</p><p>With regard to continued product use, among those assigned to nicotine gum and participated at the 26&#x02005;week follow-up, approximately 6.0% self-reported gum use only and 6.8% reported gum and cigarettes use. The rates were 14.9% and 11.6%, respectively, for snus use among those assigned to snus. The distribution of these rates was significantly different between snus and gum (p=0.006), with higher rates of continued snus use among those assigned to this product.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>The results showed no significant differences between those assigned to medicinal nicotine vs snus in amount of product use, levels of cotinine attained, the extent to which the product substituted for smoking and rates of avoidance of cigarettes or any nicotine containing products. Furthermore, there were no differences in suppression of withdrawal from cigarettes. However, the nicotine gum users reported more satisfaction and psychological reward from the product, experienced less carcinogen exposure during the time of peak use, and had fewer participants who continued product use compared to the snus users. These findings suggest that snus performs no better than nicotine gum as a cigarette substitute, has less appeal, is more toxic and is associated with higher rates of prolonged use.</p><p>The results from the current study replicate our prior pilot study, which showed that snus, at doses similar to nicotine gum, is no better than medicinal nicotine in the extent to which complete substitution occurred.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Similar to the present study, Kotlyar <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> showed higher levels of urinary total NNAL when smokers substituted snus compared to medicinal nicotine for cigarettes. However, while the prior study showed a significant reduction in total NNAL when switching to snus, in the current study, no reduction was observed. This difference across studies may be attributed to the roughly threefold increase in NNK/pouch between 2010 and 2012&#x02013;2013 (from 0.15 to 0.49&#x02005;&#x000b5;g/pouch). With regard to NNN, in the Kotlyar <italic>et al</italic>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> study no significant reduction was found when smokers switched to snus, which was similar to our findings from the present study. Furthermore, significant reductions in total NNN were observed with nicotine gum use. However, unlike the Kotlyar study, which observed no group differences, the present study observed greater reductions in total NNN in nicotine gum users, potentially due to the analysis of a subset of the participants in the current study or a larger sample size.</p><p>Contrary to the results from survey studies in Scandinavian countries, in this study, snus was associated with less positive subjective responses compared to medicinal nicotine. This finding is concordant with other North American clinical and survey studies showing medicinal nicotine products being preferred over oral tobacco products such as snus or dissolvable tobacco products.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29&#x02013;31</xref> On the other hand, in a brief clinical study conducted in New Zealand, heavy smokers reported greater preference for Zonnic (an oral nicotine sachet of 4&#x02005;mg of nicotine bound to beads) and Swedish snus, over nicotine gum, for use in quitting or reducing cigarettes.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></p><p>Unlike survey studies in Scandinavian countries, which have demonstrated high interest in snus among men, US surveys show relatively less interest in snus. In one survey, although 29.9% of male smokers reported ever trying snus, only 4.2% reported current use. Current use was negligible in former smokers. The authors concluded that the low rate of adoption of snus in the US market signifies that this product is unlikely to be a significant harm reduction agent or to lead to public health harm.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Other survey studies have also demonstrated low interest in the use of snus in the USA.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>
<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> Perhaps the lack of US interest in snus as a substitute for cigarettes is why recruitment for this study took longer than anticipated.</p><p>The results also show that a substantial number of smokers motivated to switch completely to an alternative product become dual users during the treatment period. This finding could be related to the low levels of free nicotine in our chosen product, the slower rate of absorption relative to cigarettes and the lack of the sensory aspects of smoking, attributes which lead to being a poor substitute for cigarettes. Human laboratory and short-term product cross-over studies have demonstrated that although medicinal nicotine and snus sold in the US suppressed cigarette abstinence-induced craving, usual brand cigarettes led to substantially greater suppression of craving. Furthermore, acceptability of these products was substantially lower than usual brand cigarettes and, in one study, was more in line with the sham smoking condition, leading the authors to conclude that these products are unlikely to completely substitute for cigarettes.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>
<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> In one study, even when smokers were offered a Swedish snus product with a high nicotine dose, no one chose this product for use during smoking cessation after sampling it.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p><p>The trend toward more favourable responses to nicotine gum points to two observations. First, the use of 4&#x02005;mg medicinal nicotine as a substitute for cigarette smoking and a harm reduction agent should be considered. More recently, an application for Swedish snus as a modified risk tobacco product has been submitted (Docket ID: FDA-2014-N-1051), yet medicinal nicotine gum more clearly results in reduced exposures to toxicants. Second, other minor tobacco alkaloids have been considered as potentially contributing to the reinforcing effects of tobacco products,<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>
<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> the results from this study suggest that these constituents may or may not play an important role in tobacco self-administration or response. That is, the amount of self-administration was similar across products (perhaps due to instructions for amount of use), but sustained use was higher with snus. Rat studies tend to show smokeless tobacco extracts do not enhance nicotine effects compared to similar doses of nicotine alone.<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></p><p>There are several limitations to this study: (1) potential lack of generalisability to a general population of smokers because we examined smokers interested in trying an alternative product in a clinic setting, (2) testing only one snus product, which has lower levels of nicotine and higher TSNA than some of the Swedish snus products, (3) encouragement to use a specified number of pieces of each of the products; (4) implementation of a tapering period, which might have constrained substitution behaviour; and (5) not examining the data by gender (eg, men as opposed to women may respond more positively to snus).</p><p>Nonetheless, these results suggest that, in the USA, snus may not succeed in substituting for cigarettes because of lack of interest and appeal, even when compared to medicinal nicotine. The differences in responses to snus-like products across different countries and even different sites emphasise the need to take into account the cultural context in which a product is being marketed and used. Because medicinal nicotine performed no differently or even better on some outcome variables than the snus that we tested, and had substantially less carcinogen exposure, even when this snus product alone is compared to dual nicotine gum and cigarette users, it is prudent to recommend medicinal nicotine over snus, particularly in the USA, for those who want to reduce or completely switch to another product.
