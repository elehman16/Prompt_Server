[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] Transmission of Tinea cruris may occur via physical contact with arthroconidia which are generated from dermatophyte filaments. Arthroconidia can survive for years embedded in scales of hair and skin, recurrent outbreaks of infection may occur particularly in individuals with a compromised immune system. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] In the initiation and propagation of Tinea cruris, environmental factors like warm and humid climate are also important and these cause increased outbreak of Tinea cruris infection in monsoon months in India. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] In India, Tinea cruris infection is caused mainly by <italic>Trichophyton rubrum</italic> whereas in Western countries, <italic>Epidermophyton floccosum</italic> is the commonest dermatophyte. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>]
</p><p>Till the 1940s, standard topical antifungal therapy was limited to Whitfield's ointment, Castellani's paint and Gentian violet. But today there are various modern topical antimycotics capable of eradicating human dermatomycoses.</p><p>Several classes of antifungal agents available are imidazoles, triazoles and allylamines. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] Other topical antimycotics includes Ciclopirox olamine, Selenium sulphide and Tolnaftate. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>]
</p><p>Terbinafine is an allylamine which has a broad spectrum of antifungal activity. It interferes specially with fungal sterol biosynthesis at an early stage. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] Butenafine is the only benzylamine class of antifungal agent with a structure and mode of action similar to allylamines. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] Like the allylamines, Butenafine inhibits squalene epoxidation, blocking the biosynthesis of ergosterol, an essential lipid component of fungal cell membrane. The antifungal activity of both allylamine and benzylamine results from ergosterol deficiency and intracellular accumulation of squalene, which interferes with cell membrane function and synthesis. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>]
</p><p>The dermatophytes responsible for Tinea cruris have been shown to be susceptible to both Terbinafine and Butenafine. Because Tinea cruris is a common presentation in dermatology clinics which often recurs and relapses, we undertook this trial using Terbinafine 1% and Butenafine 1% in cream base to compare their efficacy in treatment of Tinea cruris.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>The study was conducted on 76 male patients between 18 and 61 years of age who visited dermatology outdoor during a period of 1 year from June 2005 to May 2006. To qualify for enrollment, the subjects were required to have at least three signs and symptoms of Tinea cruris namely pruritus (symptom); polycyclic lesions, erythema, scaling, macerations, papules and vesiculation (signs). Patients with other disorders such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus and obesity were excluded from the study.</p><p>The patients were divided into two groups as group with Regimen I (n 37) and group with Regimen II (n 39). None of the patients had received any previous therapy. Positive result on potassium hydroxide (KOH) examination for fungal elements was taken as the criteria for enrollment. Mycological culture for a fungal pathogen was also done.</p><p>Regimen I (n 37) patients were considered for Terbinafine cream (1%) and Regimen II (n 39) were considered for Butenafine (1%) cream. Patients were advised to apply the medication after bath to the affected sites and also to the areas surrounding the affected sites, once daily for 2 weeks. The patients were evaluated at the end of 7 days, 14 days (i.e. at the end of treatment period) and 42 days (i.e. at the end of follow-up period). Clinical evaluation and KOH examination were done to detect the presence of fungal elements. Clinical evaluation encompassed improvement of the appearance of the lesions and decreased severity of symptoms and signs of Tinea cruris (pruritus, erythema scaling, etc.)</p><p>The following variables were examined as primary efficacy end points: mycological cure (negative KOH and culture), overall cure (mycological cure and investigator's clinical assessment of &#x0201c;cleared&#x0201d; lesions) and effective treatment (mycological cure and investigator's clinical assessment of lesions as &#x0201c;cleared&#x0201d; or "excellent").Secondary efficacy end points were effective clinical response, absence of total symptom and signs and patient's perception of improvement.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>In this study consisting of 76 male patients, most belonged to the age group of 30-45 years accounting for 67% of the study group. The youngest patient was 18 years and the oldest patient was 61 years. Nearly half the patients (46%) had duration of illness less than 6 months. Trichophyton rubrum was the predominant pathogen isolated (75/76, 98.68%) and one case was that of Trichophyton mentagrophytes (1/76, 1.31%).</p><p>Primary efficacy end points are shown in the <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Primary efficacy end points</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IDOJ-1-8-g001"/></table-wrap><p>Mycological cure was seen most with Regimen II (Butenafine) group than in the Regimen I (Terbinafine) group and this difference was statistically significant as early as day 7, (P &#x0003c; 0.01). This finding is comparable with other studies. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>]
</p><p>The improvement in both the study groups increased steadily in the 2-week course of therapy and the 2-week post-treatment period. At the end of 42 days, the mycological cure rates were 94.87% in the Regimen II (Butenafine) group and 62.16% in the Regimen I (Terbinafine) group. The overall cure rates were 79.49% and 62.16% in Regimen II and Regimen I groups, respectively at the end of 42-day period. The effective treatment rates after 2 weeks of post-treatment follow-up was 92.31% in Regimen II and 81.08% in Regimen I study group which were all statistically significant <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05. Treatment with Butenafine 1% cream is considered as superior to treatment with Terbinafine 1% cream in treatment of Tinea cruris.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Kanwar</surname><given-names>AJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Mamta</surname></name><name><surname>Chander</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group><person-group person-group-type="editor"><name><surname>Valia</surname><given-names>RG</given-names></name><name><surname>Valia</surname><given-names>AR</given-names></name><name><surname>Siddappa</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Superficial fungal infection</article-title><source>Textboob and Atlas of Dermatology</source><year>2001</year><edition>2nd ed</edition><publisher-loc>Bhalani Publishing House</publisher-loc><publisher-name>Mumbai India</publisher-name><fpage>215</fpage><lpage>58</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Pierard</surname><given-names>GE</given-names></name><name><surname>Arrese</surname><given-names>JE</given-names></name><name><surname>Pierard-Franchimont</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Treatment and prophylaxis of tinea infections</article-title><source>Drugs</source><year>1996</year><volume>52</volume><fpage>209</fpage><lpage>24</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">8841739</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ryder</surname><given-names>NS</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Terbinafine: mode of action and properties of the squalene epoxidase inhibition</article-title><source>Br J Dermatol</source><year>1992</year><volume>126</volume><fpage>2</fpage><lpage>7</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">1543672</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Fukushiro</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Urabe</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Kagawa</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name></person-group><person-group person-group-type="editor"><name><surname>Yamaguchi</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Kobayashi</surname><given-names>GS</given-names></name><name><surname>Takahashi</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Recent progress in antifungal therapy</article-title><source>Butenafine hydrochloride, a new antifungal agent: clinical and experimental study</source><year>1992</year><publisher-loc>Marcel Dekker</publisher-loc><publisher-name>New York</publisher-name><fpage>147</fpage><lpage>57</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Rathi</surname><given-names>SK</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Comparative efficacy of 1% terbinafine hydrochloride and 1% butenafine hydrochloride cream in the treatment of tinea cruris</article-title><source>Indian J Dermatol</source><year>2001</year><volume>46</volume><fpage>227</fpage><lpage>8</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref6"><label>6</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Syed</surname><given-names>TA</given-names></name><name><surname>Hadi</surname><given-names>SM</given-names></name><name><surname>Qreshi</surname><given-names>ZA</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Butenafine 1% versus terbinafine 1% in cream for the treatment of tinea pedis.A placebo-controlled, double blind, comparative study</article-title><source>Clinical Drug Investigation</source><year>2000</year><volume>19</volume><fpage>393</fpage><lpage>97</lpage></element-citation></ref></ref-list></back></article>
