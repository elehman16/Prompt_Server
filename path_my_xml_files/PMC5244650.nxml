According to the annual cancer registry report of Iran, in the year 2009, gastric cancer is more incident in the northern part of Iran. The age-standardized incidence rate of this cancer is highest in Ardebil and Mazandaran Provinces, and in Mazandaran (near the Caspian Sea), it is the first common malignancy in males and the fourth common cancer in females. Annually, 420 new cases of gastric cancer are registered in this province.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] This cancer is often diagnosed in advanced stages and its most common symptoms include abdominal pain, pain from metastatic disease sites, dysphagia and other eating-related symptoms, abdominal fullness, weight loss, and nausea and vomiting (N/V).[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] There are different approaches for the treatment of these patients, such as surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and combination therapy, which are selected according to the patients' age and physical status and the stage of cancer.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Chemotherapy has some specific complications; one of the most distressing problems is N/V. These symptoms may lead to a significant deterioration in patient&#x02019;s quality of life (QOL)[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and other severe consequences, such as malnutrition, electrolyte imbalance, dehydration, and weight loss. In patients receiving chemotherapy, intense N/V may require dose reduction, treatment delay, or even permanent interruption.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] In previous studies, it has been showed that despite the wide range use of antiemetic drugs, chemotherapy-induced N/V (CINV) continues to be reported by up to 70% of adult patients receiving moderately and highly emetogenic chemotherapy agents and 58% of school and adolescent age children receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] More common antiemetic agents for CINV prophylaxis include corticosteroids, serotonin receptor antagonists (5-HT3 RAs), tachykinin NK1 RAs, and olanzapine.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Olanzapine is an atypical antipsychotic agent that blocks multiple neuronal receptors involved in the N/V pathways.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] The efficacy and safety of this agent in preventing N/V, symptoms relief, and QOL improvement have been studied in several non-Iranian studies.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] It has been investigated in previous studies that there are inter-individual differences in responses to chemotherapy, related to multiple factors such as genetic differences;[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] therefore, this research was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of olanzapine in Iranian gastric patients receiving chemotherapy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study design and participants</title><p>This clinical trial was conducted on thirty new cases of gastric cancer patients whose treatment protocol was planned on chemotherapy.

In the research of Naing <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] the mean change in slope of weight loss before versus after therapy was 0.24 (<italic>P</italic> = 0.13) indicating a trend, albeit not reaching statistical significance; in the research of Suzuki <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] it showed that olanzapine at a dose of 1.25 mg/day improved the patient&#x02019;s eating solid food; in the research of Navari,[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] weight gain had been mentioned as a common side effect of olanzapine; in the research of Navari and Brenner,[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] the combination of megestrol acetate and olanzapine had a positive effect in appetite improvement and weight gain. Considering the frequency and importance of decreased appetite and weight loss in gastric cancer patients which influence on their disease outcome and prognosis, administration of medications such as olanzapine which improves the patient&#x02019;s appetite could be an efficient treatment approach.</p><p>In our study, CINV decreased after administration of olanzapine, but there was no statistical difference between the case and control groups; in the research of Abe <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] after oral administration of olanzapine (5 mg) with triplet therapy a day prior to cisplatin administration and on days 1&#x02013;5, complete response (no vomiting and no rescue) rate for acute (0&#x02013;24 h) and delayed (24&#x02013;120 h) phases postchemotherapy was 97.5 and 95.0, respectively. In the research of Navari <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] conducted among the patients receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy, 70% of patients receiving olanzapine compared to 31% of patients receiving metoclopramide had no emesis; in the review study of Fonte <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] it was concluded that in palliative care, olanzapine could control or reduce the intensity of N/V refractory to standard antiemetics. In advanced cancer patients, N/V is common and often undertreated problem. There are several causes of N/V, including central nervous system (metastases and primary tumors which increase intracranial pressure), metabolic (hypercalcemia), medications (chemotherapy, radiotherapy, opioids), psychiatric (anxiety and depression), and gastrointestinal (bowel obstruction, gastroparesis) etiologies;[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] therefore, olanzapine can be considered as a proper drug with potentially important efficacy, mild toxicity, and reduced drug interactions with respect to other antiemetics. Furthermore, the fact that only one oral daily administration is necessary has the potential advantage of improving compliance and also the cost could thus be significantly reduced and this should put olanzapine in our research interest on antiemetics.</p><p>In the previous study performed in Babol University of Medical Sciences,[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] the results showed that the patients with breast and stomach cancer had the highest prevalence of anxiety and depression among all other cancer patients; therefore, planned interventions were recommended for these patients. In our study, olanzapine had a significant positive effect on the patients' anxiety and depression. Both anxiety and depression decreased after olanzapine administration. In the research of Brunner <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] prevention of relapse was evaluated in the patients with treatment-resistant depression taking olanzapine/fluoxetine combination (OFC). Patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) who failed to satisfactorily respond to &#x02265;2 different antidepressants for &#x02265;6 weeks within the current MDD episode were acutely treated for 6&#x02013;8 weeks, followed by stabilization (12 weeks) on OFC and resulted that time-to-relapse was significantly longer in OFC-treated patients compared with fluoxetine-treated patients.</p><p>In this research, physical health subdomain of QOL improved significantly after olanzapine administration, but other subdomains such as mental health, social relationship, and environment and also total QOL score did not change significantly; in the research of Fonte <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] it was mentioned that the QOL was superior with olanzapine in global health status, emotional functioning, and social functioning; further, in the research of Liu <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] olanzapine significantly improved global health status, emotional functioning, and social functioning. In the research of Tan <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] the QOL improved significantly in the case group versus the controls; in addition, in the studies of Navari and Brenner,[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] Pirri <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and Sanchetee,[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] it was resulted that olanzapine had positive impact on the patients' QOL. This difference in the results can be related to different instruments for QOL assessment; further, several factors can influence on QOL, such as patient&#x02019;s occupational and economic condition, polypharmacy, familial and social support, and complications associated with the process of cancer and its related treatment procedures and side effects.</p><p>Fasting and 2-h postprandial blood glucose did not change significantly after treatment (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05); also, in the research of Navari,[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] it was showed that olanzapine when used over a period of months had an association with the onset of diabetes mellitus, but these effects had not been seen with short-term use of daily doses of &#x0003c;1 week; in the research of Lipscombe <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] it was presented that hyperglycemic emergencies such as ketoacidosis were rare (1&#x02013;2 in each 1000 patients per year) in the patients receiving atypical antipsychotic drugs and were more frequent in the patients who had medical history of diabetes mellitus. In our study, no person had the history of diabetes mellitus; also, the patients were followed up only 2 months after the treatment. Cohort studies should be implemented to assess the long-term side effects of olanzapine.</p><p>In this study, olanzapine did not make any significant change in the lipid profile of the patients; in the research of Kaushal <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] serum lipids were increased after olanzapine administration. This difference in the results could be due to the sample size, genetic differences, age, and other characteristics of the study population.</p><p>The major limitations of the study are its small sample size and the short time for patients' follow-up after the treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Olanzapine in a proper dosage can be effective in the symptom relief (especially appetite improvement, prevention of weight loss, N/V prevention, and decrease in anxiety and depression) of gastric cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.</p><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>This study was supported by Babol University of Medical Sciences, Iran (Research Project Number: 2097).</p></sec><sec id="sec2-6" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec1-6"><title>AUTHOR'S CONTRIBUTION</title><p>
