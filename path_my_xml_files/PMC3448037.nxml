Participants were then randomized into an intervention (I) or control (C) group and were given either genotype-based personalized dietary advice or general dietary advice, respectively. A second survey was administered to assess the participants&#x02019; opinions of the dietary reports they received.

Direct-to-consumer (DTC) personal genetic tests claim to provide consumers with information about their genetic ancestry, ability to metabolize nutrients and drugs, and risk for developing diseases (Janssens and van Duijn <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2010</xref>). One class of genetic tests offers personalized dietary advice based on one&#x02019;s DNA to improve health (Sterling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2008</xref>). Nutrigenomics (or nutritional genomics) is the study of the relationship between genes and diet, and is used as an umbrella term for two complimentary approaches: how nutrients affect gene function and how genetic variation affects nutrient response (Cahill and El-Sohemy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2011</xref>). The latter is sometimes referred to as nutrigenetics (El-Sohemy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2007</xref>) and includes the study of how genetic variations affect food intake and eating behaviors (Eny and El-Sohemy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2010</xref>; Garcia-Bailo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2009</xref>). The DTC method of marketing facilitates the sales of genetic tests without the involvement of a healthcare professional (Norrgard <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2008</xref>). These tests are commercially available through the Internet and are largely unregulated, though significant measures are being taken to regulate this emerging market in certain jurisdictions (McGuire et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2010</xref>). The cost of the different types of genetic tests available can range from approximately $99 to over $2000 USD (Bloss et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2011a</xref>). DTC genetic testing for disease susceptibility remains controversial, with opponents arguing that the tests possess limited value due to their questionable clinical validity and utility (Burke <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2009</xref>; Eng and Sharp <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2010</xref>; Caulfield et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2010</xref>). Critics note that predicted risks will continue to change as new genetic variants are discovered, and thus any risk estimates for disease based on currently known common variants are premature (Janssens et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2011</xref>; Mihaescu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2009</xref>). Moreover, environmental factors such as diet, smoking, and physical activity can have a far greater impact on risk, but are often not considered when providing estimates of risk. There is also concern that consumers may experience anxiety if provided with the estimates of higher risk for developing certain diseases based on their genes and may seek out potentially unnecessary health interventions (McGuire and Burke <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2008</xref>). Another criticism of most DTC genetic tests is that the corresponding advice is not genuinely personalized since the lifestyle recommendations are generally the same, regardless of genotype. Despite these criticisms, proponents of DTC genetic tests argue that there is public interest in genomics and that individuals should have access to their own genetic information (Bloss et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2011a</xref>; Caulfield et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2010</xref>). In addition, some propose that direct access to genetic information may motivate consumers to adopt lifestyle behavioral changes aimed at reducing the risk of disease development (Bloss et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2011a</xref>; McBride et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2010</xref>). Studies have reported different findings of the effects of disclosure of genetic risk information on health-related behaviors (Arkadianos et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2007</xref>; Chao et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2008</xref>; Conradt et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2009</xref>; Lerman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">1997</xref>; Marteau et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2004</xref>; McBride et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2002</xref>; Vernarelli et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2010</xref>); however, only one study has investigated the impact of DTC genetic testing on behavior and reported no short-term changes in specific dietary or exercise behaviors (Bloss et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2011b</xref>). A limitation of that study is that the genetic risk scores that were given to the subjects were not specifically linked to a particular lifestyle behavior, and no personalized advice to reduce the risk of developing a health condition was provided. Importantly, there was no control group in the study. A recent survey of readers of the journal <italic>Nature</italic> shows that 27% of respondents who had their genomes analyzed changed their diet, lifestyle, or medication based on their genetic information, suggesting that genetic information could impact behavior (Maher <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2011</xref>).</p><p>For appropriate recommendations and regulations regarding DTC genetic tests to be made, the public&#x02019;s knowledge and opinions of these technologies need to be well understood. A number of studies have surveyed the awareness of and attitudes toward DTC genetic tests either among the general public or among healthcare providers (Cherkas et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2010</xref>; Goddard et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2009</xref>; Stewart-Knox et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2009</xref>; Gollust et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2011</xref>; Kolor et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2009</xref>; McGuire et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2009</xref>; Taylor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2011</xref>; Goddard et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2007</xref>). These studies report low awareness of genetic tests among the general public (13&#x02013;24%) (Cherkas et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2010</xref>; Goddard et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2009</xref>), but higher awareness among healthcare providers (42&#x02013;44%) (Goddard et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2007</xref>; Kolor et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2009</xref>). Studies have reported an interest in genetic testing among the public, with 50&#x02013;66% of subjects reporting a willingness to undergo testing (Cherkas et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2010</xref>; McGuire et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2009</xref>; Stewart-Knox et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2009</xref>). Focus group research has also been conducted to better understand the knowledge and attitudes of consumers and healthcare professionals toward nutrigenomics (Morin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2009</xref>; Weir et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2010</xref>). Most consumers in the focus groups were unfamiliar with the term nutrigenomics and did not relate the term personalized nutrition to an individual&#x02019;s genetic profile, whereas about half of healthcare professionals were aware of the term nutrigenomics (Morin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2009</xref>). After being provided with an explanation of nutrigenomics, consumers felt that a tailored diet could help reduce the risk of disease development, while healthcare professionals expressed more skepticism (Morin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2009</xref>). While these studies provide valuable insight into the public&#x02019;s perceptions of nutrigenomics and genetic testing, they have all been either observational or qualitative in design. In addition, there has been some concern that genetic information obtained from a DTC genetic test is not always understood (Leighton et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2011</xref>), and no studies have examined whether DTC genetic tests that provide personalized nutrition advice are understandable. The objectives of the present study were to conduct a randomized controlled trial to assess behavioral outcomes as well as the awareness, perceptions, and understanding of nutrigenomics and genetic testing.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design and participants</title><p>The present study is a randomized controlled trial with a 2:1 ratio of participants in the intervention versus control group.

Recruitment was carried out from May to August 2011. Participants provided informed consent by mail and then completed a baseline survey designed to assess the awareness and opinions of genetic testing and nutrigenomics using 4- and 5-point Likert scales. After the baseline survey was completed, participants were randomized to an intervention (I) or control (C) group using Random Allocation Software.</p><p>Participants were recruited from the Toronto Nutrigenomics and Health Study (TNHS, <italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1,639), which is a cross-sectional study examining the role of genetics in food intake and food selection as well as gene&#x02013;diet interactions on the biomarkers of chronic disease in young men and women between the ages of 20&#x02013;29&#x000a0;years at the time of recruitment. The TNHS cohort is multi-ethnic, with participants representing three major ethnic groups: Caucasian, East Asian, and South Asian (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Recruitment for the TNHS study was carried out at the University of Toronto from 2004 to 2010. Participants provided a blood sample, and genotyping was performed for several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) involved in nutrient response and metabolism. A subset of the TNHS cohort (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;354) was contacted by e-mail or phone to participate in the present study (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Since the recommendations in this study were based on caffeine, vitamin C, sugar, and sodium, eligible participants were those who consumed at least 100&#x000a0;mg of caffeine per day, 10% of total energy from added sugars per day, and 1,500&#x000a0;mg of sodium per day and did not take vitamin C-containing supplements. Three e-mail attempts were made, and if no response was received, one phone call was made.

A smaller proportion of participants reported knowing &#x0201c;nothing&#x0201d; about nutrigenomics (30%), with just over half reporting that they knew &#x0201c;a little bit&#x0201d; about the science (52%) (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Interest in the relationship between diet and genetics was high, with 90% of participants reporting either &#x0201c;strongly agree&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;somewhat agree&#x0201d; to the survey statement. The majority of participants (87%) also agreed that they would benefit from learning about how their genetic makeup would affect their diet. Consistent with this, 75% of participants agreed that learning about their genetic makeup would affect what they ate. The greatest motivators participants reported for undergoing genetic testing were to learn more about themselves and to encourage themselves to adopt a healthier lifestyle (86 and 83%, respectively), while 73% of participants agreed that they would take a genetic test to have their doctor monitor their health more closely. Only 7% of participants strongly agreed that they would be uncomfortable learning about their genetic makeup (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Post-intervention survey</title><p>After receiving the dietary report, a greater proportion of participants in the intervention group agreed that they understood the dietary advice they received (93% (I) vs. 78% (C); <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.009).

Although concern exists over the potential for genetic information to induce anxiety in some individuals, very few participants in the intervention group agreed that they felt uneasy learning about their genetic information. Rather, 96% of participants who received their genetic information agreed that they enjoyed learning about their genetic information and dietary recommendations. This finding suggests that providing this kind of information is not likely to induce anxiety and that young adults may embrace a new era of personalized nutrition that could emerge through the advancement of personalized genomics. However, the nature of the genetic information that was provided in this study might have been perceived as less serious than genetic information related to disease risk. Although the participants in this study had an awareness of the science of nutrigenomics, only 18% reported an awareness of DTC genetic testing while 52% reported no awareness. This finding is consistent with previous surveys of the general public conducted in the UK and US (Cherkas et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2010</xref>; Goddard et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2009</xref>; Kolor et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2009</xref>). Despite the considerable attention DTC genetic testing has received in recent years (Lynch et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2011</xref>), this finding suggests that media coverage of DTC genetic testing has not yet greatly impacted young adults.</p><p>Scientific literacy and communication of genetic information are important issues to consider when studying the societal impact of DTC genetic testing (McBride et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2010</xref>). The literacy demands and quality of informational content across DTC genetic testing Web sites have been shown to vary (Lachance et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2010</xref>), and there is concern that consumers may misinterpret or not understand DTC genetic test results (Leighton et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2011</xref>). In the present study, a greater proportion of participants in the intervention group agreed that they understood the dietary report they were given, suggesting that dietary recommendations based on genetics can be more understandable than general dietary recommendations. This implies that providing individuals with clear, personalized nutritional advice may result in greater understanding. An important strength of the present study is the use of a randomized controlled trial, which eliminates the possibility of confounding and allows for direct comparisons to be made between experimental groups.</p><p>In considering the results of this study, some limitations should be noted. In the present study, no in-person contact was made with study participants, potentially affecting the reliability of the results. However, DTC genetic testing can be completed without in-person contact, so the nature of this study closely mimics the nature of DTC genetic testing. Seventy-six percent of participants in this study were females, and this affected our ability to report any sex-specific findings. However, excluding the males did not materially alter any of the results, suggesting that there were no major differences between men and women in this population. The age of participants in the current study was between 20 and 35&#x000a0;years, so findings might not be the representative of other age groups. In addition, the participants were highly educated and previously participated in a nutrigenomics study. This could explain the high degree of reported understanding of the gene-based dietary recommendations, although participants in the control group reported less understanding of the general dietary recommendations, yet were equally educated.</p><p>This study is the first to compare the impact of genotype-based personalized dietary advice with general dietary recommendations. Dietary recommendations based on genotype were reported to be more understandable than general dietary recommendations and were also reported to be more useful. Participants reported that they would not be uncomfortable learning about their own genetic information. Consistent with this, participants in the intervention group did not express discomfort in learning about their genetics and were more likely to report enjoyment in learning about the dietary recommendations they were given, as well as a greater desire to know more about the recommendations. Direct-to-consumer genetic tests based on personalized nutrition might, therefore, be more valuable that those based solely on disease risk predictions.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was supported by a grant from the Advanced Foods and Materials Network (AFMNet).
