The procedure frequently results in dry eye symptoms, usually of short but sometimes longer duration. This study was designed to assess dry eye and ocular tolerability after LASIK in patients treated with a preservative-free lacrimal substitute (Hylabak&#x000ae;) or preserved lacrimal substitute (Systane&#x000ae;). In a single-center, investigator-masked, prospective, noninferiority, clinical study, patients undergoing LASIK surgery were randomized to receive Hylabak or Systane eye drops (one drop in each eye four times daily for 3 months). Fluorescein test scores were the primary efficacy variable and were similar on day 1 (mean 0.26 and 0.28 for Hylabak and Systane, respectively). At the final visit (day 84 &#x000b1; 3) the fluorescein scores had improved to 0.11 and 0.04, respectively. The difference was not significant and thus noninferiority was established. A trend of more rapid improvement in the Hylabak group was evident. Both treatments were well tolerated and there were no serious adverse events, discontinuations for adverse events or other safety-related reasons, and no systemic adverse events. The results suggest that Hylabak is not less effective than Systane in reducing the symptoms of dry eye after LASIK surgery.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>dry eye</kwd><kwd>laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis</kwd><kwd>hyaluronate</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) is an effective procedure used to correct refractive errors such as myopia, hyperopia, and astigmatism.

The reduction in fluorescein score from baseline to study end was statistically significant for Systane and the difference between the Hylabak and Systane groups was not. However, improvement in fluorescein staining seemed to be more rapid in the Hylabak group than in the Systane group. This trend toward a more rapid improvement in the Hylabak group compared with the Systane group was supported by other parameters. LIPCOF score and global efficacy assessment by the investigator were both reduced more at day 28 in the Hylabak group than in the Systane group.</p><p>Clinical ocular signs were essentially absent at baseline and at study end. Although ocular symptoms of dry eye (sensation of dryness, sandy or gritty sensation, and photosensitivity) were relatively infrequent at baseline, the symptoms were reduced in both groups by the end of the study.</p><p>The number of patients with an LIPCOF test score of 0 at study end was the same in Hylabak-treated and Systane-treated patients, but the scores in Hylabak-treated patients decreased more rapidly than in Systane-treated patients (percentage of patients with LIPCOF scores of 0 were 77.78% and 68%, respectively). However, the differences were small and did not reach statistical significance. Vision correction following laser surgery was similar in the two groups, as was tear film break-up time.</p><p>Global efficacy as assessed by the investigator favored Hylabak at day 28; 66.67% of Hylabak-treated patients had a rating of &#x0201c;very satisfactory&#x0201d; compared with only 28% of Systane-treated patients, a difference that was statistically significant. Similarly, at day 84, 62.96% of Hylabak-treated patients had the highest rating for efficacy compared with 44% of Systane-treated patients, although this difference did not achieve statistical significance.</p><p>Overall, the efficacy of the two treatments appears to be similar, and so far as the primary efficacy parameter is concerned, Hylabak is shown to be noninferior to Systane. There are some suggestions that Hylabak may act more rapidly than Systane, but more highly powered studies will be required to characterize the relative efficacy of the two preparations. Both treatments were well tolerated in this post-LASIK surgery population, even on the day after surgery. A number of topical treatments are used postoperatively in LASIK surgery patients (including antibiotics, anti-inflammatory drugs, and treatments for dry eye), and many of these formulations contain preservative. Several studies have demonstrated the cytotoxicity of preservatives,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-opth-7-2289">23</xref> that increases with the duration of exposure, as well as the high prevalence of ocular disorders in patients treated with preserved eye drops.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-opth-7-2289">25</xref> Since preservative-free products are now recommended for dry eye,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-opth-7-2289">24</xref> the case for using them in the healing postoperative eye seems compelling.</p><p>In conclusion, preservative-free Hylabak can be considered a welcome addition to the clinical armamentarium in dry eye for patients having recently undergone LASIK surgery and has been shown to be noninferior to Systane in this population. A preservative-free formulation is preferred for the treatment of dry eye, particularly in LASIK patients.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Editorial support was provided by
