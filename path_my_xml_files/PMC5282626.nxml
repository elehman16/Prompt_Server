The aim of the current study was to evaluate the effectiveness of an organizational level, participatory intervention on need for recovery and vitality in educational workers. It was hypothesized that the intervention would decrease need for recovery and increase vitality.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A quasi-experiment was conducted at two secondary Vocational Education and Training schools (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;356) with 12- and 24-months follow-up measurements. The intervention consisted of 1) a needs assessment phase, wherein staff and teachers developed actions for happy and healthy working under supervision of a facilitator, and 2) an implementation phase, wherein these actions were implemented by the management teams. Mixed model analysis was applied in order to assess the differences between the intervention and control group on average over time. All analyses were corrected for baseline values and several covariates.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>No effects of the intervention were found on need for recovery, vitality and most of the secondary outcomes. Two small, statistically significant effects were in unfavorable direction: the intervention group scored on average over time significantly lower on absorption (i.e. a subscale of work engagement) and organizational efficacy than the control group.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Since no beneficial effects of this intervention were found on the primary and most of the secondary outcomes, further implementation of the intervention in its current form is not eligible. We recommend that future organizational level interventions for occupational health 1) incorporate an elaborate implementation strategy, 2) are more specific in relating actions to stressors in the context, and 3) are integrated with secondary preventive, individual focused stress management interventions.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Netherlands Trial Register <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.trialregister.nl/trialreg/admin/rctview.asp?TC=3284">NTR3284</ext-link> (date registered: February 14 2012).</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Self-efficacy</kwd><kwd>Work-related stress</kwd><kwd>Well-being</kwd><kwd>Teacher</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001826</institution-id><institution>ZonMw</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>50-51400-98-019</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>Twenty percent of the EU workers consider their health to be at risk as a result of work-related stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Work-related stress is especially common among workers in education throughout both the eastern [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and western developed world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. According to a report for the Health &#x00026; Safety Executive the stress levels of teachers were more than double (42%) compared to those in other occupations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Also in the Netherlands, one in five employees suffer from work-related stress, according to a representative survey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In secondary Vocational Education and Training (VET) this would equal to 11,174 of the currently employed 52,456 workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. These workers feel emotionally drained and exhausted, especially at the end of the work day, and tired when they get up again in the morning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. For 6.9% of the workers in Dutch education, work-related stress results in being overworked or burned out, including long term sick leave [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>Work-related stress may show in workers as decreased vitality and increased need for recovery, the primary outcomes of this study. High vitality is defined as having high levels of energy and resilience, persisting in the face of difficulties, and willingness to invest effort in the work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Need for recovery is the extent to which employees experience problems in the recovery of efforts at work, and is hence indicative of early symptoms of fatigue at work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Work-related stress and reduced well-being can result from an imbalance between two types of workplace characteristics: job demands and job resources. The physical, social or organizational aspects of the job that require sustained physical or psychological effort are considered job demands, whereas job resources are those work aspects that may reduce job demands, help to achieve goals and stimulate learning and development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Over the years, job demands have intensified in the educational sector [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], while job resources remained the same. Examples of increasing job demands are the growth in accountability measures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] or the integration of students with special needs in the regular classes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Job demands and job resources have to be balanced in order to prevent stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. A job demand, such as dealing with students with special needs, will turn into a stressor over time if job resources, such as coworker support, are insufficient or lacking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The imbalance between demands and resources likely contributed to the current work-related stress prevalence.</p><p>An imbalance between job demands and job resources can be restored by primary preventive interventions, which aim to alter the source of the stress at work. However, an overview of stress management interventions showed that typical stress management interventions mostly aimed to reduce stress symptoms (i.e. secondary prevention) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Moreover, the existing interventions were targeted at the individual level and comprised stress management and coping techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], whereas a review demonstrated that the organizational level is to be preferred for implementing stress management interventions, because organizational level interventions are more likely to bring about positive changes than the individual level interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. To date, the interventions targeted at workers in education primarily aimed to enhance the individual capacity of (trainee) teachers or teaching assistants to cope with stressors in the workplace, for example via mindfulness-based stress reduction or workshops on stress management skills [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. These interventions were only partly effective in influencing work-related stress or (dimensions of) burnout [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and well-being [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p>An organizational level intervention focuses on changing stressors in the work environment, rather than changing the response of employees to stressors, and the change consists of altering some aspect of the organization (e.g. roles, structure) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. However, more is needed than just applying a primary preventive, organizational level intervention to render effective results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. First, participation of stakeholders is acknowledged as one of the most desirable intervention strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], since it leads to a feeling of joint ownership of both problems and solutions and thereby increases implementation and long term adherence. Secondly, self-efficacy beliefs of the target group are of importance for interventions targeted at changing the root-cause of stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Self-efficacy is &#x02018;the belief in one&#x02019;s own ability to master specific domains in order to produce given attainments&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. High self-efficacy would help workers to create a &#x02018;control over circumstances mindset&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. The most effective way to enhance self-efficacy is by providing a mastery experience, and it was assumed that taking part in the first phase of the intervention leads to this experience of mastery.</p><p>The aim of the current study was to evaluate the long term effectiveness of an organizational level, primary preventive, participatory intervention on need for recovery and vitality primarily. The hypothesized order of expected changes is that participating in the intervention&#x02019;s first phase (needs assessment) would result directly in participant&#x02019;s increased occupational self-efficacy (proximal effect, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Implementation of intervention activities (the intervention&#x02019;s second phase) would increase organizational efficacy and job resources (i.e. decision authority, developmental possibilities and various forms of social support) and reduce job demands (i.e. psychological demands), these are the expected intermediate effects (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). And if the balance between job demands and job resources is restored, distal effects are supposedly to be found on work-related stress constructs (i.e. need for recovery and work ability) and well-being constructs (i.e. work engagement including vitality, job satisfaction and commitment; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Model representing the logic order of expected changes</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12889_2017_4057_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>
</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>The effectiveness of the intervention was evaluated in a controlled trial with a matched control group and three measurements (T0, T1, and T2). First follow-up measurement was conducted at 12&#x000a0;months after baseline (T1) and second follow-up at 24&#x000a0;months after baseline (T2). Data were collected via a questionnaire constructed with online survey software, participants received a link to the questionnaires in their mailbox. To increase the response rate at T1 and T2, an incentive (i.e. a warehouse gift card) was sent to respondents in the intervention and control group.</p><p>This trial was registered in the Netherlands Trial Register (NTR3284). The study has been approved by TNO&#x02019;s Review Committee Participants in Experiments (RCPE), an internal ethics committee that assesses ethical aspects of working with participants in experiments. The RCPE advised positively on the study to the responsible manager since the committee perceived &#x0201c;the information to be complete, participants can join voluntarily and an informed consent is provided&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The manager decided to follow the RCPE&#x02019;s approval by permitting the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study population</title><p>Two Vocational Education and Training (VET) schools were recruited via a mailing by the sector organization, The Netherlands Association of VET Colleges. A high sickness absence rate within a certain department was the most important reason to participate in this study, according to the Executive Boards of both schools. Therefore these two departments were selected as intervention groups by the schools. According to the directors of departments that were selected as intervention groups, their concerns about the situation in their department and a notion of their employees&#x02019; diminishing happiness at work were important deliberations to participate. The researchers matched a control group within the same school to each intervention group, based on department size, mean age and type of work. In total, four departments were included. Since the intervention and control groups were situated in different locations we consider diffusion of treatment effects to be unlikely. All teaching and non-teaching (i.e. educational and administrative support staff) employees and their managers in these departments were invited to participate in the study. Employees who worked within the school, but did not teach at a secondary vocational level were excluded. Informed consent was obtained from all individual participants included in the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Matching, blinding and sample size</title><p>In each school, one department was selected as the experimental group by the participating schools, since their motive to participate in this study was to solve a problem or reach a goal within a specific department. To reduce the negative impact of selection bias, the control groups were obtained according to the &#x02018;general control&#x02019; matching principle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] on the criteria: department size (at least 150 employees), age composition of staffing, and type of work (i.e. teaching vocational students and not secondary school pupils). Blinding of the participants and intervention providers was impossible due to the participatory nature of the intervention.</p><p>The sample size calculation was based on the number of cases required to detect an effect (Cohen&#x02019;s d&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.2) on the primary outcome vitality, as measured with the 3-item subscale &#x02018;vigor&#x02019; of the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale-9 (UWES-9) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. With a power of 80%, a two-sided alpha of 5%, the required sample size is 385, which translates to 193 participants per school and 97 per group. With an expected loss to follow-up of 35% over 24&#x000a0;months, a total sample size of 600 was needed at baseline. The sample size calculation has been described extensively elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Intervention</title><p>The intervention was a participatory action approach applied at the organizational level, named the Heuristic Method (HM). HM was developed by a Dutch consultancy firm and piloted over a hundred times in public and private organizations before evaluation within this trial. The consultancy firm refined the intervention after each application, based on the lessons learned. Although the customers were almost always satisfied with the intervention&#x02019;s results, the intervention effects were never tested scientifically. The intervention consisted of two 12-month phases: (i) a phase of needs assessment, and (ii) an implementation phase.</p><p>In the needs assessment phase, staff and teachers developed actions to &#x02018;work happily and healthily&#x02019;, under supervision of an HM facilitator. The HM facilitator held expertise in organizational change processes, and he used the management&#x02019;s and workers&#x02019; knowledge, skills and perceptions to thoroughly determine what hindered and facilitated &#x02018;healthy and happy working&#x02019; in the organization. A participatory work group was formed, its members were ambassadors of the project and assisted the facilitator (e.g. by approaching interviewees or by proof reading reports).</p><p>The HM facilitator then led three iterative steps to complete the needs assessment by: (i) approximately ten one-hour interviews with typical optimistic and typical critical teachers and staff; (ii) a digital open-ended questionnaire for all workers; and (iii) group sessions with all teams, chaired by members of the participatory group. The result of each step in the intervention determined the content of the following step. Reports of each step were written by the HM facilitator and were shared with all workers, starting with the participatory work group, then the management team, and finally with all workers. The third and last report contained the facilitator&#x02019;s advice to the management team on intervention activities to be implemented in the next phase. Examples of these activities were: creating a staff room or implementing performance assessment policies (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> for an overview of all problems, goals and intervention activities).<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Results of the needs assessment and translation into action plan</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th>Main content of advisory report delivered by facilitator</th><th>Main content of action plan<sup>a</sup> constructed by management team</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="4">School A</td><td>(i) professionalize the teams;</td><td>The director, assisted by an HM consultant, translated the recommendations into an action plan with three goals, six changes and a set of quick wins.</td></tr><tr><td>(ii) professionalize the management;</td><td>Goals: i) unambiguous management control; ii) competence and professionalism in the teams, and iii) adequate facilities</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">(iii) improve the administrative support and facilities.</td><td>Changes: (i) compliance to the workload policy, (ii) structured performance reviews; (iii) a continuous dialogue on the organization of the educational programs; (iv) a leading team activities plan; (v) weekly work meetings; and (vi) personalized competence development plans.</td></tr><tr><td>Quick wins: create adequate facilities by creating a staff room at both locations; place extra walls in some classrooms; place beamers in all class rooms; improve the service by the facilitation services office.</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="4">School B</td><td>(i) create adequate and effective management control by installing a management team that is approachable, coaching, and leading;</td><td>The directors of the management team decided to integrate the facilitator&#x02019;s recommendations in the annual agreements (i.e. a management contract) she made with the Executive Board, instead of writing a separate action plan.

</p><p>In the implementation phase, the intervention activities were implemented by the management teams at both schools. HM prescribed that the management team translated the facilitator&#x02019;s advisory report into an action plan, containing an implementation plan, comprising at least a timeframe, a budget and the allocation of roles. Assistance by the HM facilitator could be provided if the management had the means to temporarily hire a consultant.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Primary outcome measures</title><p>Primary outcomes were an indicator of work-related stress (i.e. need for recovery) and well-being (i.e. vitality).</p><sec id="Sec8"><title>Need for Recovery</title><p>The concept was assessed using a subscale of the Dutch Perception and Evaluation of Work Questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The scale comprises 11 dichotomous (yes/no) statements such as &#x0201c;My job makes me feel rather exhausted at the end of a work day&#x0201d;. The need for recovery scale ranges from 0 to 100, calculated as the number of points (1&#x02009;=&#x02009;yes, 0&#x02009;=&#x02009;no) divided by the number of questions answered, multiplied by 100. Higher scores indicate a higher need for recovery, which is unfavorable. The questionnaire has proven to be valid and reliable (Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha 0.86) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In the current study, internal consistency was excellent (Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha: 0.89).</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Vitality</title><p>Vitality was assessed using the 3-item vigor subscale of the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale-9 (UWES-9; e.g. &#x0201c;At my job, I feel strong and vigorous&#x0201d;) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Response scales range from 0 (never) to 6 (always/every day). The subscale scores were obtained by calculating the mean (range 0&#x02013;6). Higher scores are indicative of more vigor. The total UWES-9 has shown good validity and reliability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], as was the case for the subscale in this study (Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha: 0.87).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Secondary outcome measures</title><p>Several categories of secondary outcomes were measured: job demands, job resources, indicators of work-related stress, well-being and efficacy. Job demands were operationalized as psychological demands and job resources as decision authority, developmental possibilities and various forms of social support. Work-related stress was indicated as reduced work ability, well-being was indicated by work engagement, job satisfaction and commitment. Two efficacy or competence measures were taken into account: occupational self-efficacy and organizational efficacy.</p><sec id="Sec11"><title>Psychological demands</title><p>A five item subscale of the Dutch version of the Job Content Questionnaire (JCQ) was used to measure psychological demands, e.g. &#x0201c;My job requires that I work very fast&#x0201d;.

The higher the scale score, the more developmental possibilities were perceived, which is favorable.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Social support</title><p>The social support of colleagues, supervisor and management was measured using a modified version of two subscales of the Dutch version of the Job Content Questionnaire (JCQ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Each of these three subscales comprises three items, such as &#x0201c;My colleagues/my supervisor/the management help(s) to get the job done&#x0201d;. In the current study, internal consistency of the respective scales was excellent (Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha: 0.99; 0.98; and 0.98). The response scales range from 1 (strongly disagree) to 4 (strongly agree). A scale score was obtained by summing the three individual items (range 3&#x02013;12).

The scale comprises a question on perceived current work ability compared to lifetime best, measured on a frequency scale from 0 (unable to work) to 10 (very good). To additionally gain insight into work ability in relation to job demands, the second dimension of the WAI was added. This dimension comprises two questions on perceived work ability in relation to mental and physical job demands, recorded on a five-point frequency scale from 1 (very bad) to 5 (very good).</p><p>The combined scale score (range 2&#x02013;20) was calculated as the sum of the score on current work ability and the weighted scores on the demands, according to the nature of the work.

The items were combined into one scale, showing an acceptable internal consistency (Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha: 0.70). The scale score was calculated as the mean of the two items (range 1&#x02013;5), with higher scores indicating higher satisfaction.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Commitment to work and the organization</title><p>This concept was assessed using five items of the Dutch NOVA-WEBA questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>], such as &#x0201c;My work means a lot to me&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;I feel perfectly at home in this organization&#x0201d;. Response scales range from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree), with the scale score calculated as the mean of the score of all five items (range 1&#x02013;5). Higher mean scores indicate higher commitment. Validity and reliability were moderate in an earlier report (Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha 0.68) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>].

Contrary to the hypothesis, the results showed no effects of the intervention on the aforementioned primary outcomes. For most secondary outcomes no effects were found either. However, statistically significant effects on two of the secondary outcome measures were in unfavorable direction (i.e. absorption as a subscale of work engagement, and organizational efficacy).</p><p>At least four aspects of the current study could explain the lack of effect. Firstly, we measured a wide range of positive and negative outcomes, but all measures were collected at the individual level. One could argue that an organizational level intervention requires organizational level collection of data to detect an effect, such as sickness absence registrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], team performance indicators or company results. A second reason regarding the type of outcomes could be that we defined and operationalized the outcomes before the trial. However, the exact type, content and implementation of actions was developed during the intervention. Therefore, the relation between actions taken and measures was possibly too distant to detect an effect. Third, the process evaluation demonstrated that implementation of the intervention&#x02019;s first phase (needs assessment) was rather good, whereas the implementation of the actual changes in phase two (implementation phase) was poor in both schools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Based on the level of implementation we expected to notice effects directly after intervention phase 1, at first follow-up, but these effects were only found for need for recovery, vitality, social support of supervisor and work ability. This finding should be interpreted with caution though, because it might as well be explained by a &#x02018;ceiling effect&#x02019; in the high scores of the intervention group at baseline. For example, the baseline score of the intervention group for &#x02018;need for recovery&#x02019; was 41.7. This is not only almost ten points higher than the control group, it is also higher than the mean score of around 30 points found in other studies (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]). Such a high score at baseline makes an increase not likely. The fact that the improvement at T1 was not found for all outcomes might be due to the medium to low levels of satisfaction with the intervention. Hence, the lack of effect could be due to implementation failure. In post hoc analyses we tested for implementation failure and the effect found on occupational self-efficacy suggests that if the intervention would have been implemented as planned and the dose received would have been high enough for all, participants indeed might get a mastery experience out of taking part. Which in turn might lead to an increase in occupational self-efficacy. However, to reach this high dose received, the intervention&#x02019;s implementation strategy ought to be revised so to ensure participation throughout both phases of the intervention (e.g. by planning all intervention elements during working hours). Fourth, the lack of effectiveness could be due to theory failure, it could have been that the theory behind the intervention did not address the problem righteously. In future participatory intervention studies researchers could consider constructs that are &#x02018;closer&#x02019; to the actual implementation process as outcomes (e.g. participation, readiness for change).</p><sec id="Sec28"><title>Comparison with earlier studies</title><p>Although the (partial) lack of effect was contrary to our expectations it is in line with some existing evidence on organizational-level interventions in education. A recent Cochrane review of organizational level interventions in (primary and secondary) education found only low-quality evidence that organizational interventions lead to improvements in teacher well-being and retention rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Low quality could for example be due to small numbers of participants or a lacking control group. However, the review included only four studies and in two cases teacher well-being was measured as a side effect of a student&#x02019;s intervention, limiting the generalizability of the review&#x02019;s outcomes.</p><p>The low or mediocre quality of evidence for organizational level interventions was also found in studies conducted outside of the educational domain. For example, the review by Montano and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>] included studies in health care, manufacturing and civil service mainly. The review demonstrated that comprehensive interventions, simultaneously addressing material, organizational, and work-time conditions, were more successful than single interventions. As a second example, an elaborate Cochrane review of stress management interventions of any type, conducted in health care, demonstrated that of the organizational-level interventions only changing work schedules may lead to a reduction of stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>].</p><p>The current study adds to the existing body of evidence on the (partial) ineffectiveness of organizational level interventions for employee health. The evidence is considered to be relatively strong, since the design, with three measurements, was longitudinal as recommended in Michie and Williams&#x02019; review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>] and followed participants for a longer period than in most studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Secondly, a complex intervention framework was used as recommended for this target group and these outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Thirdly, validated measures were used for the operationalization of the concepts. And lastly, the theoretical concepts focused both on positive and negative work-related aspects, hence health protective and health promotive effects could be detected.</p></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Limitations of the current study</title><p>Some limitations of the current study need to be considered before generalizing the findings. Firstly, as a result of the long follow-up period of 12 and 24&#x000a0;months, loss to follow-up and drop out due to the termination of employment contracts were quite high. This probably affected the statistical power to detect changes. Secondly, although the matching was performed as effectively as possible, significant differences between the intervention and control groups persisted at baseline. This group difference was dealt with by correcting for baseline differences in all analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. A related, third limitation is the lack of randomization in this controlled trial: unknown confounding variables could be unevenly distributed over groups, threatening the internal validity. As has been described in the literature as a common challenge, the schools wanted to participate under the condition of choosing the intervention group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. Future studies of this type could consider alternative designs, such as the stepped wedge approach for selecting the order of groups receiving treatment, or methods, such as propensity score matching, to overcome the possible bias resulting from non-randomization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Recommendations for future research and practice</title><p>As described above, the current study already met some of the most important recommendations that were based on reviews of organizational level interventions and still no effects were found. There are at least three ways to further improve organizational level interventions. Montano and colleagues (2014) point to optimization of the implementation process as the strategy towards successful organizational-level interventions. The current study was conducted in daily practice and implementation suffered in this environment. The implementation is of utmost importance, since determinants of successful intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>] overlap with determinants of work-related stress (e.g. such as participation in decision making). By not implementing correctly, the facilitator or researcher could actually be adding a stressor to the work environment. The implementation strategy of this intervention should thus be revised (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]) before the intervention can be recommended.</p><p>A second manner to improve effectiveness of organizational level interventions has been suggested by Ruotsalainen and colleagues: the interventions need to be more specific in their focus on stressors in order to be more effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. In the current study the link between stressors formulated by all workers in phase 1 and actions taken by the management in phase 2 was unclear to most workers, which possibly hindered the effectiveness. This could be prevented by redesigning the implementation strategy in this intervention so as to incorporate participation as a central element in phase 2 as well, instead of leaving phase 2 to the management team in the schools.</p><p>Thirdly, organizational level interventions focusing on the root-cause of stress could be integrated with secondary preventive, individual focused stress management interventions. This simultaneous intervention on root-cause and early symptoms, could create a feeling of shared responsibility between organization and individual employee for occupational health. An integrated approach to workplace mental health might be more effective than one of the prevention types or levels alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec31" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>To our knowledge, this is one of the first primary preventive, organizational level intervention studies targeted at all workers in education. Reviews have shown the potential of this type of intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], especially if participation and mastery experiences are incorporated in the intervention strategy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Until now intervention studies that aimed to improve teacher well-being were secondary preventive and targeted at the individual level mostly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Unique is the content of the intervention; we evaluated a practice-based intervention that had been applied and redesigned over a hundred times for differing organizations, according to the consultancy firm which developed the intervention. However, the results of this evaluation showed no effects of this type of intervention on the primary outcomes. Two small, statistically significant effects on secondary outcomes absorption and organizational efficacy appeared to be in unfavorable direction. Post-hoc analyses showed that high compliers with the first phase of the intervention, scored on average over time significantly higher on occupational self-efficacy than the control group. Suggesting that if the &#x02018;dose&#x02019; is high enough (i.e. implementation is sufficient), the intervention might offer participants a mastery experience which affects occupational self-efficacy. The intervention program in its current form lacks a sufficient implementation strategy and is therefore not recommended. Organizational level participatory interventions for occupational health should incorporate an elaborate implementation strategy and be more specific in relating the actions taken to the stressors in the context. Future intervention studies aiming to improve occupational health should consider integrating organizational level, primary preventive elements with individual, secondary preventive elements, in order to be effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>].</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>HM</term><def><p>Heuristic method (i.e. the intervention)</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>JCQ</term><def><p>Job content questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NOVA-WEBA</term><def><p>Dutch questionnaire developed to identify risk factors for work stress</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RCPE</term><def><p>Review committee participants in experiments</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>T0</term><def><p>Baseline measurement</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>T1</term><def><p>First follow-up measurement</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>T2</term><def><p>Second follow-up measurement</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>UWES-9</term><def><p>Utrecht work engagement scale-9</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VET</term><def><p>Vocational Education and Training school</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WAI</term><def><p>Work ability index.</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><p>We thank The Netherlands Organization for Health Research and Development (ZonMw), the Education Labor market fund &#x02013; foundation (Stichting Onderwijsarbeidsmarktfonds SOM) of The Netherlands Association of VET Colleges (MBO Raad) for their support.</p><p>We thank Jan Anton Brouwer (intervention facilitator) and Edda Heijting (intervention founder and director of Heijting Weerts Group) for their role in this study.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p>This study is funded by The Netherlands Organization for Health Research and Development (ZonMw).
