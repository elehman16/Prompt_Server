Although the need for effective ALI prevention strategies is increasingly recognised, no effective preventative strategies exist. The Lung Injury Prevention Study with Aspirin (LIPS-A) aims to test whether aspirin (ASA) could prevent and/or mitigate the development of ALI.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>LIPS-A is a multicentre, double-blind, randomised clinical trial testing the hypothesis that the early administration of ASA will result in a reduced incidence of ALI in adult patients at high risk. This investigation will enrol 400 study participants from 14 hospitals across the USA. Conditional logistic regression will be used to test the primary hypothesis that early ASA administration will decrease the incidence of ALI.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>Safety oversight will be under the direction of an independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). Approval of the protocol was obtained from the DSMB prior to enrolling the first study participant. Approval of both the protocol and informed consent documents were also obtained from the institutional review board of each participating institution prior to enrolling study participants at the respective site. In addition to providing important clinical and mechanistic information, this investigation will inform the scientific merit and feasibility of a phase III trial on ASA as an ALI prevention agent. The findings of this investigation, as well as associated ancillary studies, will be disseminated in the form of oral and abstract presentations at major national and international medical specialty meetings. The primary objective and other significant findings will also be presented in manuscript form. All final, published manuscripts resulting from this protocol will be submitted to Pub Med Central in accordance with the National Institute of Health Public Access Policy.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>acute lung injury</kwd><kwd>acute respiratory ditress syndrome</kwd><kwd>aspirin</kwd><kwd>critical illness</kwd><kwd>prevention</kwd><kwd>clinical trial</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text position="float"><caption><title>Article summary</title></caption><sec><title>Article focus</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The primary objective of this manuscript is to provide the background information and methodology for a randomised clinical trial aiming to test the safety and efficacy of aspirin (ASA) in the prevention of acute lung injury (ALI) in patients determined to be at high risk.</p></list-item><list-item><p>A secondary aim of this trial is to determine if early administration of ASA modulates plasma mediators shown to be important in the development of ALI and its outcomes.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Third, this study will evaluate novel mechanisms by which an antiplatelet agent ASA may modulate the development and progression of lung injury in patients at risk.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec><title>Key messages</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>This paper describes the background information, methodology and statistical analysis plan for the first multicentre clinical trial aiming to test a promising ALI prevention strategy.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The results of this investigation will inform the scientific merit of a future phase III clinical trial on ASA administration as an ALI prevention strategy in at-risk patients.</p></list-item><list-item><p>This protocol will facilitate the development of an essential infrastructure for future clinical trials aiming to test ALI prevention strategies.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec><title>Strengths and limitations of this study</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>A major strength of this investigation is its multicentre, randomised clinical trial study design.

ALI will be defined as requirement for invasive mechanical ventilation and fulfilment of the American-European consensus definition for ALI/ARDS.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref> Patients will be screened daily for respiratory failure and the partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO<sub>2</sub>) to fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO<sub>2</sub>) ratio will be calculated daily for those on mechanical ventilation. Patients ventilated with non-invasive ventilation will not be considered ALI/ARDS as our preliminary data showed that the majority (90%) of ALI patients are eventually intubated.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref> Investigators at each site will review structured online training for assessment of ALI as was used and described in the LIPS.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref> In addition, de-identified chest x-rays of the first five patients enrolled at each site will be sent to CCC for validation by the primary investigators. Any site with significant deviation will be retrained. Each participating centre's principal investigator will adjudicate the diagnosis of ALI/ARDS using standardised definitions. Patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation who, within a given 24-h period, fulfil criteria for PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub>&#x0003c;300&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg, bilateral infiltrates consistent with ALI and not completely explained by heart failure, will be determined to have developed ALI. Given prior data suggesting poor agreement in the radiological interpretation of bilateral infiltrates on chest radiographs consistent with ALI,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref> a secondary review of all ALI cases and a random sample of non-ALI cases will be performed by an independent expert investigator who is blinded to the initial ALI/ARDS adjudication. Study participants who die or are discharged from the hospital prior to day 7, and had not met criteria for ALI at the time of death or discharge, will be adjudicated as not having developed ALI.</p><p>Secondary clinical outcome assessments will include changes in the lung injury score and sequential organ failure assessment score, as well as the number of ventilator-free days at hospital day 28 and intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital lengths of stay. Mortality will be assessed at discharge from the ICU, from the hospital, and at 28&#x02005;days. In addition, hospital survivors will undergo a brief follow-up phone survey to assess functional status (Barthel Index), health-related quality of life (QOL (SF-12)) and frailty (VES-13) at 6-months and 12-months after enrolment.</p><p>Mechanistic Outcomes: Secondary analyses will include evaluations of the mechanisms by which antiplatelet agents (eg, ASA) may modulate the development and progression of lung injury as well as a determination of the value of plasma biomarkers of lung injury in the prediction of ALI development in patients at risk (beyond clinical variables). The study will examine biomarkers previously found to be associated with the <italic>development</italic> of ALI/ARDS in at-risk individuals (<xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2012001606TB4">table 4</xref>). In addition, to better understand the mechanisms by which ASA may affect the development and progression of ALI, the study will also examine the effect of ASA on ASA-triggered lipoxins, plasma thromboxane and platelet&#x02013;neutrophil aggregates. As it is likely that other important biomarkers in ALI may be identified in the future, plasma from consenting patients will be banked at the biorepository for future studies. Blood samples will be obtained at baseline (after randomisation and before initiation of study intervention), on day 2 of study (approximately 24&#x02005;h after the first dose of study drug) and on day 4 of study (any time during day 4).

To adequately address this hypothesis, the sample size is estimated to be 200 participants per group (400 total). The assumptions involved in this calculation include the following: (1) the hypothesised placebo response rate will be 18%,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref> (2) the minimum clinically relevant effect is 10 percentage points, and (3) the type I error rate (&#x003b1;)=0.10 (two-sided; final &#x003b1;=0.0889 after interim analysis at 50% information fraction using O'Brien-Fleming-like &#x003b1;spending function). To be conservative during sample size estimation, the null proportion was shifted upwards to 25% (ie, towards the region of maximum binomial variance) so that the initial sample size estimates are based on 25% vs 15%. A &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test of proportions at the &#x003b1;=0.10 level of significance will have 80% power to detect the 10 percentage point difference with 197 participants per group. Overall recruitment is rounded to 200 participants per group (400 total) to allow for minor attrition, although attrition is not expected to affect the ascertainment of primary outcome. At the hypothesised level of 18% vs 8% and with the &#x003b1; adjusted for multiple interim looks, power with 200 participants per group is 90%. Thus, for the primary analysis 400 total participants randomised 1:1 to placebo or ASA is anticipated to yield sufficient power to detect a clinically relevant difference in the incidence of ALI.</p><p>The Data and Statistical Coordinating Center will prepare weekly reports on the accrual process for the trial. The reports, which will be reviewed on the weekly executive committee calls, will include summarisation of screening and randomisation metrics. Detailed descriptions of exclusion criteria for disqualified study candidates will be provided and reviewed as well. Each clinical centre has a target enrolment of two randomised participants per month. The reports will include a comparison of observed versus expected accrual, by clinical centre and overall for the trial. The randomisation performance of each clinical centre will be disseminated monthly to all study personnel through a study newsletter. If site-specific enrolment concerns are identified, methods for addressing these issues will be evaluated by the executive committee working with the site of interest. If a more pervasive and sustained gap between expected and observed participant accrual is identified, potential modifications to the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the protocol will be discussed. Any amendments to the inclusion and/or exclusion criteria deemed necessary by the executive committee will require approval by the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) as well as the institutional review board (IRB) of each participating institution before implementation. If enrolment remains below plan, the inclusion of additional clinical sites will be considered as well.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Randomisation and blinding</title><p>LIPS-A will utilise centralised randomisation software hosted by the Data and Statistical Coordinating Center. Randomisation through the electronic data management system will be enabled upon electronic verification of inclusion and exclusion criteria and enrolment of the study participant by the clinical site investigators. Enrolled participants will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to the ASA or placebo treatment arm using dynamic minimisation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref> with a second guess probability of 0.2. Randomisation will be stratified by centre. To maintain the double blind for the study, only the research pharmacist at each centre will have electronic access to the unblinded treatment code for study medication preparation and dispensing. The rest of the site investigators and coordinating centres will be blinded to the actual treatment assignment. Emergency unblinding is available electronically and through dispensing records at each pharmacy.</p><p>In the event the electronic randomisation system is not functioning, the research pharmacist at each centre has a sealed emergency randomisation kit to enable offline randomisation. A manual of operation governs the use of the emergency randomisation process. Briefly, prior to use of the emergency process, approval of the coordinating centres is required. All attempts will be made to recover the system prior to the use of the offline procedure. Should the offline procedure be used, the electronic data management system will be updated to reflect the treatment assignment using the identification number contained within the randomisation kit.</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>Conditional logistic regression will be used to test the primary hypothesis that early ASA administration will decrease the rate of ALI development. Clinical site will be treated as the stratification variable and conditioned out of the estimating equations. This approach is optimal in a clinical trial setting as it provides a test of null hypothesis that the ALI incidence is equal in the two treatment group and estimates the association in the event the null hypothesis is rejected (through the conditional OR estimate). SAS PROC LOGISTIC (Cary, North Carolina, USA) will be used for estimation of the primary model.</p><p>This analysis will be supplemented by the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel stratified analysis with ORs computed for each site. The Breslow-Day test will be used to examine the data for potential effect modification (ie, a &#x02018;site effect&#x02019;). In the event there is significant site-to-site variability in the estimated effect, stratified results will be reported for this phase II study. Evidence of heterogeneity of response at this phase of study will yield invaluable preliminary data for the planning of future changes.</p><p>Planned interim analyses will be conducted at 50% of study participants enrolled. With the O'Brien-Fleming-like stopping boundaries, a final adjusted &#x003b1; of 0.08885 is anticipated; however, the final value may be changed depending on unplanned interim analyses (conducted at the request of the DSMB) or slight deviations from the anticipated information milestones (0.5 and 1). Stopping boundaries will be estimated using the LD Bounds package for the R system.</p><p>For the remaining continuous and dichotomous secondary endpoints, treatment group comparisons will be performed with respect to clinical outcomes as well as important prognostic factors at screening, baseline and individual follow-up time points during the study duration. For continuous variables (eg, age, weight and laboratory assays), linear model techniques including <italic>t</italic>-tests, analysis of variance and analysis of covariance will be applied. Non-parametric procedures (eg, the Wilcoxon rank sum test), will be used if data are not normally distributed and transformations of the data are not considered useful. Standard techniques for categorical data will be applied, including Fisher's exact test, Pearson &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> procedures, weighted least squares and logistic regression analysis.</p><p>Longitudinal (or serially measured) endpoints will be evaluated by generalised linear models and linear mixed. Repeated measure analyses of binary endpoints will be analysed using generalised estimating equations methods which do not require imputation of missing values, provided the data are ignorable missing.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref> Continuous-dependent variables will utilise the mixed model approach with emphasis on evaluating the trajectories of values over time. However, early improvement in these parameters may suggest a supportive, stabilising role for ASA as a treatment option in patients at high risk of ALI. For the primary analysis, the clinical centre will be treated as a &#x02018;nuisance&#x02019; parameter and conditioned out of the estimation routine. For secondary analyses, the clinical centre will be used as a fixed covariate to account for differences across sites.</p><p>The safety endpoints (see below Adverse outcomes section) will be examined for all participants in the safety evaluable analysis set. Safety endpoints will include expected clinical events, including death, for this patient population and summarised by the treatment group. Also, all serious and unexpected adverse events will be summarised by the treatment group. Fisher's exact test will be used to estimate treatment differences in the incidence of each specified adverse event. No adjustments will be made for multiple hypothesis evaluations of safety endpoints. Adverse events will be summarised with groupings by body system. Other safety data (eg, labs and assay data) will be listed, and when appropriate, summarised in tabular or graphical format.</p></sec><sec id="s2i"><title>Data quality and management</title><p>This investigation will utilise the Medidata Rave system for data management and storage as well as to assist with the randomisation procedures.

Specifically, we have hypothesised that early administration of ASA to hospitalised patients who are at high risk of ALI, will be safe and will reduce the likelihood of progression to the full ALI phenotype. Secondarily, this investigation will glean important mechanistic data on ASA's impact on the pathways believed important in ALI pathogenesis as well as the potential value of relevant biomarkers in the prediction of subsequent development of ALI. Finally, the results of this study will provide essential information on both the scientific merit and feasibility of a larger, phase III trial testing the role of ASA in the prevention of lung injury.</p><p>The persistent difficulty in translating promising preclinical therapies into the clinical setting has fostered interest in the potential development of effective ALI prevention strategies. Indeed, prevention of ALI has been identified as a key strategic priority for invested parties such as the NHLBI.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref> However, implementation of protocols aiming to test potential ALI prevention strategies have been historically hindered by an inability to accurately predict who is at risk for ALI. Moreover, the typically short interval between risk exposure and development of ALI as well as the small proportion of patients who progress to the full ALI phenotype following an ALI-related exposure has limited the feasibility of ALI prevention studies. In addition, the historic lack of standardisation for numerous important co-interventions that confound the associations of interest (eg, ventilator management, transfusion and resuscitation practices) has also limited our ability to test preventative strategies.</p><p>To this end, the recently validated LIPS score is a key element of the herein described study protocol.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref> Specifically, the LIPS score is expected to facilitate the identification of patients at greatest risk of progressing to ALI (an LIPS score &#x02265;4 is expected to identify a subgroup of patients who have a risk of progressing to ALI that is greater than 18%). In addition, it is notable that this ALI risk assessment tool was validated using data collected within the first 6&#x02005;h after the initial evaluation in the ED. In an ALI prevention protocol such as described herein, where the time to randomisation is limited to 12&#x02005;h from presentation to the ED, the ability to accurately determine risk for ALI in such a time-efficient manner is critical.</p><p>A second notable strength of the current protocol is expected to be the implementation of the CLIP for standardising important co-interventions that may otherwise confound our association of interest (ASA and ALI). During the period between hospital admission and the development of ALI, healthcare delivery factors (timely treatment of infection and shock, appropriate administration of fluid and transfusion therapies, prevention of aspiration, avoidance of large tidal volume ventilation), may be as important as individual biology in determining ALI development and outcome.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32 R33 R34 R35 R36 R37 R38 R39">32&#x02013;39</xref> Moreover, a recent survey noted wide variation in clinical practices such as the existence of a sepsis protocol, use of low tidal volume ventilation, positive end-expiratory pressure and restrictive transfusion practices, between hospitals and among the ED, ICU and operating room within hospitals.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref> Thus, to effectively investigate preventive strategies in ALI, the standardisation of care delivery during the early phase of hospitalisation would appear critical. Indeed, the ARDSNet investigators have repeatedly shown the value of standardisation of clinical processes for ALI patients in clinical trials, allowing for determination of incremental benefit of new interventions.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref> In the current investigation, standardisation of care with best practices will help to reduce variability in the rates of ALI and the intensity of lung injury (noise) due to inconsistencies in care delivery. The result is expected to be an increased chance of seeing a beneficial clinical or biological effect from ASA and a better assessment of the potential side effects of ASA in this population.</p><p>Although the multicentre randomised clinical trial design, availability of a time-efficient risk assessment tool (LIPS score) and the standardisation of important co-interventions with CLIP, as well as the robust study support and quality control offered through Metadata Rave, are clear strengths of the current study protocol, several important limitations with the planned investigation are worth being noted. Lung injury may be present at study entry even as clinical criteria for ALI are not fulfilled. Though a formal diagnosis of prevalent ALI is exclusionary, the molecular machinery will have been clearly set in motion in many of the study participants. Therefore, the study may be more accurately characterised as a prevention/early treatment trial rather than a pure prevention trial. Nonetheless, we have attempted to focus on the early period of ALI development by mandating a short interval from hospital presentation to randomisation (12&#x02005;h) and a similarly short interval from hospital presentation to administration of the first study dose (24&#x02005;h). In addition, the study will exclude patients who presented to an outside hospital ED more than 12&#x02005;h before arrival at the enrolling site's facility. The study will also exclude those with ALI on hospital presentation or prior to randomisation as well as those who are receiving mechanical ventilation through a tracheostomy tube prior to the current hospital admission (patient who is ventilator dependent) or those with a history of interstitial lung disease with chronic pulmonary infiltrates that may mimic ALI.</p><p>A second limitation relates to the intervention of ASA administration. Specifically, it is now well documented that more than 10% of the population will have a variable response to ASA or at least some form of ASA resistance.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref> These patients may not benefit from ASA, even if ASA can modulate the development of lung injury. However, as part of this study, we will measure plasma thromboxane, a sensitive indicator of ASA resistance, to determine the prevalence of ASA resistance in patients at high risk of ALI. As such, sensitivity analyses, stratifying study participants by ASA resistance (as determined by changes in thromboxane levels), may allow us to determine whether the effect of ASA on ALI development is isolated to those susceptible to the actions of ASA. A related concern is the potential influence of concomitant medications that may impact on ASA's ability to prevent or mitigate ALI (eg, statins and corticosteroids). To address this concern, we will be collecting detailed information on concomitant medications and, when necessary, appropriate statistical adjustments will be made.</p><p>A third potential limitation with this study relates to a previously recognised major barrier to ALI prevention studies, namely feasibility. First and foremost, a substantial proportion of the target population may be expected to be receiving ASA on presentation to the ED, an exclusion criteria for the current protocol. Notably, however, our preliminary work suggests that upwards of two-thirds of the target population was not on ASA prior to admission. We also note that over the 3&#x02005;months of the initial LIPS,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref> there were 800 patients who fulfilled study inclusion criteria of LIPS score &#x02265;4 and did not fulfil the exclusion criteria of pre-existing ASA use, prevalent ALI and elective surgery. Therefore, we believe that with 14 proposed sites and 2&#x02005;years of planned enrolment, we will successfully meet our enrolment goals of 400 total patients. Also relating to feasibility, it is possible that some sites will be challenged by the short time interval allowed for patient enrolment as well as the short time to study drug administration. Though a valid concern, we believe the use of the LIPS score and the robust support offered through Metadata Rave will greatly facilitate the enrolment and randomisation procedures such that sites will indeed be successful in meeting these time-sensitive challenges.</p><p>A fourth and final limitation which deserves mention relates to the potential toxicity of the intervention of interest. Generally, ASA is well tolerated even in acutely ill, hospitalised patients in whom ASA is often continued during the hospitalisation. As an example, in a study of ASA use up to the time of cardiac surgery, its continuation was not associated with an increased need for transfusion therapies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref> Nevertheless, there may be injury associated with the administration of ASA. To address this concern, patients at risk for major complications from ASA therapy have been excluded from the study. Multiple stopping criteria for patients who experience adverse events have also been incorporated into the protocol. In addition, the more complete understanding of the safety profile of an intervention of interest is an important goal of all phase II trials. In this regard, the information gleaned from this study, adverse events included, is necessary to help decide on the merits of proceeding to a phase III clinical trial.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This manuscript describes the study protocol and analysis plans for the first phase II randomised clinical trial of the promising ALI prevention agent ASA. In addition to providing important information on the safety and efficacy of ASA in patients at high risk for ALI, the results of this trial will also inform the scientific community regarding the merit and feasibility of a more definitive phase III clinical trial. Importantly, the significance of this effort lies not only in the specific results which will be obtained from the study protocol, but equally in the infrastructure that will be created to facilitate the conduct of this trial. Specifically, the development and utilisation of innovative methods to facilitate the early identification of high-risk patients with the LIPS and the standardisation of potential confounding co-interventions with CLIP will address key barriers to studying ALI prevention measures and is expected to lay a framework for the meaningful conduct of future ALI prevention studies as well.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d34e207" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2012-001606.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> DJK has contributed to all aspects of the study design and is the principal investigator at the Data and Statistical Coordinating Center.
