We conducted a prospective randomized trial to assess the benefits of a new disposable circumcision suture device (DCSD). A total of 942 patients were equally divided into three groups (conventional circumcision, Shang ring and disposable suture device group). Patients in the DCSD group were anesthetized with compound 5% lidocaine cream, the others with a 2% lidocaine penile block. Operation time, intra-operative blood loss, incision healing time, intra-operative and post-operative pain, the penile appearance and overall satisfaction degree were measured. Operation time and intra-operative blood loss were significantly lower in the Shang ring and suture device groups compared to the conventional group (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). Intra-operative pain was less in the suture device group compared with the other two groups (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001); whereas post-operative pain was higher in the conventional group compared to the other two groups (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). Patients in the suture device (80.57%) and Shang ring (73.57%) groups were more satisfied with penile appearances compared with the conventional circumcision group (20.06%, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). Patients in suture device group also healed markedly faster than the conventional group (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01). The overall satisfaction rate was better in the suture device group (78.66%) compared with the conventional (47.13%) and Shang ring (50.00%) groups (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). The combination of DCSD and lidocaine cream resulted in shorter operation and incision healing times, reduced intra-operative and post-operative pain and improved patient satisfaction with the cosmetic appearances.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>circumcision</kwd><kwd>disposable circumcision suture device</kwd><kwd>patient satisfaction</kwd><kwd>penis appearance</kwd><kwd>pre-operative and postoperative pain</kwd><kwd>Shang ring</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Phimosis and redundant prepuce are common male genital conditions, which can induce recurrent balanitis and posthitis, cause premature ejaculation<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> and increase the incidences of sexually transmitted diseases and penile cancer.

All patients requiring circumcision for phimosis redundant prepuce or phimosis at five different hospitals between October 2012 and May 2013 were randomly allocated into three groups (allocation by random number table): the conventional circumcision group, the Shang ring group and the DCSD group. Patients under 18 years, those with dense adhesions between glans and foreskin and obese patients with partly buried penis were excluded. The study was approved by the ethics committee (number: 2012-Research-52). All patients signed informed consent forms and were not undergoing any other clinical procedure.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-2"><title>Surgical process</title><p>We used compound 5% lidocaine cream (Ziguang Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.

The training included the understanding of the questionnaire, healing standard, the surgery skills. An assessment was taken by a specialist after the training to see if the surgeon was qualified. In order to reduce the bias caused by surgeons subjective judgment, we defined assessment standards for incision healing: the incision is closed and covered by skin, no rupture under moderate exercise; with time, the healed incision can withstand certain stretching force and pressure, the pigmentation is relieved and is close to the color of normal skin; return to the intact normal skin function.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-4"><title>Data collection</title><p>Incidences of post-operative complications including hematoma, edema, disruption of incision, incision infection and incision healing time were recorded at 1 week, 2 weeks and 1 month post-operation.

Since then, the number of surgical techniques has increased; however, the psychological implications for patients have largely been neglected. Clinicians rarely pay sufficient attention to the psychological states of patients receiving circumcision. Patients tend to be more anxious about genital surgeries than similar surgeries related to other organs. Prelimilary studies showed that, currently the satisfaction rate of circumcision was rather low, only 60%.<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Clinicians should be aware of the major factors that influence patients&#x02019; satisfaction and improve surgical procedures accordingly.</p><p>To gain primary insight into the fears of patients undergoing circumcision surgery, we retrospectively performed a health and satisfaction survey on 508 patients who had recently undergone circumcision. We found that safety and pain were the issues that mainly concerned patients before the operation, while pain and penile appearance were the most concerning issues after the operations were performed. According to our survey, patients&#x02019; fears about the surgery were justified. It was consistent that pain is the most concern before surgery and the most bothering after surgery, what is different is that patients worried most about the safety before surgery, this worry was relieved after surgery, but was replaced by the worry about the appearance of the penis. We think it is because that the success of the operation eliminated patients&#x02019; the concerns about the safety, but the incision increased the worries upon the cosmetic appearances. Besides, pain may be associated with lidocaine injection for dorsal penile nerve block, which is generally used as anesthesia during currently used circumcision techniques. Lidocaine injection often results in severe intraoperative pain because of incomplete block and can introduce several complications including allergic and toxic reactions and penile hematoma.<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Post-operative penile appearance can be affected as conventional circumcision procedures may result in uneven and asymmetric incisions and polyps of the frenulum.</p><p>The health and satisfaction survey shows that patients undergoing surgery with the DCSD experienced reduced intra-operative and post-operative pain. This is likely due to our novel anesthesia method, which allows patients undergoing short surgery such as a circumcision to avoid pain associated with injection, a common anesthetic approach. The penis has typical anatomical features. The skin that wraps the penis is the thinnest and softest skin in the human body, without any subcutaneous adipose tissue. We believe that this makes the topical anesthesia route more efficient and suitable for patients receiving circumcision. In addition, previous studies have demonstrated that compound lidocaine cream can be absorbed easily and is very stable in tissue, anesthetizing the patients for a longer time, especially when applied to superficial skin.<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> In addition, using the DCSD did not involve the pain caused by the electric scalpel or compression.</p><p>Our results demonstrate that circumcision performed using the DCSD and Shang ring circumcision involved markedly less intra-operative blood loss and a shorter operation time when compared to the conventional circumcision technique. We believe that the differences are, at least partly, because the DCSD and Shang ring circumcision aid in removal of the redundant foreskin and anastomose the incision using staples, nearly simultaneously. During the Shang ring technique, the foreskin is sandwiched between the inner and outer Rings before the redundant foreskin is removed by a cryoscalpel. This could substantially reduce intraoperative blood loss.</p><p>The use of the DCSD markedly decreased incision healing time. This could be because the use of an electric scalpel during conventional circumcision involves thermal injuries, larger incisions and longer exposure time and Shang ring requires the rings to sandwich the foreskin until the redundant foreskin becomes necrotized.</p><p>Other similar circumcision devices such as the gomco device, the accucirc device and others have been studied in recent years. None of them were considered as perfect because of various associated complications.<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> The present study demonstrated fewer post-operative complications when the DCSD was used. We believe that this is because the modified device avoids the use of an electric scalpel and manual suture as in the conventional approach and reduces the tissue compression that is associated with the use of Shang rings. In addition, the method of anesthesia is fundamentally different with the DCSD. Lidocaine injection for dorsal penile nerve block in the conventional and Shang ring approaches could induce subcutaneous hematoma and reflux blockage. The reduced edema and better blood supply in the DCSD group decreases the incidences of infection and incision disruption. Firstly, the device we used is a DCSD, the staple of the ring-shaped blade on this device can inosculate with the prepuce during the circumcision, thus the sharp incision of the foreskin can be achieved, thus reducing the risk of the influence of blood supply and getting recovered faster; secondly, one good thing about the staple is that it is double-row straight staple, thus reducing the risk of rupture and because of no irritation of the suture, the risk of local inflammation is low; thirdly, we used self-adhesive plaster for pressure bandaging and gave patients anti-erection medicine (the patients in each group were given 3 mg for consecutive 3 days post-operatively) orally for prevention. In the DCSD group of this study, 10 out of 314 had rupture of the incision site, we gave absorbable thread for local suture and no serious complication occurred.</p><p>Improved satisfaction with penile appearance was also achieved using the DCSD. We believe that it is because the device maintains an appropriate length of foreskin, achieves a symmetrical and uniform cutting edge and reduces local induration, dewlap of the preputial frenulum and scars associated with the incision.</p><p>In summary, our modification of the traditional anesthetic and surgical methods of circumcision based on our findings of the health satisfaction survey markedly reduced the number of incidences of post-operative complications, intra-operative and post-operative pain and improved penile appearance and patient satisfaction. Several cases of disruption of incision, delayed disappearance of the staples and hematoma were found in a few patients undergoing circumcision with our modified device, warranting further research on measures that must be taken to improve the clinical efficiency and acceptability of our novel surgical approach.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-5"><title>AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS</title><p>SGZ and BDL conceived of the study, and participated in its design and coordination and helped to draft the manuscript.
