ATP is the primary source of energy for the cells, and supplementation may enhance the ability to maintain high ATP turnover during high-intensity exercise. Oral ATP supplements have beneficial effects in some but not all studies examining physical performance. One of the remaining questions is whether orally administered ATP is bioavailable. We investigated whether acute supplementation with oral ATP administered as enteric-coated pellets led to increased concentrations of ATP or its metabolites in the circulation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Eight healthy volunteers participated in a cross-over study. Participants were given in random order single doses of 5000&#x02009;mg ATP or placebo. To prevent degradation of ATP in the acidic environment of the stomach, the supplement was administered via two types of pH-sensitive, enteric-coated pellets (targeted at release in the proximal or distal small intestine), or via a naso-duodenal tube. Blood ATP and metabolite concentrations were monitored by HPLC for 4.5&#x02009;h (naso-duodenal tube) or 7&#x02009;h (pellets) post-administration. Areas under the concentration vs. time curve were calculated and compared by paired-samples t-tests.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>ATP concentrations in blood did not increase after ATP supplementation via enteric-coated pellets or naso-duodenal tube. In contrast, concentrations of the final catabolic product of ATP, uric acid, were significantly increased compared to placebo by ~50% after administration via proximal-release pellets (P&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.003) and naso-duodenal tube (P&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.001), but not after administration via distal-release pellets.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>A single dose of orally administered ATP is not bioavailable, and this may explain why several studies did not find ergogenic effects of oral ATP supplementation. On the other hand, increases in uric acid after release of ATP in the proximal part of the small intestine suggest that ATP or one of its metabolites is absorbed and metabolized. Uric acid itself may have ergogenic effects, but this needs further study. Also, more studies are needed to determine whether chronic administration of ATP will enhance its oral bioavailability.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>ATP</kwd><kwd>Metabolism</kwd><kwd>Nutritional supplement</kwd><kwd>Bioavailability</kwd><kwd>Gastrointestinal transit</kwd><kwd>Multi-particulate supplement</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Nutritional supplements designed to increase adenosine 5&#x02032;-triphosphate (ATP) concentrations are commonly used by athletes as ergogenic aids. ATP is the primary source of energy for the cells, and supplementation may enhance the ability to maintain high ATP turnover during high-intensity exercise. ATP is also released from cells to act as a local regulator of neurotransmission, inflammation, and nociception via interaction with purinergic receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. ATP is present in substantial concentrations in a number of foods (e.g. meat, soy, mushrooms) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] and in breast milk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Furthermore, capsules containing ATP are currently registered in France for the treatment of low back pain of muscular origin, and supplements containing ATP are marketed on the internet for various purposes including the restoration of energy.</p><p>Oral ATP supplements have beneficial effects in some but not all studies examining physical performance. In an experimental study by Jordan <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], three groups of nine healthy men received ATP (150 or 225&#x02009;mg) or placebo for 14&#x02009;days. Physical performance and muscular strength were positively affected. Another study investigated the effects of supplementation with an ATP-containing registered drug for 30&#x02009;days (At&#x000e9;pad&#x000e8;ne&#x000ae;, 90&#x02009;mg daily) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The questionnaire-based outcome indicated that it provided benefit to patients with subacute low back pain. In contrast to these beneficial findings, Herda et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] found no improvements in muscle strength, power output, or endurance after supplementation of 24 healthy men with a commercially available treatment intended to increase ATP. The authors suggested that the lack of an effect in this double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial, might be caused by breakdown of ATP in the gastrointestinal tract. Because they did not collect blood samples from the participants, the authors could not verify whether ATP concentrations in the blood circulation had been altered as a result of supplementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Evidence on the oral availability of ATP supplements is limited. In the study by Jordan et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], no changes in whole blood and plasma ATP concentrations were detected, but the dosages administered were modest (225&#x02009;mg or less). Animal studies reporting alterations in cardiac, vascular and pulmonary function after 30&#x02009;days of oral ATP supplementation, also found no increases in systemic concentrations of plasma or erythrocyte ATP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. However, the concentration of ATP in plasma taken from the portal vein of rats increased rapidly up to a 1000-fold after instillation of ATP in de small intestine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The identification of a number of nucleoside transporters in the small intestine further suggested that orally administered ATP may be absorbed and utilized by the human body [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>We have previously shown that ATP is bioavailable after intravenous administration in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. ATP concentrations in erythrocytes increased in a dose-dependent manner by ~60% after 24&#x02009;h of continuous infusion. We now report the results of a randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial in 8 healthy humans, designed to assess the oral bioavailability of an ATP nutritional supplement. The ATP was administered as a single dose that was high enough to enable its detection in whole blood (5000&#x02009;mg). Furthermore, an acid-resistant enteric coating of the multi-particulate supplement was used to prevent the degradation of ATP in the acidic environment of the stomach. As a comparison, ATP was also directly instilled in the small intestine via a naso-duodenal tube.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>Subjects were examined on five occasions according to a cross-over design. Two types of enteric coated pH-sensitive multi-particulate supplements (from now on referred to as pellets) were tested, one targeting the proximal part of the small intestine, and one targeting the distal part. On days 0, 7, and 14, subjects received the following supplements in random order: 5000&#x02009;mg ATP as proximal-release pellets, 5000&#x02009;mg ATP as distal-release pellets, or placebo proximal-release pellets. The pellets were ingested with approximately 200&#x02009;mL water acidified to pH&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;5 with citric acid. On days 21 and 28, subjects received in random order 5000&#x02009;mg ATP dissolved in 100&#x02009;mL water (30&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;4&#x000b0;C), or water only (placebo), administered through a naso-duodenal tube. The tube was inserted through the subjects&#x02019; nostril and placed in the stomach. To promote movement of the tube through the pylorus into the duodenum, subjects were asked to lay down on their right side. To verify the tube&#x02019;s position (either stomach or duodenum), gastro-intestinal juice samples were taken by a syringe and tested for their pH and color. Once pH was above 5 (&#x000b1;180&#x02009;min after insertion of the tube), and color was yellow, administration started and the tube was removed 10&#x02009;min later. The study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Maastricht University Medical Centre. The study was carried out according to the Helsinki Declaration for human experiments.</p></sec><sec><title>Study population</title><p>Male and female subjects (18&#x02013;60&#x02009;years) received oral and written information about the protocol and possible risks before signing informed consent. Exclusion criteria were a history of lung, heart, intestinal, stomach or liver disease, use of prescription medication, smoking, drug use, dietary restrictions, and pregnancy. Subjects abstained from products containing alcohol or caffeine and from purine-rich foods, such as game, offal, sardines, anchovies and alcohol-free beer for two days before each test day. Subjects fasted from 10&#x02009;p.m. the previous day until the end of the test day (4&#x02009;p.m.), and refrained from any vigorous physical activity starting 24&#x02009;h before each test day.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], with minor modifications to obtain an ATP concentration of &#x0003e;40% (wt:wt) after coating. Placebo pellets were produced in the same manner, but without ATP. To verify the timing of intestinal release, Li<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> (60&#x02009;mg per administration) was added to the pellets. The proximal-release pellets were coated with 30% Eudragit&#x000ae; L30D-55 (ATP or placebo pellets), and the distal-release pellets (ATP only) were coated with 15% Eudragit&#x000ae; FS 30 D (R&#x000f6;hm Pharma, Darmstadt, Germany), mixed with anionic copolymers of methacrylic acid and ethylacrylate (1:1). After coating, the pellets were cured overnight at room temperature at 60% (proximal-release pellets) or 20% (distal-release pellets) humidity, packed in aluminum foil sachets (VaporFlex&#x000ae;, LPS, NJ, USA), sealed at their respective humidity and stored at room temperature.

Samples were collected after 2&#x02009;h in HCl and after 2, 5, 10, 20, 30 and 60&#x02009;min in buffer as described in Huyghebaert et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. ATP and metabolite concentrations were measured by HPLC separation and UV-analysis as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Sample collection during the intervention</title><p>Venous blood was collected from the antecubital vein by a 20 gauge intravenous catheter (Terumo-Europe NV, Leuven, Belgium), connected to a three-way stopcock (Discofix&#x000ae;, Braun Melsungen AG, Melsungen, Germany). Blood was collected into 4&#x02009;mL EDTA tubes (Venosafe, Terumo-Europe NV) by inserting a 21 gauge multisample needle (Venoject Quick Fit, Terumo-Europe NV) into the membrane of a closing cone (IN-Stopper, Braun Melsungen AG) that was attached directly to the stopcock. The anticoagulant EDTA inhibits the extracellular hydrolysis of ATP by Ca<sup>2+</sup>- and Mg<sup>2+</sup>-activated enzymes such as plasma membrane-bound CD39 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. To avoid clotting after each blood collection, approximately 1.5&#x02009;mL of heparinized (50&#x02009;I.E./mL) 0.9% saline was used to rinse the blood collection set-up. It was removed before the next blood collection.</p><p>Three baseline blood samples were collected at 30, 20 and 10&#x02009;min before administration. Starting 30&#x02009;min after pellet administration or 15&#x02009;min after naso-duodenal administration, blood samples were collected every 15&#x02009;min. Between 210 and 420&#x02009;min (pellets) or 270&#x02009;min (naso-duodenal tube) after administration, samples were collected every 30&#x02009;min.

Peak height measurements at 670.8&#x02009;nm wavelength were compared with values for standards of known concentrations (ranging from 2 to 10&#x02009;ng/mL). Initially, 20 &#x003bc;L sample and 5 &#x003bc;L modifier solution (1.2&#x02009;M NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub>) were injected into the top hole of the graphite tube.

The three types of pellets had different release profiles, as was quantified by measuring the AUC (Table&#x02009;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).

As a comparison, ATP was also directly instilled in the small intestine via a naso-duodenal tube. Although the ATP dosage administered in our study (5000&#x02009;mg, or 55.6 - 83.3&#x02009;mg/kg body weight) exceeded those of most other oral administration studies, we observed no changes in whole blood ATP concentrations. Recommended dosages to &#x02018;increase your energy&#x02019; for ATP supplements marketed on the internet usually range from 100&#x02013;250&#x02009;mg per day, which is considerably lower that the dosage we tested. The only other human study that we know of that measured ATP after oral administration of either 150&#x02009;mg or 225&#x02009;mg ATP as enteric coated beadlets, also found no increase in plasma and whole blood ATP concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Kichenin <italic>et al</italic>. orally administered ATP in dosages up to 20&#x02009;mg/kg per day to rabbits and up to 10&#x02009;mg/kg per day to rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. No increases in systemic plasma or erythrocyte ATP concentrations were observed. However, the concentration of ATP in plasma taken from the portal vein of rats increased rapidly up to a 1000-fold after direct instillation of ATP in the small intestine. In humans it is not possible to collect portal vein blood without performing very invasive procedures, and we could therefore not determine this is our study. Intravenous ATP administration in humans ranging in dosage from 36 to 108&#x02009;mg/kg per day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] did lead to substantial increases in ATP concentration in the systemic circulation of up to 60% above baseline. Of the ATP metabolites considered, only uric acid concentrations increased significantly after administration of the proximal-release pellets and of the naso-duodenal tube, but not of the distal-release pellets.</p><p>When ATP is released into the small intestine, ecto-nucleotidase triphosphatase diphosphohydrolases present on the luminal side of intestinal enterocytes dephosphorylate ATP via ADP to AMP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], after which ecto-5&#x02032;-nucleotidase (CD73) degrades AMP to adenosine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. In mice, the terminal ileum is the site in the intestine with the lowest ATPase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Although information on the human intestine is limited, this may explain the difference in plasma uric acid concentrations after ingesting the proximal or distal-release pellets. Concentrative (CNT) and equilibrative (ENT) nucleoside transporters are able to transport nucleosides into the intestinal enterocytes and to the capillary bed of the intestinal villi. CNTs exhibit a proximal-distal gradient with highest transport activities present in the jejunum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Finally, adenosine is taken up by the erythrocytes through ENTs in the erythrocyte membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. <italic>In vivo</italic> studies in animals and humans indicated that inside the erythrocytes adenosine can be used for the synthesis of ATP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In our study, neither ATP nor adenosine concentrations were increased, suggesting that instead of being used for ATP synthesis in the erythrocytes, orally administered ATP is degraded to uric acid by xanthine oxidase, an enzyme which is expressed mainly in the liver and in endothelial cells of blood vessels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Assuming that uric acid is primarily present in the extracellular fluid (the volume of which is approximately 22% of body weight), that the 5000&#x02009;mg ATP is completely broken down to 9.06&#x02009;mmol uric acid, and that there is no loss of uric acid due to excretion, the estimated &#x02018;bioavailability&#x02019; of ATP (defined as the observed uric acid increase as a percentage of the theoretical maximum) was 16.6&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2.3% for the naso-duodenal tube, 14.9&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2.5% for the proximal-release pellets and 3.2&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.6% for the distal-release pellets.</p><p>In our study, the increase in plasma uric acid concentration was similar for the proximal-release pellets and the naso-duodenal tube, indicating complete release of ATP from the pellets. The delay in uric acid increase of about 1&#x02009;h following proximal-release pellet administration compared to naso-duodenal tube administration is probably a combined effect of gastric residence time and the time needed for dissolution of the coating of the pellets. We used enteric pH-sensitive coated pellets because they were previously successfully used for the targeted delivery of various compounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. The pH-sensitive Eudragit&#x000ae; polymer coating provided sufficient gastroresistance, as unwanted <italic>in vitro</italic> release of ATP from the pellets was within the limits set by the USP (i.e. &#x0003c;10% drug release in 2&#x02009;h in 0.1&#x02009;N HCl) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. <italic>In vivo</italic>, the intestinal pH and transit times are the main factors determining the location where each type of coating releases its contents. The duodenum has a pH of 6.4 with a mean transit time to the jejunum of 30&#x02009;min, while in the ileum, the pH rises to 7.4 with a transit time to the colon for pellet dosage forms in fasted individuals of approximately 3&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1&#x02009;h (mean &#x000b1; SD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. The modest rise in uric acid concentration after ingestion of the distal-release pellets may be partly caused by incomplete release in the small intestine, in combination with the limited uptake of ATP once it has entered the colon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Timely release of the contents of the pellets was confirmed by using lithium as a marker. As expected from earlier studies in which lithium was used as a marker [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], the lithium dosage administered to the subjects was safe; the highest plasma lithium concentration amounted to only 17% of the lower therapeutical range advised for patients with bipolar disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Remarkably, higher lithium concentrations were reached after administration of the placebo pellets compared to ATP pellets. Possibly, the higher content of carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), which promotes pellet disintegration by expanding upon contact with water, in the placebo pellets (nearly 100%), compared to the ATP pellets (nearly 50%), resulted in a quicker release of lithium and hence the higher plasma concentration. Another possibility is that the negative charges on the CMC molecule, which promote its exposure to water, are shielded by the sodium-ions in the ATP pellets, thus slowing the swelling of CMC in the pellets and thereby the release of their contents.</p><p>What may be the consequences of increased plasma uric acid concentrations obtained by orally administering ATP? On the one hand, hyperuricemia is a risk factor for gout and is associated with hypertension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. The highest individual uric acid concentration (405&#x02009;&#x003bc;mol/L) we observed, is within the range reported for male non-gouty individuals (179&#x02013;440&#x02009;&#x003bc;mol/L) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. No adverse effects were observed during the study. The short-lasting increase in uric acid concentration found in the current study is not likely to cause any symptoms of gout or hypertension, since these require a prolonged period of severe increase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. On the other hand, high uric acid concentrations have also been associated with beneficial health effects. Uric acid may function as an antioxidant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>], and epidemiological studies have shown that healthy subjects with high uric acid concentrations are at a reduced risk for developing Parkinson&#x02019;s disease, a condition suspected to be instigated by oxidative damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Furthermore, patients with multiple sclerosis are known to have lower uric acid concentrations than healthy volunteers, and raising the uric acid concentration by pharmacological means has been the subject of recent investigation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Although increasing the uric acid concentration pharmacologically using ATP pellets might have benefits for certain individuals, these have to be weighed against increased risks of gout and possibly cardiovascular disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>A single dose of oral ATP supplement is not bioavailable, whether administered as proximal-release or distal-release enteric coated pellets, or directly instilled in the small-intestine. This may explain why several studies did not find ergogenic effects of oral ATP supplementation. An on average 50% increase in uric acid concentration was found with the proximal-release pellets and with the naso-duodenal tube, suggesting that ATP or one of its metabolites is absorbed, but immediately metabolized before becoming available to the body. Uric acid itself may have beneficial effects, but this needs further study. Also, more studies are needed to determine whether chronic administration of ATP will enhance its oral bioavailability.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>AAS, Atomic absorption spectrophotometer; ADP, Adenosine 5&#x02032;-diphosphate; AMP, Adenosine 5&#x02032;-monophosphate; ATP, Adenosine 5&#x02032;-triphosphate; AUC, Area under the curve; CD73, Ecto-5&#x02032;-nucleotidase; carboxymethylcellulose; CNT, Concentrative nucleoside transporter; ENT, Equilibrative nucleoside transporter; PCA, Perchloric acid; TCA, Trichloroacetic acid.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>ICWA participated in the design and data analysis of the study, and drafted the manuscript, EJCMC carried out the human intervention study, participated in the data analysis and drafted the manuscript, MJLB participated in the design of the study and helped to draft the manuscript, NH produced the pellets and carried out the dissolution experiments, MACH participated in the design of the study and helped to draft the manuscript, AB participated in the design and conception of the study and helped to draft the manuscript, PCD conceived of the study, participated in the design and coordination of the study, and helped to draft the manuscript.
