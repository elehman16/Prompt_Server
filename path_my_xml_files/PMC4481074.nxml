Randomization of time to intervention initiation was stratified by health centre TB case rate. The ACF intervention included provider-initiated home visits of all new sputum smear positive TB patients in order to evaluate household contacts for active TB.

High quality RCTs require particularly stringent study contexts in order to optimize their internal validity. For many public health interventions, particularly those deployed in low-resource settings, efficacy findings from rigorous research contexts do not necessarily align with those observed under the conditions and contexts in which the intervention is to be operationalized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Pragmatic RCTs were initially conceived to allow for the inclusion of a more realistic study environment, for example including the intervention&#x02019;s study population. Nevertheless, these studies are limited in their ability to approximate the true, real-world effectiveness of a public health intervention once it is assimilated into routine public health practice or implemented on a large-scale across populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>In practice, public health interventions may be rapidly deployed on the basis of weak or limited pre-existing trial data if they are believed to be of more benefit than harm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. However, the decision to undertake a large-scale roll out of a new public health intervention requires a corresponding investment of public resources. Depending on the type of intervention, this investment could range from costs of increasing the number trained public health staff to costs of programmatic materials including diagnostic tests or disease treatments. Therefore, public health interventions should be evaluated as they are implemented and embedded into local health infrastructure in order to examine the contextual effectiveness and to appropriately support evidence-based public health decision-making [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>The stepped-wedge variant of the cluster randomized controlled trial (CRCT) is increasingly used in pragmatic studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In a classic parallel CRCT design commonly used in community intervention effectiveness trials, groups of individuals or clusters (e.g. health centres) are randomly assigned to either the intervention or control arm for the entire study period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. In the stepped-wedge CRCT design, clusters are randomly assigned to start the intervention at different times (unidirectional cross-over trial) so that by the end of the follow-up period all clusters have initiated the intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The integration of a staggered initiation time of the intervention in the stepped-wedge design is particularly useful if withholding the intervention is not considered equitable or for when it is difficult logistically to simultaneously initiate an intervention over a large population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. However, very few published studies using a stepped-wedge design have been undertaken in the context of infectious disease control programs or for interventions embedded within routine public health systems in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Amongst these, even fewer have shared information on the design, planning, implementation, strengths, challenges and practical issues encountered in undertaking the stepped-wedge design in this context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>In 2012, the World Health Organization (WHO) released its first comprehensive recommendations for screening all household contacts (HCs) of persons with infectious pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) in LMICs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. This new guideline is in response to slow declines in TB rates and the increasing concern of TB drug resistant strains spread in areas with well-established directly observed treatment strategies (DOTS). Until recently in LMICs, DOTS focus primarily on the adequate management of TB cases once they self-report for diagnosis; recommended screening was prioritized for select high-risk groups such as children&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;5&#x000a0;years old or individuals co-infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Despite these new expanded recommendations, a substantial gap in evidence regarding the effectiveness of household contact tracing within routine LMIC TB programs remains. In recognition of this limitation, the WHO recommendations called for operational studies of household and close contact tracing activities, including through stepped-wedge designed studies, to help guide future recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. We designed a pragmatic stepped-wedge CRCT for active case finding among HCs of index TB cases in comparison with the detection of secondary TB cases using the routine passive detection of TB cases. The strengths, challenges and practical issues of implementing the stepped-wedge design are discussed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study context</title><p>TB is caused by the pathogen <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> which is spread primarily when a smear-positive (i.e. high bacillary load in sputum samples) pulmonary TB case coughs or exhales aerosolized droplets which are then inhaled by their close contacts. Household contacts (HCs) of smear-positive TB patients are at greater risk for acquiring TB infection and disease than the general community because of their duration and proximity of contact to infectious cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p>DOTS refers to both a TB treatment program (including the direct observation of short-course therapy for treatment) and the first component of WHO&#x02019;s global STOP TB control strategy adopted by many national TB programs (NTPs) globally, including in Peru. Since the early 1990&#x02019;s, Peru has run an established DOTS program that has consistently met WHO operational performance indicator targets. Despite a standardized operational DOTS program, the goal of TB elimination in Peru remains elusive. In addition to new diagnostics, therapeutics and the current passive detection of TB cases using sputum microscopy, expanding case finding activities is of particular interest where the basic core NTP program has been implemented, as is the case in Peru.</p><p>In 2013, Peru reported an average TB incidence of 99 per 100,000 population, which is amongst the highest in the Americas. Unlike the TB epidemic in Sub-Saharan Africa, HIV is not a primary driver of the epidemic in Peru (HIV rates among TB cases are &#x0003c;3&#x000a0;%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. In 2010, over 1,800 new cases of TB (170 per 100,000 population) were identified in San Juan de Lurigancho (SJL), Northern Lima&#x02019;s most densely population and largest district (population: 900,000, area: 131.25&#x000a0;km<sup>2</sup>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. In SJL, nearly 30&#x000a0;% of health centres reported an incidence ranging between 200 and 400 per 100,000 population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p>The Peruvian Ministry of Health operates its NTP in SJL through 34 health care facilities (20 community health clinics (CHCs), 14 health posts) and 1 hospital [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. The NTP DOTS program, including TB treatment, follow-up visits, management of clinical and programmatic records and counseling occur within a designated outpatient TB program office within each of these health care facilities. The routine public health system in SJL includes the self reporting of HCs of TB cases for symptom screening. In 2010, over 60&#x000a0;% of eligible HCs presented to district clinics for TB screening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. In each health centre, typically a physician, nurse and nurse&#x02019;s aide are responsible for the TB program activities. In smaller health centres with fewer TB cases, the staff is responsible for multiple public health programs within the centre, while in larger centres with numerous TB cases, full-time staff are allocated to the TB programs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Intervention arm</title><p>In the intervention arm, The SJL NTP program initiated an active case finding (ACF) program, entitled &#x0201c;<italic>Familia saludables de contactos de tuberculosis</italic>&#x0201d;or &#x0201c;Healthy Families of TB Cases&#x0201d;, which includes visits by a TB program nurse to households of all newly diagnosed smear-positive TB cases enrolled in DOTS treatment within an SJL NTP clinic (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). During the home visit, NTP staff evaluates all HCs for symptoms of active TB.

Contamination between clinics was considered to be minimal, as cases and contacts are required to initiate TB treatment within the clinic catchment area of their primary residence, primarily for administrative reasons.

Indeed such collaborations at the outset of operational studies, like the stepped-wedge CRCT in SJL, are crucial to their success. During the planning stages, a partnership of NTP programmers with local and international researchers was formed with the common goal of estimating the added benefit of actively evaluating HCs of TB cases for disease compared to the existing DOTS TB strategy of symptomatic individuals self-reporting for evaluation (standard of care). NTP programmers highlighted the importance of having a rapid intervention rollout in order to meet annual programmatic targets and to demonstrate public health action across all health centres in their jurisdiction. Typically in many RCT designs, only half of the included study health centers would be assigned to the intervention arm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Researchers emphasized the need to plan study design aspects such as random assignment, sufficient study sample size in intervention or control arms and supervision of health workers to ensure high quality implementation and sound data management. The stepped-wedge design most aligned with stakeholder needs, including the introduction of randomized crossover times and allowing NTP programmers to oversee a controlled implementation of the intervention across all health centres [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. This novel design is considered particularly useful in the implementation of public health interventions, given the phased implementation steps. However stepped-wedge designs are relatively new, and many programmatic managers may be unfamiliar with their ability to yield methodologically valid and informative results. Finally, an upfront understanding of the utility of this implementation design is needed so findings of this study would considered by local decision makers hearing of the stepped-wedge CRCT design for the first time.</p><p>Researchers can advise on methodological design issues in order to meet the needs of the research question, however in order to understand the operational research aspects of the protocol, gaining a thorough understanding of the local daily operations of the TB program at the health centre level is a key aspect to the design of this protocol. This knowledge included understanding of how contact investigations are undertaken routinely, how the intervention will be applied in local NTP centres, and how monitoring, supervision and data collection could be undertaken feasibly throughout the study period.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Strengths and challenges of the stepped-wedge design</title><p>The stepped-wedge design is particularly useful in this study due to the required widescale roll-out of this public health intervention. In SJL, the systematic stepped-wedge implementation of a provider-initiated ACF program amongst HCs of TB cases provides new evidence, where previously very limited pre-existing effectiveness data are available and few, if any, have been measured within the local public health program in a TB endemic area.</p><p>While the staggered intervention initiation times increase the flexibility of the stepped-wedge design in practice, it also requires understanding of the methodological complexities involved. A stepped-wedge allows for a degree of flexibility in its design, such as the number of centres at initiation, and enough time between wedges to provide training and achieve enough study power. However, this design is still subject to biases and threats to sample size and study power. Determining the number of clusters, the number of steps and time-frame for rollout must all be predetermined and require special consideration. If the composition of clusters to be randomized at each crossover time point is unbalanced, this could result in skewed increases or decreases in the measured outcomes. For example, if all high TB rate centres were to cross over at the first time point and all low TB rate centres cross over at the last time point, this could result in a skewed numbers of secondary TB outcomes in HCs observed earlier and for a longer time period of the study. A simple stratification for the randomization of health centres by TB rate at each crossover time point is used in the current protocol to account for TB burden and as a proxy for the corresponding size of clinics to evenly distribute centres across the various wedges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p>A common challenge for many operational research designed studies is that blinding of the intervention assignment is not possible. In the current protocol, health centres awaiting crossover may have anticipated their likely crossover time based on the number of health centres that have already initiated the intervention. Additionally, the public health intervention is undertaken by health centre staff, who along with patients, know whether or not they have initiated the intervention. In our study, contamination between clusters, though possible, is not a major concern as TB patients and their HCs must attend the health centre of the catchment area to which their primary residence is registered.</p><p>The selection of a stepped-wedge design is considered optimal in the context of logistical, feasibility and resource challenges. However, the stepped-wedge design of a population-based implementation does not necessarily require fewer research or programmatic resources to undertake adequately compared to other study designs. In the current protocol, given a study period spanning 20&#x000a0;months, resources were required for monitoring the full implementation of the intervention across all centers for the entire time frame. These include study resources for data quality monitoring, training and supervision of the intervention, and data extraction from health centre charts throughout the full study period. While all operational research studies are subject to these challenges, it is a consideration in the implementation of a stepped-wedge design study where intervention cross over times occurs over a long period. If certain centres or the entire district interrupt the intervention in health centres for unforeseen circumstances, such as personnel strikes, public health outbreaks or other political challenges, then data collection, quality and completeness could suffer and at minimum require adjustment in the study time lines and addition of resources to complete data collection or worse, could lead to imbalances or biases in the overall stepped-wedge designed study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Strengths and challenges to the stepped-wedge design during implementation within a routine TB program</title><p>There are several advantages and disadvantages to designing a pragmatic stepped-wedge CRCT for operational research within a routine public health program. A unique feature of the current protocol is the use of routine NTP program staff. The stepped-wedge approach using NTP personnel provides an evaluation of intervention effectiveness within actual programmatic conditions and therefore, may be more representatives then a study using strictly dedicated highly trained research personnel. The ability to sustainably integrate the intervention into the program during the study period was facilitated given the intervention was presented as a function of the routine program and not a study specific responsibility. The stepped-wedge implementation provides a useful tool to be able to logistically implement the study, allowing for targeted training within small groups as they initiate the intervention.</p><p>Public health interventions are complex and context dependent, as they are integrated within the infrastructure of existing health systems, dependent on local political, socioeconomic and cultural perspectives of the population and its public health practitioners [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The use of routine NTP nurses and physicians adds a complexity given that this intervention of household contact tracing is conducted within the context of numerous other responsibilities of the health centre staff. TB programs are impacted by complex treatment management protocols for active TB cases, a high burden of cases in endemic areas and numerous administrative programmatic activities (e.g., reporting forms, indicators, record keeping). Therefore, effective implementation requires planning, high quality training and active monitoring. These factors are better achieved when programs are initiated in a manageable number of sites; the stepped-wedge design allows for flexibility in determining the number of sites initiating a new program at any one time. This aspect is particularly valuable when beginning the new program in all or half of all sites would not be feasible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. The randomized allocation of centres to the crossover time point also eliminates preferential assignments due to either health centres&#x02019; performance evaluations or other subjective criteria. In the context of the current study, health centre NTP staff appeared motivated and engaged in training and preparation for the intervention once it is known that all centres will have to implement the new program and undergo the same intensive training, monitoring and evaluation processes, instead of some targeted added work assigned only to half of the centres.</p><p>Adherence or fidelity to the program and whether the intervention, in its intended form, is systematically applied by staff within a health centre is a distinct challenge particularly in pragmatic trials where routine program staff are undertaking the new intervention as part of their normal duties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. From an analytic perspective, intention-to-treat analysis (ITT) is generally the preferred analytic strategy for CRCTs, which considers outcomes based on the random allocation to the intervention arm, regardless of what happened subsequent to assignment. In practice, if there is no reported difference in effectiveness between intervention and control arms, conclusions need to consider whether the ineffectiveness of the intervention is the cause or if possible low adherence of implementers to the intervention is the more likely explanation. To examine this latter possibility, per protocol analyses, which consider actual adherence to the intervention, will also be examined in our study.</p><p>Several challenges can occur in undertaking a research study within the daily operations of a public health program, in addition to high staff turnover, worker strikes, outbreaks in other disease areas, and authorization requirements for data access. These substantial issues lead to interruptions of activities, which may not be encountered in studies using dedicated research staff. While planning and design of the stepped-wedge can help to control some of these threats, in some instances these cannot be completely avoided or controlled. The probability of an interruption occurring increase and should be expected when study periods are projected over several months within a routine operational TB program. However, dealing with unforeseen events is a common reality for most public health settings, and the evaluation of the intervention within a pragmatic setting could reflect its likely effectiveness once integrated into practice.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Concluding remarks</title><p>Stepped-wedge designs provide an important option for public health researchers and practitioners to generate intervention effectiveness data that otherwise could remain unmeasured. Typically, stepped-wedge designs are justified when feasibility, logistics and/or limited resources are important practical considerations while still allowing for a randomization process as part of the operational research. Overall, there is no indication that a stepped-wedge design requires fewer resources than other designs; the design requires resources over a longer period of time, yet involves smaller resources for training and monitoring at any given time point during the study. Finally, fidelity or adherence to the intervention may need to be considered during implementation and in the analysis, in order to correctly interpret null or negligible findings of effectiveness.</p><p>The current ongoing study will provide invaluable evidence on contextual factors that would not have been possible in traditional study designs. The findings of this study will have implications for the selection of interventions and allocation of resources in TB programming for Peru, and will be a major contribution in the field of TB prevention and TB contact tracing in LMICs.</p></sec></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>RCT</term><def><p>Randomized Controlled Trial</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CRCT</term><def><p>Cluster Randomized Controlled Trial, WHO, World Health Organization</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DOTS</term><def><p>Directly Observed Therapy Shortcourses</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LMICs</term><def><p>Low and Middle-Income Countries</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HIV</term><def><p>Human Immunodeficiency Virus</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NTP</term><def><p>National TB Program</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HCs</term><def><p>Household Contacts</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ACF</term><def><p>Active Case Finding</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PCF</term><def><p>Passive Case Finding</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ITT</term><def><p>Intention-to-treat</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>INH</term><def><p>Isoniazid</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>LS, MRP, TFB and EG conceived and designed the study.
