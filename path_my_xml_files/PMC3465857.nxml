<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref> In both trials, belimumab 10 mg/kg plus standard SLE therapy met the primary endpoint of significantly higher SLE Responder Index (SRI) response rates at week 52 than with placebo plus standard SLE therapy. In addition, a multivariate analysis of the combined clinical data from both BLISS trials indicated that certain baseline characteristics of patients with SLE (eg, high disease activity [Safety of Estrogens in Lupus National Assessment&#x02013;Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SELENA-SLEDAI) score &#x02265;10], anti-dsDNA positivity, low complement levels and prednisone use) were associated with a greater response to belimumab compared with standard therapy alone as measured by the SRI response at week 52.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></p><p>The SRI is a composite responder index that includes one measure of disease activity improvement (ie, &#x02265;4-point decrease in SELENA&#x02013;SLEDAI).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref> Also included in the SRI are two measures to ensure that improvement in disease activity is not offset by worsening of the patient's overall health status (ie, &#x0003c;0.3-point increase from baseline in the Physician's Global Assessment score) or by worsening of disease in organ systems (ie, no new British Isles Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG) A domain score or no more than one new B score). In the present exploratory analysis, the effects of 1 year of belimumab treatment on organ domains, as assessed by the SELENA&#x02013;SLEDAI<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref> and BILAG<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref> scoring systems, were analysed in patients participating in the two phase III trials.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="s1"><title>Methods</title><p>BLISS-52 (n=865) and BLISS-76 (n=819) were randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled, international, multicentre trials that compared belimumab 1 and 10 mg/kg plus standard SLE therapy with placebo plus standard therapy in patients with seropositive SLE. The trials had similar designs, which have been described previously.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref> In brief, at screening all patients had a SELENA&#x02013;SLEDAI score of 6 or greater, were seropositive for antinuclear antibody (&#x02265;1:80) and/or anti-dsDNA antibody (&#x02265;30 IU/ml), and had received a stable regimen of standard therapy for 30 days or more before the study. Standard therapy was not protocol defined; rather, it consisted of background medications (including corticosteroids, and immunosuppressive and antimalarial agents) previously chosen by the physician for individual patients that did not violate protocol restrictions.</p><p>Belimumab or placebo was infused intravenously on days 0, 14 and 28, and then every 28 days to week 48 (BLISS-52) or week 72 (BLISS-76).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref> Patients with severe active lupus nephritis or severe active central nervous system (CNS) manifestations were excluded from the studies. Changes in concomitant corticosteroid, immunosuppressive and antimalarial medications were progressively restricted over the course of both trials. The primary endpoint in both trials, SRI response rate at week 52, was an evaluation of treatment effect. The trial was not designed or powered to determine efficacy in any specific organ system. No organ system manifestations, other than serological activity (immunological), were enriched a priori in the studies. Efficacy assessments included changes in SELENA&#x02013;SLEDAI and BILAG scores every 4 weeks. As the two phase III trials were similar in design and the primary endpoint was met in both, data across the trials were pooled in this post-hoc analysis to increase precision.</p><p>SELENA&#x02013;SLEDAI domains were determined based on the SLEDAI analysis of Bombardier <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref> in which the 24 individual items are grouped into nine organ systems including dermal, which is henceforth described as mucocutaneous for comparison with the similar BILAG domain. Improvement in SELENA&#x02013;SLEDAI organ domains was defined as a reduction in total domain scores in patients with organ domain involvement at baseline, whereas worsening was defined as any increase in scores in patients with or without organ domain involvement at baseline. The proportions of patients who improved or worsened in each of the organ domains from baseline to week 52 were summarised by treatment group. In addition, the improvements in SELENA&#x02013;SLEDAI organ domains were evaluated by an adjusted mean SELENA&#x02013;SLEDAI analysis over 52 weeks.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref> The adjusted mean SELENA&#x02013;SLEDAI is equivalent to the area under the curve of SELENA&#x02013;SLEDAI over time divided by the time interval.</p><p>The BILAG organ systems were determined by the classic BILAG index.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref> Organ domain involvement by BILAG was defined as an A or B score. Improvement in BILAG organ domains during the study was defined as a step down to a B, C or D score in patients with an A or B score at baseline; worsening was defined as a step up in score from B, C, D or E at baseline to an A or B score. In addition to the summaries of the proportions with improvement and worsening, the proportion of patients who improved one step (eg, improvement from A to B or B to C) or three steps (eg, improvement from A to D) in a given organ domain from A or B at baseline to week 52 was evaluated.</p><p>For both BILAG and SELENA&#x02013;SLEDAI, patients who withdrew from the study or received protocol-prohibited medications were considered to have no improvement in the improvement analyses, and missing data were analysed using the last observation carried forward method in the worsening analyses. As the studies were not designed to examine the treatment effect of belimumab on individual organ domains, all reported p values are nominal. Improvement and worsening rates were compared between each of the belimumab groups and the placebo group using logistic regression adjusted by study effect. For organ domains with low event counts (n&#x02264;5), the analysis was performed using Fisher's exact test.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3"><title>Baseline characteristics</title><p>Baseline demographics and disease characteristics were similar across treatment groups and between BLISS-52 and BLISS-76 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">table 1</xref>).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>

The most frequently affected organ domains were musculoskeletal (BILAG 59.9%; SELENA&#x02013;SLEDAI 65.4%), mucocutaneous (BILAG 58.8%; SELENA&#x02013;SLEDAI 81.9 %) and immunological (SELENA&#x02013;SLEDAI 79.5%). CNS and renal involvement were relatively uncommon at baseline because of the exclusion of patients with severe active lupus nephritis or severe active CNS manifestations.

Although both SELENA&#x02013;SLEDAI and BILAG were incorporated in the SRI, the former was used to evaluate efficacy, whereas the latter was used to record organ-specific worsening. In this post-hoc analysis of pooled data from the two phase III trials, the two disease activity instruments were used to evaluate both organ domain improvement and worsening.</p><p>The BLISS-52 and BLISS-76 trials, as well as the current post-hoc analysis of pooled data, were neither designed nor powered to demonstrate the efficacy of belimumab treatment in individual organ domains.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref> This analysis, however, showed that more patients treated with belimumab than with placebo had improvements, and fewer had worsening across several BILAG and SELENA&#x02013;SLEDAI organ domains. In general, the findings with BILAG and SELENA&#x02013;SLEDAI were consistent across the two indices. In particular, both indices indicated more improvement in patients treated with either belimumab dose than with placebo in the mucocutaneous and musculoskeletal domains, which were among the most commonly affected domains at baseline (82% and 65% by SELENA&#x02013;SLEDAI, and 59% and 60% by BILAG, respectively). Belimumab treatment was also associated with greater rates of improvement in the SELENA&#x02013;SLEDAI immunological domain, the second most frequently affected domain on that index. In addition, more patients on belimumab had improvements in three or more organ systems than on standard SLE therapy alone. There were fewer patients treated with belimumab plus standard therapy than standard therapy alone who had worsening in the haematological domains as measured by both SELENA&#x02013;SLEDAI (10 mg/kg) and BILAG (1 mg/kg), as well as in the immunological domain as measured by SELENA&#x02013;SLEDAI (10 mg/kg).</p><p>Improvement was noted in vasculitis with both disease activity indices. Conclusions regarding improvement or worsening in rare organ manifestations are, however, limited by the small sample sizes. Vasculitis at baseline was described as primarily cutaneous based on BILAG items scored at baseline. Furthermore, for the CNS and renal domains, conclusions are limited by the exclusion of patients with severe lupus nephritis or severe CNS manifestations from the two trials.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></p><p>The haematological domain showed similar rates of improvement in all three treatment groups as measured by BILAG, and in the placebo and belimumab 1 mg/kg group as measured by SELENA&#x02013;SLEDAI. The rate of response with belimumab 10 mg/kg was lower than with placebo, although there were similar proportions of patients with grades 1&#x02013;4 leucopenia, lymphopenia, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia at baseline, and after 52 weeks of therapy. The lower response in the 10 mg/kg group was not significantly different and was most likely due to the small sample size with haematological involvement (n=129; 7.7% of the total population), and may be related to the higher proportion of patients with belimumab versus placebo who had leucopenia at baseline and were on immunosuppressive agents (63% vs 36%).</p><p>A limitation of this post-hoc analysis is the small sample size of some organ system manifestations and not correcting for multiple comparisons. These two factors could have led to spurious results with regard to improvement or worsening, particularly in the organ systems with less than 10% of the total population. Further study in these less common manifestations would be needed to evaluate the potential belimumab treatment effect properly.</p><p>Multivariate analysis of the pooled BLISS-52 and BLISS-76 data identified high disease activity (SELENA&#x02013;SLEDAI score &#x02265;10), anti-dsDNA positivity, low complement 3 or 4 levels and prednisone use at baseline as being predictors of a better SRI response with belimumab plus standard therapy than with standard therapy alone.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref> Post-hoc analysis suggested that patients with high serological activity (ie, both anti-dsDNA positivity and low complement 3 or 4 levels; 52% of the study population) have higher disease activity, and may have greater magnitudes of SRI response and individual organ domain improvement with belimumab than with standard therapy alone. These results are consistent with the improvement noted in the immunological domain (decrease in anti-dsDNA autoantibodies, or increase in complement 3 or 4 levels), as well as the reductions in other autoantibodies, or selected B-cell and plasma cell subsets observed in the BLISS trials.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref> Although the most commonly affected organ domains (ie, mucocutaneous, musculoskeletal and immunological) improved with belimumab therapy, there were also responses detected in the CNS, renal and vasculitis domains that are often associated with high disease activity (SELENA&#x02013;SLEDAI score &#x02265;10), which supports the observations in the multivariate analysis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></p><p>In conclusion, a post-hoc analysis of patients from the BLISS-52 and BLISS-76 trials found that treatment with belimumab plus standard SLE therapy was effective in the organ systems most commonly affected at study entry, including the musculoskeletal, mucocutaneous and immunological domains. The treatment effect with belimumab remained after removal of the contribution of these three common organ domains, or both the musculoskeletal and mucocutaneous domains, to SELENA&#x02013;SLEDAI scoring. These results demonstrate that the responses observed in the two phase III studies were not driven by effects on a single organ domain. Rather belimumab had effects on multiple organ systems.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Editorial support (writing assistance, assembling tables and figures, collating author comments, grammatical editing, and referencing) was provided by Matt Stenger and Eleanore Gross of BioScience Communications, New York, NY, USA.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="con"><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> All authors have read and approved the manuscript.
