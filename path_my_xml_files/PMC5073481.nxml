Offering human papillomavirus (HPV) self-sampling in place of Papanicolaou (Pap) testing may eventually increase screening participation and reduce cervical cancer rates in this population.</p></sec><sec><title>Design</title><p>A community-randomised controlled screening trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Setting</title><p>First Nations communities in Northwest Ontario, Canada.</p></sec><sec><title>Participants</title><p>Women aged between 25 and 69, living in Robinson Superior Treaty First Nations.

One community withdrew, leaving 5 communities in each group (834 eligible women). Participation was &#x0003c;25%. Using clustered intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis, initial and cumulative averaged uptakes in arm A were 1.4-fold (20% vs 14.3%, p=0.628) and 1.3-fold (20.6% vs 16%, p=0.694) higher compared to arm B, respectively. Corresponding per protocol (PP) analysis indicates 2.2-fold (22.9% vs 10.6%, p=0.305) and 1.6-fold (22.9% vs 14.1%, p=0.448) higher uptakes in arm A compared to arm B. Screening uptake varied between communities (range 0&#x02013;62.1%). Among women who completed a questionnaire (18.3% in arm A, 21.7% in arm B), the screening uptake was 1.8-fold (ITT; p=0.1132) or 3-fold (PP; p&#x0003c;0.01) higher in arm A versus arm B.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Pap and HPV self-sampling were compared in a marginalised, Canadian population. Results indicated a preference for self-sampling.

<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> In an Argentinian, cluster-randomised, controlled trial, self-sample collection resulted in a 4-fold higher screening uptake than HPV sampling performed by a clinician<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> and we hypothesised that a similar approach could potentially increase screening uptake within Northwest Ontario First Nations communities that have above-average cervical cancer rates.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p><p>In populations such as First Nations, community-based participatory action research (PAR) is recognised to be an appropriate approach as it focuses on community engagement, collaboration and reflection throughout the process design, implementation and dissemination of the research.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Accordingly, the Anishinaabek Cervical Cancer Screening Study (ACCSS), using a unique mixed methods approach, was developed with 11 partner communities in Northwest Ontario, Canada. The main objective was to assess whether, within a PAR framework, screening participation increases in the First Nations population when HPV self-sampling instead of Pap testing is offered. After conducting interviews as well as focus groups with healthcare providers (HCPs) and women living on reserves about cervical cancer screening barriers (qualitative component),<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16&#x02013;18</xref> we performed a community-randomised controlled trial (quantitative component).

Each arm consisted of a first offer of a screening modality in phase I lasting 3&#x02005;months, followed by a 1&#x02013;2-month intervention break, and finally the phase II cross-over period in which women were offered the alternate screening method. In the intervention group (arm A), women were first offered HPV testing using self-sampling and in the control group (arm B), women were first offered Pap testing. CBRAs invited women to participate in the ACCSS trial after an educational event and other recruitment strategies (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3">supplementary table A</xref>). CBRAs obtained written informed (individual) consent from the participants and helped them to complete baseline and follow-up questionnaires.</p><p>For HPV DNA testing, the CBRAs provided the self-sampling kits and the participants were asked how they wished to be contacted in the event of a positive HPV test result. If a participant was found to have a high-risk infection (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3">supplementary table B</xref>), she was referred for a follow-up (Pap test). For Pap testing, CBRAs scheduled appointments either directly with HCPs or through Well-Women clinics. Sample collection, processing, communication and follow-up were performed according to the Ontario Cervical Screening protocol for primary care practitioners.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Outcomes</title><p>The primary outcomes of the trial were initial and cumulative screening uptakes as well as participant psychosocial status. Initial screening uptake was defined as the number of women who provided informed consent, completed a baseline questionnaire (online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">supplementary protocol appendix</xref>) and provided a self-sample or underwent a Pap test following the initial screening offer, divided by the eligible number of women registered in their community as of January 2014.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> For cumulative screening uptake, the numerator was defined as for initial uptake, except that participation was in either the initial or the subsequent screening offer; the denominator was defined as above. Psychosocial status included domains of worries/concerns about cancer, self-efficacy and external factors. A secondary outcome reported comfort with the screening experience.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Sample size and power estimations</title><p>When designing the ACCSS trial, data regarding cervical cancer screening rates in Ontario Indigenous women were not available. As First Nations women in Ontario are twice as likely to develop cervical cancer compared to the mainstream population,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> we calculated that the proportion of women eligible to be screened in First Nations communities in Northwest Ontario, and who had a Pap test in the previous 3&#x02005;years, was half the general population uptake of 45%, that is, 22.5%. Previous studies report that between 32% and 58% (mean 45%) of women who have not had a Pap test during the last 6&#x02005;years accepted an offer of self-sampling.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25&#x02013;27</xref> We estimated three scenarios to illustrate the range of power we might have with a given sample size of &#x0223c;1000 women: (1) no change in screening uptake in the arm initially offered Pap testing, uptake 45% higher in the other arm, that is, 32.5%; (2) uptake in the arm initially offered Pap testing 30%, and 43.5% in the other arm; and (3) uptake in the arm initially offered Pap testing 45%, and 65.3% in the other arm. If clustering were disregarded in the power calculations, then, with &#x0223c;500 participants per arm, at 5% &#x003b1; level, the trial would have an average power of &#x0003e;96% to detect a difference in uptake for all three scenarios. Because of the potential for individuals' responses to the interventions within communities to be correlated, clustering had to be taken into account. Previous work on intracluster correlation (ICC) in the situation of variable cluster size<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28&#x02013;30</xref> suggests that the ICC would likely be less than the estimated maximum values (scenario 1: 0.0063, scenario 2: 0.0158, scenario 3: 0.0461), meaning that a sample size of 500 participants per arm would be adequate to achieve 80% power.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Randomisation</title><p>We stratified communities according to size (small, medium and large) and randomly assigned them to the first offer intervention type within their strata. Using band registration numbers from January 2013,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> we defined a small community as &#x02264;360 total registered females, a medium community as between 361 and 910 total registered females and a large community as more than 910 total registered females. There were seven medium communities, three small communities and one large community. By conducting a stratified randomisation, we intended for approximately equivalent numbers of women to be offered screening in each arm. We randomised communities instead of individuals, to build on the community engagement element of the project as well as to reduce contamination between the control group (those who were first offered Pap testing) and the intervention group (those who were first offered the HPV self-test). A research assistant external to the Research Team performed the randomisation. First, we randomly assigned the seven medium sized communities. To do so, each community was assigned a random number and then those with the four highest numbers were placed into one arm and the remaining three into the other arm. We then applied the same approach to the three smaller communities. Finally, we placed the one large community in the arm with only three medium-sized communities in it.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>Screening uptake was determined by intention-to-treat (ITT) and per protocol (PP) analyses, in recognition of limitations with both approaches.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31&#x02013;35</xref> Thus, in the ITT analysis, women from a community that terminated its participation in the trial were <italic>included</italic> in the analysis as having no screening uptake.

Psychosocial scores were obtained by calculating a mean score of all completed items for each respondent (after reverse-coding items 2, 4 and 8). We compared PP community-averaged baseline scores obtained at the time of intervention rollout in each community between the arms, irrespective of whether the women had accepted the offer of a screening test. We intended that this would reflect the response to the educational and engagement component of the intervention at the community level. We computed means and 95% CIs (as described above), and tested for the difference between the arms by a permutation test. In a descriptive analysis, we computed the scores at follow-up time points 1 and 2 between the arms, regardless of community, to assess psychosocial scores before and after screening. We also compared scores between screened and not screened women.</p><p>We applied standard descriptive statistics to the non-clustered data, sociodemographic characteristics, health status and health service use as well as comfort with either screening modality.

Approximately two-thirds of all participating women reported that they had had a Pap test in the 3-year interval prior to completion of the baseline questionnaire. No significant difference in recent Pap history between arm A and B (p=0.796) or stratified according to women screened or not screened within arm A (p=0.756) and arm B (p=0.899) was noted, as assessed by the Mantel-Haenszel &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>The ACCSS is the first mixed methods study under a PAR framework to <italic>qualitatively</italic> and <italic>quantitatively</italic> investigate cervical screening behaviours of First Nations women in Canada.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> We have been mindful to engage the partner communities throughout the research process to initiate a cancer screening culture reflecting the Anishinaabek &#x02018;Pimatisiwin&#x02019; (good life based on good health) philosophy which included the implementation of a cervical screening trial comparing two screening modalities. We hypothesised that in a marginalised population with high cervical cancer rates and low screening participation, HPV self-sampling may be an appealing alternative to Pap testing. We reasoned that empowering women to take their own samples may help overcome some of the structural and cultural barriers First Nations women face when attending cervical screening<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02014;a re-affirmed notion and deemed to be culturally appropriate by our community informants during the qualitative phase of the ACCSS.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>
<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> DNA integrity from self-samples was excellent&#x02014;an important factor to emphasise when promoting this screening method as some women reported being anxious that they were not taking their self-sample correctly. Greater than 95% of the samples could be HPV-tested and typed, confirming our earlier pilot data.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Except for the higher employment rate, the sociodemographic characteristics of women who accepted the offer of screening and/or completed a questionnaire were similar to those of the region's Indigenous populations.<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>
<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> For instance, using food security responses as a proxy, we noticed higher, self-reported, impoverished living conditions compared to the general population.<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></p><p>The average screening uptake was less than a quarter for either screening modality, which may be related to not being aware of the benefit of screening, general fear of cancer and colonial legacy (eg, mistrust of the healthcare system). The estimated screening uptake was achieved only in two communities of arm A and in one community of arm B. Notably, the uptake in each participating community varied considerably, and only clustered PP analysis of screening uptake relative to the number of women in each community who completed a questionnaire showed statistical significance in favour of HPV self-sampling. However, the absolute difference in uptake in favour of HPV self-sampling was close to (ITT) or even twice (PP) our a priori estimation. A similar increase in uptake of HPV self-sampling over Pap testing was obtained for European and North American underscreened women,<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> underscoring its benefits for cervical screening participation. A shift in the comfort level was noted in favour of HPV self-sampling in the current study. A deeper, qualitative analysis comparing HPV self-sampling with HCP-administered Pap cytology is still needed and is currently under way by the ACCSS team.</p><p>The large variability in the screening uptake within communities was equally noted for both arms, implying that the modality offered is not the only means to increase screening participation in our target population. Indeed, our data and the statement of one CBRA: &#x0201c;Easier for me, small community, I knew everyone who was in that age range&#x0201d;, suggest that the approach of using lay health workers for recruitment is more effective in smaller communities and needs to be further explored. Variation in the number of participants per community is also likely to have resulted from individual engagement of the CBRAs. In addition, being new in a community may affect the outcome: in the community with the lowest uptake, the CBRA was at first very shy to approach women but is now well trusted and enthusiastic to continue her work with the ACCSS.</p><p>Interestingly, no significant differences of psychosocial scores were found between the two screening arms. This finding may be explained by the fact that approximately two-thirds of our questionnaire participants reported having had a Pap test within the timeframe of 3&#x02005;years recommended in recent guidelines<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> and implies that we have primarily reached women who already are regularly screened. The &#x0223c; 30% &#x02018;underscreened&#x02019; women of our cohort were equally distributed in both arms. Participation recruitment included individual (eg, door-to-door visits and in-person appointments) and communal (eg, educational events, health fairs and well women clinics) strategies, and were most successful with women under the age of 50.</p><p>In conclusion, differences in uptake between both screening methods indicated a preference towards HPV self-sampling, but study participation was lower than what was expected. Long-term, the ACCSS with its longitudinal approach is poised to increase awareness for the benefit of cervical screening. In a recent gathering with selected members (HCPs and CBRAs) from all partner communities, the ACCSS team received positive feedback for this study and a request to continue the work. More collaborative work with the partner communities based on innovative, community-shaped health promotions and Indigenous knowledge-based education involving <italic>all</italic> ages and genders are necessary steps to elucidate ways in which to reach the women, who remain underscreened. For instance, in a recent focus group promoting arts-integrated education to explain the cause of cervical cancer through HPV, the women created their own HPV balls based on an electron micrograph of the HPV capsid molecule, &#x0201c;turning something ugly into something beautiful&#x0201d; as one participant expressed it.<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank the ACCSS First Nations partner communities in the Thunder Bay district, the CBRAs for their community engagement during both phases of the trial as well as the community management and leadership for their continuous support.
