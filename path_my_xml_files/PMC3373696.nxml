In addition to effects on the skin and muscles, RhM is believed to have both general effects (e.g. enhancing physical vitality) and disease-specific effects (e.g. internal medicine, orthopedics, neurology, pediatric, rehabilitation). The goal of this randomised, single-blinded study was to assess the efficacy of a single RhM intervention either with aromatic oil (RA), neutral oil (RM) or a sham massage (SM) on subject well-being.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>101 healthy adults (mean age: 25.2; SD: 4.7) were randomised to one of three groups (RM, RA or SM). All participated in the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) before receiving a single massage intervention of about 60 minutes including 20 minutes of quiet time. Well-being was assessed by standardised questionnaires (MDBF, BF-S, B-L) and visual analogue scales (VAS) prior to the beginning of the study and afterwards. Additionally, salivary cortisol was measured.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>After a single Intervention, the RM and the RA group showed statistically significant improvements compared to the SM group in the dimensions of mood and alertness (MDBF), VAS&#x0201a; emotional state, and relaxation of neck and shoulders. No difference was found between the RM and the RA group. Salivary Cortisol, BF-S and B-L scales did not differ significantly between the three groups over time. All participants had comparable expectations concerning their participation and no one had previously experienced RhM.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>One single RhM intervention leads to a better mood, alertness and relaxation that is not explainable from the setting, because no improvement was found in the SM group. No additional effects were found for the aroma oil.</p></sec></body></article>
