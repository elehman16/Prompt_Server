Approximately 2%&#x02010;20% of both dairy and beef cattle have abomasal ulcerations of variable severity identified at slaughter.<xref rid="jvim15080-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref>, <xref rid="jvim15080-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2</xref>, <xref rid="jvim15080-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref> Clinical signs of abomasal ulceration vary with severity of disease and include anorexia, bruxism, cranial abdominal pain, melena, signs of localized or generalized peritonitis, anemia, and death.</p><p>In adult cattle, suggested risk factors include abomasal lymphoma, stress from periparturient disease, diets high in carbohydrates, and use of nonsteroidal anti&#x02010;inflammatory drugs.<xref rid="jvim15080-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref> Cattle admitted to veterinary hospitals often have a combination of these risk factors, and thus are predisposed to either having ulceration at admission or developing ulceration during hospitalization. One of the challenges of diagnosing and managing abomasal ulceration is the lack of sensitive and specific definitive diagnostic tests. Presence of melena, positive fecal occult blood tests, and typical clinical signs of bruxism and cranial abdominal pain are suggestive of abomasal ulceration. Thus, empirical treatment often is recommended as preventative or presumptive therapy.</p><p>Treatment of gastric ulceration in other species includes increasing gastric pH by use of PO alkalinizing agents or suppression of gastric acid production. The use of PO alkalinizing agents such as magnesium hydroxide and PO gastric acid suppressants including histamine type&#x02010;2 receptor antagonists (H<sub>2</sub>RA) and proton pump inhibitors (PPI) has been studied in pre&#x02010;ruminant calves.<xref rid="jvim15080-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref>, <xref rid="jvim15080-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref>, <xref rid="jvim15080-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref> These agents have variable efficacy in increasing abomasal pH in pre&#x02010;ruminants. Administration of PO therapies may be ineffective in adult cattle because of the buffering and diluting effect of the rumen, unpredictable bioavailability, and delivery to the abomasum.<xref rid="jvim15080-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref> Limitations of parenteral administration of H<sub>2</sub>RA or PPI include the need for IV access, frequent administration, relatively large doses required, and associated cost.</p><p>Famotidine is an H<sub>2</sub>RA that competitively inhibits histamine binding to the H<sub>2</sub>&#x02010;receptor on the basolateral membrane of the parietal cells, and thus decreases stimulation of the H<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ATPase pump at the luminal surface of the cell, which decreases acid secretion. It is used in humans with gastric or duodenal ulceration, as well as in those with gastroesophageal reflux disease.<xref rid="jvim15080-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref> Dosage rates in dogs have been suggested at 0.5 mg/kg IV q12h<xref rid="jvim15080-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">10</xref> and in horses at 0.2&#x02010;0.4 mg/kg IV q6h&#x02010;q8h.<xref rid="jvim15080-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">11</xref> Evidence for parental administration of gastric acid suppressants in adult cattle is lacking, although anecdotal descriptions of a variety of treatments are available.<xref rid="jvim15080-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref>, <xref rid="jvim15080-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref> The dosage rate and frequency of administration chosen for our study utilized the upper end of the dosage for horses (q8h) to be able to detect an effect, if any, with a feasible time for sampling. We hypothesized that the abomasal outflow of adult cattle receiving IV famotidine will have a higher pH compared to the abomasal outflow of cattle treated with saline control. The objectives of our study were to: (1) assess the effect of a single dose of famotidine administered at a dosage of 0.4 mg/kg IV on the pH of abomasal outflow of adult cattle; (2) assess the effect of famotidine administered at a dosage of 0.4 mg/kg IV on the pH of abomasal outflow of adult cattle when administered as 3 doses q8h to mimic clinical treatment; and (3) to describe serum concentrations and pharmacokinetic parameters of famotidine in adult cattle.</p></sec><sec id="jvim15080-sec-0006"><label>2</label><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="jvim15080-sec-0007"><label>2.1</label><title>Animals</title><p>This study was a randomized 2&#x02010;way cross&#x02010;over clinical trial utilizing 4 adult Angus steers fitted previously with surgically implanted duodenal cannulae placed orad to the biliary and pancreatic ducts.

A partial validation was performed using bovine serum as the matrix. Calibration curves and negative control samples were prepared fresh for each quantitative assay and quality control samples (bovine serum fortified with analyte at 4 concentrations within the standard curve) were included as an additional check of accuracy. The response for famotidine was linear and gave a coefficient of determination (<italic>R</italic>

The accuracy (% nominal concentration) was 115, 104, 111, and 106% at 0.3, 25, 100, and 700 ng/mL, respectively. Precision (% relative standard deviation [SD]) was 6, 3, 5, and 2% for 0.3, 25, 100, and 700 ng/mL, respectively. The assay was optimized to provide a limit of quantitation of 0.2 ng/mL and a limit of detection of approximately 0.1 ng/mL. To assess the potential impact of the silicone plug in the serum separator tubes on famotidine concentrations (ie, drug binding), control bovine serum was collected into both serum separator tubes and serum tubes without the silicone plug. Famotidine, at 1 of 3 concentrations (1 ng/mL, 5 ng/mL, and 10 ng/mL), was added to serum in the different tube types. Each concentration was spiked in triplicate. Tubes containing drug were allowed to sit at room temperature for 1 hour.

Our results indicate that famotidine administered at a dosage of 0.4 mg/kg IV is effective at increasing the abomasal outflow fluid pH of adult cattle for up to 4 hours after a single dose compared with saline control. When administered every 8 hours, as is typically done for clinical treatment,<xref rid="jvim15080-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">11</xref> famotidine increased the pH of the abomasal outflow fluid, but the effect decreased with additional doses. Famotidine increased the abomasal outflow fluid pH for 3 hours after the first dose, 2 hours after the second dose, and for only 1 hour after the third dose. This phenomenon of tachyphylaxis has been described in humans and a decrease in response to treatment with H<sub>2</sub>RA has been reported after the second dose and with repeated PO dosing of famotidine in dogs.<xref rid="jvim15080-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">14</xref>, <xref rid="jvim15080-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref> However, although the effect on acid secretion was reported to be negligible in these studies of humans, there was a perceived effect of treatment, which may be a result of other mechanisms. In humans, plasma concentration is dose&#x02010;related with greater acid suppression correlated with larger doses.<xref rid="jvim15080-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">16</xref> Similar studies have not been performed in veterinary species to our knowledge. The mechanisms of a decreasing effect on acid secretion in cattle are not known, and may occur through a similar process, such as degradation of parietal cell H<sub>2</sub>&#x02010;receptors with time.<xref rid="jvim15080-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">17</xref> The presence of tachyphylaxis is clinically important when recommending dosing interval or frequency.<xref rid="jvim15080-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref>
</p><p>Previous reports describing use of other H<sub>2</sub>RA in ruminants have been published. In 1 report, abomasal pH increased for 1 hour after administration of ranitidine (6.6 mg/kg IM) in cattle.<xref rid="jvim15080-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref> Other studies have reported a dose&#x02010;dependent effect of PO cimetidine and ranitidine in pre&#x02010;ruminant calves.<xref rid="jvim15080-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref> The effect of IV ranitidine has been investigated in sheep with abomasal cannulae, indicating that a dosing interval of every 8&#x02013;12 hours is most effective.<xref rid="jvim15080-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">18</xref> That study, however, also found that sheep receiving ranitidine had increased total serum protein and increased serum creatinine concentrations, increased aspartate aminotransferase activity, and decreased serum pepsinogen concentration, indicating safety concerns for this agent in sheep.<xref rid="jvim15080-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">18</xref>
</p><p>Drugs that increase gastric pH above 3.0 for up to 75% of a 24&#x02010;hour period may be associated with healing of gastric or duodenal ulcers in humans.<xref rid="jvim15080-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">19</xref> When administered as a single dose, famotidine significantly increased the abomasal outflow pH compared to the controls for up to 4 hours, from a baseline of 4.26&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.81 pretreatment to a high of 6.01&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.18 at 2 hours post&#x02010;administration of famotidine. When administered every 8 hours, as has been clinically recommended, the greatest difference between control&#x02010; and famotidine&#x02010;treated cattle occurred 2 hours after administration of the first dose. However, the 2 groups were only different for 7 hours of a 24&#x02010;hour period, which equates to approximately 30% of the day. This is less than the observed 48.9% of a 24&#x02010;hour period in dogs treated with famotidine (0.5 mg/kg IV q12h)<xref rid="jvim15080-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">10</xref> and less than the 75% of the day recommended in humans.<xref rid="jvim15080-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">19</xref> This finding suggests that administering H<sub>2</sub>RA every 8 hours may not be cost&#x02010;effective if there is no clinical effect, and perhaps may have the same duration of effect in a 24&#x02010;hour period, if administered less frequently. These percentages are less than the suggested interval for treatment of humans, but the optimal degree of gastric acid suppression has not been clearly defined in veterinary species, including cattle.</p><p>Our study reports higher pH values obtained for fluid from duodenal cannulae as compared with studies with direct luminal abomasal fluid measurement in calves and adult cattle, either from direct cannulation or abomasocentesis,<xref rid="jvim15080-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref>, <xref rid="jvim15080-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref>, <xref rid="jvim15080-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref>, <xref rid="jvim15080-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">20</xref>, <xref rid="jvim15080-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">21</xref> which may be a consequence of backflow of biliary and pancreatic secretions and mucus production by small intestinal enterocytes. Correct placement of the duodenal cannulae was determined at the time of surgical implantation by measurement of pH, and thus was unlikely to have caused the difference in our study, especially based on consistency among individuals. Additionally, minimal fluctuation was observed in the abomasal outflow pH of control steers during the study period, suggesting that feeding concentrate did not have an effect on the acid secretion and pH of the abomasal outflow fluid in our study.</p><p>In our study, the HL of famotidine was just over 3 hours, suggesting that&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;99% of the drug would be eliminated within 24 hours (7 elimination HL) post&#x02010;administration. However, only serum was obtained in this study and a multi&#x02010;dose regimen with tissue samples would be required to determine accurate tissue residues to determine appropriate withdrawal times. Veterinarians are recommended to consult the Food Animal Residue Avoidance Database (FARAD), or other regulatory body, for recommendations on withdrawal times after administration of this medication, because famotidine currently is not approved for use in food&#x02010;producing animals in the United States and its use is considered extra&#x02010;label.</p><p>Limitations of our study include small sample size, short study period, and use of a single IV catheter for administration and sampling. A small sample size may increase the effect of individual variation, especially when interpreting the pharmacokinetic data. The short 34&#x02010;hour washout period between studies may have allowed an unknown residual effect of the drug on the parietal cells within the abomasum. To more accurately analyze the pharmacokinetic indices of famotidine, more frequent blood sampling would have been necessary directly after administration of the drug, but due to certain constraints, this was not possible for our study. The <italic>C</italic>
<sub>max,</sub> in particular, would be affected, as the lack of initial data points may have resulted in the failure to identify the true peak concentration, which may have occurred before the first data point. More data points would have changed the shape of the time&#x02010;concentration curve, and thus the AUC and CL values are likely to have been underestimated, because of the first data point being an hour after administration.</p><p>Because of personnel limitations and temperament of the cattle, direct IV administration of the treatment was not practical for this pilot study. Utilizing the same IV catheter for administration of drug and blood sample collection may have altered the measured serum famotidine concentrations because of crystallization of famotidine within the catheter or extension set. Additionally, returning the 20 mL of blood taken before sample collection to the animal post&#x02010;sampling may have inadvertently readministered drug remaining within the catheter, also affecting the pharmacokinetic analysis. In particular, 1 steer in the multi&#x02010;dose section of the study had repeatedly higher serum famotidine concentrations than the others steers, which may have been caused by individual variation, but the possibility of sampling error as a result of the above&#x02010;mentioned issues cannot be ruled out. In addition, some data points for the multi&#x02010;dose study were not available, thus making interpretation of the pharmacokinetic analysis of the multi&#x02010;dose study problematic.</p><p>More frequent abomasal outflow fluid samples or continuous sampling by pH electrode through the cannulae would have allowed detection of the initial effects of famotidine on parietal cell secretion and a more accurate detection of the timing of abomasal outflow pH changes. Studies with larger numbers of individuals using direct abomasal cannulation <xref rid="jvim15080-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref>, <xref rid="jvim15080-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref>, <xref rid="jvim15080-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">20</xref> or using repeated percutaneous ultrasound&#x02010;guided abomasocentesis<xref rid="jvim15080-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">21</xref> may have resulted in more accurate measurements of abomasal pH.</p><p>This pilot study facilitates further studies assessing different dosage rates and dosing intervals of famotidine, as well as investigating the effect of different commercially available gastric acid suppressant therapeutic drugs in cattle and other ruminant species. Further studies investigating the efficacy of famotidine after extravascular administration may be clinically useful. In conclusion, famotidine when administered parenterally at a dosage of 0.4 mg/kg is effective at increasing abomasal outflow pH for at least 4 hours after a single dose, and could be a useful adjunctive treatment for abomasal ulceration in adult cattle, but should not be the sole form of treatment. Further studies are needed to evaluate the use of this drug, especially dose rates and frequency.</p></sec><sec id="jvim15080-sec-0018"><title>CONFLICT OF INTEREST DECLARATION</title><p>Authors declare no conflicts of interest.</p></sec><sec id="jvim15080-sec-0019"><title>OFF&#x02010;LABEL ANTIMICROBIAL DECLARATION</title><p>Famotidine is not labeled for use in food&#x02010;producing animals in the United States.</p></sec><sec id="jvim15080-sec-0020"><title>INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC) OR OTHER APPROVAL DECLARATION</title><p>All animal procedures were approved by the University of Missouri Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee Protocol #8331.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="jvim15080-sec-0017"><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>The authors thank Dr. Dusty Nagy, Julie Holle, Jill Larson, and Kim Pearl for their support and assistance with this study.</p></ack><ref-list content-type="cited-references"><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="jvim15080-bib-0001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal" id="jvim15080-cit-0002">
