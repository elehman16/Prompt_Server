class-based task-oriented circuit training (CTCT) and individual-based task-oriented
circuit training (ITCT). [Subjects and Methods] The subjects were 30 patients who were
diagnosed with hemiplegia due to stroke more than six months previously. They were divided
into Group I (n=10), which received conventional physiotherapy, Group II (n=10), which
received conventional physiotherapy and ITCT, and Group III (n=10), which received
conventional physiotherapy and CTCT. To determine the qualitative aspect of gait ability,
a GAITRite (CIR Systems Inc., Sparta NJ, USA) was employed, while a two-minute walking
test (2MWT) was conducted to determine the quantitative aspect. [Results] The gait ability
showed significant differences in velocity, cadence, and 2MWT between groups in the
significance test. As a result, the Bonferroni post test showed that gait velocity was
significantly different between Groups I and II and between Groups I and III, while
cadence showed a significant difference between Groups I and III. In the 2MWT, Groups I
and II and Groups I and III also showed significant differences. [Conclusion] Both the
individual and class applications task-oriented circuit training were effective for
improving gait ability. This result indicates that CTCT can improve the physical ability
of stroke patients as much as ITCT.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Gait</kwd><kwd>Stroke</kwd><kwd>Task-oriented circuit training</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>A stroke is a neurological disease caused by an abnormal supply of blood to brain and is
characterized by a high incidence rate<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.
It causes muscle weakness, spasticity, sensory changes, abnormal movements, pain, a
reduction in posture and balance ability, and various psychological problems, such as
depression<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>One of the physical methods that can improve gait ability after stroke is task-oriented
circuit training (TOCT). TOCT is based on the motor learning theory proposed by Forghany et
al.<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>, and consistes of tasks that can
help motion abilities for daily living. It has been proposed to be an effective therapy
method for early stroke patients, and application of TOCT in patients who experienced a
stroke within one year previously has been shown to result in improvements in walking
distance and gait velocity<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Class-based training can improve motivation, provide encouragement, and enhance health
awareness and communication between people<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus, it can promote patient psychological well-being, which is
deficient in one-to-one therapy, and help improve physical functional activities. Recently,
a number of studies were conducted to determine the effect of class-based task-oriented
circuit training that employed a circulation mode by combining the ideas of class therapy
and TOCT<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, although related
previous studies have attempted to determine the CTCT effect, in some cases they did not
utilize a control group. Even if a control group was utilized, other intervention methods
were applied, so it was hard to decide whether TOCT or class-based training was more
effective.</p><p>Therefore, this study aimed to determine a difference in gait abilities when TOCT, which is
based on the motor learning theory, was applied by groups or individually.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study was conducted in patients with hemiplegia who were diagnosed with stroke at C
and S hospitals. The study was approved by the hospital, and all the participants provided
written informed consent. The general characteristics of Group I, Group II, and Group III
were as follows: their average ages were 62.78&#x000b1;9.97&#x02005;years, 64.10&#x000b1;8.61&#x02005;years, and
59.28&#x000b1;5.23&#x02005;years; average heights were 158.00&#x000b1;6.28&#x02005;cm, 164.78&#x000b1;6.84&#x02005;cm, and 161.16&#x000b1;5.00&#x02005;cm;
and average weights were 61.22&#x000b1;6.42&#x02005;kg, 64.60&#x000b1;4.23&#x02005;kg, and 60.00&#x000b1;7.23&#x02005;kg, respectively. In
terms of duration of illness, Group I, Group II, and Group III had durations of illness of
36.67&#x000b1;15.12 months, 30.70&#x000b1;14.68 months, and 27.66&#x000b1;19.35 months.</p><p>This study aimed to determine the change in gait abilities in patients after CTCT, so the
subjects (40 in all) were divided into three groups. Ten patients were excluded from the
pool of subjects due to health problems, so the remaining subjects were randomly assigned to
Group I (n=10) as a conventional physiotherapy group, Group II (n=10) as a ITCT group, and
Group III (n=10) as a CTCT group. All subjects received conventional therapy for 30 minutes
a day, five times a week; the subjects in Groups II and III received TOCT for 30 minutes a
day, three times a week for four weeks. Measurements were conducted before and after the
intervention.</p><p>The TOCT proposed by Salbach et al.<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup> was
modified into a circular mode. The training tasks were sitting in chair and walking, walking
over obstacles, carrying goods, turning the goods upside down, and walking fast in a circle.
Group III was divided into two groups, each consisting of four to six persons under the
supervision of two physiotherapists with more than 10&#x02005;years of physiotherapy experience
each. Group II performed the same task done by Group III under the supervision of one
physiotherapist with more than 10&#x02005;years of physiotherapy experience.</p><p>A GAITRite (CIR Systems Inc., Sparks, NJ, USA) was employed to measure temporal and spatial
variables to test gait abilities. The subjects walked from a place 2&#x02005;m away from the
electronic walking mat start point to a place 2&#x02005;m away from the end position to reduce the
acceleration and deceleration effect<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.
This study measured velocity, cadence, stance phase symmetry profile, swing phase symmetry
profile, and step length symmetry profile.</p><p>To determine the walking endurance, a two-minute walking test (2MWT) was conducted<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. A 50&#x02005;cm-high cylinder was placed 1&#x02005;m and
9&#x02005;m away from the start point, and the subjects walked with a comfortable velocity around
the two cylinders for the 2MWT<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. A
researcher recorded the number of times that each subject walked around the cylinders, which
was subsequently converted into a distance. He then added a distance from the heel of the
subject to the cylinder at the completion of the 2MWT to calculate the final walking
distance.</p><p>The statistical analysis in this study was done by using SPSS 12.0 for Windows<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>.
The general characteristics of the subjects were analyzed by descriptive statistics. ANCOVA
was used to analyze whether gait abilities were different between groups, and the Bonferroni
method was used as a post test. The statistical significance level &#x003b1; was set to 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>To determine the difference in gait velocity between groups, ANCOVA was conducted, and the
results showed a statistically significant difference (p &#x0003c; 0.05). The Bonferroni

III (p &#x0003c; 0.05), while no significant difference was shown between Groups II and III. To

showed a statistically significant difference (p &#x0003c; 0.05). After the Bonferroni post test,
the results showed a significant difference only between Groups I and III (p &#x0003c; 0.05). No

al<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. In order to measure spatiotemporal
gait variables, the GAITRite used by Titianova et al.<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup> was employed to measure changes in gait velocity, cadence, stance
and swing phases, and step length symmetry profiles. The measurement results showed no
significant difference in the stance and swing phase and step length symmetry profiles
between groups, while a significant difference was found in gait velocity and cadence
between groups after the intervention. With regard to gait velocity, a significant
difference was found in Groups II and III compared with Group I. This result was similar to
that in the study by Sherrington et al.<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>,
in which TOCT was applied to subjects with mobility problems, resulting in an improvement in
the gait velocity of the subjects in 6&#x02005;m walking tests. It is also similar to a result of a
study by Dean et al.<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>, in which
class-based TOCT was applied to patients with chronic stroke, resulting in a significant
difference in the gait velocity of the patients in 10&#x02005;m walking tests compared with the
control group. Therefore, subsequent tasks of ever-increasing difficulty in CTCT, such as
walking, carrying, and fast walking, were deemed to cause a significant increase in gait
velocity and cadence. In the same manner, these tasks were also deemed to affect the
individual training group. On the other hand, no significant difference was shown in the
stance and swing phase and step length symmetry profiles. This is because the training
program focused on quantitative gait abilities rather than on gait pattern function.</p><p>This study showed that the the application of TOCT was effective in both the individual and
group contexts in terms of physical recovery. Therefore, CTCT training had a positive effect
on the gait abilities of stroke patients, meaning that CTCT can be effective for training
programs that aim to change physical functions in clinical practice.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This paper was supported by research funds provided by the Howon University.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>F&#x000f6;rster</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Szabo</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Hennerici</surname><given-names>MG</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Pathophysiological concepts of stroke in hemodynamic risk
