Before chemotherapy, all patients underwent ultrasonography of bilateral breasts, bilateral armpits and the liver, chest radiography and systemic bone scanning. For the enlarged lymph nodes, the fine needle aspiration biopsy was done to detect whether there was metastasis. There were 24 patients in the target chemotherapy group with a median age of 42 years (range: 28&#x02013;58 years). Of them, 5 and 19 were negative and positive for regional lymph node metastasis, respectively. In respect of the TMN stage, there were 6, 8, 4, 2 and 4 cases at the stage of IIA, IIB, IIIA, IIIC and IV, respectively. In the control group (n=23), the median age of patients was 41 years (range: 26&#x02013;55 years). Of them, 4 and 19 were negative and positive for regional lymph node metastasis, respectively. In respect of the TMN stage, there were 6, 9, 4, 3 and 1 cases at the stage of IIA, IIB, IIIA, IIIC and IV, respectively.

Oedema at the local lesion was attenuated and accompanied by the occurrence of fold, the superficial varicosity was alleviated, and the adherence between cancers and chest wall was improved. The mass size was decreased, and the lesion was softened and could be moved. The exudate in the ulcerated site was reduced, and the skin colour was changed into brownness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-rado-45-02-123">Figures 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-rado-45-02-123">4</xref>). In the targeted chemotherapy group, nine patients achieved a clinical complete remission (cCR), thirteen patients achieved a partial remission (PR), one patient achieved state disease (SD), one patient achieved progress disease (PD); four patients achieved a pathological complete remission (pCR), and the remission rate (RR) was 91.67 % (22/24) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-rado-45-02-123">Figure 5</xref>&#x0223c;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6-rado-45-02-123">6</xref>). Residual carcinoma <italic>in situ</italic> was noted in 1 patient. The down-staging rate was 62.50% (15/24). In the control group, the changes of local lesions were observed at 10 days after chemotherapy. The mass was softened and tumour size was reduced, which was more obvious 30 days after chemotherapy. In the control group, there were 3, 11, 7, 2, and 1 patient with cCR, PR, SD, PD and pCR, respectively, and the RR was 60.87% (14/23). The down-staging rate was 39.13% (9/24). In the targeted chemotherapy group, of the 19 patients with an axillary lymph node metastasis, no metastasis was found in regional lymph nodes in 7 patients after surgery. In the control group, of 19 patients with an axillary lymph node metastasis, no metastasis was found in regional lymph nodes in 7 patients after surgery. The negative change ratio in a lymph node metastasis was 47.37% (7/19) in the targeted chemotherapy group and 26.31% (5/19) in the control group.

Breast cancer of different subtypes may have significantly distinct prognosis, different therapeutic strategies and marked difference in survival.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-rado-45-02-123">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-rado-45-02-123">12</xref> Patients with triple-negative breast cancer cannot benefit from the targeted endocrine therapy and anti-HER-2 treatment. Therefore, for such patients, the only alternative strategy is chemotherapy as an adjuvant therapy of surgery and radiotherapy. Studies have demonstrated triple-negative breast cancer is more sensitive to chemotherapeutic drugs than breast cancer of other subtypes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-rado-45-02-123">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-rado-45-02-123">14</xref> However, the prognosis of triple-negative breast cancer is very poor and it is susceptible to recurrence, which may be contributed to the low pathological remission rate of triple-negative breast cancer. Therefore, in enhanced chemotherapy, the pathological remission rate is a critical factor in improving the prognosis of triple-negative breast cancer.</p><p>The sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs and local concentration are two crucial factors determining the fate of cancer cells (especially the tumour stem cells) and the subsequent pathological remission rate.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-rado-45-02-123">15</xref> Traditionally, the pre-operative chemotherapy is carried out through intravenous infusion. Under this condition, the effective concentration of chemotherapeutic drugs in local lesion is relatively low and, therefore, the effectiveness will be achieved after prolonged courses of the treatment. In addition, intravenous chemotherapy may result in drug resistance of cancer cells. Nevertheless, in the intra-arterial chemotherapy, the effective concentration of chemotherapeutic drugs in local lesion, surrounding tissues and lymph nodes is significantly elevated.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-rado-45-02-123">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-rado-45-02-123">17</xref> Previously, the blood supply of breast cancer was considered to be mainly from internal mammary artery. Therefore, in superselective intra-arterial chemotherapy, the chemotherapeutic drugs were infused into internal mammary artery. However, in recent studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-rado-45-02-123">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-rado-45-02-123">20</xref>, results revealed the lateral thoracic artery was the dominant feeding artery of breast cancer followed by thoracic artery and sub-scapular artery. At the same time, the metastasis of breast cancer is done through ipsilateral axillary lymph nodes which are supplied by thoracic artery and subscapular artery. Therefore, the optimal target in superselective intra-arterial chemotherapy should be the blood vessel network in the breast cancer and the axillary arteries<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-rado-45-02-123">8</xref> and the area supplied by these blood vessels is also called target region. In the present study, superselective intra-arterial chemotherapy was performed and the effective concentration of chemotherapeutic drugs in the local target region was dramatically increased in unit time, resulting in increased time-density/intensity. Therefore, the primary lesion and surrounding potential lesions as well as lymph nodes were effectively chemically treated which further increased the pathological remission rate and reduced the local recurrence and the risk for distant metastasis.</p><p>The favourable sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs but poor prognosis of triple-negative breast cancer may be contributed to the difficult detection of local skin metastases, lymph node metastases or even distant micrometastases. In traditional chemotherapy, the effective concentration in local lesion is relatively low in unit time and subsequently the cancer cells can not be completely killed, which, however, may lead to drug resistance of cancer cells affecting the efficacy of chemotherapy. Our results showed the advantages of targeted chemotherapy in the increased efficacy, down-staging, improved lymph node metastasis, cCR, and pCR over traditional chemotherapy (P&#x0003c;0.05). Furthermore, the mean course of targeted chemotherapy was only 15 days which was also shorter than that in the control group (31 days). These results revealed the superselective intra-arterial chemotherapy could increase the local effective concentration of chemotherapeutic drugs, possess favourable efficacy demonstrated by the decrease in tumour size and rapidly control the disease progression, which are critical for the killing of cancer cells as soon as possible.</p><p>Pre-operative superselective intra-arterial chemotherapy, on one hand, can increase the local effective concentration after the regional infusion, and more cancer cells can be killed when completely contacting with drugs. As a result, the tumour could be shrunk in a large scale. Therefore, the man-made spread of cancer cells during operations and post-operative recurrence as well as metastasis are prevented. On the other hand, the infused drugs are transferred into the systemic circulation. Therefore, not only local chemotherapy but systemic chemotherapy is carried out. In the present study, there was no significant difference in the side effects of chemotherapy between both groups, which suggested the concentration of drugs in the systemic circulation was also comparative with that in traditional chemotherapy. This effect is critical for the control of subclinical lesion and benefits for the complete remission in pathology. Moreover, the mortality in the targeted chemotherapy was lower than that in the control group, which also demonstrated the advantage of targeted chemotherapy in improving the prognosis of triple-negative breast cancer.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was supported by Science and Technology Program of Guangdong Province (NO.73125) and Key Science and Technology Program of
