These severe consequences may have a very detrimental impact on the quality of life (QOL) of people with DM. However, these untoward complications may be delayed or even prevented by effective treatment and education.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] The cost of these complications exceeds $132 billion annually; in addition, quality and length of life are reduced.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Management of diabetes requires specific lifestyle changes including diet, exercise, self-monitoring, frequent visits to health care providers, and often multiple medications. Further, these changes must be sustained for the remainder of the person's life.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>To control their disease, people with DM have to understand the importance of their medication and diet and be aware of the way to modify them in accordance with their exercise routine.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Hence, diabetes self-management education (DSME) is an essential element of diabetes care.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] What DSME intends to achieve is to assist patients in gaining knowledge, obtaining information, acquiring coping and self-care skills, and shaping attitudes necessary for effective self-management of their diabetes.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] The results of several reviews and meta-analyses are indicative of the positive effect of DSME interventions on health and psychological outcomes. An increase in diabetes-related knowledge, improvement of blood glucose monitoring, foot care, medication taking, coping skills, glycemic control, and formation of healthy dietary and exercise habits are some specifics outcomes of these interventions.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Unfortunately, more than 50% of diabetic individuals do not have a sufficient amount of knowledge and lack necessary skills. Furthermore, in people with type 1 and people with type 2 diabetes, the mean hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels are higher than the acceptable level. Moreover, an ideal glycemic control (HbA1c &#x0003c;7.0%) is only achieved by less than half of people with type 2 diabetes.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Reasons of these failures should seek in educational approaches were implemented in instructional sessions to people with DM.</p><p>Despite the existence of ample evidence supporting the effectiveness of DSME interventions in the improvement of diabetes-related health outcomes, not many studies so far have examined the effect of delivery format of DSME on diabetes health-related outcomes. According to Mensing and Norris, compared to individual-based approaches, group-based approaches usually urge a higher level of interaction and interpersonal dynamics.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] In addition, certain educational activities, such as social modeling or problem-based learning, are better fostered by group settings than by individual settings.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>To some researchers, in comparison to individual-based DSME, group-based DSME improves diabetes-related health outcomes to a greater extent. Moreover, it is believed that compared to individual education, group education costs less.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Norris <italic>et al</italic>. (2001) conducted a study with the aim of examining group versus individual approaches to DSME. The results of their study showed that patients in both settings achieved the same level of success in applying self-care practices. Nutritional management and physical activity were the only two self-management practices in which group-based learning resulted in marginally better self-care outcomes than individual-based learning. The researchers concluded that each one of the intervention approaches enjoyed a unique set of features and advantages.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>The study conducted by Deakin <italic>et al</italic>. revealed that group-based education was effective in improving fasting blood glucose levels, HbA1c, systolic blood pressure, body weight, need for medication, and diabetes knowledge among individuals suffering from type 2 diabetes.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] With regard to positive advantages of group-based approaches (interactive approaches), it seems that those will be more helpful and effective than other approaches in educating people with diabetes. Therefore, the aim of the present research was to examine the impact of interactive approaches-based educational intervention program on beliefs, behavior, HbA1c, and QOL in diabetics.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study design and participants</title><p>This experimental study was conducted during the year 2011 in Khoy, Islamic Republic of Iran.

For better usage of interactive educational techniques in education sessions, intervention group were divided into three subgroups (each subgroup included 15 patients). A female nurse was trained by the researcher about implementing educational program and educating diabetic patients using interactive approaches in two 2-h sessions. Then, the trained nurse (educator) instructed each subgroup for 60 min/week (intervention group) by involving patients in educational sessions. However, no educational intervention conducted on comparison group exception the routine treatment.

In instructional sessions, collaborative and interactive teaching methods (group discussion, brainstorming, and question and response techniques) were used. Especially, for promoting self-efficacy of diabetics, the educator utilized specific training approaches such as verbal persuasion, modeling, and performance accomplishments. According to interactive approaches, there is a discussion during the educational sessions with the active participation of the patients and that all the information is derived and analyzed on the basis of patients&#x02019; knowledge and experience.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Before education, data relating to study demographic and main variables were collected, but 3 months after health education program, only main variables were evaluated and compared.</p><p>The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of Tehran University of Medical Sciences.

It seems that improvement in HbA1c and HRQOL of diabetics is dependent on behavior change and also behavior modification might be related to the change that educational intervention made in participants&#x02019; knowledge, attitudes, and self-efficacy. Lack of awareness has been identified as one of the reasons why patients do not control their disease.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>The type of education that can improve patient's self-care is known to be the first step in controlling diabetes. As in the current study, mean score of knowledge level in women with DM increased in intervention group after education and paired <italic>t</italic>-test confirmed the significant difference. In contrast, this variable was not changed in the comparison group at the end of the study. This finding was supported by other studies results. For instance, results of study of Hartayu <italic>et al</italic>. showed that group-based interactive approach increased knowledge level of diabetic patients in intervention group after education. They concluded interactive strategy is effective to improve diabetic patients&#x02019; knowledge.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Furthermore, other studies have confirmed that this instructional approach (interactive approach) is effective in improving knowledge of participants and these studies supposed increased of patients&#x02019; knowledge will be more, if they involve in educational process.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>Although knowledge level of diabetics plays the important role in managing and controlling their condition, but it is not sufficient.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] To better manage and control diabetes, other effective factors such as attitude and self-efficacy of diabetic patients should also be considered. Attitudes and self-efficacies of diabetics are more effective than knowledge in improving metabolic control.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p><p>The results showed statistically significant differences in attitude mean score of the intervention group after the educational intervention, which is consistent with previous studies.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] It seems that attitude also is influential on self-care activities and glycemic control. To raise intention to engage in self-care of diabetics, it is necessary that patients gain a positive attitude toward self-care behaviors. One study[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] also proved that a relationship existed between diabetes-specific health beliefs and following a diabetes regimen and controlling glucose among older people with noninsulin-dependent DM. Self-efficacy, as another psychosocial factor, can play the main role in changing behavior, and then diabetes educators, practitioners, and consultants should consider to this subject. This study finding indicated the mean score of self-efficacy increased after education and paired <italic>t</italic>-test confirmed it. Results of previous studies are consistent with our finding.</p><p>In an experimental study and in accordance with self-efficacy theory in physical activity improvement, Allen examined the effect of education among the patients with type 2 diabetes. It was found that a significant difference existed between self-efficacy averages of the experimental and control groups before and after the intervention (8 weeks later).[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] The findings of our study were consistent with those of Henrietta's. In Henrietta's study, it was found that there was a positive correlation between self-efficacy and diabetes activities. This indicated that individuals with higher self-efficacy performed more diabetes self-care activities.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</p><p>The study conducted by Whittemore <italic>et al</italic>. confirmed that in women with type 2 diabetes, positive health outcomes may be led by their perceived self-confidence and support.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Findings of Gumbs's study also showed that those women receiving DSME were significantly more likely to check their own blood sugar and feet on a regular basis, to perform moderate physical activities, and to have received foot examination, glycosylated hemoglobin measurements, and dilated eye examinations by healthcare providers over the past year.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] The impact of education on self-care behavior, as a final short-term objective, was also assessed in this interventional study.</p><p>The results showed that the patients&#x02019; mean of performance in intervention group has improved after the intervention. Paired <italic>t</italic>-test showed that the mean of self-care behavior scores in intervention group is different, but not in the control group. It means that education using interactive training methods is effective on behavior of diabetic patients. Results of Kroese's <italic>et al</italic>. study were consistent with our findings. As he and his colleagues found that educational had a positive effect on the improvement of cognitive skills, self-care activities, and also dietary and exercise behaviors.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] Others have also resulted in significant improvements in diabetes outcomes.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] For instance, Deakin <italic>et al</italic>. concluded that in patients with type 2 DM, group-based education in self- management strategies improves clinical and lifestyle outcomes.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] The results indicated that a significant difference existed between HbA1c levels before and after the intervention in the experimental group and not in the control group. These findings of the study are consistent with those of other studies.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] Reduction of HbA1c is mainly a consequence of changes in the behavior of the intervention group members. During the 6&#x02013;8 weeks of education period, the average of patients&#x02019; blood glucose levels was closer to normal. In addition, the long-term risk of complications was reduced.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] Maintenance of HbA1c low levels will prevent complications associated with diabetes. A 1% decrease in HbA1c causes a 21% reduction in mortality associated with diabetes, a 14% decrease in myocardial infarction, and a 37% decrease in microvascular complications are demonstrated by research studies.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</p><p>Improving the QOL for patients with diabetes in a way that they can lead as normal a life as possible is one of the main objectives of diabetes management. It is an important measure of outcome that should be examined on a routine basis in clinical trials which are concerned with evaluating patients&#x02019; education.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] This study showed that before diabetes education, patients with diabetes had a lower overall HRQOL in all aspects. Health education led to higher scores in all dimensions except for the environment in intervention group. In case, these changes were not observed in the control group. The results of this study are consistent with those observations made by other studies which have found that diabetes education contributes to an increase in the HRQOL score.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] Furthermore, there is ample evidence from different interventional studies for the positive impact of educational programs on various aspects of QOL and overall well-being.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] The study has several strengths. First, the educational intervention was pragmatically designed for implementation in a primary care setting for patients. Second, Basic principles relating to interactive educational techniques fully considered in educational meetings. Finally, we measured long-term outcomes of education in addition to its short-term outcomes. Shortage of follow-up period y, small sample size, and losing samples within the study process were the study limitations. Therefore, increased educational follow-up periods, and using big sample size were recommended for researchers who will conduct educational studies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Results highlighted that applying interactive and collaborative educational approaches in educating women with diabetes 2 were important, helpful, and valuable. After education, ample changes have been seen in areas of patients&#x02019; health beliefs, behavior, glycemic control index, and QOL. The study suggests that practitioners, nurses, and other health care providers should consider interactive education as a core element in delivering health care to diabetic patients.</p><p>Hence, educational interventions should be designed in a way that they put the focus on individual needs of each patient, that is, a patient-centered approach is needed. In designing an educational program, factors such as the patient's priorities, feelings, expectations, and lifestyle changes following the disease should also be taken into account.
