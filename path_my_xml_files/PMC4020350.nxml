It has been adapted for use with &#x02018;hard-to-reach&#x02019; or &#x02018;difficult-to-treat&#x02019; children. This trial will compare the adapted-NFPP with a generic parenting group-based programme, Incredible Years (IY), which has been recommended for children with preschool-type ADHD symptoms.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>This multicentre randomized controlled trial comprises three arms: adapted-NFPP, IY and treatment as usual (TAU). A sample of 329 parents of preschool-aged children with a research diagnosis of ADHD enriched for hard-to-reach and potentially treatment-resistant children will be allocated to the arms in the ratio 3:3:1. Participants in the adapted-NFPP and IY arms receive an induction visit followed by 12 weekly parenting sessions of 1&#x000bd;&#x02009;hours (adapted-NFPP) or 2&#x000bd;&#x02009;hours (IY) over 2.5&#x000a0;years. Adapted-NFPP will be delivered as a one-to-one home-based intervention; IY, as a group-based intervention. TAU participants are offered a parenting programme at the end of the study. The primary objective is to test whether the adapted-NFPP produces beneficial effects in terms of core ADHD symptoms. Secondary objectives include examination of the treatment impact on secondary outcomes, a study of cost-effectiveness and examination of the mediating role of treatment-induced changes in parenting behaviour and neuropsychological function. The primary outcome is change in ADHD symptoms, as measured by the parent-completed version of the SNAP-IV questionnaire, adjusted for pretreatment SNAP-IV score. Secondary outcome measures are: a validated index of behaviour during child&#x02019;s solo play; teacher-reported SNAP-IV (ADHD scale); teacher and parent SNAP-IV (ODD) Scale; Eyberg Child Behaviour Inventory - Oppositional Defiant Disorder scale; Revised Client Service Receipt Inventory - Health Economics Costs measure and EuroQol (EQ5D) health-related quality-of-life measure. Follow-up measures will be collected 6&#x000a0;months after treatment for participants allocated to adapted-NFPP and IY.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This trial will provide evidence as to whether the adapted-NFPP is more effective and cost-effective than the recommended treatment and TAU. It will also provide information about mediating factors (improved parenting and neuropsychological function) and moderating factors (parent and child genetic factors) in any increased benefit.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Current Controlled Trials, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.controlled-trials.com/ISRCTN39288126">ISRCTN39288126</ext-link>.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>ADHD</kwd><kwd>cost-effectiveness</kwd><kwd>effectiveness</kwd><kwd>parenting</kwd><kwd>parenting programme</kwd><kwd>parent training</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Estimates of the prevalence of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) vary widely within and between countries. The UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) have estimated that around 5% of school-aged children and adolescents meet the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for ADHD, equivalent to 366,000 children and adolescents in England and Wales [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder is a debilitating mental health disorder, which is marked by symptoms of inattention, overactivity and impulsiveness that have an early onset, and are age inappropriate, persistent and pervasive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. It affects children over their school years and into adulthood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] and is associated with a number of impairments that impinge on a range of social and health care systems (education, criminal justice, mental health, social services, and so on) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Those with ADHD are at increased risk of delinquency, criminality, educational failure and mental illness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Treatment for ADHD typically begins during the middle school years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] and multimodal approaches are recommended [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Stimulant and nonstimulant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] medications are considered the most efficacious treatments and are recommended. However, these have a number of limitations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], including reported side effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and can give rise to parental concerns about the use of medication for behavioural control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Furthermore, medication on its own might not improve other outcomes, such as social and academic functioning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Nonpharmacological treatments, such as classroom-based behaviour modification or parent-training programmes can also be valuable but appear not to provide the same control of ADHD symptoms offered by pharmacological treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>To optimize the effects of nonpharmacological therapies, early intervention approaches implemented during the preschool period have been proposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Such proposals are consistent with the fact that, even though most ADHD cases are first formally diagnosed and treated in middle childhood, ADHD often has its roots in the preschool period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. In fact, while significant levels of preschool-type ADHD symptoms may not always signal the early &#x02018;onset&#x02019; of impairment, numbers of referrals of ADHD before the age of 5&#x000a0;years are growing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>A number of parent-training programmes have been developed to target preschool ADHD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. The New Forest Parenting Programme (NFPP) is a home-based approach designed specifically to target the core symptoms of ADHD in preschool children. It is delivered on a one-to-one basis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. It has been shown in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to substantially reduce levels of ADHD symptoms and related problems, such as oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. A second approach, the Incredible Years (IY) programme, was originally designed to target children&#x02019;s oppositional and noncompliant behaviour. It consists of a suite of programmes for parents, children and teachers. While originally, and still mainly, delivered to groups of parents, children and teachers, there is now also a home-coaching model for the parent programme. These programmes, both individual and in various combinations, have been demonstrated to reduce children&#x02019;s noncompliance and troublesome behaviour and increase positive behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. It has also produced generally positive effects on these outcomes with preschool children, including those with or at risk of ADHD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. A recent adaptation specifically for children with ADHD has shown benefits in terms of parents&#x02019; ratings of ADHD symptom reduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. The IY programme has been recommended for use with preschool ADHD children in influential guidelines, such as those published by NICE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], partly on the basis that its group-based nature is thought to be a cost-effective therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>].</p><p>Despite positive findings from RCTs, there are many barriers to effective implementation of these treatments in everyday practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>], especially with regard to individuals and families traditionally seen as hard to engage and treat. Such factors as the presence of parental mental health problems, the existence of additional child comorbid conditions, cognitive and language problems and the presence of adverse environmental factors need to be addressed if preschool parenting packages are likely to work with those most in need of help. Knowing how to access and engage &#x02018;at-risk&#x02019; and &#x02018;hard-to-reach&#x02019; children and their families, who may be living in difficult circumstances, is therefore central to the development of an effective early detection and intervention strategy. Previous research indicates that when access is made available, the outcomes for &#x02018;hard-to-reach&#x02019; families attending the IY parent programme are as good as those less disadvantaged [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>].</p><p>The Comparison of Preschool Parenting Interventions (COPPI) trial is the fifth and final project in the 5-year Programme for Early Detection and Intervention for ADHD (PEDIA). This programme of research, funded by the National Institute for Health Research, is being carried out at the University of Southampton in collaboration with Solent NHS Trust, and at two other centres: the University of Nottingham in collaboration with Nottingham City Care and Nottingham County Health Partnerships and the North Staffordshire Combined Healthcare NHS Trust.</p><p>Using an evidence-driven approach, the NFPP has been recently adapted to address the specific needs of &#x02018;hard-to-reach&#x02019; and &#x02018;difficult-to-treat&#x02019; preschool children with ADHD and their families (F McEwan et al., unpublished work) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. This has involved extending it from an 8- to a 12-week programme with the inclusion of specific modules to address such problems as parental mental health problems and child comorbid developmental conditions. In this trial, we will evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the adapted-NFPP against IY and treatment as usual (TAU) in a multicentre RCT.</p><sec><title>Aims and objectives</title><p>The overall aim of this study is to conduct a large-scale multicentre RCT of the efficacy of the adapted-NFPP by comparing it with (i) a TAU group and (ii) a generic parenting package recommended by NICE (IY) in a sample enriched for potentially hard-to-reach and treat children.</p><p>The key objectives are to test whether, for individuals with preschool-type ADHD problems, the adapted-NFPP produces statistically greater beneficial effects in terms of core symptoms of ADHD and other secondary outcomes (general child behaviour problems and parental mental health); to determine whether outcomes are moderated by factors that might be predictive of long-term burden and other potentially important moderators, including genetic factors; to determine whether effects are mediated by (a) improved parenting and (b) improved neuropsychological function; and to determine whether the adapted-NFPP is more cost-effective.</p><p>The main research questions are:</p><p>1. Does the adapted-NFPP produce statistically greater reductions in ADHD symptoms compared with a TAU group and standard IY 12-week parenting programme in a sample of individuals with preschool-type ADHD problems enriched for &#x02018;hard-to-reach&#x02019; and potentially treatment-resistant preschool children?</p><p>2. Do these effects extend to other problems, such as child conduct problems?</p><p>3. Do they generalize from home to educational settings?</p><p>4. Are these effects moderated by (i) factors that might be predictive of long-term burden as well as other putative barriers to treatment efficacy and (ii) genetic factors?</p><p>5. Are these effects mediated by (a) improved parenting and (b) improved neuropsychological function?</p><p>6. Do benefits persist in the longer term (for example, 6&#x000a0;months after treatment)?</p><p>7. Is the adapted-NFPP cost-effective relative to IY in this enriched sample over a 6-month period and does the added value of adapted-NFPP outweigh any additional costs of treatment delivery?</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><sec><title>Trial design</title><p>A multicentre three-arm RCT will be carried out to evaluate the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of adapted-NFPP compared with IY and TAU for preschool children with a research diagnosis of ADHD in a sample enriched to ensure a high percentage of potentially high-burden and difficult-to-treat cases. Participants will be randomly allocated to adapted-NFPP, IY and TAU in the ratio 3:3:1. Randomization will be stratified by participating centre and tranche.</p></sec><sec><title>Study setting</title><p>Participants will be enlisted at the three centres participating in the trial: the University of Southampton and Solent NHS Trust; the North Staffordshire Combined Health Care NHS Trust; and the University of Nottingham and Nottingham City Care and Nottinghamshire County Health Partnerships. All centres will run the trial in accordance with good clinical practice guidelines and will work in collaboration with National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) local research networks and with the University of Southampton Clinical Trials Unit (UoSCTU).</p></sec><sec><title>Eligibility criteria</title><sec><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p>Inclusion criteria are: (1) Parents or main caregivers aged 18&#x000a0;years or older (with or without moderate mental health issues); (2) Child aged between 2&#x000a0;years 9&#x000a0;months and 4&#x000a0;years 6&#x000a0;months with significant ADHD-type behaviour (with or without comorbid conditions, such as language and communication difficulties, learning difficulties or behaviour problems); (3) positive screening for ADHD symptoms (score &#x02265;20) based on the parent-reported Werry-Weiss-Peters Activity Rating Scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>] followed by a score above clinical thresholds on the parent-reported Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children Version 4 (DISC-IV) ADHD Scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]; that is, six or more symptoms on either the inattention subscale or the hyperactive/impulsivity subscale, or combined, but in either case with a rating of impact or impairment.</p></sec><sec><title>Exclusion criteria</title><p>Child exclusion criteria are: (i) diagnosis of autism; (ii) being in foster care without a long-term plan in that foster placement; (iii) extreme learning difficulties, as defined by a score below an age-appropriate developmental level for more than 6 out of 12 items taken from four scales of the Parent Involvement Project (PIP) Developmental Scales [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>] including: physical development, three items; development, four items; eye-hand co-ordination development, one item; development of play, four items; (iv) very poor or no language as defined by a score below an age-appropriate developmental level for more than three out of six items taken from the Language Development Scale of the PIP Developmental Scales [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. Parent exclusion criteria are: (v) no working knowledge of English; (vi) serious mental illness (for example, psychosis, extreme learning difficulties, manic depressive disorder); (vii) having a child on the Child Protection Register.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Interventions</title><sec><title>Arm A: Adapted-NFPP</title><p>The original 8-week individually delivered home-based NFPP was developed as a specialized psychological intervention for preschool children and focuses on reducing the core symptoms of ADHD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. The value of early intervention is demonstrated in three NFPP trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], which have shown it to be effective in reducing ADHD symptoms and conduct problems. Short-term effects on parental mental health and the quality of mother-child interactions were also observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. This programme includes components of psychoeducation of parents about ADHD and teaches strategies of proactive parenting in the context of a child with ADHD. It aims to enhance the mother-child relationship through play. It also includes an attention and organizational training component to target the underlying neuropsychological basis of the condition (for example, poor concentration and working memory and inability to cope with delay) using games played together by the preschool ADHD child and the child&#x02019;s mother. The original trial of this programme in a RCT had an effect size of 0.87 for ADHD symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], while a recent smaller RCT had an effect size of 1.96 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. The adapted-NFPP is based on the original NFPP but modified to be potentially more effective with treatment-resistant and hard-to-reach families and children on the basis of qualitative research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>] and piloting carried out prior to the start of the current trial (F McEwan et al., unpublished work). The 12-week programme provides the time to deliver the original 8-week programme at a slower pace. Additional modules are included to address (a) the child&#x02019;s sleep problems, learning difficulties and speech and language problems and (b) parental mental health problems, learning difficulties and ADHD. A component on mindfulness for parents has also been added, as has training in motivational techniques and the use of social stories. The adapted-NFPP will be carried out in weekly sessions of approximately 1.5&#x000a0;hours&#x02019; duration over a 12-week period. Course materials provided during the course of the programme include handouts, a DVD (adapted for preschool children), an audio CD and other resources (see Appendix 1).</p></sec><sec><title>Arm B: Incredible Years</title><p>The IY programme is a series of programmes for parents, children and teachers and includes a suite of parenting programmes focused on strengthening parenting competencies (monitoring, positive discipline, confidence) and fostering the parent&#x02013;child relationship, as well as targeting involvement in children&#x02019;s school experiences, in order to promote academic, social and emotional competencies and reduce conduct problems. The IY parenting programmes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>], as recommended by NICE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], have been developed to help parents prevent or manage oppositional and challenging behaviour through the use of reinforcement and have been shown to be effective in improving parenting skills, reducing conduct problems and improving parent&#x02013;child relationships [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. A modified version of the IY being used in the current trial has also shown some value in the treatment of preschool children displaying early signs of ADHD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. The parenting programmes are recommended by the American Psychological Association Task Force as meeting accepted criteria for empirically supported mental health intervention for children with conduct problems. They are also one of the few programmes identified in the University of Colorado Blueprint classification of programmes with good evidence for violence prevention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. The techniques used to help parents acquire new skills are facilitator-led group discussion, brainstorming, videotape modelling, role play and rehearsal of the taught intervention techniques within groups and through homework. A number of skills are taught in weekly sessions, usually over a period of 12&#x000a0;weeks or more. Parents are shown how to use: (i) play and child-centred activities to promote a positive relationship with their child; (ii) praise, reward and incentive to promote appropriate child behaviours; (iii) effective limit setting and clear instruction; and (iv) the use of strategies to manage noncompliant behaviour. Course materials include handouts, CDs, books and prizes, which are awarded during the course of the programme. Parents who miss a session receive weekly calls and also, where possible, visits from a therapist to encourage the parent and to monitor progress. This is an 8-part programme, with each part building on the previous one, and is designed to support parents by strengthening positive and nurturing parenting skills (see Appendix 2). It is carried out in weekly sessions of approximately 2 to 2.5&#x000a0;hours&#x02019; duration over a 12-week period.</p></sec><sec><title>Arm C: TAU</title><p>For those parents randomized to the TAU group, measures will be collected before and after the 12-week programme. Measures will not be collected from the TAU group 6&#x000a0;months after treatment, as with the adapted-NFPP and IY participants. After final data collection, parents in the TAU group will be offered individual home-based treatment with adapted-NFPP or a place in an IY group-based programme.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Programme fidelity</title><p>Strategies for ensuring fidelity are incorporated as integral parts of the two parenting programmes, including training and monitoring procedures. In addition, a common approach will also be adopted to assess fidelity and integrity as required by each programme, so that these factors can be compared across treatments and their effects on outcome assessed. Procedures for optimizing fidelity relate to the selection, training and supervision of therapists and the skills to be acquired by therapists. The therapists for both programmes come mostly from a health background and are nurses with a background in child and adult mental health services (CAMHS), paediatrics or health visiting; psychologists with a background in CAMHS or behavioural management; family support workers with a background in CAMHS; or senior social workers with experience in children services. As initial training, therapists delivering both programmes will attend a residential training course focused on the techniques necessary to deliver the programme. The basic 3-day IY parent group leader workshop teaches leaders how to use the programme as preventive early intervention in a range of settings. Attending this workshop is the first step in becoming a certified group leader. Training covers three parent programmes, for parents of toddlers aged 1 to 3&#x000a0;years, parents of preschool children aged 3 to 6&#x000a0;years and parents of school-aged children 6 to 8&#x000a0;years old. Both sets of therapists will have ongoing supervision both locally and centrally throughout the time of the trial using face-to-face supervision, by telephone and monitoring of videotaped sessions recording their work with families. Training and supervision of IY therapists and leaders is overseen by practitioners with extensive experience of delivering IY and a clinician (JH) with extensive experience in working with the IY set of programmes and their development. Training and supervision of adapted-NFPP therapists is overseen by a clinician (MT) and a consultant nurse specializing in ADHD (CLB), both with extensive experience in conducting the NFPP and its development.</p></sec><sec><title>Fidelity measures</title><p>Session checklists and evaluation forms will be completed by therapists. Three instruments will also be used to monitor process and treatment fidelity across both programmes and their moderating effects on outcomes. Process fidelity will be measured using a modified version of the Leader Observation Tool (LOT) after treatment is finished [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. The Working Alliance Inventory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>] will be used to look at aspects of the parent-therapist relationship during therapy. The impact of treatment on the family will be measured using the Family Strain Index [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Study measures</title><sec><title>Screen and diagnostic interview</title><p>Three measures will be administered to determine the eligibility of parents and their children for inclusion in the study: the Werry-Weiss-Peters Activity Rating Scale (WWP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]; the DISC-IV ADHD Scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>] and the PIP Developmental Scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. Scores on the WWP will determine whether the child has ADHD symptoms at a significant level of severity to proceed with the administration of the DISC-IV-Parent preschool ADHD diagnostic interview. Items on the PIP Developmental Scale will indicate the presence of poor or no language and severe child learning disability or poor development.</p></sec><sec><title>Primary and secondary measures</title><p>The primary outcome measure is the SNAP-IV-P ADHD Scale (parent-completed), which will be collected at the three time points and records the frequency of occurrence of ADHD symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. Secondary outcome measures include a child observation measure carried out by the research fellow using the Child&#x02019;s Solo Play Index [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]; the teacher-completed SNAP-IV-T ADHD Scale; the teacher and parent-completed SNAP-IV ODD scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>] and the Eyberg Child Behaviour Inventory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>], both of which are measures of noncompliant and oppositional behaviour</p></sec><sec><title>Economic costing</title><p>Economic measures include the Revised Client Service Receipt Inventory (R-CSRI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>] and the parent-reported EQ(5D) and proxy-parent-reported child measure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Mediators</title><p>Factors that might play a mediating role in the effectiveness of the parenting programmes will be investigated and will be collected at all time points. Measures employed will include the expressed emotion five-minute speech sample (FMSS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>]; the Global Impressions of Parent&#x02013;child Interactions (GIPCI) observation measures, which include &#x02018;Jigsaw&#x02019;, &#x02018;Tidy-up&#x02019; and &#x02018;Free play&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>]; the &#x02018;Cookie delay&#x02019; task, which is a measure of inhibition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>], and the parent-completed General Health Questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Moderators</title><p>Factors that might play a moderating role include the Current Symptoms Scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>], which is a measure of parental ADHD symptoms. Saliva samples will also be collected to investigate parent and child gene polymorphisms related to the ADHD phenotype including <italic>DRD4</italic>, <italic>DRD2</italic>, <italic>5HTT-LPR</italic>, <italic>COMT</italic>, <italic>MAO-A</italic> and <italic>OR-A</italic> and their impact on the effectiveness of the parenting programme.</p><p>The possible role of the PARI (Preschool ADHD Risk Index) in moderating the effectiveness of the parenting programmes will also be examined. As part of the overall 5-year PEDIA programme of research, the PARI will be developed based on the outcomes of a longitudinal study of adult outcomes of preschool hyperactivity. A range of child behavioural and developmental factors will be considered, together with a range of maternal and demographic factors. A demographic questionnaire will be administered at baseline for the purposes of PARI analysis and to characterize the sample. The parent-completed Current Symptom Scale, a parental ADHD symptom measure, and the Emotionality, Activity, Sociability and Impulsivity (EASI) questionnaire, a measure of child temperament, will also be administered at baseline only and used for the purposes of the PARI analysis, if these factors are found to contribute to high risk and burden in the ongoing longitudinal study.</p><p>A more detailed description of all study instruments is included in the section on data collection methods.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Participant timelines</title><p>Outcome measures are collected at pretreatment (T1), post-treatment (T2) and, in the case of those participants allocated to Arm A or Arm B, also at 6&#x000a0;months post-treatment (T3).

Assuming a conservative estimate of effect size difference of 0.4 standard deviation between adapted-NFPP and IY, an intraclass correlation of 0.08 for parents treated in the same IY groups and a drop-out rate of 10% (considerably higher than in the original trials) it is estimated that 141 individuals will be needed per treatment arm to provide sufficient power to test the hypothesis that the adapted-NFPP is superior to IY in terms of reduction in ADHD symptoms (total <italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;282). This equates to a difference of mean 0.28 and standard deviation 0.7 on the SNAP-IV-P ADHD rating scale (the primary outcome) using a 5% two-tailed test of significance and 80% power.

Again assuming a conservative estimate of effect size difference between adapted-NFPP vs TAU, a group of 141 adapted-NFPP and 47 TAU will give 81% power to detect an effect size of 0.5 on the SNAP-IV-P ADHD score (equating to a difference of mean 0.35 and standard deviation 0.7) with 5% two-tailed significance. No intraclass correlation has been applied for this calculation, as both adapted-NFPP and TAU will be delivered individually.</p><p>On this basis, each of the three centres will recruit approximately 110 families with a preschool-aged child (age 2&#x000a0;years 9&#x000a0;months to 4&#x000a0;years 6&#x000a0;months) with high levels of ADHD symptoms (total <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;329) into the trial. Families will be randomized with intention to treat to either (i) adapted-NFPP as an individually delivered, home-based parenting programme (<italic>n</italic> =141, leaving 127 for final analysis with 10% drop-out); (ii) IY delivered in groups of eight (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;141, leaving 127 for final analysis with 10% drop-out); or (iii) TAU (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;47, leaving 42 for the final analysis with 10% drop-out).</p></sec><sec><title>Recruitment</title><p>The plan for recruitment takes into account that (a) two research fellows will be available at each centre to conduct screening and the diagnostic interview, recruit participants to the study and complete T1 to T3 visits for each tranche and (b) two pairs of therapists will be employed at each centre to cover the two parenting programmes. Given a target recruitment of <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;329 participants (110 participants per centre) and factoring in school holiday periods, it is estimated that five or six parenting programme tranches will be needed, with 18 to 22 parents enlisted per tranche across centres. An allocation ratio of 3:3:1 will mean that approximately eight parents will be allocated to each pair of therapists. Two NFPP therapists will each work on a one-to-one basis with four parents over the 12-week period of the programme and two IY therapists or leaders will conduct a group-based programme in a local hall with eight parents, whose partners may also attend the group.</p><p>The collaboration of local agencies and services acting as participant identification centres across each of the sites will be sought to help achieve recruitment targets for each tranche of parenting programmes. Practitioners and clinicians across agencies will make study enlistment packs available to parents. These packs contain a letter to the parent, an information sheet, an expression of interest form, a consent to screen form and a freepost envelope for the return of the expression of interest and consent forms to the research office. Posters, radio advertisements and social media will also be used to recruit a broad range of parents to the study. For the purpose of ensuring sufficient numbers of hard-to-reach and potentially difficult-to-treat families, the sample will be enriched by targeting a range of different referral sources and using previously developed outreach strategies to increase engagement of these families. Multiple recruitment routes will be used at each of the centres participating in the trial; these will include health visiting and Sure Start professionals; speech and language clinics; community paediatric clinics; and CAMHS. To determine the proportion of &#x02018;hard-to-reach&#x02019; and potentially treatment-resistant families participating in the trial, the sample will be characterized using a number of factors that have been associated with such families. These factors will include: socioeconomic status; education; employment; number and age of siblings residing in the home; ethnicity; single parent status; age of parent at time of birth; parental mental health problems or ADHD; child language and communication problems and the presence of other child comorbid conditions.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Informed consent</title><p>In the 10-week period prior to the start of each parenting programme tranche, two research fellows in each area will have responsibility for obtaining written informed consent to administer screening and diagnostic measures to parents, usually at their homes or some other convenient location or, if necessary, by phone. Standard informed consent procedures will be followed both for the administration of screen and diagnostic interview measures and, if the parent is eligible and willing, for participation in the full study. If the parent is not eligible, the parent will be informed and this will be confirmed in writing to the parent and the parent&#x02019;s clinician or practitioner where appropriate. If the measures indicate that (1) all inclusion criteria have been met and (2) that in the event of being allocated to IY, the parent would be available to attend an IY programme on a fixed day in a local centre or hall where cr&#x000e8;che facilities will be made available, the parent and child will be eligible for inclusion in the full study. A screen and diagnostic interview case report form (CRF) will be completed by the research fellow, indicating that all inclusion criteria were met together with the parent or main caregiver scores for all completed measures.</p><p>If the parent is willing to participate, the research fellow will arrange to visit the parent&#x02019;s home. At the T1 visit, written informed consent to participate in the full study will be obtained and T1 measures will be collected. Protocol assessments will be performed according to the schedule in Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>. After consent is obtained and the visit has been completed, a T1 CRF will be completed by the research fellow to record the measures completed at the visit and the scores for these measures.</p><p>The research administrator will then liaise with the UoSCTU to complete the process of randomization and the participant will be randomized to an arm of the study. General practitioners will be informed of the parent&#x02019;s participation both at the start and end of the study. All participants will be informed that they can withdraw from the study at any time without their rights being affected. In the case where consent to treatment is withdrawn but the participant agrees to remain in the research study, the participant will be followed to completion.</p><sec><title>Allocation and blinding</title><p>After consent has been received, the participant will be randomized into an arm of the study by the UoSCTU using the online TENALEA system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>]. Randomization procedures will be carried out prior to the start of each parenting programme tranche and will take place during normal working hours (Monday to Friday, 9&#x000a0;a.m. to 5&#x000a0;p.m.). Only the trial co-ordinator (DMC) and designated research administrator staff at each centre will be responsible for liaising with the UoSCTU in randomizing participants. When possible and to help maintain blindness, groups of eight or more participants within each centre will be randomized together. Upon receipt of an electronic file from each centre, designed by the UoSCTU to provide participant IDs and initials, centre attended and other details necessary for TENALEA system randomization, the UoSCTU will carry out randomization. Parents will be block randomized to adapted-NFPP, IY or TAU arms in the ratio 3:3:1. Automated email confirmation of randomization will be sent to the authorized individual at each centre. Details of the randomization will then be added to the screen and diagnostic interview CRF by the research administrator. A copy of this CRF, together with the T1 CRF, will be checked and verified by the centre principal investigator and sent by courier or, in the case of the Southampton centre, delivered by hand to the UoSCTU, along with a copy of all measures collected at these two visits. Data measures will be gathered and CRFs completed and processed in a similar manner at T2 and T3 visits.</p><p>Participants in each centre will be informed by designated research staff as to which arm of the study they have been allocated and this will be confirmed in writing. In the case of parents randomized to the TAU group, parents will be offered a place on a parenting programme in the community to commence approximately 4&#x000a0;weeks after T2 data collection, which will be &#x02018;end of study&#x02019; for TAU participants. Those participants allocated to adapted-NFPP and IY will also be asked to complete T3 measures 6&#x000a0;months after treatment. Research fellows will remain blind to treatment allocation. Research fellows will inform the participant when arranging home visits at T2 and T3 data collection that this blindness should be maintained on their visit. Any breaches of blindness will be recorded. The screen and diagnostic interview CRF containing allocation details will be filed separately from other documents contained in participant files to which the research fellows will have access, as will all other such documents.</p></sec><sec><title>Data collection methods</title><p>Data collection will take place at the parent&#x02019;s home at each of the three time points.

The DISC-IV uses criteria contained in the DSM-IV and enquires about hyperactive and inattentive symptoms and impairment in both home and school settings. The standard DISC-IV impairment algorithm requires moderate impairment in at least one area of functioning related to ADHD symptoms, as judged by parental responses. Impairment on the DISC is defined by the degree to which the symptoms have (a) caused distress to the child; (b) affected relations with caregivers, family, friends or teachers; or (c) affected school functioning. The DISC has been shown to have moderate to substantial test-retest reliability and internal consistencies. Training in administration and scoring of this measure was overseen by the clinical lead (MT), the trial co-ordinator and other researchers with extensive experience in its administration.</p></sec><sec><title>Parent Involvement Project (PIP) developmental scales [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]</title><p>If DISC-IV inclusion criteria are met, the PIP developmental scales will be administered by the research fellow. This developmental checklist is widely used by educational psychologists as either an interview schedule with the parents or an observation schedule. It gives a profile of the child in five different areas: physical development, social development, eye-hand co-ordination development, development of play and language development. The chart also suggests the age that children will normally develop these skills and has age norms up to age 4&#x000a0;years. In this study, it will be used as an interview schedule with the mother and it will give an indication of any possible developmental delay. An educational psychologist was consulted regarding the scoring of these scales and training in the administration of this measure by the research fellow was carried out by the clinical lead (MT).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Outcome measures</title><sec><title>SNAP-IV parent (SNAP-IV-P: 56]) and teacher scales (SNAP-IV-T: 56])</title><p>The self-completed SNAP-IV-Parent ADHD Scale is the primary outcome measure in this trial with the teacher-completed SNAP-IV-T ADHD Scale and the SNAP-IV-P and T ODD Scale used as secondary outcome measures. The Multimodal Treatment Study of Children with ADHD (MTA) version of the SNAP-IV is used in this trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">72</xref>]. The 26 items include 18 ADHD symptoms (nine inattentive, nine hyperactive or impulsive) and 8 ODD symptoms, as specified in the DSM-IV. Items are rated for frequency by the parent or teacher on a 4-point scale (0&#x02009;=&#x02009;not at all to 3&#x02009;=&#x02009;very much) and average ratings per item are then calculated for each subscale. Bussing et al.

It includes a seven-point intensity scale (never to always) that measures the frequency of each problem behaviour and a yes-no problem scale that identifies whether the behaviour is currently seen as a problem. The ECBI can be used both as a clinical screening measure for identifying and treating externalizing problems in children and as a measure of treatment outcome. Cut-offs representing high-risk children are 127 for the problem scale and 11 for the intensity scale. The ECBI has been shown to correlate well with independent observations of children&#x02019;s behaviours and can differentiate between clinic-referred and nonclinical populations.

Patterns of attending to and switching from one activity to another during independent play are measured and an index of attention or engagement is calculated (time on task divided by total number of switches from zone to zone). High index scores represent more attention and less switching.

The EQ-5D-3&#x000a0;L (five dimensions, three levels) used in this study consists of the descriptive system and the EQ-5D visual analogue scale (EQ-5D VAS). The descriptive system comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain or discomfort and anxiety or depression. Each dimension has three levels, no problems, some problems and extreme problems, and the respondent is asked to tick the box against the most appropriate statement in each of the five dimensions. The VAS records the respondent&#x02019;s self-rated health on a vertical, visual analogue scale (0 to 100) with endpoints representing the worst and best imaginable health states. Both the self-completed parent- and proxy-parent-reported child measures are used in this trial. This is a generic measure, applicable to a wide range of health conditions and can be used in the clinical and economic evaluation of health care. The parent-completed measure is widely used and has shown moderate levels of validity. The parent-proxy measure has not been sufficiently validated, particularly with younger children. However, Matza and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">74</xref>] have looked at the parent-proxy ratings of children with ADHD in the USA and UK and reported that it was able to detect impairment in these children.

Parental EE is rated on the initial statement, warmth, emotional overinvolvement, relationship, positive and critical comments. A coding manual is used for the FMSS. An overall score can be given for the level of EE with a high level indicating a negative influence.

This is based on a prospective follow-up of a large sample of individuals who were identified as having symptoms of ADHD at a preschool age in the 1990s but are now entering late adolescence or early adult life. The risk index is derived from a statistical process involving (i) identification of those children with high levels of ADHD symptoms at 3&#x000a0;years who fall into high- and low-burden groups and (ii) the use of logistic regression to model child, parental and socioeconomic predictors of poor outcome and high burden in the sample of children. Ten parameters will be included in the model: initial ADHD symptom levels; socio-emotional problems; temperament; language delay; developmental delay; maternal mental health; maternal age; parental marital status; perinatal risk and social class. This information will be obtained from a number of sources, including birth and patient records, a demographic questionnaire and the current trial measures (for example, maternal mental health).

The working alliance is an important part of the process of therapy, and looks at the alliance of task, goals and relationship of therapist with parent and vice versa.

In the case of the IY programme, this will be either by attending the group or by receiving individual home-based sessions for any missed sessions.</p><sec><title>Therapist effects</title><p>Four or more therapists (depending on numbers recruited) will work in each of the three study centres with two therapists working on each intervention. The mixed effects regression models will include therapist as random effects within these models, allowing for the extent to which treatment effects differ between therapists and also accounting for the way in which participants are nested by therapist. Even when the difference between treatment effects can be assumed to be identical for all therapists, the mixed model can improve the precision of the treatment estimates by taking appropriate account of the different therapists in the analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Missing data</title><p>Drop-out in this trial is defined as noncompletion of measures at the end of the 12-week parenting programmes. A drop-out rate of 10% has been estimated and the rates of drop-out across the three arms will be compared using analysis of variance. The randomness of missing data resulting from drop-out will be explored across treatment arms and, if random, standard mixed-effect regression model procedures will be employed. If data loss is not random, the modelling strategy will be based on Yang and Shoptaw [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B78">78</xref>], which involves imputation of nonignorable missing data due to drop-out using different models. The effect of using several different models will be compared to estimate imputed values. This method allows an exploration of the range of possible effects of missingness and provides the most conservative estimate of treatment effects, taking into account missing data due to drop-outs.</p></sec><sec><title>Mediational analysis</title><p>Exploratory mediational analysis will examine the extent to which changes in ADHD symptoms are determined by the effects of the treatment package on parents (more positive and constructive parenting or improved maternal mental health) and on children (improved inhibition and greater delay tolerance). Analysis will be conducted using regression approaches, as recommended by Valeri and Vanderweele in their 2013 paper [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B79">79</xref>] using SAS and SPSS; and path analysis using AMOS (for Windows) and Mplus (Muthen &#x00026; Muthen, Los Angeles, CA.).</p></sec><sec><title>Moderator analysis</title><p>The presence of parental ADHD will be assessed using the CSS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>]. This score will be collected at baseline and an interaction term (CSS * treatment group) will be included in the mixed-effect regression models to determine whether parent training might be less beneficial for children whose parents demonstrate symptoms of ADHD. The interaction term will be considered significant for <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05.</p><p>Risk of long-term burden as assessed by the PARI will be included in the mixed-effect regression models to determine whether this measure moderates the effect of treatment on primary and secondary outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Genetic moderation of parent-training effects</title><p>DNA will be collected from parents and children, to test whether parental responses to parent training in terms of changes in parenting behaviour and the parent&#x02019;s responses to the child during interaction are moderated by functional polymorphisms in selected genes shown to affect parenting and &#x02018;openness&#x02019;. These will include polymorphisms that have been associated with the ADHD phenotype in genes that control serotonin, dopamine and oxytocin function (<italic>DRD4</italic>; <italic>DRD2</italic>; <italic>5HTT-</italic> group) will be included in the mixed-effect regression models to determine whether this measure moderates the effect of treatment on primary and secondary outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Effects as a function of treatment fidelity</title><p>Scores from the LOT and the Working Alliance Inventory will be used to calculate a fidelity composite measure (scored 1 to 3, indicating low to high fidelity). An interaction term &#x02018;fidelity composite score * treatment group&#x02019; and, similarly, an interaction term &#x02018;FSI * treatment group&#x02019; will be included in the mixed-effect regression models to determine whether these measures moderate the effect of treatment on primary and secondary outcomes.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Health economic analysis</title><p>The economic analysis, adherent to guidelines for good economic evaluation practices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B80">80</xref>], will adopt a societal perspective, including health and social services, as well as any costs borne by families. The primary economic evaluation will be in the form of cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA), and a secondary economic evaluation in the form of cost-utility analysis (CUA). These will be based on intention to treat and if approved, per-protocol analyses (see Statistical Analyses above).</p><sec><title>Resource use and family borne costs</title><p>Detailed information on all resources required to provide both the adapted-NFPP and the IY programme will be collected. This will include the design of a time collection form to record therapist time spent providing the intervention inclusive of preparation and travel time. It will also include resources such as manuals and handouts, training and supervision and any necessary fidelity procedures. Resource use will be combined with relevant unit cost data to provide estimates of the costs of providing these interventions. The detailed breakdown of the types of costs required will allow carrying out sensitivity analysis of the effect of varying any aspect of how the interventions are provided. It will also allow comparison of the economics of different modes of provision.</p><p>Patient-reported resource-use measures are an important component and one of the most challenging parts of an economic evaluation. The CSRI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>] is considered one of few resource-use measures that have been comprehensively tested and the validity and reliability of the instrument is considered good, with consistency generally fairly well demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B81">81</xref>]. An adapted version of the CSRI will be used to collect detailed information from all parents indicating contacts with frontline professionals or specialized services and will allow identification of ADHD related health and social care resource use required by individuals and families. This will include costs related to counselling services and support groups, child education and day care, as well as employment related costs due to child&#x02019;s health/behaviour. There is no doubt that there is a tension between demand for information on costs and its supply; this comprehensive cost data collection will provide the opportunity to report on economic implications of ADHD in preschool children.</p></sec><sec><title>Primary outcome measure and health-related quality of life</title><p>The preference-based generic health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) instruments enable comparisons across chronic conditions and benchmarking with healthy population samples. The economic evaluation alongside clinical trials framework also enables estimation of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and presentation of results in a cost per QALY context. There is some doubt as to how appropriate HRQoL scores will be in very young children. Given this, it is not yet possible to identify the best paediatric generic HRQoL instrument to be used in the preschool age group. There is a paucity of research on the use of preference-based measures of HRQoL such as the EQ-5D in very young children. However, there is evidence supporting the use of parent-proxy EQ-5D ratings of children with ADHD in the UK and US. Matza et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">75</xref>] assessed the HRQoL of children with ADHD using the parents&#x02019; proxy version of the EQ-5D and reported that the instrument was able to detect impairment in children diagnosed with ADHD and that this measure was feasible and valid when used as part of an overall health outcomes assessment in clinical studies of childhood ADHD. Hence, the within-trial cost-effectiveness will be estimated using the EQ-5D to estimate QALYs (CUA).</p><p>Given the degree of change based on EQ-5D scores compared with the primary outcome measure (SNAP-IV-P), the effectiveness of this instrument in estimating HRQoL to be used in economic evaluations alongside clinical trials, for this age group, with ADHD symptoms, will also be investigated.</p><p>Following NICE recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>], as part of the diagnostic process for children, there should also be an assessment of their parents&#x02019; or carers&#x02019; mental health; in this study, EQ-5D and EQ-5D VAS scores will be used to detect changes on HRQoL for both (a) the child, using proxy completion by the parent or main caregiver, and (b) the parent&#x02019;s or main caregiver&#x02019;s own state of health.</p></sec><sec><title>Cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA)</title><p>The aim of the CEA will be to determine whether the adapted-NFPP, a home-based parenting programme, is more cost-effective with children at high risk of poor outcomes than either a TAU group or a generic package (IY: active control).</p><p>In addition to cost per QALY (CUA), the within-trial CEA will also be estimated using the primary outcome measure SNAP-IV-P, looking at cost per unit change in the SNAP-IV-P score, to allow for the possibility that the EQ-5D is not sensitive to changes in ADHD symptoms.</p><p>The NICE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>] reviewed treatments for ADHD, and, in their economic evaluation, people with ADHD were either classified as responders or nonresponders, based on the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) Scale. A study from Lloyd et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B82">82</xref>] developed a classification system of four health states (normal; borderline to mildly ill; moderately to markedly ill and severely ill), reflecting different levels of severity of the patient&#x02019;s symptoms. A similar approach will be explored, classifying children by severity using the primary outcome and the EQ-5D, depending on the variation in severity of those recruited. In addition, by mapping the severity scale to the improvement scale, the response to treatment will be estimated, to allow classification of children as responders or nonresponders, as described by NICE. Given that the adapted-NFPP has recently been adapted to address the specific needs of &#x02018;hard-to-reach&#x02019; and &#x02018;difficult-to-treat&#x02019; children, this analysis is appropriate. The results will be presented as point estimates and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves. Deterministic sensitivity analysis will be combined with probabilistic sensitivity analysis, to explore different types of uncertainty.</p><p>Missing data will be examined as to whether cases with missing data are similar to those with full economic data in a similar manner to the main trial analysis. If cases with missing data are similar to those with complete data, an analysis will be carried out using only cases with complete data (complete case analysis). If this is not the case, appropriate measures of imputing missing data, for example, multiple imputation, will be explored. This will be done in consultation with the trial statistician. If results using imputed values are produced, these will be in addition to those using a complete case analysis.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec><title>Ethical approval</title><p>The study protocol was approved by the National Research Ethics Service, NRES Committee South Central for Portsmouth and the University of Southampton. The trial is registered with Current Controlled Trials (ISRCTN39288126).</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The COPPI trial will provide vital information about the clinical value of parenting programmes for the treatment of ADHD in preschool children and will provide novel insights at a number of levels. For example, first, by contrasting a specialist intervention designed specifically to target core ADHD symptoms (adapted-NFPP) against a more generic parenting approach (IY), the trial is designed to answer questions about the specificity of effects of parenting programmes within this sample. Second, by adding a health economic component, the trial will be able to establish the value of any trade-off between the potentially greater costs of a home-based one-to-one intervention (adapted-NFPP) and a possibly less expensive group-based alternative. Third, by studying a sample enriched for hard-to-reach and difficult-to-treat families and preschool ADHD children, this trial will allow us to test whether programmes previously seen as effective with less challenging samples can also work with clinically more complex cases. Fourth, by taking direct observation measures along with parent and teacher ratings, it will allow us to disentangle the effects of rater (parent versus teachers versus observer) from those of setting (home versus school). Fifth, by testing for the mediating role of neuropsychological factors and altered parenting the trial will allow the examination of the processes that drive therapeutic change. Sixth, by collecting DNA and genotyping for ADHD risk and more general susceptibility genes, the study will allow us to isolate genetic factors that might determine clinical response and help to better target treatments in the future.</p><p>Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder is a major health burden across the life span. Effective and cost-effective treatments need to be developed and validated for use with a range of different sorts of children with ADHD. Early intervention, it has been argued, offers a number of advantages, especially in optimizing the value of nonpharmacological approaches. Establishing the value of the COPPI interventions will present a major step forward in the search for an effective early intervention strategy for ADHD.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial status</title><p>COPPI is an ongoing trial and it is expected that participant recruitment will continue, subject to approval, until January 2014, when a final tranche of 12&#x000a0;week parenting programmes will commence.</p></sec><sec><title>Appendix 1</title><sec><title>Adapted New Forest Parenting Programme (adapted-NFPP)</title><sec><title><italic>The New Forest Parenting Programme (NFPP)</italic></title><p>This programme is centred around four broad themes:</p><p>1.
