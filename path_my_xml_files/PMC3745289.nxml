Finally, in view of the molecular diversity of breast cancer, adjuvant taxanes have provided different benefits for special patient subgroups, especially those who are HER2-positive and triple negative.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-ott-6-1073">10</xref> Therefore, there is a need to identify patients who would not necessarily obtain benefit from this treatment.</p><p>This study was conducted with the aim of evaluating the value of adjuvant sequential taxanes, compared to six cycles of classic anthracyclines, in patients with the luminal A phenotype in a small-sized Egyptian population.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Patients and methods</title><p>This was a randomized prospective study comparing disease-free survival (DFS) and toxicity of adjuvant taxanes in 60 females (aged &#x0003e;18 years) who presented at Dar Al Fouad Hospital, Egypt, during the period from June 2007 to July 2008 with stage (pT 1-2 pN 0-3 M0).

The result of the PACS-01 trial showed a small but significant improvement in DFS and OS. In a preplanned subgroup analysis, no benefit was seen in patients aged less than 50 years.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-ott-6-1073">6</xref> Bria et al performed a pooled analysis of 15,500 patients treated in a randomized trial designed to determine if the addition of paclitaxel or docetaxel to conventional anthracycline treatment improved survival.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-ott-6-1073">15</xref> The authors concluded that taxane-based sequential treatment added a significant benefit to both DFS and OS. However, the magnitude of the benefit was not large, with an approximately 2%&#x02013;4% absolute benefit, meaning that 35 to 45 patients need to be treated for one to benefit.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-ott-6-1073">15</xref> Hence, our study was designed to explore the role of the taxane docetaxel in luminal A disease (pT1-2 pN0-3 M0).</p><p>Ultimately, the present study did not show a 4-year DFS benefit from adjuvant docetaxel, coinciding with conclusions from the TACT study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-ott-6-1073">5</xref> and CALBG-9344<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-ott-6-1073">10</xref> in a luminal A subgroup of patients.
