<italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic> is the dominant microbial species responsible for persistent apical periodontitis with ability to deeply penetrate into the dentin. Exopolysaccharides (EPS) contribute to the pathogenicity and antibiotic resistance of <italic>E. faecalis</italic>.

Samples were randomly assigned to six medication groups for 1 week (n=10 per group): CH + 40% glycerin-water solution (1:1, wt/vol); CMCP; 2% CHX; CH + CMCP (1:1, wt/vol); CH + CMCP (2:3, wt/vol); and saline.

The residual microbial flora located in inaccessible areas of the root canal anatomy is the main cause of persistent periapical infections. Because of anatomical complexities that cannot be reached by instruments, it is still difficult to clean root canals mechanically. Thus, intracanal medication has been proposed as a component of instrumentation and irrigation to eliminate bacteria along with their by-products<sup><xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>.</p><p>Calcium hydroxide (CH) paste is one of the most commonly used intracanal medicaments. When dissolved in water, the CH paste dissociates into hydroxide and calcium ions; as a result, the antimicrobial action of this medication depends on the presence of hydroxide ions in the solution<sup><xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. Despite its excellent properties, the buffering action of dentin can neutralize the antimicrobial activity of CH at deeper layers of dentinal tubules, and <italic>E. faecalis</italic> resistance to this medicament has consequently been demonstrated<sup><xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. The camphorated parachlorophenol (CMCP) solution contains chemical ingredients, such as chlorophenol, and the antimicrobial actions of CMCP products are related to its ability to destroy the bacterial membrane through protein and lipid binding. The association of CH paste and CMCP forms calcium p-chlorophenolate, which increases the pH of dentin, allowing the liberation of hydroxyl ions for an extended time<sup><xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. The addition of camphorated parachlorophenol (CMCP) to CH paste was more effective to eliminate the microorganisms in infected root canals, based on the method of bacteriological sampling in root canals using paper points<sup><xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. The association of CH with CMCP may enhance the diffusion of CH, while maintaining a relatively high pH value. Furthermore, the addition of CH paste has been shown to decrease the toxicity of CMCP in periapical tissues via prolonged action of the calcium hydroxide-based paste<sup><xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. When the CH paste combined with CMCP was used as an intracanal medication, 74% of the successes were categorized as cases of two-visit treatment<sup><xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. However, this methodology is limited, since the microorganisms located inside the dentin were not collected.</p><p>The chlorhexidine (CHX) is positively charged and has been reported to act by electrostatic interactions with the negatively charged bacterial wall. This procedure alters the cell osmotic equilibrium and results in cell death, which contributes to the antimicrobial effect of CHX<sup><xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. Two percent CHX gel is used as an intracanal dressing, in which it is effective against microorganisms in infected root canals<sup><xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. The challenge of eliminating all bacteria in root canals may be partly attributed to their invasion into dentinal tubules, where the organisms are protected from medicaments. The addition of CMCP to CH paste may enhance the diffusion of CH and significantly decrease the toxicity of CMCP in periapical tissues<sup><xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. Thus, we sought to examine the efficacy of CH paste, CMCP, and CHX gel to eliminate bacteria within dentinal tubules.</p><p>
<italic>E. faecalis</italic> becomes more resistant in the root canals because of its ability to adapt to harsh environmental changes and starvation<sup><xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. Exopolysaccharides (EPS) are the crucial components of the protective shelter in oral biofilms<sup><xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. Consequently, the dominant mechanism involved in biofilm resistance to antimicrobial therapy may be the capability of EPS to provide mechanical stability and drug tolerance. Additionally, treating <italic>E. faecalis</italic> biofilms with dextranase effectively sensitized bacteria to a 2% CHX solution, which highlighted the hypothesis that dispelling EPS provides a new target for antimicrobial therapies<sup><xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. However, little is known about the effects of medicaments on EPS synthesis and <italic>E. faecalis</italic> survival in dentinal tubules.</p><p>Recently, a dentin infection model was generated to establish standard and deep penetration of bacteria into dentinal tubules<sup><xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. This visual strategy efficiently assessed the efficacy of endodontic medication against <italic>E. faecalis</italic> in dentin<sup><xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. In addition, the contamination protocols and the method for the microbial infection of the dentine had been modified in the <italic>in vitro</italic> model<sup><xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> and investigated in intra-oral appliances<sup><xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. As <italic>E. faecalis</italic> play a central role in endodontic infections, with EPS likely contributing to its pathogenicity and antibiotic resistance, this study sought to investigate the antimicrobial efficacy of current medicaments against <italic>E. faecalis</italic> in infected canals and the role of EPS in this process.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIAL AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Sample preparation</title><p>One hundred and twenty extracted single-canal human teeth were extracted from adults (18&#x02013;30 years old) for orthodontic reasons and were kept in a 0.01% NaOCl solution prior to use. Each participant was provided with an informed consent form approved by the Ethics Committee of West China Hospital of Stomatology, Sichuan University. The teeth were prepared using a Protaper system to F3 file<sup><xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. The debris and smear layer were removed by immersion in an ultrasonic bath containing 5.25% NaOCl for 5 minutes, then were submerged in 17% EDTA for 5 minutes. Each root was decoronated to obtain roots measuring 12 mm in length and sterilized before use. One hundred and twenty semicylindrical dentin halves were shaped as previously reported<sup><xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. Dentin blocks with a length of 4 mm were horizontally sectioned from each tooth at 1 mm below the cementoenamel junction. Root canal blocks were enlarged to a size of Gates Glidden drill #6 (Tulsa Dentsply, Tulsa, OK, USA). Each cylindrical dentin block was fractured by prepared grooves into two semicylindrical halves. The outer surfaces of the dentin blocks were ground to achieve a standard thickness of 2 mm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref>). The smear layer of the specimen was removed by immersion in 5.25% NaOCl, then 17% EDTA for 5 minutes each in an ultrasonic bath. The outer sides of the roots and dentin blocks were sealed by nail varnish to close the open dentinal tubules. The average colony-forming unit (CFU) counts and the standard deviations were defined according to our preliminary work. Then, an assumption was made that the statistical significance level is typically 5% (&#x003b1;=0.05) and adequate power is widely accepted as 0.9 (90%). The hypothesized means and standard deviations were calculated. The sample size, estimated by PASS (Power Analysis and Sample Size) version 13.0 (NCSS, Kaysville, UT, USA), was 7 samples <italic>per</italic> individual group; thus, 10 samples were included in each group to maintain an adequate sample size.</p><fig id="f1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Schematic drawings of sample preparation and medication.

The antibacterial activity of CH paste has been previously questioned because of the buffering potential of the dentin, which decreases the pH effect<sup><xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. Previously, the influence on dissociation of CH in aqueous and nonaqueous solutions has been investigated, and the conductivity of CH in pure glycerin or propylene glycol was measured<sup><xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. In this study, the conductivity of CH in pure glycerin was negligible and the conductivity value of CH in water was 7.3&#x000b1;3 mS/cm. These results indicate that high concentrations of glycerin reduce conductivity<sup><xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. In the present study, the CH paste mixed with a 40% solution of glycerin had some antimicrobial action, but was inferior to the CH paste mixed with CMCP solution. It is possible that higher concentrations of glycerin may impede the effectiveness of CH as an intracanal dressing. On the other hand, <italic>E. faecalis</italic> is able to endure alkaline stress at a pH value of 11.1<sup><xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. Therefore, this combination of CH paste and CMCP solution was superior to the CH paste alone in eliminating the microorganisms in root canals.</p><p>In addition, the application of CH paste is unable to achieve a pH value greater than 10 within the dentinal tubules because of the dentin buffering effects<sup><xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. Previous studies report that <italic>E. faecalis</italic> can form biofilms and colonize dentinal tubules under alkaline stress conditions <italic>in vitro</italic>
<sup><xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. As a result, CH combined with CMCP has been suggested to provide a broader antibacterial spectrum and more rapid penetration than inert vehicles<sup><xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. In the present study, CH combined with CMCP exhibited a more pronounced antibacterial effect than CH alone, indicating that this association may compensate for the weaknesses of CH as previously proposed. Ideally, an intracanal medication should occupy the root canal space reaching into the infected dentinal tubules to destroy the microorganisms. As phenolic compounds have a low surface tension, the combination of CH and CMCP may allow for an easier flow of the medicament into the dentinal tubules and also appears to be less toxic than CMCP alone<sup><xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>.</p><p>The antibacterial effect of CH pastes has been attributed to dissociation of hydroxyl ions. However, the buffering action of dentin can neutralize the antimicrobial activity of CH at deeper layers of dentinal tubules<sup><xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. In addition, CH pastes associated with CMCP allow a controlled liberation of calcium and hydroxyl ions. This association forms calcium p-chlorophenolate, which increases the liberation of hydroxyl ions for a longer period<sup><xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. That kind of reaction between those two medications may be less toxic than CMCP alone. On the other hand, CH combined with CMCP composes a lesser amount of CMCP than when is used alone in the present study. When incorporated with the CH paste, reduced concentration of CMCP would also contribute to less the toxicity of CMCP as the root canal medicament. The antimicrobial effect of CMCP products is often described as its ability to destroy the bacterial membrane by binding on its proteins and lipids. As a result, CMCP solution is controversial when used as medication because of its possible toxicity caused by ingredients such as chlorophenol<sup><xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. Because of the fast diffusion of CMCP solution through the dentinal tubules, adverse cytotoxic reactions were found when there was liquid extrusion in the periapical tissues. However, the denaturing effect of CH paste on periapical tissues may prevent further tissue penetration by CMCP<sup><xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. From this point of view, it is supposed that this association of CMCP + CH paste would be advantageous by slow release of CMCP from the paste. In addition, the combination of CH and CMCP could increase the pH of dentin and help to maintain the alkaline environment<sup><xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. The high pH may promote a superficial denaturing effect of CH paste in which this area may act as a physical barrier to a deeper diffusion of chlorophenol into the periapical tissues<sup><xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. Conversely, this association may increase the pH of dentin, promoting antimicrobial action<sup><xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. The current results also indicate that increasing the concentration of CMCP enhances its antibacterial efficacy.</p><p>The antimicrobial effect of chlorhexidine (CHX) is reported to act by electrostatic interactions, in which CHX is positively charged and the bacterial wall is negatively charged. This interaction alters the cell osmotic equilibrium and allows bacterial cytoplasm coagulation, resulting in cell death<sup><xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. Two percent CHX gel is commonly used as a chemical auxiliary in endodontic therapy, which shows its effectiveness against microorganisms present in infected root canals<sup><xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. The association of CH and 2% CHX has been used as an intracanal dressing because of its enhanced antimicrobial action against endodontic pathogens<sup><xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. It has been found that CHX may induce reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in the alkaline environment with a biphasic response, which are possibly involved in the killing of root canal microorganisms<sup><xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>. The CH pastes have the ability to induce hard tissue formation and also mediate the neutralization of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)<sup><xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. As a result, it is supposed that this association of CHX gel + CH paste would be advantageous compared with CH paste alone, because the substantive effect of CHX sustains the antimicrobial activity after being removed from the root canal systems<sup><xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. However, the association of CHX with CH may fail to improve the antibacterial efficacy of CHX gel<sup><xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>. In the present study, it was observed that the antimicrobial activity of CH paste was inferior to the CHX gel alone. On the other hand, the present investigation also demonstrated that the antimicrobial effect of CHX was inferior to that of CH combined with CMCP (2:3, wt./vol.), which was related to the poor penetration into the matrix-encased structure of the biofilm. CHX appears to be ineffective in dissolving glycosidic bonds in the biofilm matrix<sup><xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>. Utilization of CH with CMCP may provide a better therapeutic strategy, since CHX may interact with residual sodium hypochlorite, inducing tooth discoloration. Furthermore, CHX may interfere with the sealing ability of root canal fillings<sup><xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec><title>Dispelling the EPS Matrix sensitized <italic>E. faecalis</italic> in dentinal tubules to medicaments</title><p>Microbial flora colonization is considered to be the critical first step in biofilm formation and dentinal tubule invasion<sup><xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. EPS are composed of microbial dextran derived from or found on the cell walls of <italic>E. faecalis</italic>. In addition to initiating the attachment and colonization of biotic surfaces<sup><xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> by planktonic cells, EPS also act as an extracellular digestive system by trapping enzymes that surround bacterial cells, which reduces physical contact with antimicrobial agents<sup><xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. For the survival of <italic>E. faecalis</italic>, it is presumed that bacteria may remain alive, but nonculturable (VBNC), in nutrient poor environments<sup><xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>. Thus, the bacteria left in dentinal tubules after instrumentation and irrigation may grow again in the presence of an EPS matrix. Furthermore, dextran, a class of extracellular-formed glucans produced by bacteria, has been found in the matrix of <italic>E. faecalis</italic> biofilms, implicating dextran in the development of microbial communities<sup><xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>.</p><p>Previous reports demonstrated that the Alexa Fluor 647-labeled dextran generated a fluorescence resonance energy-transfer (FRET) reaction, in which the dextran chain was displaced, resulting in a change in fluorescence<sup><xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. In addition, we slightly modified the standard dentin infection model to achieve a better understanding of the remaining bacterial distribution and of EPS organization in dentinal tubules. In the present study, autofluorescence in noninfected dentinal tubules could be visualized after staining, which is consistent with previous investigation<sup><xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. Considering that all dentin blocks were prepared to achieve the standard size (4&#x000d7;2&#x000d7;2 mm), dentinal specimen sampling maintained consistent baselines for CLSM observation and could ensure valid comparisons to be made between the experimental medication groups. After dentin blocks were longitudinally split, CLSM observations were conducted to assess the proportion of viable bacteria and EPS production in dentin, which, thus, was established in relevant publications<sup><xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. In addition, dentinal blocks incubated with saline as control were also investigated and the control group could also be compared as the baseline of the other medication groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">4</xref>).</p><p>The labeling technique allowed the visualization of VBNC cells and the quantitative analysis of the EPS matrix. In the present study, the visual strategy has been used to assess not only the percentage of vital bacteria, but also EPS matrix formation in the dentinal tubules. EPS production declined with a concomitant decrease in the proportion of live cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2B-C</xref>), suggesting that reduced EPS production enhances the anti-biofilm activity of medicaments. Particularly, <italic>E. faecalis</italic> utilizes the residual EPS matrix in dentinal tubules after treatment with saline under starvation conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4G</xref>). As a result, the presence of EPS in deeper areas may create a chemical barrier against antibacterial agents<sup><xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. Thus we propose that the increased resistance of <italic>E. faecalis</italic> in the dentinal tubules may be attributed to the EPS matrix. In the present study, the combination of CH and CMCP inhibited EPS synthesis and negatively affected bacteria in the dentin. The degradation of the EPS matrix facilitated the penetration of CMCP, which sensitized the bacteria present in dentinal tubules to antibacterial agents. Clearly, the quantitative analysis of EPS and microbial colonization would advance our understanding of biofilm structure and accelerate the development of antimicrobial agents. This study sought to investigate the role of EPS matrix involved in antimicrobial efficacy of current medicaments in infected canal conditions. In our opinion, the EPS matrix dispelling by root canal medication, which would be related to bactericidal effect of the disinfection agents. Further investigations should be carried out to clarify the role of CMCP in EPS matrix metabolism and to evaluate the viability of residual bacteria after root canal fillings.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>In summary, this study demonstrated that CMCP enhanced the antibacterial action of CH paste against <italic>E. faecalis</italic> and inhibited EPS synthesis in the dentin. Moreover, increasing concentrations of CMCP sensitized biofilms more effectively to disinfection agents. These two medicaments may additively act toward the elimination of <italic>E. faecalis</italic> and degradation of the EPS matrix, facilitating the modification of the structure of the biofilm. The antimicrobial activity of CHX gel was superior to the CH paste alone and was similar to CH combined with CMCP (1:1, wt./vol.). The labeling visualization and the quantitative analysis demonstrated that EPS matrix declined with a concomitant decrease in the proportion of live cells, suggesting that reduced EPS production may enhance the antimicrobial activity. The EPS matrix dispelled by CH paste with volatile vehicles may be related to its bactericidal effect for infected root canal medication. The visualization and analysis of EPS formation and microbial colonization in dentinal tubules may be a useful approach to verify antimicrobial components using an <italic>in vitro</italic> model.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>DISCLOSURE STATEMENT</title><p>The authors deny any conflicts of interest.
