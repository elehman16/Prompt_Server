We hypothesized that currently used doses (&#x02265;375&#x02009;mg/m<sup>2</sup>) exceed several hundred-fold the half-maximal effective dose, which is most sensitive for detecting putative differences between biosimilars and important for dose finding. In an open label, exploratory trial healthy volunteers received single infusions of rituximab at doses of 0.1, 0.3 or 1.0&#x02009;mg/m<sup>2</sup>. Subsequently, in a double-blind, randomized trial healthy volunteers received single infusions of two rituximab products at doses of 0.1 and 0.3&#x02009;mg/m<sup>2</sup>. In the exploratory trial rituximab transiently depleted CD20+ cells by a mean 68% (range: 57&#x02013;95%), 74% (55&#x02013;82%) and 97% (94&#x02013;100%) immediately after the infusion of 0.1 (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;4), 0.3 (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;4) and 1&#x02009;mg/m<sup>2</sup> (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;8), respectively. In the randomized trial CD20+ cells decreased by&#x000a0;a mean 48% (25&#x02013;84%) &#x02212; 55% (26&#x02013;85%) and 81 (67&#x02013;89%) &#x02013; 87% (77&#x02013;96%) after infusion of 0.1&#x02009;mg/m<sup>2</sup> (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;12) or 0.3&#x02009;mg/m<sup>2</sup> (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;8 proposed biosimilar, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;4 reference product) of the proposed biosimilar or the reference product, respectively. It is important to understand that in healthy volunteers &#x0003c;1% of the authorized rituximab doses depletes almost all circulating B lymphocytes. Thus, for non-malignant diseases alternative, more cost-effective dosing regimens seem plausible, but require clinical testing.

The European Medicines Agency and the US Food and Drug Administration have published guidance on the development of biosimilars recommending a stepwise approach, for the totality of evidence, addressing structural aspects of the product, functional assays, animal studies, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties in humans, immunogenicity analysis and possibly clinical efficacy and safety trials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>.

However, the optimal dose to compare rituximab products is currently unknown. As B-cell depletion is the only effect of rituximab, the aim of this trial was to investigate a dose at which comparing the effects of biosimilar rituximab products is most sensitive. Based on the low <italic>in vitro</italic> EC50<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> we hypothesized that tiny fractions of authorized rituximab doses would be sufficient to achieve that in humans. This was first investigated in a pilot trial. The second trial compared the B lymphocyte depletion, immunogenicity profile and safety of a proposed biosimilar rituximab product to MabThera&#x000ae;, (authorized rituximab, Roche, Basel, Switzerland) in an exploratory, randomized, double-blind, active controlled trial in healthy volunteers.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p id="Par6">Recruitment of healthy volunteers for both trials was between March 29<sup>th</sup> 2011 and May 23<sup>rd</sup> 2013.

Hemoglobin, white blood cells and lymphocytes dropped below baseline immediately after infusion of rituximab. These changes were minor, graded as not clinically relevant and resolved until the final safety visit.

The half-maximal effective dose for depletion of circulating CD20&#x02009;+&#x02009;B-cells was 0.1&#x02009;mg/m<sup>2</sup>, which is only a tiny fraction (1:3750&#x02013;5000) of the authorized doses.</p><p id="Par23">We chose a starting dose of 1&#x02009;mg/m<sup>2</sup> to identify the half maximal effective dose <italic>in vivo</italic>, because the half maximal effective concentration is &#x02264;1&#x02009;&#x000b5;g/ml <italic>in vitro</italic>
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. As mentioned above, this dose is of particular interest, because it is the most sensitive dose to detect differences in the effects between biosimilar rituximab products and may guide dose-finding. Infusion of 1&#x02009;mg/m<sup>2</sup> rituximab already depleted 97% of all B-cells in healthy volunteers. Thus, instead of increasing the dose of rituximab as originally planned, the dose was reduced to 0.3&#x02009;mg and 0.1&#x02009;mg/m<sup>2</sup>. These doses still lowered CD20+ cell counts by 75% and 66% of baseline values in the pilot trial. Our results suggest that comparison of the effects of rituximab in the steep part of the dose-response curve is no longer possible when doses reach 1&#x02009;mg/m<sup>2</sup>.</p><p id="Par24">The demonstrated high potency of rituximab at very low doses may have important implications for rituximab dosing in non-malignant diseases. The &#x02265;95% depletion of circulating B lymphocytes after infusion of 1&#x02009;mg/m<sup>2</sup> rituximab, although of a transient nature, makes it conceivable that lower doses than the currently authorized (&#x02265;375&#x02009;mg/m<sup>2</sup>) may suffice to deplete all B lymphocytes from the circulation and therefore may be equally effective. However, this hypothesis needs to be tested in further clinical trials. This is especially interesting for low-income countries struggling to meet the financial burden of treatment with biologicals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. We extrapolated these data and hypothesize that 100&#x02009;mg rituximab (lowest strength available) may suffice to fully suppress CD20+ cells for three months (refer to the pharmacokinetic model and Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Assuming a price of approximately 1.75 Great Britain Pounds (GBP) per mg rituximab<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, two doses of 1000&#x02009;mg in rheumatoid arthritis could result in drug costs of approximately 3500 GBP. Two doses of 100&#x02009;mg (i.e. the smallest vial size) every three months would add up to 350 GBP, a cost reduction of 90%. However, these are only extrapolations from healthy volunteers that require validation in clinical trials involving patients. The ORBIT study reported that annual costs decreased by ~20% when rituximab was used instead of a TNF-&#x003b1; inhibitor in patients with rheumatoid arthritis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>.

</p><p id="Par25">No differences in immunogenicity were found between the two rituximab products regarding development of anti-drug antibodies. However, the incidence rates of these antibodies were higher in our trial than reported previously. The rate of human anti-chimeric antibodies after infusion of rituximab was 33% in patients with systemic lupus erythematodes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, 4.3% (5 out of 117) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> and less than 1% (1 out of 166) in patients with indolent lymphoma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. The frequency of anti-drug antibodies in multiple sclerosis patients was approximately 30%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Noteworthy, such patients often receive other immunosuppressive drugs such as methotrexate, glucocorticoids and chemotherapy. These findings should not impose any risks on patients in clinical trials of low-dose rituximab, because in contrast to our trial, in these patients a complete and continuous depletion of all B lymphocytes is pursued. Thus, the initial target dose of the first infusion should ideally remove all CD20&#x02009;+&#x02009;B lymphocytes. In such case, we assume that anti-drug antibody generation should not differ from other patient populations despite of the low doses. However, based on our findings we recommend testing for anti-drug antibodies in all trials investigating lower doses of rituximab.</p><p id="Par26">For biosimilarity testing, the experimental setup of a submaximal depletion of B lymphocytes may be especially suitable to detect and to compare immunogenicity, because high rituximab doses completely deplete B-cells, which may suppress the humoral immune response to the drug itself and possibly bias the immunogenicity results.</p><p id="Par27">A multitude of impediments hinders the conduct of pivotal clinical trials for the introduction of new drugs to the market. These obstacles include increasing financial and regulatory burdens by the need of multinational multicenter trials, unwillingness of many patients to enroll in clinical trials, as well as diminishing incentives for investigators in health systems focusing on efficiency and profitability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. In some instances such as testing of biosimilarity, alternative approaches to these extensive trials such as extrapolation may be a reasonable approach<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. In certain cases, the results of human, pharmacological studies, as well as clinical immunogenicity testing may suffice for approval of biosimilarity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Increasing the validity of the pharmacodynamic biosimilar exercise may help to decrease the burden for the phase III comparability exercise and therefore the costs of the development program.</p><p id="Par28">Some limitations need to be considered. First of all, the number of participants was small and this exploratory trial was not powered to formally assess biosimilarity between the two rituximab products using established non-inferiority margins.</p><p id="Par29">Some technical limitations related to the sensitivity of the pharmacokinetic assay occurred and rituximab was detectable only for a short period of time at low doses. As a result, it was not possible to accurately assess pharmacokinetic properties of rituximab at low doses. There was a clear pharmacokinetic signal for&#x000a0;the rituximab dose of 1&#x02009;mg/m<sup>2</sup> during the first 24&#x02009;hours. Thus, the calculated mean T<sub>1/2</sub> of 36&#x02009;hours is markedly shorter than the mean rituximab T<sub>1/2</sub> of approximately 20 days after 375&#x02009;mg/m<sup>2</sup> or 1000&#x02009;mg<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. For the same reasons pharmacokinetic analysis at lower doses (&#x02264;0.3&#x02009;mg/m<sup>2</sup>) was technically not feasible.</p><p id="Par30">Another limitation of our trial was that the effects of neutralizing anti-drug antibodies on the efficacy after repeated exposure to low dosed rituximab could not be investigated as rituximab was only infused once in healthy volunteers for safety reasons.</p><p id="Par31">While in our study CD19 and CD20 counts behaved similar in almost all subjects, this need not be the case if higher doses of rituximab are used or other detection antibodies are used in the laboratory. Ideally clinical laboratories will have to check for the <italic>in vitro</italic> interference of rituximab with their antibodies used to detect CD20+ cells up to maximum plasma concentrations, i.e. 500&#x02009;&#x000b5;g/mL.</p><p id="Par32">These data are derived from a trial in healthy volunteers. There are no clinical efficacy data and proposed new dosing regimens are based on extrapolations and require well designed clinical trials.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par33">In conclusion, even very low doses of rituximab &#x02264;1&#x02009;mg/m<sup>2</sup> effectively depleted CD20+ cells in healthy volunteers. Based on these data, alternative, more cost-effective dosing regimens seem plausible for the use of rituximab in non-malignant diseases. However, efficacy of such regimens needs to be tested in further clinical trials involving patients and pharmaco-economic evaluations. Considering the world-wide use of rituximab, such trials are desperately needed and may be particularly relevant for low-income countries struggling to meet the financial burden of therapy with biologics.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Trial Design</title><p id="Par34">Two clinical trials were conducted (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

The second trial was a single center, stratified (FC&#x003b3;RIIIa polymorphism), randomized, double blind, active controlled trial, where the effects, the safety and the immunogenicity of two rituximab products were compared, the reference product (MabThera&#x000ae;, Roche, Basel, Switzerland) and the proposed biosimilar product (Apotex Inc., Toronto, Canada) at the previously identified optimal doses. The national competent authority of Austria (AGES, Austrian Agency for Food and Drug Safety) and the Independent Ethics Committee of the Medical University of Vienna approved both trials, which were conducted in compliance with Good Clinical Practice and the Declaration of Helsinki.
