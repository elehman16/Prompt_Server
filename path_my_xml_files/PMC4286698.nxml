rehabilitation within randomised controlled trials of surgical interventions
is required to underpin the generation of reliable and usable evidence.
This article describes the key processes used to ensure provision
of good quality and comparable rehabilitation to all participants
of a multi-centre randomised controlled trial comparing surgery
with conservative treatment of proximal humeral fractures in adults.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods </title><p>These processes included the development of a patient information
leaflet on self-care during sling immobilisation, the development
of a basic treatment physiotherapy protocol that received input
and endorsement by specialist physiotherapists providing patient
care, and establishing an expectation for the provision of home
exercises. Specially designed forms were also developed to facilitate
reliable reporting of the physiotherapy care that patients received.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>All three initiatives were successfully implemented, alongside
the measures to optimise the documentation of physiotherapy. Thus,
all participating sites that recruited patients provided the sling
immobilisation leaflet, all adhered to the physiotherapy protocol
and all provided home exercises. There was exemplary completion
of the physiotherapy forms that often reflected a complex patient
care pathway. These data demonstrated equal and high access to and
implementation of physiotherapy between groups, including the performance
of home exercises.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion </title><p>In order to increase the validity and relevance of the evidence
from trials of surgical interventions and meet international reporting
standards, careful attention to study design, conduct and reporting
of the intrinsic rehabilitation components is required. The involvement
of rehabilitation specialists is crucial to achieving this.</p><p>Cite this article: <italic>Bone Joint Res</italic> 2014;3:335&#x02013;40.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Surgery; Rehabilitation; Pragmatic randomised controlled trials; Shoulder fracture; Research design</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>The ProFHER trial was funded

span and dominate much of the care pathway for people receiving
surgery, can be overlooked in the design, conduct and reporting
of randomised controlled trials evaluating surgery.<sup><xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> This article gives an account of the processes
undertaken to ensure good practice in the rehabilitation of all
participants, and the reporting thereof, within the context of a
multi-centre randomised controlled trial, the &#x02018;PROximal Fracture
of the Humerus: Evaluation by Randomisation&#x02019; (ProFHER) trial, conducted
in the United Kingdom (UK).<sup><xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup></p><p>The ProFHER trial aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and cost
effectiveness of surgical <italic>versus</italic> standard non-surgical treatment
for adults with an acute, closed and displaced fracture of the proximal
humerus involving the surgical neck. Recruitment of 250&#x000a0;patients
took place in the orthopaedic departments of 33 UK NHS hospitals
from September 2008 to April 2011. Patient care pathways included outpatient
and community-based rehabilitation.</p><p>ProFHER was a purposefully pragmatic trial by design and conduct.<sup><xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> It emphasised currently
accepted good practice in surgery and conservative management to facilitate
the general and ready applicability of its results, particularly
in, but also beyond, the UK NHS. The protocol stressed standardised
protocols and care pathways throughout, with comparable and sufficient
expertise of care providers.<sup><xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> This
article focuses on the measures taken to assure the quality of the
non-surgical aspects of treatment and rehabilitation for both treatment
groups. It reports on the success of these measures and provides insights
into the complexity of achieving these aims across multiple sites
and along the patient care pathway. The dependency on the contributions
of physiotherapists for successful delivery is illustrated by a
summary of their involvement in trial design, local management and
provision of care. Finally, we discuss the results of the key initiatives
and the insights gained from this trial and how these apply more
generally.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>A rehabilitation specialist on upper limb conditions was brought
on board early in the preparation stages of the trial, including
membership of the Trial Steering Committee. This specialist also
acted as the central contact for physiotherapy-related issues from
participating sites. </p><p>After an appraisal of practice at the lead hospital and consultation
at several other hospital sites, we focused on three key elements
of the care pathway. These elements were: self-care during initial
sling immobilisation, the development of a basic treatment physiotherapy
protocol, and home exercises for patients. To adhere to the reporting
standards for pragmatic and non-pharmacological trials,<sup><xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> we also devised data collection procedures
to document the provision of rehabilitation. Such data on physiotherapy
are also important regarding the use of healthcare resources, and
contributed to the cost-effectiveness analysis.</p><sec><title content-type="h3">Provision of written patient information
on personal care during initial use of a sling</title><p>Identification of the lack of written patient information on
this aspect of personal care prompted the development of an illustrated
information sheet by two physiotherapists with input and feedback from
the ProFHER trial management team and two &#x02018;service users&#x02019; (both
former proximal humeral fracture patients). Items covered in the
information sheet were: the rationale for the sling; sling use and
care; advice on keeping mobile; hand and wrist exercises; washing
and hygiene; getting comfortable; sleeping position; pain relief,
including breathing; important &#x02018;don&#x02019;ts&#x02019;; warning signs and a reminder
to seek further advice in case of problems. The information sheet
was provided as part of the trial recruitment materials for giving
to potentially eligible patients. Hospitals were advised that the
ProFHER sling care information leaflet could be replaced by locally
available material, if available. </p><p>Soon after recruitment had ended, we sent each participating
site a brief questionnaire designed to obtain feedback on the use
of the ProFHER sling care leaflet.</p></sec><sec><title content-type="h3">Physiotherapy: production of physiotherapy
protocol</title><p>The lack of a physiotherapy protocol to promote standard care
for these fractures was noted at all hospitals involved in the funding
application. In the absence of evidence on which to base practice,<sup><xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> our aim was to develop
a physiotherapy protocol that was representative of accepted good
practice. This process comprised several stages.</p><p>After an initial review of current physiotherapy practice at
the lead site, a draft protocol structured to reflect successive
phases of rehabilitation was drawn up by four specialist physiotherapists
from different centres. Upon review, the Trial Steering Committee
advised of the need to seek feedback on the draft protocol and further
insights on the current management of these fractures from specialist
shoulder physiotherapists and other experts. Further advice related
to the importance of keeping to routine practice and avoiding unusual
interventions, including electrotherapy (other than transcutaneous electrical
nerve stimulation (TENS)). </p><p>A short questionnaire was prepared. This asked for feedback on
the protocol in terms of its acceptability as a guide to basic treatment
for these fractures and on whether the specialists themselves would
follow the approach given in the protocol. Additionally, it asked
the specialist to list other interventions that they applied routinely
for people with these fractures, as well as any interventions available
in an NHS setting that they would discourage. In June 2008, the
questionnaire and draft protocol were circulated for comment primarily
via the hub contacts for the National Physiotherapy Research Network
(NPRN)<sup><xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> and
distributed in person to physiotherapists at the British Elbow and
Shoulder Society (BESS) annual meeting. The results from the questionnaire
survey were collated and assessed in terms of the acceptability
of the draft protocol and any changes that were required. All comments
and routinely-used interventions not appearing in the protocol were
documented.</p><p>We received 29 completed questionnaires, 14 from allied health
professionals attending the BESS meeting, 12&#x000a0;from the NPRN mailshot
and three from members of a guideline development group. Respondents
were predominantly specialist physiotherapists currently involved in
treating these fractures and other shoulder injuries. In total,
27 (93%) respondents agreed the protocol was acceptable as a basis
for treatment and were happy with the approach given in the protocol.
Two main modifications to the protocol were made in response to
the feedback. The first involved additional text stressing that
the protocol was only a guideline and that variation in practice was
anticipated and acceptable, with the proviso that any substantive
difference was recorded. The second was a correction to some contradictory
instructions. None of the listed &#x02018;other&#x02019; interventions were considered
unexpected or inappropriate. Notably there was a strong discouragement of
electrotherapy except the use of TENS for pain relief. Overall,
we concluded there were sufficient responses to inform trial methods
and that the overwhelmingly positive response endorsed the use of
the protocol; this in turn would serve to strengthen the delivery
of physiotherapy and, thus, acceptance of the trial methods.</p><p>Subsequent feedback from the Trial Management Group and colleagues
from the UKUFF trial on rotator cuff repair<sup><xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> indicated the need for greater emphasis
on the non-surgical aspects of treatment and rehabilitation, and that
the protocol should make very clear that it applied to all patients,
whether treated surgically or non-surgically. The final version
was installed as a document provided to trial sites and its use
for all trial participants mandated in the trial manual. </p></sec><sec><title content-type="h3">Home exercises</title><p>We promoted the need for physiotherapists to encourage patients
to perform home exercises. These tend to reflect patient ability
and be adapted as the patient recovers. Since this variation contradicts
the development of standardised material, our protocol indicated
we would check that physiotherapists either provided information
leaflets illustrating exercises for home use already or would access
a standard web-based facility to generate &#x02018;bespoke&#x02019; exercise sheets.
It was considered essential that physiotherapists documented whether patients
had done their home exercises.</p></sec><sec><title content-type="h3">Delivery</title><p>Delivering physiotherapy to this patient population is complicated
by the tendency of patients to receive physiotherapy at one or more
different locations after leaving hospital. Although approval from
Research and Development (R and D) often covered data collection
by physiotherapists delivering care in clinics in the community,
sometimes R and D approval for Primary Care Trusts was required
in addition to that from acute hospital trusts. For practical purposes,
only the main Primary Care Trusts were generally targeted &#x02013; patients
who were expected to use venues outside their catchment area were
deemed ineligible for the trial. Ultimately, additional R&#x000a0;and D approval
was obtained for 16 Primary Care Trusts. </p><p>To facilitate delivery of physiotherapy and data collection,
contacts for physiotherapy were identified at each trial site and
named in the local site R and D approval document for the study.
The contact physiotherapists usually attended the multidisciplinary
team meeting at site set-up visits. The contacts were responsible
for organising this aspect of care including dissemination of trial
methods and materials, providing advice, distribution and collection
of physiotherapy follow-up forms, and often their dispatch to the
trial co-ordinating centre. All but one participating hospital had
named contacts for physiotherapy.</p></sec><sec><title content-type="h3">Data collection</title><p>Insights from other investigators of multi-centre orthopaedic
surgery trials indicated the need to design forms documenting physiotherapy
treatment that could be readily completed at the end of each session.
Such forms need to capture all the key information for an assessment
of the physiotherapy delivered: when, by whom, referral to other
specialities and end-of-treatment data. Some limited patient outcome
data were also collected. After identifying the essential data needed for
collection, the focus turned to the practical aspects of collecting
data over a protracted period, including optimising form design.</p><p>In designing the physiotherapy treatment log, consideration was
given to physiotherapists&#x02019; routine record keeping, so that completing
the form would require little additional effort. It included tick
boxes for registering the use of basic categories of interventions
(advice and/or education, exercise, TENS, soft-tissue techniques,
etc), and gave the opportunity to record other interventions, including
any substantial variations from the ProFHER physiotherapy protocol.
A question asked whether the patient had done his or her home exercises,
and a text box was provided for any comments. Key data on a physiotherapist&#x02019;s
grade, location and duration of session were also collected for
inclusion in the cost-effectiveness analysis. Additionally, an &#x02018;end
of treatment&#x02019; form was designed primarily to collect reasons for
discharging a patient when treatment was and was not completed. Piloting
of draft data collection forms was undertaken to identify and resolve
any problems. Consideration of how to maximise the completion and
return of forms pointed to the need for local physiotherapy contacts
to co-ordinate data collection. Hospitals were paid for the return
of physiotherapy data on each participant in the trial.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title content-type="h3">Sling care information</title><p>All participating sites completed the post-recruitment survey
on the provision of the sling care information leaflets to patients
eligible for participation in ProFHER. This revealed that 28 of
the 33 hospitals (85%) that had identified eligible patients routinely
provided ProFHER leaflets to all eligible patients. Two sites had &#x02018;never&#x02019;
used the leaflet, one of which provided an alternative, which was
a text-only leaflet providing general advice on sling use during
conservative management of proximal humeral fractures. Three other
sites &#x02018;rarely&#x02019; used the leaflet. All 32 sites who had recruited
patients into the trial routinely provided the ProFHER sling information
leaflet. </p><p>These results confirm the delivery of a standard of care, in
particular for consenting patients, thereby ensuring comparability
between the two randomised groups.</p></sec><sec><title content-type="h3">Physiotherapy</title><p>As shown in Table I, data from physiotherapy treatment logs demonstrated
equal physiotherapy access and implementation between groups. Similar numbers
of patients in each group received &#x02018;other&#x02019; interventions, none of
which was electrotherapy (which would have been a protocol violation).
A review of the 486 comments in the physiotherapy treatment logs found
no record of a substantial difference from the ProFHER physiotherapy
protocol. However, lack of access to the physiotherapy protocol
was identified from the comments by two outpatient physiotherapists
for two patients in the surgical group. </p><table-wrap id="t1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table I</label><caption><p>Physiotherapy</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Surgical

in the protocol, the physiotherapy contact realised that some allowance
was needed for home exercises that were predominantly based on daily functional
tasks (such as reaching up to the top of a cupboard). For these
tasks, written instructions were considered unhelpful, the emphasis
being on the monitoring and reinforcement of these and related functional
activities at subsequent physiotherapy. Table I shows the high levels
of recording of home exercises, with similarly high numbers of participants
in both groups recorded as performing home exercises for most sessions.</p></sec><sec><title content-type="h3">Delivery</title><p>The success of our processes is corroborated by data in Table
I. The underlying complexity in the provision and documentation
of rehabilitation for these fractures is illustrated by the data
for one centre, chosen because it served a mainly urban community
(typical for ProFHER) and had sufficient patient numbers. In all, 28&#x000a0;physiotherapists
completed the treatment log forms and provided care to the 15 patients
recruited at this centre. Of the 18 physiotherapists providing outpatient
care, eight were based in one hospital outpatient department, eight
in another hospital outpatient department, one from an external
source provided home care and one from a health centre. While a
variety of physiotherapists provide hospital ward care, patients
mostly had one or two physiotherapists providing care in an outpatient department.</p></sec><sec><title content-type="h3">Data collection</title><p>Aside from two sites, where repeated requests for the return
of physiotherapy forms were required, physiotherapy treatment logs
and end of treatment forms for individual patients were returned
in a timely manner throughout the trial. Ultimately, 235 of 250
(94%) physiotherapy treatment logs and 245 of 250 (98%) physiotherapy
&#x02018;end of treatment&#x02019; forms were obtained. Most of the missing logs
were because patients never started physiotherapy. Overall, the
data forms were well completed. The only notable yet resolvable
problem found at data checking was the numbering of physiotherapy
sessions, which was often recorded as starting at one again when
the patient was transferred to another healthcare setting.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The successful attainment of the recruitment target and low attrition
in the return of patient questionnaires and hospital forms meant
that ProFHER provides good quality evidence on a key treatment question.<sup><xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> However, the validity of trial results
and their applicability also depend on other aspects of trial design,
conduct and reporting.<sup><xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> In particular, it
is crucial to ensure comparability in good standard care throughout
the trial so that any difference in outcome can be attributed to
the interventions under test.<sup><xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Typically,
single-centre trials are able to exert greater control over their
treatment interventions and rehabilitation, but at a loss of general
applicability. A recent trial on proximal humeral fractures describes
the same rehabilitation protocol being rigidly prescribed to both
groups, and a regular monthly visit to the physiotherapist up to
12 months.<sup><xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Such
control and prescription for tightly-staged physiotherapy and surveillance
is neither practical nor appropriate for large multi-centre trials
such as ProFHER. Here, the emphasis, especially where there is a
lack of robust evidence to inform practice, has to be on taking
sufficient measures to ensure comparability of accepted good practice
for the intervention groups, yet allowing for acceptable variation.
Thus, the focus shifts to providing a good standard of care, using
familiar techniques and safeguarding for substantial deviations
that might undermine this. The development of a basic physiotherapy
protocol was central to achieving this aim.</p><p>This article has focused on the key processes undertaken to ensure
a good standard and comparable rehabilitation, and the reporting
of this, within the context of this pragmatic trial. Table II summarises
the key stages in setting up, delivering on, reviewing and reporting
of rehabilitation in terms of CONSORT.<sup><xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> All
measures taken were successful and arguably, for some at least,
their impact could have exceeded that of the trial itself. For example,
the survey of the use of the sling care information leaflet by the
participating sites
not only provided assurance of comparability between the two treatment
groups, but also revealed the correct identification of an important
gap in patient management in that only one site had an alternative
leaflet. The provision of the basic treatment physiotherapy protocol addressed
another important gap. None of the participating sites raised objections
to using the protocol, and no protocol violations were recorded
or detected. Minor variation in practice, often reflecting adaptation
to the needs of individual patients, was expected in the context
of accepted good practice.</p><table-wrap id="t2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table II</label><caption><p>Summary of the key stages in setting

</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>The return of the completed physiotherapy treatment logs and
end of treatment forms was exemplary, especially given the often
complex and protracted care pathway for individual patients. The
data on the location and reporting of physiotherapist data for one
participating centre illustrate the need for and the diligence of
the great majority of the physiotherapy contacts for the trial.
They vindicate also the groundwork done at the start of the study
and early involvement of physiotherapists when setting up sites. Such
data are essential for the full and correct reporting of the trial.<sup><xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> For example, the CONSORT participant
flow diagram, where the numbers of care providers in each centre
are reported; the interventions, which includes details of how these
were standardised; and a discussion on the applicability of the
trial findings.<sup><xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>
</p><p>The key role played by physiotherapists in ensuring the success
of this multi-centre trial is shown. The early inclusion of a physiotherapist
in trial management, including importantly in the Trial Steering
Committee and Trial Management Group, was essential to ensure there
was sufficient attention paid to the rehabilitation aspect of the trial.
Physiotherapists also were central to local management and co-ordination
of trial activities. In ten hospitals, physiotherapists were also
the designated contacts and thus responsible for all trial activities
including patient recruitment at a hospital site. These ten centres
recruited a total of 89 patients (36% of total).</p><p>This article has shown the attention required for delivering
and reporting the rehabilitation aspect of randomised controlled
trials in evaluating definitive treatment options. Involvement of
rehabilitation specialists (such as physiotherapists in the UK)
in the trial design, setting up, conduct, reporting and interpretation
of the data and results of such trials is essential to ensure their validity,
applicability and implementation.</p><p><bold>Acknowledgements:</bold> The authors wish to thank Mr M.
