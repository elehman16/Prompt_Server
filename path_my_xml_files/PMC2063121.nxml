Patients who responded to conventional chemotherapy were mobilized with chemotherapy (mainly high-dose cyclophosphamide) and/or recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhG-CSF). Patients who reached the threshold of 20 CD34+ cells per microl of peripheral blood underwent apheresis and were randomized at that time to receive either unmanipulated mobilized blood cells or selected CD34+ cells. For patients in the study arm, CD34+ cells were selected from aphereses using the Isolex300 device. Fifteen patients failed to mobilize peripheral blood progenitors and nine other patients were excluded for various reasons. Forty-seven eligible patients were randomized into two comparable groups. CD34+ cells were selected from aphereses in the study group. Haematopoietic recovery occurred at similar times in both groups. No side-effect related to the infusion of selected cells was observed. The frequency of epithelial tumour cells in aphereses was low (8 out of 42 evaluated patients), as determined by immunocytochemistry. We conclude that selected CD34+ cells safely support haematopoietic recovery following high-dose chemotherapy in patients with poor-prognosis breast cancer.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00011-0077.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="913" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00011-0078.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="914" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00011-0079.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="915" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00011-0080.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="916" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00011-0081.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="917" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00011-0082.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="918" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00011-0083.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="919" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00011-0084.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="920" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00011-0085.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="921" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
