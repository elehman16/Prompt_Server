Physical activity and exercises along with medical management and dietary plan are common strategies to use for the management of deranged lipid profile in patients with T2DM. We aimed to determine the effects of supervised structured aerobic exercise training (SSAET) program on high and low density lipoprotein in patients with T2DM.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Methods:</title><p>This randomized control trial study was conducted at Riphah Rehabilitation Research Centre (RRRC), Pakistan Railway General Hospital (PRGH) Rawalpindi from 1<sup>st</sup> January 2015 to 30<sup>th</sup> March 2016. The inclusion criteria was Type-2 diabetes patients of both gender aged between 40 to 70 years. Patients with severe complications like coronary artery diseases (CAD), and other serious complications like diabetic foot, and severe knee and hip osteoarthritis (OA) were excluded from the study. A total of 195 patients diagnosed with T2DM were screened out and 102 were selected for the study as per the inclusion criteria. All participants were randomly assigned into two groups, experimental &#x02018;A&#x02019; (n=51) and control &#x02018;B&#x02019; (n=51). Patients in group A were treated with SSAET program of 25 weeks at 3 days a week in addition to routine medical management, while patients in Group-B were on their routine medications and dietary plan. Serum LDL, and HDL were tested at baseline and after 25 weeks. The data was analysed through SPSS 20.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>Mean and standard deviation of LDL in group A (n=51) was 118.56&#x000b1;19.17 (pre) and 102.64&#x000b1;13.33 (post), while the mean and standard deviation for Group-B (n=51) was 116.50&#x000b1;18.45 (Pre) and 109.88&#x000b1;17.13 (post). Both groups showed improvement but, Group-A treated with SSAET along with RMM showed significantly higher (P Value &#x02264; 0.05) improvement as compared with group B treated with RMM alone. Mean and standard deviation of HDL in Group-A was 42.70&#x000b1;8.06 (pre) and 47.47&#x000b1;7.16 (post), while the mean and standard deviation of group B is 43.37&#x000b1;8.15 (Pre) and 44.41&#x000b1;7.91 (post).

Group-A was treated with SSAET program at three days a week for 25 weeks in addition to routine medical management, while group B were treated with routine medication and dietary plan.</p><p>Sahay BK and his colleagues in 2002 conducted a similar study in the management of diabetes mellitus through life style modification and concluded that exercise and dietary control are the most important primary therapeutic modalities for the management of diabetes mellitus. Exercise is especially very effective in Type-2 diabetes mellitus as it increases insulin sensitivity and normalise dyslipidaemia.<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Our results also showed significant improvements in normalizing deranged HDL and LDL levels in patients with Type-2 diabetes mellitus, while treated with SSAET program.</p><p>A study was conducted in 2014 by Mann S and his colleagues and they concluded that regular physical activity increased HDL levels, while maintaining LDL and triglycerides levels. It was also concluded that very high intensity aerobic exercises are required for improving and decreasing LDL levels. It was observed that increase in calorific expenditure is associated with intensity and duration of aerobic exercises, and positively influence HDL and LDL levels. <xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Our study also demonstrated that the participants underwent a long duration i.e. 25 weeks of supervised aerobic exercise and there was reduction in LDL and increase in HDL levels.</p><p>Another study was conducted by Kelley GA and his colleagues in 2006, to test the effects of a 12 weeks training program of resistance, aerobic exercises and combined exercises at moderate intensity for 30 minutes, five days a week on HDL and LDL.
