It is the most common malignant tumor in Asia, especially in China.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup> At present, the average prevalence and mortality rate of gastric cancer in China significantly exceed the average risk worldwide. A majority of cases are diagnosed with advanced gastric cancer upon admission. Surgical resection supplemented with postoperative chemotherapy remains the primary treatment, whereas the postoperative recurrence rate is alarmingly high.<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup> Development of the molecular biological techniques unravels the mechanisms underlying the incidence and progression of malignant tumors. Cell receptor, cell cycle, signal conduction, and angiogenesis have been validated to act as the novel targets of clinical intervention of cancer. Previous studies<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> have demonstrated that cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) plays a pivotal role in the incidence and progression of malignant tumors. Our preliminary in vitro study has suggested that COX-2 can regulate the expression of E-cadherin through Snail/NF-kb signaling pathway and promote the proliferation, infiltration, and metastasis of gastric cancer cells. On this basis, celecoxib was applied as the preoperative short-term intervention for gastric cancer patients, suggesting that elective COX-2 inhibitor could inhibit the proliferation, infiltration, and metastasis of malignant tumors. Recent investigations<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup> have demonstrated that celecoxib, as an elective COX-2 inhibitor, possesses anti-tumor effect in tumor model studies and clinical trials. Celecoxib and chemotherapy agents exert a synergistic effect upon malignant tumors, whereas the conclusion remains to be further validated by multicenter and sample-size investigations. Moreover, gastric cancer is manifested with geographical pattern and influenced by genetics and environmental factors, which significantly affect the sensitivity and specificity of postoperative chemotherapy. In this case-control study, gastric cancer patients from Gansu province, a gastric cancer-prevalent region were recruited. The clinical efficacy and safety of celecoxib combined with chemotherapy in gastric cancer patients after undergoing radical gastrectomy were evaluated.</p></sec><sec><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><label>2.1</label><title>Study subjects</title><p>The patients undergoing radical gastrectomy from 3 centers including the First Affiliated Hospital of Lanzhou University, Gansu Wuwei Tumor Hospital, and the General Hospital of Lanzhou Military Command between September 2010 and July 2016 were enrolled in this clinical trial. All patients were randomly assigned into the experimental and control groups. In the control group, a chemotherapy regime consisting of fluorouracil-type drugs (5-fluorouracil, capecitabine, and tegafur) in combination with oxaliplatin at a dosage of 130&#x0200a;mg/m<sup>2</sup> via intravenous drip for 3&#x0200a;hours. In the experimental group, the chemotherapy regime was similar to the control group. Celecoxib capsule (200&#x0200a;mg) was administered twice daily for approximately continuous 5 months until the day of final chemotherapy. According to the compliance and tolerance of gastric cancer patients, 6 cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy were delivered. The clinical efficacy and safety of adjuvant chemotherapy were assessed every 2 cycles. Written informed consents were obtained from all participants. The study procedures were approved by the ethics committee of our hospital.</p></sec><sec><label>2.2</label><title>Inclusion and exclusion criteria</title><p>Inclusion criteria were follows: aged 18 to 70 years; patients who had undergone radical gastrectomy; ECOG PS 0&#x02013;2; estimated survival &#x0003e;12 weeks; no vital organ dysfunction; normal outcomes for liver, kidney, heart function tests; routine blood test: neutrophilic granulocyte count &#x02265;1.5&#x0200a;&#x000d7;&#x0200a;10<sup>9</sup>/L, hemoglobin &#x02265;90&#x0200a;g/L, and platelet count &#x02265;85&#x0200a;&#x000d7;&#x0200a;10<sup>9</sup>/L.

Epstein-Barr virus, which is carcinogenic to humans, has also been linked to gastric cancer. Surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy remain the primary interventions for the treatment of advanced gastric cancer.<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup> Although radical gastrectomy and systemic lymph node dissection yield clinical efficacy, the risk of recurrence and metastasis of gastric carcinoma is still alarmingly high. Compared with the radical gastrectomy alone, radical gastrectomy combined with postoperative chemotherapy can significantly enhance the clinical prognosis, and prolong the median OS, DFS, and PFS of gastric cancer patients. Meta-analysis has revealed that combined chemotherapy exerts a higher clinical efficacy in the clinical prognosis of advanced gastric cancer patients compared with the chemotherapy alone. For patients diagnosed with middle- and advanced-stage gastric cancer, chemotherapy is still the primary option for gastric cancer treatment.<sup>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup> Chemotherapy combined with supporting therapy can mitigate the clinical symptoms, enhance the quality of life and improve clinical prognosis of gastric cancer patients. Nevertheless, the issues of insensitivity or drug resistance towards the chemotherapy drugs are urgently to be resolved. Previous clinical trials have reported that approximately 50% of patients are insensitive to platinum-based chemotherapy agents due to secondary multidrug resistance in China. Moreover, the use of chemotherapy is likely to cause severe injuries to the proliferation and activity of normal cells. Therefore, a targeted and harmless chemotherapy agent is urgently required to enhance the clinical efficacy and therapeutic safety of postoperative chemotherapy and non-surgical intervention.</p><p>Comprehensive therapeutic regime consisting of chemotherapy in combination with new drug is a novel orientation of current treatment of gastric cancer.<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup> Multi-molecule target medication therapy has been proven to yield high clinical efficacy in clinical trials. The theoretical basis of targeted therapy depends upon the expression levels of tumor-specific biomarkers, which embodies the concept of individualized treatment of malignant tumors. The administration of celecoxib, a cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor, is captivating widespread attention from oncologists. COX-2 has been proven to play a pivotal role in the incidence and progression of malignant tumors.<sup>[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup> COX-2 is able to promote the growth and proliferation of tumors, inhibit the cellular apoptosis, up-regulate the expression level of vascular endothelial growth factor through prostaglandin E2.<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup> Therefore, celecoxib has been recognized to exert anti-tumor effect by oncologists. United States Food and Drug Administration have approved the use of elective COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib to treat familial adenomatosis coli and prevent the incidence of colon cancer in clinical practice. Recent investigations<sup>[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup> have demonstrated that high expression of COX-2 can upregulate the expression level of multidrug resistance proteins, which can be blocked by the use of COX-2 inhibitor. Consequently, administration of celecoxib can enhance the sensitivity of gastric cancer patients towards platinum-based chemotherapy drug and 5-Fu. Our preliminary in vitro research also found that COX-2 is capable of regulating the expression level of E-cadherin through Snail/NF-kb signaling pathway and promoting the growth, infiltration, and metastasis of gastric cancer cells. Therefore, celecoxib in combination with the first-line chemotherapy is a promising comprehensive treatment of gastric cancer.</p><p>The mortality rate of gastric cancer in Gansu province is reported up to 61.99/100,000, accounting for 39.75% of all malignant tumors. The incidence and mortality rate of gastric cancer in Gansu province is the highest nationwide. The prevalence of gastric cancer in Wuwei city of Gansu province is 90.71/100,000, almost 5 times higher compared with the average level in China. According to the annual report of the registered cancer patients in 2016, the incidence rate of gastric cancer in Wuwei city is calculated as 100.38/100,000, accounting for 41.56% among all types of malignant tumors, which is consistent with the incidence rate of 8% in the present investigation.</p><p>In this multicenter randomized case-control study, 230 patients diagnosed with advanced gastric cancer undergoing radical gastrectomy were recruited and randomly assigned into 2 groups. In the control group, chemotherapy regime consisting of fluorouracil in combination with oxaliplatin (5-Fu, capecitabine, and tegafur) alone was adopted. In the experimental group, chemotherapy combined with celecoxib was administered for almost 5 months until the final chemotherapy. According to the therapeutic compliance and tolerance, the adjuvant chemotherapy was delivered for 6 cycles.</p><p>In this study, DFS was considered as the primary efficacy parameter, and overall survival (OS), quality of life (QOL), and therapeutic safety were utilized as the secondary efficacy parameters. Postoperative follow-up endured for 3 years. In total, 117 gastric cancer patients underwent celecoxib combined with chemotherapy. The 3-year OS was calculated as 72% and 64% for the 3-year DFS. In the chemotherapy alone group, the 3-year OS was 68% and the 3-year DFS was calculated as 51%. No statistical significance was identified in terms of the 3-year OS and DFS between 2 groups. Interestingly, for patients with positive COX-2 in the celecoxib combined with chemotherapy group, the 3-year OS was 78% and the 3-year DFS was 70%, significantly higher compared with 66% and 50% of their counterparts in the control group. These comparative results indicate that celecoxib combined with chemotherapy can significantly prolong the 3-year OS and DFS in patients diagnosed with advanced gastric cancer. Although use of celecoxib fails to enhance the OS of all patients, it significantly prolongs the OS and DFS of gastric cancer patients with positive COX-2, suggesting that use of celecoxib target specific gastric cancer patients, and COX-2 is the molecular target of such specific effect. Previous studies have demonstrated that COX-2 is not expressed in all types of malignant tumors, and the expression rate of COX-2 in gastric cancer is estimated to 50% to 60%, which is consistent with the expression rate of COX-2 in gastric cancer patients enrolled in this clinical trial. Since use of celecoxib can enhance the clinical benefits for gastric cancer patients with positive COX-2, whether it is necessary to perform COX-2 detection before standard chemotherapy and screen the gastric cancer patients according to the status of COX-2 expression remain to be further elucidated.</p><p>Prior to corresponding treatment, the scores of QLQ-C30 and QLQ-STO22 did not significantly differ between 2 groups. In addition, no statistical significance was identified in the QLQ-C30 and QLQ-STO22 before and after chemotherapy alone. Nevertheless, the global QOL score, the scores of the pain and fatigue domains of QLQ-C30 questionnaire, and the score of the pain domain of QLQ-STO22 questionnaire in the experimental group were significantly higher after treatment. No statistical significance was noted in terms of alternative domains between 2 groups. These results suggest that administration of celecoxib can significantly enhance the QOL by mitigating the pain and fatigue symptoms of gastric cancer patients. In terms of the adverse events during treatment, 36 patients suffered from nausea in the experimental group, and 33 in the control group. The incidence of grade 3&#x02013;4 adverse events was lower compared with that of overall adverse events. No statistical significance was identified in terms of the adverse events during the period of treatment between 2 groups. These results indicate that celecoxib combined with chemotherapy is a relatively safe treatment of gastric carcinoma, which yields similar adverse events.</p><p>Taken together, celecoxib in combination with the first-line chemotherapy is an efficacious and safe treatment of advanced gastric cancer. The conclusion in this clinical trial should be validated by multicenter, large sample-size investigations.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations: CI = confidence interval, COX-2 = cyclooxygenase-2, DAB = diaminobenzidine, DFS = disease-free survival, HR = hazard ratio, ORR = objective response rate, OS = overall survival, PBS = phosphate buffer solution, PFS = progression-free survival, QOL = quality of life.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p>Funding support: Science and Technology Foundation of Gansu (1606RJZA140); National key research and development plan, digital diagnosis and treatment equipment research and development special project (2016YFC0107006); Scientific and research Management Project of Gansu Healthy Profession (GWGL2010-19).</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>The authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><label>[1]</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Yu</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Gu</surname><given-names>CP</given-names></name><etal/></person-group>
