After applying the inclusion criteria, 60 patients (mean age: 65.0&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;10.4, range 41&#x02013;79) were included in this study (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). The following inclusion criteria were used: &#x02265;6-month history of axial LBP without radicular symptoms; age between 20 and 79 years; local paraspinalis tenderness with increased pain on hyperextension, rotation, or lateral bending of the lower lumbar spine; &#x02265;50% temporary pain relief following a diagnostic block with IA injection of 0.5&#x0200a;mL of 1% lidocaine; and failure to respond to physical therapy and medication (LBP of at least 4 on the numeric rating scale [NRS]). Each patient underwent lumbar spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Exclusion criteria were as follows: disc herniation, lumbar spinal stenosis, spinal instability, coagulopathy, allergy to iodinated contrast, rheumatic disorders, and any uncontrolled medical or psychiatric condition. All subjects provided written informed consent before the study. The Institutional Review Board of Yeungnam University Hospital approved this study. Sixty patients with LFJ pain were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 groups. In the PRF group, 30 patients received PRF stimulation in the IA space of the LFJ. In the IA corticosteroid injection group (ICI group), 30 patients received IA LFJ corticosteroid injection. Randomization was performed using a random table. Treatment was carried out only 1 time for each patient. A putatively painful LFJ was selected on the basis of the physical examination (local tenderness site) and findings of degenerative facet pathology (osteophyte, bone sclerosis, or joint effusion) on radiographs or MR images.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Demographic characteristics of patients in the PRF and ICI groups.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="medi-96-e6524-g001"/></table-wrap></sec><sec><label>2.2</label><title>Procedures</title><p>In the PRF group, the treatment was performed via a posterior approach with the patient in a prone position for C-arm fluoroscopy (Siemens). Patients were positioned in the prone position with a cushion below the lower abdomen to straighten the lumbar spine. The C-arm tube was angled cephalad and rotated until it was at a tangent to the LFJ space. A 23-gauge cannula (SMK Pole needle, 100&#x0200a;mm with a 10&#x0200a;mm active tip, Cotop International BV) was inserted under fluoroscopy parallel to the C-arm beam. To confirm IA access, an arthrogram of the LFJ was obtained by injecting 0.3&#x0200a;mL of contrast (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). IA access was successful in all 30 patients. In the PRF group, an electrode was connected to the cannula, and the LFJ was stimulated (Cosman G4 radiofrequency generator, Cosman Medical). PRF treatment was administered at 5&#x0200a;Hz, and a 5-millisesond pulsed width, for 360&#x0200a;seconds, at 55&#x0200a;V, under the condition that the electrode tip temperature did not exceed 42&#x000b0;C. In the ICI group, the preparation steps were identical to the PRF group. Under C-arm fluoroscopy, after confirming IA access by injecting 0.3&#x0200a;mL of contrast into the CFJ space, we injected 10&#x0200a;mg (0.25&#x0200a;mL) of dexamethasone mixed with 0.25&#x0200a;mL of 0.125% bupivacaine using a 26-gauge, 90&#x0200a;mm spinal needle.

Our results show that the severity of pain, which was measured using the NRS, was significantly reduced after each procedure and persisted for the 6-month duration of the study. At 1 month after the procedures, the patients who had corticosteroid injection showed a significantly higher reduction in pain compared with the PRF group. However, at 3 and 6 months after the procedures, the degrees of pain reduction were not significantly different between the 2 groups. Furthermore, in both groups, approximately half of patients reported more than 50% of pain relief at 6 months after each procedure. Summarizing, the short-term pain-relieving effect was superior in the ICI group, but the long-term effect was similar between PRF and ICI.</p><p>The mechanisms of how IA PRF reduces joint pain remain unclear. However, we can suggest some possible therapeutic mechanisms of IA PRF. First, PRF stimulation causes damages in the sensory nociceptive axons at a microscopic or subcellular level. These lesions are selectively located in the smaller principal sensory nociceptors (C-fibers and A-delta fibers), but are rarely identified in the larger nonpain-related sensory fibers (A-beta fiber).<sup>[<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup> Therefore, we think IA PRF of the LFJ disrupts the synovial lining nociceptive C-fibers. Additionally, due to insulating properties of bone, the current can be deflected by bony surfaces, and remain inside the joint space without weakening.<sup>[<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</sup> Accordingly, the residual current in the LFJ appeared to inhibit the excitability of pain-generating afferent nerves, or free nerve endings, which richly innervate the articular capsule. On the contrary, the electrical field induced by a PRF electrode placed in soft tissue rapidly weakens if the distance from the electrode is increased.<sup>[<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</sup> Finally, the electrical field was reported to reduce the production of proinflammatory or inflammatory cytokines.<sup>[<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</sup> After the application of PRF into the joint, serum C-reactive protein and cytokines were reduced.<sup>[<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</sup> In our study, IA PRF stimulation of the LFJ seems to reduce the IA inflammation, leading to reduction of LFJ-origin pain.</p><p>The efficacy of IA LFJ corticosteroid injection remains a subject of discussion. Several studies demonstrated the positive short and long- term effects of IA LFJ corticosteroid injection for managing LFJ pain.<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup> In contrast, Lilius et al<sup>[<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</sup> reported no differences in outcome between the placebo and ICI groups. Generally, to clinicians, the level of evidence of ICIs is fair or moderate.<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup> We adopted strict inclusion criteria in recruiting patients with LFJ origin pain; we included patients who presented with positive findings on both physical examination and diagnostic block. Furthermore, we excluded patients who had disc herniation, lumbar spinal stenosis, or spinal instability on MRI findings. In the current study, IA LFJ corticosteroid injection was shown to be effective during at least 6 months after the injection. The aim of ICI is to bring corticosteroids into the degenerated facet joint based on the belief that there is inflammation. If there is inflammation of the synovium, the synovial lining nociceptive C-fibers are excited, which are responsible for the development of the LFJ pain.<sup>[<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</sup> The anti-inflammatory properties of corticosteroids block production and release of the inflammatory mediators, and consequently inhibit processes to the inflammation.<sup>[<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]</sup> ICI in our patients with LFJ pain could reduce IA inflammation, which seems to have reduced LFJ pain. However, despite the effectiveness of IA corticosteroids, they have potential adverse effects, including major ones such as suppression of the pituitary-adrenal axis, hyperadrenocorticism, avascular necrosis, osteoporosis, myopathy, and hyperglycemia, to minor ones such as flushing, sweating, and nausea.<sup>[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup> In our study, 1 of the 30 patients who received corticosteroid injection developed hyperglycemia. On the contrary, in the PRF group, no adverse events were reported. Considering the various adverse effects of corticosteroids and devastating results after repeated corticosteroid injections, we think IA PRF stimulation may be a better option in managing LFJ pain than ICI.</p><p>As for the usefulness of PRF for managing LFJ pain, several studies have demonstrated the positive efficacy of PRF stimulation on lumbar medial branches.<sup>[<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]</sup> However, so far, no study has been conducted on the effect of IA LFJ PRF stimulation. Targeting medial branches of the dorsal ramus is sometimes technically challenging.<sup>[<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]</sup> Compared with PRF stimulation on lumbar medial branches, IA insertion of PRF catheter needle can be technically easier to perform by clinicians. We believe that IA LFJ PRF stimulation would be helpful to reduce the amount of exposing radiation during the procedure and the time taken for the procedure.</p><p>In conclusion, we found that both IA PRF stimulation and ICI into the LFJ significantly relieved LFJ pain, and their effects were sustained for at least 6 months after the procedure. The short-term effect was higher after ICI, but the long-term effect was not significantly different between the 2 procedures. Successful pain relief at 6 months was about 50% for patients in both groups. IA PRF can be a useful clinical option for the management of LFJ pain, particularly in patients at risk for development of complications from the use of corticosteroids. Our study involved a small number of subjects; thus, further studies involving larger number of subjects are warranted for a clear elucidation of this topic.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations: CRF = conventional radiofrequency, IA = intra-articular, ICI = intra-articular corticosteroid injection, LBP = lower back pain, LFJ = lumbar facet joint, MBB = medial branch block, MRI = magnetic resonance imaging, NRS = numeric rating scale, PRF = pulsed radiofrequency.</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>The authors report no conflicts of interest.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><label>[1]</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><collab>From the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</collab>. <article-title>Prevalence of disabilities and associated health conditions among adults: United States, 1999</article-title>. <source>JAMA</source>
