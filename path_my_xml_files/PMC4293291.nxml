The GLOW7 study evaluated the efficacy and safety of od glycopyrronium 50 &#x003bc;g in predominantly Chinese patients with moderate-to-severe COPD.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In this 26-week, multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study, men and women &#x02265;40 years with moderate-to-severe COPD were randomized to glycopyrronium 50 &#x003bc;g od or placebo (2:1). The primary objective was to confirm the significant improvement of trough forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) following 12 weeks of treatment with glycopyrronium compared with placebo. Secondary objectives included the effect of glycopyrronium on health status (St George&#x02019;s Respiratory Questionnaire), breathlessness (Transition Dyspnea Index), other lung function parameters, rescue medication use, and COPD exacerbations. Safety and tolerability were also evaluated.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Of the 460 patients randomized, 459 were included in the full analysis set (glycopyrronium, n=306; placebo, n=154; mean age 64.7 years; mean post-bronchodilator FEV<sub>1</sub>: 50.8% predicted); 425 (92.4%) completed the study. At Week 12, glycopyrronium signifcantly improved trough FEV<sub>1</sub> with a least square means treatment difference of 141 mL (95% confidence interval 111 mL, 171 mL; <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001) compared with placebo. The mean treatment effect of glycopyrronium was greater than the minimum clinically important difference versus placebo in both St George&#x02019;s Respiratory Questionnaire total score (&#x02212;4.92; <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001) and Transition Dyspnea Index focal score (1.0; <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001) at week 26. Glycopyrronium reduced the risk of exacerbations in terms of time to first moderate or severe exacerbation by 28% (<italic>P</italic>=0.153) and rate of moderate or severe COPD exacerbation by 29% (<italic>P</italic>=0.119) compared with placebo. Incidence of death was 1.3% with glycopyrronium and 0% in placebo during the treatment period. Overall incidence of adverse events (glycopyrronium 43.6%; placebo 47.4%) and serious adverse events (glycopyrronium 5.6%; placebo 9.1%) were similar.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In predominantly Chinese patients with moderate-to-severe COPD, od glycopyrronium 50 &#x003bc;g significantly improved lung function, dyspnea, and health status compared with placebo.

The study was conducted in 37 centers in four countries (People&#x02019;s Republic of China, Korea, India, and the Philippines). The majority of centers were in the People&#x02019;s Republic of China (25 centers). All patients provided written informed consent before participating in the study. In the 7-day pre-screening washout period, patients discontinued using long-acting &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-agonist and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) combination therapy and were switched to equivalent ICS monotherapy. Patients&#x02019; eligibility based on symptom control via daily electronic diary was assessed during the 14 day run-in period. Eligible patients were randomized (2:1) to od glycopyrronium 50 &#x003bc;g or placebo (both via the Breezhaler<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> device) to be taken in the morning between 8 am and 11 am, for a period of 26 weeks. Randomization was stratified according to baseline smoking status. Salbutamol/albuterol was permitted as rescue medication throughout the study. The study was approved by institutional review boards and ethics committees at participating centers, and was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Conference on Harmonization Good Clinical Practice guidelines.</p></sec><sec><title>Assessments</title><sec><title>Efficacy</title><p>Spirometry measurements (FEV<sub>1</sub> and FVC) were taken to assess patients&#x02019; eligibility before the run-in period and to measure the post-bronchodilator FEV<sub>1</sub> 45 minutes after inhalation of 4&#x000d7;20 &#x003bc;g of ipratropium bromide (or equivalent dose). Thereafter, spirometry measurements were taken at randomization, Days 1, 2, 29, 85, 86 and 183 and 184 and at the time of discontinuation for patients who discontinued prematurely.</p><p>The primary objective of the study was to confirm the significant improvement with glycopyrronium delivered via the Breezhaler<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> device versus placebo on trough FEV<sub>1</sub> (mean of FEV<sub>1</sub> at 11.15 pm and 11.45 pm post dose) after 12 weeks of treatment in patients with COPD.</p><p>Secondary objectives were to evaluate the improvements in health status according to St George&#x02019;s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score and dyspnea measured using the Transition Dyspnea Index (TDI) at Weeks 12 and 26.

Cause of death, non-fatal serious cardio- and cerebrovascular (CCV) events, as well as all atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter events occurring during the study and follow-up period were evaluated by an independent adjudication committee.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Summary statistics were used to describe demographics and baseline patient characteristics based on safety set, which included all patients who received at least one dose of study drug whether or not being randomized. Efficacy analysis was performed in the full analysis set, defined as all randomized patients who received at least one dose of the study drug. Primary efficacy variable, trough FEV<sub>1</sub> at Week 12 was analyzed using a mixed model with last observation carried forward, including treatment as a fixed effect, baseline FEV<sub>1</sub> measurement, FEV<sub>1</sub> prior to inhalation of short acting bronchodilator, FEV<sub>1</sub> 45 minutes post inhalation of short acting bronchodilator as covariates. The model also included baseline ICS use (yes/no), smoking status (current/ex-smoker) and region (People&#x02019;s Republic of China/other) as fixed effects with center nested within region as a random effect. Other efficacy variables were analyzed using the similar mixed model using corresponding baseline measurement replacing baseline FEV<sub>1</sub>. The percentage of patients with clinically important improvement of SGRQ total score and TDI focal score was analyzed using logistic regression. The model included the same terms as described above. Time to first moderate or severe COPD exacerbation was analyzed using a Cox regression model and displayed by Kaplan&#x02013;Meier curves. The Cox regression model included terms for treatment, baseline ICS use (yes/no), baseline total symptom score, baseline COPD exacerbation history, FEV<sub>1</sub> prior to inhalation of short acting bronchodilator, FEV<sub>1</sub> 45 minutes post inhalation of short acting bronchodilator, smoking status, and region. The rate of moderate or severe COPD exacerbations during the 26 weeks of treatment was analyzed using a generalized linear model assuming a negative binomial distribution. The log (time on treatment) was used as the offset variable in the model. The model included the same terms as used for the analysis of time to first moderate or severe COPD exacerbation. Safety assessment was conducted using summary statistics based on safety set. Sample size calculation is given in the Supplementary material.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Patient disposition and baseline characteristics</title><p>A total of 742 patients were screened; 460 patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to glycopyrronium (n=306) or placebo (n=154); 425 (92.4%) completed the study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-copd-10-057">Figure 2</xref>).

Treatment with long-acting bronchodilators improved patients&#x02019; functional status and quality of life by maintaining optimal lung function, improving symptoms, and preventing the recurrence of exacerbations.<xref rid="b12-copd-10-057" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Glycopyrronium showed a rapid and sustained bronchodilation throughout the 26 week study period. In addition, a significant improvement in FEV<sub>1</sub> at 5 minutes post-dose on Day 1 suggests that glycopyrronium could be beneficial for patients struggling with morning symptoms of COPD.<xref rid="b13-copd-10-057" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p><p>Rapid and sustained bronchodilation in patients with moderate-to-severe COPD with glycopyrronium was associated with a significant improvement in dyspnea and health status versus placebo.<xref rid="b6-copd-10-057" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> In this study, improvement in lung function was accompanied by significant improvements in patient-reported outcomes (SGRQ and TDI). A systematic review of randomized clinical studies with inhaled long-acting bronchodilators showed proportional improvement in health status with trough FEV<sub>1</sub>, but association between change in FEV<sub>1</sub> and other patient-reported outcomes was generally weak.<xref rid="b14-copd-10-057" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> SGRQ represents a key patient-reported outcome that evaluates the overall health status of patients, whereas dyspnea is a common and most troublesome symptom of COPD. Improvement in health status and relief from dyspnea are important goals of the management of COPD.</p><p>Exacerbations are generally associated with a rapid decline in lung function and worse health outcomes in patients with COPD and may require emergency room visits or hospitalization with significant associated costs.<xref rid="b15-copd-10-057" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Reduction in exacerbations is one of the major components of management of COPD. In this study, glycopyrronium showed a trend towards reduction in the risk of exacerbation both in terms of rate and time to first moderate and severe COPD exacerbations, although this finding did not reach statistical significance. These outcomes are consistent with other LAMAs like tiotropium and aclidinium. In patients with moderate-to-severe COPD, tiotropium numerically reduced the risk of exacerbations during 26 week treatment period versus placebo.<xref rid="b16-copd-10-057" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Aclidinium, a twice-daily LAMA also showed a numerical reduction in risk of exacerbation compared with placebo in the ACCLAIM/COPD I clinical study.<xref rid="b17-copd-10-057" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> The result of non-significant improvement in this study is not surprising, as the study was not powered for exacerbations and the overall rate of exacerbations in the study was comparatively low (annual exacerbation rate of 0.59 in the placebo arm of this study, compared with 2.20 reported elsewhere).<xref rid="b18-copd-10-057" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p><p>Further to the above results, reduction in rescue medication use and symptom scores with glycopyrronium also supported the improvement in dyspnea and overall health status. Superior efficacy of glycopyrronium over placebo also resulted in less resource utilization during the study.</p><p>The incidence of AEs was generally low and comparable between the study groups, and most AEs were either mild or moderate in severity. A lower proportion of patients experienced severe AEs with glycopyrronium (4.3%) compared with placebo (8.4%). Worsening of COPD was the most frequent AE which occurred less frequently in patients with glycopyrronium compared with placebo. The proportion of patients with SAEs was also lower with glycopyrronium (5.6%) compared with placebo (9.1%). These data provide further support for the favorable safety profile of glycopyrronium, which is consistent with reported studies where glycopyrronium had a comparable safety profile with placebo or active comparators.<xref rid="b4-copd-10-057" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="b6-copd-10-057" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b8-copd-10-057" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Furthermore, no clinically relevant changes in QTc, changes in pulse rate, urinalysis, routine hematology, biochemistry, or blood pressure were observed with glycopyrronium during the study. This fact is supported by the previous findings where glycopyrronium, at supratherapeutic doses, did not show any clinically relevant effect on QT interval.<xref rid="b19-copd-10-057" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> In this study, CCV events were similar between the treatment groups. The reason for the numerical imbalance in deaths was not entirely clear, as baseline risk factors were generally well balanced between the treatment groups. However, percentage of patients with severe COPD and ICS use at baseline was slightly higher in the glycopyrronium group compared to placebo. But, the observed differences do not preclude the possibility that this numerical imbalance in death occurred by chance. Overall, the small imbalance of the death cases was not considered clinically meaningful and none of the deaths were related to the treatments.</p><p>Overall, the results from the GLOW7 study demonstrated the efficacy of glycopyrronium over 26 weeks in patients with moderate-to-severe COPD. Glycopyrronium showed a rapid onset of action and sustained bronchodilation compared with placebo. This study in predominantly Chinese patients with moderate-to-severe COPD supports the use of the approved therapeutic dose of od glycopyrronium 50 &#x003bc;g as an effective and well-tolerated treatment option in the management of stable COPD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary material</title><sec><title>Inclusion and exclusion criteria</title><sec><title>Inclusion criteria</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Male or female patients aged &#x02265;40 years, who had signed an informed consent form prior to initiation of any study-related procedure.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Patients with moderate-to-severe stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD; stage II or stage III) according to the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD 2010) guidelines.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Current or ex-smokers who had a smoking history of at least 10 pack-years (10 pack-years was defined as 20 cigarettes a day for 10 years, or ten cigarettes a day for 20 years, etc).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Patients with a post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) &#x02265;30% and &#x0003c;80% of the predicted normal and post-bronchodilator FEV<sub>1</sub>/forced vital capacity &#x0003c;0.7 at visit two (day &#x02013;14; post refers FEV<sub>1</sub> and forced vital capacity after 45 minutes of administering ipratropium).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Symptomatic patients, according to daily electronic diary data between visit two (day &#x02212;14) and visit three (Day 1), with a total score of 1 or more on at least 4 of the last 7 days prior to visit three.</p></list-item></list></sec></sec><sec><title>Exclusion criteria</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Pregnant women or nursing mothers (pregnancy confirmed by human chorionic gonadotropin laboratory test).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Women of child-bearing potential.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Patients with a history of long QT interval syndrome or whose corrected QTc measured at visit one (Fridericia method) was prolonged (&#x0003e;450 ms for males and females), as confirmed by the central electrocardiogram (ECG) interpretation.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Patients who had a clinically significant abnormality on the ECG at visit one, who in the judgment of the investigator, would be at potential risk if enrolled into the study.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Patients who, in the judgment of the investigator, had a clinically relevant laboratory abnormality or a clinically significant condition before visit three, such as (but not limited to):
