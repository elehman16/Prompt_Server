Even though effective anti-bacterial treatment for TB has been available for more than six decades, the long duration of treatment poses challenges to patients, who find complying with treatment over extended periods taxing. Poor compliance facilitates development of drug resistance that further aggravates the problem. Moreover, no new drug specific for TB has been introduced since the late 1960s.</p><p>Shortening the duration of treatment for TB is a global research priority. A regimen significantly shorter than the currently recommended 6-month regimen will be a boon for both patients and health care providers. Clinical trials that studied the efficacy of 3&#x02013;4 month regimens in the 1970s and 1980s had high relapse rates <xref rid="pone.0067030-Fox1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. A randomized clinical trial by the National Institute for Research in TB (NIRT) formerly the Tuberculosis Research Centre (TRC) showed that 4- or 5-month regimens containing ofloxacin (O), isoniazid (H), rifampicin (R) and pyrazinamide (Z) daily for 3 months followed by H and R twice weekly for one or two months were very effective, with 99% of patients becoming sputum culture negative at the end of treatment, and only 4% and 2% respectively suffering recurrence of TB over 24 months of follow-up <xref rid="pone.0067030-Tuberculosis1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. This study showed for the first time that the quinolones could be advantageously used in shortening TB treatment duration.</p><p>Since then, newer fluoroquinolones, in particular moxifloxacin (M) and gatifloxacin (G) with more potent bactericidal and sterilizing activities against <italic>mycobacteria</italic> have emerged <xref rid="pone.0067030-Sirgel1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0067030-Sulochana1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Both M and G have shown excellent activity <italic>in vitro</italic> and in animal models of TB, a favorable pharmacokinetic, and good safety profiles <xref rid="pone.0067030-Sulochana1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0067030-Lober1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, suggesting that they may prove useful in shortening the treatment duration for TB, when used along with other first-line anti-TB drugs. Since an O-containing 4-month regimen has been shown to be very effective <xref rid="pone.0067030-Tuberculosis1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, the substitution of either M or G for O could be expected to fare even better. However, the regimen containing O that proved successful had a daily intensive phase of 3 months. Previous clinical trials have shown that regimens given three times a week can be as effective as daily regimens in the treatment of TB <xref rid="pone.0067030-Fox1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067030-Hong1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067030-Hong2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> while being less toxic and less costly.</p><p>We therefore studied the efficacy and safety of 4-month G or M containing regimens given thrice-weekly in patients with newly diagnosed sputum-positive pulmonary TB.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Methodology</title><p>The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0067030.s002">Checklist S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0067030.s001">Protocol S1</xref>.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Study Participants</title><p>The study was an open label randomized controlled clinical trial conducted at Chennai and Madurai, South India, beginning in May 2004, after obtaining due regulatory approvals from the Scientific Advisory Committee and the Institutional Ethics Committee.

The following tests were also done: posterior-anterior chest radiograph; electrocardiograph (ECG), urine examination for albumin, glucose, bile salts, acetyl H, and R; total and differential leucocyte counts, haemoglobin estimation, total erythrocyte count, and platelet count; liver function (bilirubin, alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, alkaline phosphatase); renal function (blood urea and serum creatinine); serum uric acid; random blood glucose; and ELISA for HIV antibody. The ECG was interpreted by a cardiologist.</p><p>A physician examined the patient every month and recorded adherence to treatment, any adverse drug reactions and the clinical response. Sputum specimens were examined every month by microscopy and culture, three (two overnight and one spot) during the treatment phase and two (one overnight and one spot) during the follow-up phase. One positive sputum culture was tested each month for susceptibility to H, R, E and O. Sputum specimens were given identification laboratory numbers, and bacteriological investigations were carried out by technicians who were blinded to the clinical status of the patient and the regimen. ECG was done every month. At the end of intensive phase and end of treatment a chest radiograph and blood tests comprising of hemogram, liver, renal functions and random blood sugar were done. Patients who had clinical deterioration or had adverse reactions to anti-TB drugs were examined by a team of physicians and any decision to modify the regimen was made by consultation.

Allowing for 10% attrition in patients over a 24-month follow-up period and expected proportion of patients with drug resistant TB at intake to be 10%, the final sample size was calculated to be 400 patients for each regimen.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>The proportion of patients with various outcomes (sputum culture conversion at two months, response at the end of treatment, TB recurrence and drug adverse events) was calculated for the three regimens and the values for the test regimens were compared to that of the control regimen. The primary analyses of the outcomes of interest was both by intention-to-treat and per-protocol. Efficacy analysis was performed based on recurrences of TB in the post-treatment period of 24 months. P values less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The chi square test was used to compare proportions and survival analysis was done by the Kaplan-Meier method and the log-rank test was used to compare the survival distribution. Hazards ratio was calculated using Cox proportional hazards model. The statistical analyses were carried out using SPSS version 14.0.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><p>The study design envisaged enrolling 400 patients in each arm in a 1&#x02236;1:1 ratio. However, due the non-availability of one of the test drugs (M), patients were enrolled initially in a 1&#x02236;1 ratio in the G and control regimen arms commencing in May 2004. Subsequently, when M became available (May 2005) patients were enrolled to the G, M and control regimen arms in a 1&#x02236;2:1 ratio to compensate for the delay in recruiting to the moxifloxacin arm at the onset. Later, on review of interim data, the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) recommended termination of the G arm initially (February 2006), and later the M arm (October 2006) due to high TB recurrence rates in these two arms compared to the control regimen arm. Due to the premature termination of the study, the targeted population of 1200 patients could not be achieved.</p><p>A total of 429 patients were admitted to the study. Of these, 13 did not fulfil the eligibility criteria (4 had sputum cultures positive for <italic>mycobacteria</italic> other than <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>; 2 had no positive sputum cultures; 3 had received previous anti-TB treatment for more than one month; 4 had MDR-TB).

id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>The study was designed based on the encouraging results from an earlier study with a 4-month ofloxacin containing regimen with an initial daily intensive phase and the desire to develop a fully intermittent regimen of similar duration. Since previous experience with TB treatment trials had suggested that fully intermittent regimens may be as effective as daily regimens while at the same time being less toxic and less expensive, we were hopeful of a favourable outcome. Contrary to our expectations, while the results at the end of treatment were comparable, the TB recurrence rates in the gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin regimens were higher compared to the control regimen, necessitating the premature termination of the trial. However, this truncated trial still yielded important information that we considered worth communicating and that might guide future research in this area.</p><p>We found that the response at the end of treatment was uniformly high in all 3 regimens, with 95% and 98% of the patients treated with a thrice-weekly 4-month gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin regimens respectively becoming culture negative at the end of treatment, compared to 97% in the control regimen. This is in keeping with the previous experience at the NIRT when 99% of patients treated with the ofloxacin containing 4-month regimen, with a daily intensive phase were culture negative at the end of treatment <xref rid="pone.0067030-Tuberculosis1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Even among those with initial drug resistance, none of the 4 patients treated with the moxifloxacin regimen had an unfavourable outcome while one of 8 patients treated with the gatifloxacin regimen and 3 of the 26 patients treated with the control regimen had an unfavourable response. Only one of 21 patients with initial H resistance treated with the control regimen developed MDR TB.</p><p>The proportion of sputum culture conversion to negative at 2 months is an important parameter for assessing the efficacy of a TB drug regimen <xref rid="pone.0067030-Fox1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. In this study, 83% and 88% of patients treated with the gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin regimens respectively became sputum culture negative at 2 months compared to 78% of those treated with the control regimen. These culture conversion rates were significantly lower than the 92&#x02013;94% culture negativity that was observed in our previous ofloxacin study with daily dosing <xref rid="pone.0067030-Tuberculosis1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.</p><p>The most striking finding of this study was that the recurrence rate of TB during 24 months of post-treatment follow-up was higher in the gatifloxacin arm (16%) compared to the moxifloxacin (10%) and control regimen arms (6%). The recurrence rates in both the quinolone regimens was much higher than the 4% recurrence in our previous study in which OHRZ was given daily for 3 months followed by RH twice weekly. <xref rid="pone.0067030-Tuberculosis1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> Clearly, a thrice weekly 4-month regimen is inferior to a 4-month regimen with an initial daily phase in terms of recurrence of TB. However, even though the recurrence rate in the moxifloxacin arm (10%) was higher than that in the control regimen arm (6%), the difference was not statistically significant. It is pertinent to point out that 90% of patients treated with the 4-month thrice-weekly moxifloxacin regimen were recurrence free 24 months after treatment completion.</p><p>The majority of the TB recurrences (all in gatifloxacin arm and 9 of 11 in the moxifloxacin arm) occurred within 6 months of stopping treatment. This is in keeping with previous experience <xref rid="pone.0067030-Tuberculosis1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067030-Tuberculosis3" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. While this suggests that these recurrences were probably true relapses rather than re-infections, in the absence of genotying it is difficult to be sure. In contrast to this, two of the 10 recurrences in the control regimen arm, i.e. 20%, occurred beyond 12 months of follow-up compared to none in the gatifloxacin arm and 1 of 11 in the moxifloxacin arm. Again it is difficult to say whether these could represent re-infection rather than re-activation.</p><p>In analysing the possible reasons for the high TB recurrence rates in the two quinolone regimens, we need to consider the following issues: (a) dosage of the quinolone &#x02013; we used the standard recommended daily dosage of 400 mg for both gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin, even though both drugs were administered thrice weekly. It is possible that this dosage was insufficient in terms of pharmacokinetic effects when administered thrice weekly; (b) rhythm of drug administration - intermittent drug administration in TB is based on the phenomenon of lag phase or the post antibiotic effect (PAE) exhibited by the anti-TB drugs <xref rid="pone.0067030-Dickinson1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. An in-vitro study has shown that moxifloxacin has no PAE <xref rid="pone.0067030-Chan1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>; which could be the reason for its poor performance when given thrice- weekly throughout the treatment period. On the other hand, it has been shown in an animal study that moxifloxacin has excellent sterilizing activity when given once-weekly along with H and rifapentine <xref rid="pone.0067030-Lounis1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. This needs to be evaluated in human studies.</p><p>Both the quinolone regimens were well tolerated. While gastrointestinal symptoms and giddiness were significantly more common in those treated with the quinolone regimens, most of these were mild and were managed with symptomatic treatment Three of 136 patients treated with the gatifloxacin regimen developed seizures. Though 2 patients (one each in the gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin arms) had marginal prolongation of the QTc interval in the ECG neither had adverse consequences. Significantly none of the patients developed dysglycemia, which has been recognized as a known side effect of gatifloxacin <xref rid="pone.0067030-GreenbergALDecerbo1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, even though blood sugar levels were not closely monitored and was done only during routine monthly check-up.</p><p>This analysis of a truncated study has many limitations. Case recruitment could not proceed as planned due to operational reasons, and occurred in a staggered manner, initially to the gatifloxacin and control regimen arms, and later to the three arms of the study. The targeted sample size could not be completed due to the premature termination of the study on the recommendation of the DSMB. Even though the primary outcome of our study was defined as a combination of the results at the end of treatment and TB recurrence in those with a favourable treatment outcome, the DSMB recommendation to terminate patient recruitment, first to the gatifloxacin regimen and later to the moxifloxacin regimen was based only on the post-treatment TB recurrence rates. We did not do genotyping to distinguish between reactivation and re-infection. Even though these issues limit the robustness of the analysis, the data presented in this report still gives valuable information that can guide future research, especially in view of the current interest in the role of quinolones in shortening TB treatment duration. What appears to be clear is that while a 4-month regimen including a quinolone in addition to other bactericidal anti-TB drugs H, R and Z with at least initial daily phase of 3 months was very successful in the treatment of sputum positive patients with pulmonary TB <xref rid="pone.0067030-Tuberculosis1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, a regimen of similar duration but given 3 times a week throughout (in spite of having a quinolone throughout the 4 months) was clearly inferior. Perhaps the search for a shorter TB regimen using quinolones should necessarily include a daily phase at least initially. Currently at the NIRT a clinical trial is in progress to study the efficacy and safety of 3 and 4-month moxifloxacin-containing regimens with a daily intensive phase for the treatment of patients with sputum positive pulmonary TB (CTRI/2008/091/000024). Two multicentre global phase III studies with gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin containing regimens in patients with sputum positive pulmonary tuberculosis are also in progress <xref rid="pone.0067030-Controlled1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067030-A1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Results from these three clinical trials will ultimately determine whether a 4-month treatment regimen will be successful in treating patients with sputum positive pulmonary TB.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0067030.s001"><label>Protocol S1</label><caption><p>
