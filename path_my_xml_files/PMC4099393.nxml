Many of the fluids used for intravenous hydration contain supraphysiologic concentrations of chloride, which can induce hyperchloremia and metabolic acidosis, resulting in renal vasoconstriction and decreased renal function. In addition, patients receiving less fluid and less sodium show faster recovery of gastrointestinal (GI) function after colonic surgery.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and design</title><p>This is an investigator-initiated, single-center, randomized, controlled, parallel group trial with assessor-blinded outcome assessment, in the Department of Urology, University Hospital Bern, Switzerland. The study will involve 44 patients with bladder cancer scheduled for radical cystectomy and urinary diversion. The primary outcome is the duration between the end of surgery and the return of the GI function (first defecation). Secondary outcomes are fluid balance (body weight difference postoperatively versus preoperatively) and the incidence of kidney function disorders according to the Risk &#x02013; Injury &#x02013; Failure &#x02013; Loss - End Stage Renal Disease (RIFLE classification). An equal number of patients are allocated to receive Ringerfundin&#x000ae; solution or a glucose/potassium-based balanced crystalloid solution as baseline infusion during the entire time that intravenous administration of fluid is necessary during the perioperative period. The randomized crystalloid solution is infused at a rate of 1&#x000a0;ml/kg/h until the bladder has been removed, followed by 3&#x000a0;ml/kg/h until the end of surgery. Postoperative hydration is identical in both groups and consists of 1,500&#x000a0;ml of the randomized crystalloid solution per 24&#x000a0;hours. Postoperative patient care is identical in both groups; patients are allowed to drink clear fluids immediately after surgery, and liquid diet is started on postoperative day 1, as well as active mobilization and the use of chewing gum. Body weight is measured daily in the morning. Time of first flatus and first defecation are recorded.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This trial assesses the benefits and harms of two different balanced crystalloid solutions for perioperative fluid management in patients undergoing open radical cystectomy with urinary diversion, with regard to return of GI function and effects on postoperative renal function.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Current Controlled Trials <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.controlled-trials.com/ISRCTN32976792">ISRCTN32976792</ext-link> (registered on November 21 2013).</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Crystalloid solution</kwd><kwd>Return of the gastrointestinal function</kwd><kwd>Radical cystectomy</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>A recent randomized double-blind clinical trial has demonstrated that intraoperative restrictive hydration with a maleate Ringer&#x02019;s solution (Ringerfundin&#x000ae;) combined with a concomitant norepinephrine infusion reduces the incidence of postoperative complications and hospitalization time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Patients to whom restrictive hydration was administered were more inclined to have a postoperative zero fluid balance (i.e. weight difference on postoperative day (POD) 1 versus preoperatively was 0) compared with patients in the control group, who had a positive fluid balance of approximately 2&#x000a0;kg on POD 1. A positive postoperative fluid balance is known to be associated with increased postoperative complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. In addition, the intraoperative use of norepinephrine, by minimizing the risk of fluid overload, is associated with a lower incidence of acute kidney damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Although enough evidence exists to support the rational use of perioperative restrictive hydration, the choice of the optimal crystalloid solution to use remains unclear, and intravenous chloride administration is ubiquitous [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Many of the fluids used for intravenous hydration contain supraphysiological concentrations of chloride, which can induce hyperchloremia and metabolic acidosis, resulting in renal vasoconstriction and decreased renal function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The effect of chloride on the kidney is of concern because acute kidney injury has been associated with high mortality, and may require invasive renal replacement therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. After administration of NaCl 0.9%, glucose 5% and Ringer&#x02019;s lactate solutions in normal subjects, the physiological response is a slow excretion of sodium, which can be impaired by hyperchloremia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Because patients undergoing cystectomy are prone to have transient creatinine increase, electrolyte disturbance, and acidosis postoperatively, it would make sense to administer a more physiological intravenous solution to these patients perioperatively. In addition, it has been demonstrated that the influence of salt and water balance on gastrointestinal (GI) recovery after colonic surgery is clinically relevant: patients receiving less fluid and less sodium show faster recovery of GI function, resulting in a shorter hospitalization time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. This is of crucial importance in patients undergoing cystectomy because they are at risk for postoperative constipation or ileus.</p><p>The aim of this study is to evaluate, in a prospective, single-center, randomized, parallel-group, assessor-blinded study design, the physiology of electrolyte and water homeostasis in patients undergoing open radical cystectomy and urinary diversion, using two different fluid regimens. We hypothesize that an approach with a glucose/potassium-based and reduced chloride crystalloid solution will result in faster return of GI function, reduced hypernatremia and hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis, less frequent hyperosmolality, and a better maintained fluid balance compared with a regimen using a balanced Ringer&#x02019;s crystalloid solution.</p></sec><sec><title>Method and design</title><sec><title>Ethics approval</title><p>The study was approved by the local ethics committee (Kantonale Ethikkommission Bern KEKBE; chairperson: Professor Dr N Tueller; registration number 151/13) on October 22, 2013.

There will be no interim analysis.</p><p>Statistical analysis will be conducted on an intention-to-treat basis. Data distribution will be tested by Q-Q plots. Normally distributed data will be presented as mean and standard deviation (SD), skewed data as median and range, and dichotome data as number and percentage. Comparing related and unrelated continuous samples, the paired and unpaired <italic>t</italic>-tests, respectively, will be used for normally distributed data and the Wilcoxon signed rank test and Mann&#x02013;Whitney <italic>U</italic>-test, respectively for skewed data. Differences in proportions will be analyzed using the Fisher&#x02019;s exact test, and risk ratio with associated 95% confidence interval (CI). For the analysis of the primary endpoint, we will use the unpaired Student <italic>t</italic>-test with associated 95% CI. In addition, a multiple logistic regression analysis will be carried out, including the randomization groups and all clinically relevant variables (age, ASA scores, Charlson comorbidity score, Glasgow prognostic score, postoperative fluid balance). A two-sided <italic>P</italic> value of less than 0.05 will be considered significant.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample analysis</title><p>Based on retrospective data from our institution in the same surgical population (mean duration until first defecation 4.82&#x000a0;days, SD of 0.82&#x000a0;days), a power analysis was performed using duration of return of GI function as the primary variable. For a calculated sample size of 18 patients in each group (36 patients in total) the study is designed to have an 90% power (&#x003b2;&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.10) for the Wilcoxon/Mann&#x02013;Whitney test to detect a difference of 1&#x000a0;day between the groups (Ringerfundin&#x000ae; and G5-K solution) at a two-sided significance level of 5% (&#x003b1;&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.05) assuming an SD of 1&#x000a0;day (G Power Version 3.1.5., Kiel and Duesseldorf, Germany). This decrease of 1&#x000a0;day is considered clinically relevant. Assuming a drop out of 20%, 22 patients per group will be recruited.</p></sec><sec><title>Assessment of safety</title><p>The methods used to measure plasma and urine samples are those established at our hospital and used in everyday clinical practice. Both intravenous solutions will be provided by the pharmacy of the University Hospital Bern. Both solutions are routinely used at our institution (Department of Anesthesia and Department of Intensive Care Medicine).</p></sec><sec><title>Reporting of adverse events</title><p>Follow-up will be guaranteed because every patient included in the trial will receive daily visits from the urologist in charge and will have blood samples taken. In addition, all patients will be continuously monitored during POD 1 to 5, as they will be on the intermediate care unit.</p><p>The principal investigator (PYW) will monitor the patients for any adverse events (AEs), which are defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign (including abnormal laboratory results), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of the randomized infusions. This will be documented on the CRF and immediately communicated to the principal investigator.</p><p>Serious AEs (SAEs) are defined as any untoward medical occurrence at any dose that results in death, or is life-threatening (i.e. patient was at risk of death at the time of the event), requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, or results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity. All treatment related to SAEs will be recorded and reported to the local ethics committee. An investigation will be conducted, and a report on the findings generated before the study can be resumed, in accordance with the Good Clinical Practice Guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki.</p></sec><sec><title>Duration and timeline</title><p>The annual caseload of cystectomy is around 100 in our institution per year. We expect to recruit our participants within 18&#x000a0;months. The study protocol was designed and approval from the local ethics committee obtained in 2013, and participants will be recruited during 2014 and 2015.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The present study will improve knowledge on the use of perioperative crystalloid solutions in patients with bladder cancer undergoing radical cystectomy with urinary diversion. This information should produce a basis on which to develop strategies that aim to prevent perioperative morbidity such as delayed return of the GI function and postoperative renal dysfunction.</p><p>The primary outcome of this study is the return of GI function, which is a cornerstone of the postoperative management of patients after major abdominal surgery. Delayed return of GI function is one of the major reasons for prolonged hospitalization time. The potential implications of our results are important. Accelerating the return of GI function will inevitably shorten hospitalization time and thus reduce the cost of hospital expenditure.</p><p>We expect by using the G5-K solution, which does not contain chloride anions, to achieve not only a near-zero water balance, as we already demonstrated in a previous RCT, but also a near-zero salt balance after radical cystectomy with urinary diversion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. In contrast we expect the patients in the Ringerfundin&#x000ae; group to be at higher risk of having a positive fluid and salt balance. This non-accumulation of salts and water in the G5-K solution group is expected to result in an earlier return of the GI function. Lobo <italic>et al</italic>. already showed that a positive salt and water balance after colonic resection delayed the return of GI function and resulted in longer hospitalization time. In addition, perioperative chloride loading is known to impair urinary output, and to induce metabolic acidosis and even hyperkalemia in patients with preoperative renal dysfunction.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, this trial is an investigator-initiated, pragmatic, randomized clinical trial to test the hypothesis that administration of glucose-rich balanced crystalloid solution containing potassium can accelerate the return of GI function. In addition, this study will also determine the effect of this solution on renal function after radical cystectomy with urinary diversion.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial status</title><p>The trial is ongoing.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>ASA: American Society of Anesthesiologists; BNP: Brain natriuretic peptide; CI: confidence interval; CRF: case report form; GI: gastrointestinal; MAP: Mean arterial pressure; NGAL: Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin; PRBC: Packed red blood cells; POD: postoperative day; RCT: Randomized clinical trial; RIFLE: risk, injury, failure, loss, end-stage renal disease; SD: standard deviation.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that to have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>PYW/LML/BK drafted the manuscript together with FCB.
