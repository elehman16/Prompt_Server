effective in increasing joint ROM. The PNF stretching technique first induces an isometric
contraction in the muscles to be stretched, but no agreement concerning the optimal
contraction intensity has yet been reached. The purpose of the present study was to
examine the effect of contraction intensity on ROM while applying PNF stretching.
[Subjects and Methods] Sixty male subjects were randomly assigned to one of four groups
(three experimental groups and one control group). Each experimental group applied one of
three contraction intensities (100%, 60%, and 20%) defined by the MVIC ratio, and the
control group did not receive any intervention during the experiment. PNF stretching was
applied to left knee extensors to compare changes in the knee joint flexion angle.
[Results] The results showed that the changes in ROM were larger for the 60% and 100%
groups compared with the 20% group. The changes in ROM were lowest in the control group.
[Conclusion] The present results indicate that while applying the PNF stretching, it is
not necessary to apply the maximum intensity of muscle contraction. Moderate isometric
contraction intensities may be optimal for healthy young males, while a sufficient effect
can be obtained even with a low contraction intensity.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>PNF stretching</kwd><kwd>Isometric contraction</kwd><kwd>Range of motion</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Flexibility can be defined as the ability to maintain a suitable range of motion (ROM) of

Sherrington&#x02019;s muscle facilitation and inhibition concept<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Specifically, muscle contraction has been considered to result in
muscle relaxation and to then lead to increased ROM via decreased agonist resistance<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. More recent evidence, however,
demonstrates that simple reflex pathways are unable to explain the mechanism of increased
ROM observed with PNF stretching<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Practically, PNF stretching first induces

contraction while applying PNF stretching. Feland and Marin<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup> applied PNF stretching to hamstring muscles using 20%, 60%, and
100% of the maximum voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC). They compared a knee joint
extension angle among three groups, but no significant difference was found. Sheard and
Paine<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup> applied PNF stretching to the
extension muscle of the hip joints using 20%, 50%, and 100% of the MVIC, and found that
about 64.3% of the MVIC produced the greatest increment in the ROM changes.</p><p>Many studies have examined various intensities of isometric contraction applied in PNF
stretching, but no agreement concerning the optimal contraction intensity has been reached
yet. The purpose of the present study was to examine the effect of contraction intensity on
ROM while applying PNF stretching. Unlike the previous studies, the current study applied
PNF stretching to knee extensors. The knee extensors were used in this study because the
movement of the pelvis can be controlled easily in the prone position; and the activities of
the surrounding muscles can be excluded to a great extent. Two previous studies used the
hamstrings<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup> and hip extensors<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>, respectively. Since resistance was
applied from the back of the lower extremities of the subjects in those studies, it might
have been difficult to control the pelvis movement. As a result, contraction of many muscles
involved in pelvis movement might not have been avoidable, which might have created
difficulties in accurate application of the stretching to the preferred muscles.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The protocol and consent form for this study were approved by the Institutional Review
Board of the Catholic University of Daegu, Gyeongsan, Republic of Korea. All subjects signed
a written consent form prior to participation. All subjects voluntarily participated in the
study.</p><p>Male subjects with an age of approximately 25&#x02005;years were chosen. In a pilot study, most
females showed near-normal ROM for knee joint flexion and recovered normal ROM (larger than
135&#x000b0;) after the intervention regardless of the contraction intensities applied. Ten females
in their 20s voluntarily participated in the pilot study. Five of them who had over 115&#x000b0; ROM
for left knee joint flexion were excluded. PNF stretching was applied for the remaining five
females who had less than 115&#x000b0; ROM (2, 2, and 1 for 20%, 60%, and 100% of the MVIC,
respectively). After applying the technique, all of them acquired normal knee flexion ROM
(larger than 135&#x000b0;). This result showed a larger difference compared with that of male
participants, who showed less than 135&#x000b0; flexion after stretching. Therefore, they were
excluded from the present study. The following selection criteria were used to choose the
subjects: (1) no current disease (or pain) and no past history of surgery in the lumbar
region, hip joints, and knee joints and (2) normal passive ROM (135&#x000b0;) and less than 115&#x000b0;
active ROM for left knee joint flexion while assuming the posture devised for this
experiment (see the Methods section). We excluded those who exercised more than two times
per week because regular exercise activities might include stretching exercises<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup>; three male participants were excluded
based on this exclusion criterion.</p><p>Finally, the 60 selected subjects were randomly assigned to one of the four study groups.
There were three experimental groups and one control group. Each experimental group was
applied one of three contraction intensities (100%, 60%, and 20%) defined by the MVIC ratio,
and the control group did not receive any intervention during the experiment except ROM
measures.</p><p>In the experiment, the subjects lay down on a height-adjustable bed in the prone position.
PNF stretching was applied to the left leg of the subjects. To perform effective stretching
of the left knee joint, the right leg, to which stretching was not applied, was positioned
off the bed and extended to the floor. The hip joint of the right leg was placed in a
position of up to 135&#x000b0; flexion by adjusting the bed height while the foot sole was kept in
full contact with the floor to minimize slippage. In addition, the subjects were asked to
grasp the table edge firmly to maintain the stretching position. This posture prevented the
rectus femoris in the left knee extensors from intervening in the anterior tilting of the
pelvis by having the pelvis attached firmly in the direction of posterior tilting.</p><p>First, the MVIC of the subjects was measured. Flexion of the left knee joint was stopped if
the subject felt resistance to it. In this position, the subject was requested to extend the
knee joint as much as possible in a maximum contraction, and the contraction intensity was
measured using a dynamometer (Baseline<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Digital Push-Pull Dynamometer,
Fabrication Enterprises Inc., Elmsford, NY, USA). In order to prevent a difference in force
due to a change in the lever arm length, the dynamometer was always applied in the same
position at the anterior border of the tibia, which was 10&#x02005;cm away from the medial malleolus
in the proximal direction. The position was marked with a sticker so that force would always
be measured at the same position. The MVIC was measured three times for each subject, and
the mean value was set as the final MVIC value. Eight seconds of rest were given to the
subjects between measurements.</p><p>To minimize any carry-over effect, a PNF stretching experiment was conducted three days
after MVIC measurement. The subjects continued left knee joint flexion until they felt
resistance in the joint. The knee flexion angle (pre-stretching ROM) was measured at that
position using an inclinometer (Dualer IQ Inclinometer, JTECH Medical, Midvale, UT, USA)
placed right inferior to the tibial tuberosity. Immediately after measuring the knee flexion
angle, knee extension was requested for 8&#x02005;s with the preset contraction intensity according
to the contraction intensity group. When contraction was complete, 8&#x02005;s of rest was allowed,
and then the knee was flexed up to the position where resistance was felt. This process was
repeated two more times. After the last rest, the knee flexion angle (post-stretching ROM)
of the subjects was measured at the maximum flexion position. The knee flexion angle of the
control group was measured two times with an interval of 1&#x02005;min without any intervention.</p><p>PNF stretching for each subject was performed by a skilled physical therapist. ROM was
measured by an occupational therapist who had no information about this experiment. Subjects
were randomly assigned to the experiment, and the occupational therapist did not receive any
information about the group assignments of the subjects.</p><p>The dependent variable was &#x00394;ROM (change between post- and pre-stretching ROM), and the
independent variable was contraction group (100%, 60%, 20%, control). &#x00394;ROM data were
analyzed by one-way ANOVA in the contraction groups. Duncan&#x02019;s multiple range test was used
to analyze post hoc main effect. The statistical significance level was set at &#x003b1;=0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p><xref rid="tbl_002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title>Subject characteristics by contraction group</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="middle" align="center" rowspan="3" colspan="1">Gender </th><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">20%</th><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">60%</th><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">100%</th><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Control</th></tr><tr><th colspan="4" rowspan="1"><hr/></th></tr><tr><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Male (N=15)</th><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Male (N=15)</th><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Male (N=15)</th><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Male (N=15)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (years)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">25&#x000b1;2.0</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">24.9&#x000b1;2.1</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">24.8&#x000b1;1.9</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">24.7&#x000b1;2.0</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Height (cm)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">172.2&#x000b1;4.2</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">174.5&#x000b1;4.4</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">173.1&#x000b1;3.9</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">174.3&#x000b1;3.7</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Weight (kg)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">66.5&#x000b1;5.7</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">68.3&#x000b1;7.1</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">65.7&#x000b1;4.8</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">66.1&#x000b1;5.0</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Knee flexion degree before intervention (&#x000b0;)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">99.5&#x000b1;8.5</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">100.3&#x000b1;7.2</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">102.2&#x000b1;8.0</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">101.1&#x000b1;8.5</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x00394;ROM (&#x000b0;)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">21.4&#x000b1;2.9</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">25.0&#x000b1;4.8</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">23.8&#x000b1;5.7</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.7&#x000b1;1.4</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap> shows the gender, age, height, weight, and initial knee joint flexion angle of

contraction during PNF stretching. Using 20%, 60%, and 100% of the MVIC, PNF stretching was
applied to the left knee extensors of healthy young males to compare changes in the knee
joint flexion angle. The results showed the largest increase for two groups: 60% and 100% of
the MVIC. This result is similar to that of Sheard and Paine<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>. They proposed that the most efficient isometric contraction
intensity could be around 65% of the MVIC while applying the PNF stretching technique to
young athletes. Our study also revealed that the most effective contraction intensity to
increase ROM was at least 60%, suggesting that a moderate isometric contraction intensity
may be optimal for healthy young males.</p><p>However, our result differs somewhat from that of Feland and Marin<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>, who found no significant difference in isometric
contraction intensity for 20%, 60%, and 100% of the MVIC. This result suggests that a
minimal amount of isometric contraction, as low as 20% of the MVIC, is as effective as
moderate or maximal contraction intensities when applying the PNF stretching technique.
Unlike the result of Feland and Marin, our study found a significant difference between the
groups that applied 60% and 20% of the MVIC. In other words, our study suggests that a
moderate contraction intensity to some extent is better than a lower contraction intensity.
In the present study, nonetheless, a sufficient increase in ROM was obtained with the 20%
contraction intensity, that is, an increase of about 19&#x000b0; more than the control group.</p><p>The increase in ROM caused by PNF stretching can be explained by the activation of
inhibitory neurons in the spinal cord followed by stimulation of the Golgi tendon organ<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, most studies using EMG have not
found muscle relaxation after isometric contraction in PNF procedures<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref><sup>)</sup>. These results suggest that muscle relaxation is not
always followed by muscle contraction. Sheard and Paine<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup> suggested that isometric contraction larger than 70% of the MVIC
might lead to stimulation of the muscle spindle, which might result in inhibition of muscle
relaxation. This might support the current result in that the largest ROM increase was found
in the 60% MVIC group.</p><p>The results of our study and two previous studies indicate that while applying PNF
stretching, it is not necessary to apply the maximum intensity of muscle contraction. As
shown in our study results, a contraction intensity of around 60% might be optimal for
increasing the ROM maximally, while a sufficient effect can be obtained even with a low
contraction intensity (20%). This result has several important implications. First, the
maximum intensity of muscle contraction is not required of those who are performing PNF
stretching. In fact, those who utilize the maximum intensity of muscle contraction can be
vulnerable to fatigue more quickly, and the applied muscles may be easily exposed to the
risk of injury<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>. Second, a moderate
submaximal intensity may be more effective than too low a contraction intensity in order to
derive the maximal effect<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>. Hence, a
moderate contraction intensity, e.g., 60%, may be optimal for healthy normal persons and
athletes who need flexibility. Finally, our study result suggested that those who feel
difficulty in muscle contraction or muscle pain can sufficiently increase their ROM even
with a contraction intensity of 20%<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>.
The applicability of these findings to subjects with other characteristics will need to be
determined.</p><p>There are some limitations to this study. First, the definition of the end of ROM was
subjective and depended on the subjects&#x02019; feeling of limitation<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref><sup>)</sup>. Second, the present study examined the acute effect of
PNF stretching. Further study is needed to investigate the long-term effect with different
intensities of isometric contraction. Third, the present study focused on the knee joint.
Although most studies investigating PNF stretching have focused on lower extremities,
further studies are needed on other parts such as the upper extremities and trunk. Fourth,
the present study used healthy males in their 20s. As mentioned in the Methods section,
female subjects showed different results compared with male subjects in a pilot study. This
suggests that the present results might not be applicable to subjects with different
characteristics (e.g., gender, age) or special populations (e.g., patients, athletes).</p><p>There are a variety of factors influencing the use of PNF stretching in the field. Not only
isometric contraction intensity but also contraction time, relaxation time after
contraction, and the number of contractions can make a difference in terms of the effect. To
determine a more efficient stretching technique, the knowledge concerning these factors
should be supported by additional studies in the future.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><person-group><name><surname>Zachazewski</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group>: Improving flexibility.
