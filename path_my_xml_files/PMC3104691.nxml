Sublingual administration is essential because bioavailability if ingested is less than 2%. Efficacy is supported by acute and long-term randomized controlled studies conducted by the manufacturer, with asenapine 5 mg twice daily evidencing superiority over placebo in six-week studies of acute schizophrenia, and flexibly-dosed asenapine (modal dose 10 mg twice daily) superior to placebo in a 26-week maintenance of response study. Tolerability advantages over some second-generation antipsychotics, such as olanzapine, include a relatively favorable weight and metabolic profile, as demonstrated in a 52-week randomized, head-to-head, double-blind clinical trial. Although dose-related extrapyramidal symptoms and akathisia can be present, the frequency of these effects is lower than that for haloperidol and risperidone. Somnolence may also occur, and appears to be somewhat dose-dependent when examining rates of this among patients receiving asenapine for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Prolactin elevation can occur, but at a rate lower than that observed for haloperidol or risperidone. Unique to asenapine is the possibility of oral hypoesthesia, occurring in about 5% of participants in the clinical trials. Obstacles to the use of asenapine are the recommendations for twice-daily dosing and the need to avoid food or liquids for 10 minutes after administration, although the bioavailability is only minimally reduced if food or liquids are avoided for only two minutes.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>antipsychotic</kwd><kwd>asenapine</kwd><kwd>clinical trials</kwd><kwd>schizophrenia</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type=""><title>Introduction</title><p>Schizophrenia is a relatively common mental disorder that is usually chronic in nature. Interventions are ordinarily targeted to positive psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations or delusions, but negative, cognitive, and mood symptoms can also be disabling.

Patients were required to be hospitalized during the first two weeks of the study. The primary efficacy endpoint was change from baseline in the total score on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). There were two prespecified methodological approaches to assess efficacy, ie, analysis of covariance using last observation carried forward (LOCF) as the primary analysis and a mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) as the secondary analysis. Discontinuation rates were 37.6%, 33.3%, 42.0%, and 43.4% for asenapine 5 mg twice daily, asenapine 10 mg twice daily, haloperidol, and placebo groups, respectively. The discontinuation rates due to insufficient therapeutic response were 12.8%, 16.2%, 8.9%, and 25.4%, respectively, yielding a number needed to treat (number needed to treat [NNT] = 35, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ndt-7-325">Figure 1</xref>) versus placebo to avoid discontinuation because of an insufficient therapeutic response of 8, 11, and 7 for asenapine 5 mg twice daily, asenapine 10 mg twice daily, and haloperidol, respectively. On both LOCF and MMRM analyses of change in PANSS total score, asenapine 5 mg twice daily and haloperidol were both superior to placebo, with statistically significant differences seen from day 21 onwards. However, asenapine 10 mg twice daily showed no advantage over placebo at any time point on the LOCF analysis and an advantage only at day 42 on the MMRM analysis, an effect that the authors suggest may have been due in part to the high placebo response evident in this trial. The secondary outcomes roughly mirrored the primary outcome. On the PANSS positive subscale score, asenapine 5 mg twice daily and haloperidol were superior to placebo from day 21 onwards; asenapine 10 mg twice daily showed an advantage at day 42 and study endpoint. On the LOCF analysis of change in the PANSS negative subscale, none of the treatments was superior to placebo. However, using MMRM, asenapine 5 mg twice daily demonstrated an advantage at days 35 and 42. On both the LOCF and MMRM analyses of change in the PANSS general psychopathology subscale score, asenapine 5 mg twice daily was superior to placebo from day 21 onwards, in contrast with haloperidol, which showed an advantage at day 21 only, and with asenapine 10 mg twice daily, which showed no advantage at any time point. PANSS Marder factor scores were also determined, and on both the LOCF and MMRM analyses, all active treatment regimens were superior to placebo on the positive factor, but none showed an advantage on the negative factor. On both analyses of the hostility/excitement factor, only haloperidol was superior to placebo. Asenapine 5 mg twice daily was the only intervention that demonstrated superiority to placebo on the anxiety/depression factor (by MMRM) and the disorganized thought factor (by LOCF and MMRM). Categorical response, defined as a minimum decrease of 30% on the PANSS total score or a Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) score of 1 (ie, very much improved) or 2 (much improved), were for PANSS 55%, 49%, 43%, and 33%, for asenapine 5 mg twice daily, asenapine 10 mg twice daily, haloperidol, or placebo, respectively, yielding a NNT = 5, 7, and 10 versus placebo for asenapine 5 mg twice daily, asenapine 10 mg twice daily, and haloperidol, respectively. Similarly, CGI-I responders at endpoint were 48%, 44%, 44%, and 34%, for asenapine 5 mg twice daily, asenapine 10 mg twice daily, haloperidol or placebo, respectively, yielding a NNT = 8, 10, and 10 versus placebo for asenapine 5 mg twice daily, asenapine 10 mg twice daily, and haloperidol, respectively.

Discontinuation rates were 54.2%, 57.6%, and 66.1% for asenapine, risperidone, and placebo groups, respectively. The discontinuation rates due to lack of efficacy were 15.2%, 27.1%, and 29.0%, respectively, yielding a NNT = 8 versus placebo to avoid a discontinuation due to lack of efficacy for asenapine and 53 for risperidone. Compared with placebo, asenapine produced significantly greater decreases in PANSS total scores from week 2 onwards. Risperidone did not separate statistically from placebo. Compared with placebo, asenapine and risperidone were associated with significantly greater decreases in Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) scores from week 4 onwards. On the PANSS positive subscale, scores with asenapine demonstrated statistically greater improvement over placebo for asenapine from week 3 onwards, and with risperidone at weeks 1, 3, 5, and 6. On the PANSS negative and general psychopathology subscales at endpoint, asenapine demonstrated statistically superior improvement compared with placebo but risperidone did not. A post hoc MMRM analysis confirmed the overall efficacy of asenapine in the primary outcome measure. The authors speculated on the reasons why risperidone may not have performed as expected, including issues regarding dosing at 6 mg/day.

Mean weight gain was 0.9 kg with asenapine and 4.2 kg with olanzapine. The proportion of patients experiencing clinically relevant weight gain was approximately 35% for olanzapine and approximately 15% for asenapine (NNH = 5). No notable changes or between-group differences were seen in measures of total cholesterol or glucose, but triglyceride levels rose substantially with olanzapine and declined slightly with asenapine. Extrapyramidal symptoms reported as adverse events were more common with asenapine (18%) compared with olanzapine (8%, NNH = 10). The most commonly reported type of movement disorder in the asenapine and olanzapine groups was akathisia, with treatment-emergent rates of 10% for asenapine and 4% for olanzapine (NNH = 17). Extrapyramidal symptoms, most commonly akathisia, were the reported cause of premature discontinuation in 12 patients taking asenapine (1%) and three patients taking olanzapine (1%). Anticholinergic drug use among all treated patients at endpoint was 6% for asenapine and 2% for olanzapine (NNH = 25). On formal assessment of extrapyramidal symptoms, mean scores on rating scales decreased from baseline in both groups. Markedly abnormal increases (to levels greater than three times the upper limit of normal) in alanine transaminase were seen in 3% of the asenapine group and 11% of the olanzapine group (NNH = 13); for aspartate transaminase, the percentages were 1% and 3%, respectively (NNH = 50).

However, no relevant change from baseline was observed on either the mental or physical component of the 12-item Short Form scale, suggesting to the authors that patients&#x02019; overall health status was not notably affected by treatment with either asenapine or olanzapine. Moreover, there were no notable changes within groups or significant between-group differences in living situation, employment, or level of functioning. Among the outpatient subjects in the trial, hospitalization occurred in 6% of those on asenapine and 3% in those on olanzapine (NNH = 34). However, the total number of hospital days during the trial was marginally lower for asenapine than for olanzapine (mean 34.9 days and 36.3 days, respectively). In terms of preferences and ranking, at study end, 34% of asenapine-treated patients and 37% of investigators considered asenapine much better than previous antipsychotic medication; corresponding percentages for olanzapine were 40% and 48%, respectively. Quality of life scale changes was recorded in the extension to the Western hemisphere study comparing asenapine with olanzapine for patients with predominantly negative symptoms;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-ndt-7-325">9</xref> improvement was noted in both treatment arms, with no relevant between-group differences, as was also observed in the parent study.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-ndt-7-325">18</xref></p><p>The market uptake of asenapine was reported in a brief paper.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40-ndt-7-325">40</xref> Postlaunch retail prescription trends of asenapine were assessed. In the 12 months since launch, asenapine gained a 0.22% share of the second-generation antipsychotic market. The share of new patient prescriptions was 0.44%; this is double the total market share and may be a predictor of future growth. About 77% of total prescriptions of asenapine were generated by psychiatrists; this is higher than that for other second-generation antipsychotics. From the data reported in the study, it is unknown what proportion of asenapine prescriptions were for patients with schizophrenia versus those with bipolar disorder.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Selecting the &#x0201c;right&#x0201d; antipsychotic for the &#x0201c;right&#x0201d; patient is complex, and can involve trial and error. Factors in treatment selection include prior history of therapeutic response, prior history of tolerability with other agents, and individual patient values and preferences regarding both the symptoms to be targeted and the side effects to be avoided. Adherence can be the biggest obstacle to success; lack of consistent adherence is not uncommon in patients with schizophrenia, who may not perceive themselves as being ill or otherwise see no value in the medications being offered. Nonetheless, given the considerable heterogeneity in antipsychotic efficacy and tolerability among the available choices, as well as large individual variation in treatment response, having different options in order to optimize efficacy and tolerability for the individual patient is definitely desirable.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-ndt-7-325">1</xref></p><p>Asenapine&#x02019;s efficacy in the treatment of schizophrenia is evidenced in both short-term acute clinical trials and in longer-term studies. Although a dose of 5 mg twice daily was found to be efficacious in the acute trials, the 26-week maintenance trial was flexibly dosed, and the modal dose of asenapine was 10 mg twice daily both in the open-label stabilization phase and in the randomized phase. In the head-to-head 52-week study comparing asenapine with olanzapine, changes from baseline in PANSS total score with asenapine and olanzapine were similar at week 6, but showed a statistically significant difference in favor of olanzapine at endpoint (by LOCF). For observed cases (ie, patients who completed the entire study) changes in PANSS total score with asenapine and olanzapine were similar at week 6 and also at week 52.</p><p>In the mind of the clinician, comparisons of asenapine will likely be made against other &#x0201c;metabolically-friendly&#x0201d; second-generation antipsychotics, such as ziprasidone, aripiprazole, iloperidone, and lurasidone.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41-ndt-7-325">41</xref> Tradeoffs among the choices include issues such as once-daily versus twice-daily dosing, the need for dose titration, special requirements for administration with or without food, as well as specific side effect profiles (see also Table 4 in a paper by the author<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41-ndt-7-325">41</xref> and Table 4 in another paper by the author<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42-ndt-7-325">42</xref>). Relative efficacy rankings among these five agents (asenapine, ziprasidone, aripiprazole, iloperidone, and lurasidone) are not known, and will require specifically designed and adequately powered head-to-head studies. Head-to-head comparisons with the older second-generation antipsychotics, such as quetiapine and risperidone, would also be of interest, as well as an expansion of work already being done comparing asenapine with olanzapine. In the meantime, meta-analyses can be performed that can indirectly estimate potential differences,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-ndt-7-325">17</xref> as has been done with the older second-generation antipsychotics.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43-ndt-7-325">43</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45-ndt-7-325">45</xref></p><p>Available so far are the results of carefully conducted controlled trials that enrolled patients who fulfilled strict inclusion and exclusion criteria. All studies have been conducted by its manufacturer. The different studies for asenapine that examined acute use, maintenance use, and negative symptoms targeted somewhat different populations. These research subjects can be dissimilar to patients commonly treated in a routine clinical environment, particularly in terms of severity of illness, physical and psychiatric comorbidities (such as substance use), concomitant use of other antipsychotic medications, or dangerous behaviors. Known nonresponders to antipsychotics and patients recently treated with clozapine are commonly also excluded from participation in registration trials. There is a clear need for pragmatic clinical trials with more liberal enrollment criteria (permitting greater generalizability) that can help place antipsychotics such as asenapine into clinical perspective. Also desirable would be specific studies to ascertain the efficacy and tolerability profiles of asenapine in patients during their first episode of schizophrenia.</p><p>Asenapine remains unique as being the only antipsychotic that is absorbed in the oral mucosa. This renders impossible the surreptitious &#x0201c;cheeking&#x0201d; that can occur among patients who have an ambivalent attitude about adherence. Although asenapine is reasonably well tolerated, the possibility of oral hypoesthesia may be a new event for the patient, necessitating advance warning that this can occur. In the clinical trial program itself, oral hypoesthesia rarely led to discontinuation from the clinical trial (observed in 7/2251 or 0.3% for asenapine versus 0% for all other groups).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-ndt-7-325">26</xref> Dysgeusia (distorted or bad taste), has largely been alleviated with a black cherry-flavored formulation of asenapine.</p><p>In summary, the place of asenapine in the treatment of schizophrenia is likely to be for patients in whom metabolic concerns are important, and for patients who would prefer a sublingual preparation. Specific obstacles to the first-line use of asenapine are the recommendations for twice-daily versus once-daily administration and the recommendation to avoid food or liquids for 10 minutes after dosing. Cost may be a further impediment, given the availability of inexpensive generic versions of risperidone in the US, as well as other generic second-generation antipsychotics in other countries.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclosure</bold></p><p>LC is a consultant for, has received honoraria from, or has conducted clinical research supported by the following companies: Abbott Laboratories, AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals, Avanir Pharmaceuticals, Azur Pharma Inc, Barr Laboratories, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Eli Lilly and Company, Forest Research Institute, GlaxoSmithKline, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Jazz Pharmaceuticals, Merck, Novartis, Noven Pharmaceuticals, Pfizer Inc, Shire, Sunovion, Valeant Pharmaceuticals, and Vanda Pharmaceuticals.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="b1-ndt-7-325"><label>1.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Volavka</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Citrome</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Oral antipsychotics for the treatment of schizophrenia: Heterogeneity in efficacy and tolerability should drive decision-making</article-title><source>Expert Opin Pharmacother</source><year>2009</year><volume>10</volume><issue>12</issue><fpage>1917</fpage><lpage>1928</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">19558339</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="b2-ndt-7-325"><label>2.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="webpage">Saphris (asenapine) sublingual tablets.
