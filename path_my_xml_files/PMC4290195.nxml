The human lens in healthy people is light brown in middle age.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Although not wholly demonstrated, it is believed that short wavelengths may contribute to retina damage in middle-aged to elderly patients due to the characteristics the retina acquires with age.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Until a few years ago, this effect was not taken into account when choosing an intraocular lens (IOL) for a patient having cataract surgery. The patient had a totally transparent IOL implanted, with a filter for only ultraviolet wavelengths between 200 nm and 400 nm. This type of IOL endeavored to simulate the crystalline lens of a young patient, which was considered better than that of an older patient. Nevertheless, currently, in view of the above-mentioned evidence (although it has not been wholly demonstrated) IOL with various filters that endeavor to block the passage of blue light, simulating the crystalline lens of a middle-aged to elderly subject have been introduced on the market.</p><p>At present, there are several options of IOL with filters available. They all attempt to block the passage of blue light to the retina, establishing the cut-off at different wavelengths to provide good photoprotection. Thus, there are violet filter lenses that block the visible spectrum of the wavelengths from 400 nm to 440 nm, and blue filter lenses that block the spectrum between 440 nm and 500 nm.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] The cut-off value considered the best for retinal photoprotection is established at around 445 nm.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] But, in general, shortwave filter IOL have a very different spectral density from that of the natural lens, which usually makes filtering blue light exert a partial photoprotection of the retina. Furthermore, any spectral filter that reduces blue-green phototoxicity causes an equivalent percentage decrease in scotopic sensitivity.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Indeed, there are no IOL on the market that offer a good compensation between retinal protection and reduction in the blue light that reaches the ocular fundus (photoreception).[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>Despite clinical evidence showing that a complete protection of the retina against light damage does not occur with this type of IOL, they are still used. This is because the inclusion of this filter in IOL implanted in patients does not seem to affect their everyday life.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>Clinical studies on IOL with filters of a yellowish shade show that, there are no significant differences in visual acuity and contrast sensitivity (CS) under different illumination conditions for patients with IOL with such filters and for patients without them.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Until date, most clinical studies performed on a change in chromatic vision with the insertion of a filter show small alterations in the area of the short wavelengths that the filter cuts off, but in no case do these changes appear to be significant when compared with a normal population group.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>Some IOL with different wavelength cut-off filters were designed, like the lenses with an orangey shade (Ophtec PC 440Y orange) and a yellowish shade (Alcon natural SN60AT), with a view to making IOL more similar to the physiological conditions of a normal lens.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] There is a recent study that compare color differences and contrast sensitivity function (CSF) in photopic and mesopic illumination conditions between orange and yellow IOL, and it conclude that there are not significative differences in the results that they obtain with both lenses.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p><p>Here we determine and compare the optical quality of both lenses, and we measure the modulation transfer function (MTF) and spectral transmission. We also analyze the influence of these factors on the visual quality of patients implanted with orange and natural yellow lenses in order to evaluate the possible advantages and disadvantages of these types of filters.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Optical properties</title><p>We evaluated spherical lenses. We do not use two aspherical lenses to avoid the way, in which each manufacturer compensates the asphericity of the eye, because this fact could influence on the results obtained.</p><p>The main difference between these lenses is that the natural SN60AT lens has an IMPRUV<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> filter, which gives it a yellow tint that filters the light spectrum up to approximately 400 nm, while the orange PC440Y lens filters up to 440 nm. We also determined its spectral transmission curves using a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 800 UV/VIS spectrometer, which provides a spectrum from 200 nm onward.</p><p>Similarly, and so any appreciable difference due to the optical quality of the lenses could be ruled out, the MTF of both lenses was determined.

In accordance with the studies that state that blue light affects the retina[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] this is an advantage, although it also means that it removes part of the visible light that reaches the retina, which is necessary for vision.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Nevertheless, if we take note of the height of the curves, when they reach their asymptotic value, we can see that the orange lens reaches 98% of transmission while the yellow lens only reaches 90%. However, this value is reached by the orange lens at 610 nm onward, that is, within the red area of the spectrum, while in the case of the yellow lens it is 550 nm onward, precisely at the maximum of the vision curve (V<sub>&#x003bb;</sub>), that is, where the visual system is most sensitive and most output is obtained from the light that reaches the retina. Regarding the cut-off point, the orange lens starts to transmit (1% approximately) from the wavelength at 370 nm, becoming appreciable (10%) at 420 nm and reaching 50% of transmission at 470 nm approximately. On the other hand, the yellow lens wholly filters all the wavelengths up to 390 nm, after which it starts to transmit, reaching 50% of transmission at 440 nm approximately. Therefore, it is clear from these data that each lens has its own advantages and disadvantages.</p><p>Regards to MTF curves, we observed that the optical quality is very good for both lenses, as it usually is for monofocal lenses.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] If we analyze the AM of both lenses, as Felipe <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] said in their article, only a difference of 25% in AM could provoke important differences in BCVA, so, in this case, the MTF of yellow IOL will not provoke better BCVA than orange IOL (there is only a difference of 0.59% between the two values), although we can observe that MTF at high frequencies in yellow filter is better than the orange filter. This effect is in concordance with BCVA obtained for both lenses.</p><p>With these results, in mesopic vision, we would expect obtain a visual quality better in yellow lens than in orange lens, due Purkinje effect by its high range of transmission and a slightly better modulation at high frequencies. Although the mesopic values of CSF for all frequencies in yellow lens are higher than in orange lens, these differences are not significatives and hence we can affirm that objective quality properties of these lenses does not affect subjective visual quality of the patients.</p><p>Contrast sensitivity under mesopic conditions is statistically lower than under photopic conditions for all the spatial frequencies studied, for the yellow lens and for medium-high frequencies (6, 12 and 18 cpd) for the orange lens. For the 3 cpd frequency, we did not expect to find significant changes on CS, when we changed lighting conditions because Weber's law[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] was played out, which highlights that for low spatial frequencies, illumination conditions hardly affect CS, but for yellow filter, we also found changes.</p><p>The differences between the two illumination conditions are not the same, depending on the spatial frequency measured, and they increase as it goes up, although not lineally. The greatest difference was observed for 12 cpd spatial frequency for orange filter, and the lowest for 3 cpd for both lenses, in concordance with Webber's law. Between both lenses, we observe the greatest changes in orange lens, because it removes more of the visible light that reaches the retina that is necessary for vision than yellow filter. When we compare both lenses, again these differences are not statistically significant. Hence, color lens differences do not provoke changes in CS, despite illumination conditions.</p><p>To complete the study, it will be interesting to compare our results with a IOL without color filter. Although we can find in the literature studies that affirm that there are no differences between lens with and without filter in BCVA and CS,[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] it will be interesting to check if differences between photopic and mesopic lightning conditions are similar or if these differences are greater in filter IOLs than in no filter IOLs, due to its transmission values.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Both lenses more or less imitate the spectral transmission conditions of a lens of the age range studied,[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] as we can see in the spectral transmission curves. Nonetheless, the orange lens filters more of the blue band than the yellow filter lens. However, the yellow filter lens reaches that asymptomatic value at 550 nm, practically at the maximum spectral sensitivity of the human visual system.</p><p>Nevertheless, this different filter does not involve a substantial difference between the visual results obtained with each lens. With regard to the CS, both lenses note the change of illumination conditions due its transmission. Finally, we can state that both lenses with their different filters provide a similar visual quality.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold>
