At present, an estimated 12% of the total health expenditure worldwide is directed towards this largely preventable disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Treatment of individuals with type 2 diabetes aims to achieve a normal lifespan and a quality of life (QOL) similar to that of persons without diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Long-term glycemic control is critical to prevent or delay the onset of macrovascular and microvascular complications and their associated consequences for patients&#x02019; health and health-related QOL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">Medication adherence is an integral component of type 2 diabetes management; however, treatment discontinuation during the early stages of the disease is not uncommon because patients are unaware of (or choose to ignore) their condition due to limited subjective symptoms or a low incidence of complications. Auto-recording systems for drug administration suggest that compliance difficulties increase with dosing frequency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In this context, minimizing dosing frequency may increase treatment satisfaction and eliminate a major barrier to treatment continuation.</p><p id="Par7">Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors are a newer class of oral antidiabetic agent with longer-lasting glycemic control compared with conventional therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. These agents are increasingly being positioned higher in treatment algorithms for type 2 diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Several daily dosing DPP-4 inhibitors are available in Japan for administration once or twice daily [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The first weekly dosing DPP-4 inhibitor, trelagliptin, was launched in Japan in 2015. Owing to its convenient once-weekly dosing schedule, trelagliptin has the potential to improve medication adherence, especially in patients newly starting oral glucose-lowering monotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">The availability of an antidiabetic medication with a reduced treatment burden may be conducive to patients continuing with treatment. Accordingly, this study has been proposed to assess treatment burden during treatment with weekly trelagliptin or a daily DPP-4 inhibitor in patients with type 2 diabetes beginning oral antidiabetic therapy.</p><p id="Par9">The objective of the study is to evaluate the reduction in treatment burden during administration for 12&#x000a0;weeks of once-weekly trelagliptin compared with a daily DPP-4 inhibitor in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes newly starting oral glucose-lowering monotherapy, by measuring their treatment-related QOL.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study Design</title><p id="Par10">This is a multicenter, randomized, open-label, parallel-group, comparative study to be conducted at approximately 15 study sites across Japan.

Subjects will be instructed to bring any leftover medication and empty sheets at each visit to allow adherence and usage to be checked along with the Diabetes Treatment Medication Record Card.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Statistical Methods</title><p id="Par65">Two analysis sets have been defined for the study. The full analysis set (FAS) includes all randomized subjects who receive at least one dose of trelagliptin or a daily DPP-4 inhibitor. The safety population includes subjects who receive at least one dose of trelagliptin or a daily DPP-4 inhibitor.</p><p id="Par66">Efficacy endpoints will be analyzed in the FAS. For the primary endpoint, comparison between treatment groups is to be conducted using the analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model, including: change in total score for all items of the DTR-QOL questionnaire from treatment start to treatment end (week 0 to week 12) as a dependent variable; total score of the DTR-QOL questionnaire (&#x0003c;&#x000a0;80 or&#x000a0;&#x02265;&#x000a0;80) and HbA1c (&#x0003c;&#x000a0;8.0% or&#x000a0;&#x02265;&#x000a0;8.0%) at the start of the screening period as covariates; treatment group as an independent variable. The level of significance is 5% (two-sided).</p><p id="Par67">For the secondary endpoints of change in total score for each factor of the DTR-QOL questionnaire at each assessment time point, change in total score for all questions of the DTR-QOL questionnaire at each assessment time point, and change in total score for all (treatment satisfaction) questions of the DTSQ at each assessment time point, summary statistics [number of patients, mean, standard deviation (SD), maximum, minimum, and quantile] and two-sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for means per treatment group will be calculated to plot changes in means and SDs. Point estimates and two-sided 95% CIs for differences between treatment groups will also be calculated. This same analysis will be performed for the change in mean from baseline (week 0) of each secondary efficacy variable.</p><p id="Par68">The ANCOVA model described above for the primary endpoint will also be used to analyze total scores for each factor of the DTR-QOL questionnaire and the DTSQ.</p><p id="Par69">With regard to other endpoints, summary statistics for measurements or changes from baseline (week 0) in laboratory tests will be calculated per treatment group. The treatment adherence of each study subject will be calculated and summary statistics per treatment group will be analyzed. Frequency of answers to each question of Your Basic Profile at each visit will be calculated and summary statistics per treatment group will be analyzed.</p><p id="Par70">Safety endpoints will be analyzed in the safety population using frequency tables for incidences of adverse events, hypoglycemia, and hospitalizations for worsening type 2 diabetes per treatment group.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Rationale for Planned Sample Size</title><p id="Par71">With respect to the primary endpoint&#x02014;the change in total score from baseline to end of treatment for all questions of the DTR-QOL questionnaire, mean changes in the trelagliptin and daily DPP-4 inhibitor groups were assumed to be 19.0% and 14.4%, respectively. The mean change in the trelagliptin group was assumed by reference to data from the validation trial of the DTR-QOL questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], and the mean change in the daily DPP-4 inhibitor group was assumed by reference to data from previously conducted research on sodium glucose transporter 2 inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The common SD was assumed to be 12.1% by reference to the latter data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Using a 5% significance level (two-sided) for analysis of the primary endpoint, at least 110 subjects per group would be required to ensure 80% power for comparisons between the trelagliptin and daily DPP-4 inhibitor groups. Assuming a type 2 diabetes treatment discontinuation rate of 8% [based on results for Topic 2 of the <italic>Strategic Studies on the Prevention of Diabetes</italic> (JDOIT-2)] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], the number of randomized subjects was established as 120 subjects per group, or 240 subjects in total.</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Enhanced content</bold></p><p>To view enhanced content for this article go to <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.medengine.com/Redeem/83CCF060114FA8D1">http://www.medengine.com/Redeem/83CCF060114FA8D1</ext-link>.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Funding for this research and article processing charges were provided by Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (Tokyo, Japan).
