The accuracy of diagnosis and monitoring of infertility treatments such as ovulation induction has greatly increased because of the availability of sophisticated ultrasound technology and equipment.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT1">1</xref>] Since the advent of the transvaginal ultrasound, this has been a preferred method for the assessment of the follicle and the endometrium. The assessment of follicular maturity at the time of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is one of the key factors for the success of all assisted reproductive technique procedures.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Basis of the study</title><p>The follicular size of 16-18 mm is considered as appropriate on two-dimensional (2D) ultrasound (US) for hCG administration for ovulation trigger. But, maturation of the follicle and the endometrium, ovulation and leutinization are processes of multiple biochemical, morphological and vascular changes. The vascular changes are a reflection of the biochemical changes and can be studied by color Doppler. The spectral/pulse Doppler values give an objective assessment of the follicular vascularity. Therefore, color and pulse Doppler speak about the functional maturity of the follicle and therefore the quality of the ovum. Three-dimensional (3D) US and 3D power Doppler (3D PD) assesses the global vascularity as compared to vascularity in a single plane on 2D ultrasound and so may give a better idea about follicular maturity, time of hCG and, therefore, pregnancy rates.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>A prospective randomized study of 1000 cycles of intrauterine insemination (IUI) was performed over a period of 10 months. The various stimulation protocols for ovulation induction used were clomiphene citrate, letrozole + recombinant follicle stimulating hormone (rFSH) and only rFSH. Follicular assessment was done on Voluson E8 (Wipro GE) and all studies were performed by a single operator. A transvaginal multifrequency volume probe 6-12 MHz was used for scanning. Speckle reduction imaging (SRI) was used when required for better resolution. On 2D US, the follicular diameter was measured as a single diameter vertically on the screen when the follicle is rounded. When the follicle was polygonal due to pressure effect from adjacent follicles, the follicle was imaged in two perpendicular planes and three diameters were taken at perpendicular planes of this follicle to take an average to decide the follicular diameter. A follicle was called mature when it was round, thin walled, with no internal echoes, measuring at least 16 mm for gonadotropin stimulation and at least 18 mm for clomiphene citrate stimulation. In these follicles, cumulus- like shadows were searched for. Color Doppler assessment was performed for all these follicles to see how much of the circumference of the follicle is covered by the blood vessels. If the blood vessels were scanty on color Doppler, PD was tried to see the vascularity better. For both color and PD, the pulse repetition frequency (PRF) was set at 0.3 kHz, wall filter at the lowest, balance at 180 and gains just enough to fill up perifollicular vessels but not to spill the color outside the blood vessels. For pulse Doppler, the PRF was set to 2.2 kHz and wall filter to 60 Hz. Angle correction was performed. The vessels that overlap and obliterate the visibility of the follicular wall only were considered perifollicular vessels. After this assessment, a 3D US and 3D PD was carried out for all the patients. PRF settings are fixed at 0.3 always and the volume box is switched on. The size of the volume box was adjusted enough to include the whole follicle and at least a surrounding 5-7 mm margin. The angle of the volume was selected to be large enough to cover the whole follicle from edge to edge. The acquired volume is seen as a follicle in three perpendicular planes on the screen. Using the Vocal Software with 15&#x000b0; angle, the follicle is traced at its circumference at every 15&#x000b0; rotation and at the end the command &#x02018;done&#x02019; is given, the region of interest (ROI) is ultimately accepted or any corrections required may be made and the computer then calculates the volume of the follicle [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref>].</p><fig id="F0001" position="float"><label>Figures 1 and 2</label><caption><p>Follicular volume by the Vocal software and cumulus oophorus in the pre-ovulatory follicle</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JHRS-02-62-g001"/></fig><p>After the volume calculation, the follicle was seen on the rendered image. Using the surface smooth or light gradient mode for rendering with high threshold can show cumulus [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 2</xref>]. Then, ROI is again edited to select the option for the shell volume. An option for the outside shell with a wall thickness of 2 mm is selected, which has been found to be the most appropriate to include the perifollicular vessels. This is accepted and a volume histogram is switched on. This gives the vascularity index (VI), which calculates the abundance of flow in the selected volume, flow index (FI), which calculates the average intensity of flow in the selected volume and vascular flow index (VFI), which calculates the perfusion of the selected volume. VI indicates the abundance of the color vessels in the given volume, FI indicates the intensity of the color in the given volume and VFI is the ratio of the abundance and intensity, meaning it gives an idea about the general perfusion status of the given volume [Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">4</xref>].</p><fig id="F0002" position="float"><label>Figures 3 and 4</label><caption><p>Pre hCG perifollicular 3DPD values</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JHRS-02-62-g002"/></fig></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>When a follicle of 16-18 mm was seen on color Doppler, it was considered to be mature enough for hCG injection.

This corresponds to the follicular volumes of between 3 and 7 ml. The accuracy of 3D US measurement of follicular volume compared with the standard 2D techniques by comparing the volume of individual follicles is estimated by both methods with the corresponding follicular aspirates: Using the formula of ellipse, the limits of agreement between aspirates and calculated volume were + 3.47 to &#x02212;2.42 as compared with + 0.96 to &#x02212;0.43 when calculated by 3D US using[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT4">4</xref>] the Vocal software. The conception rate for the cumulus seen group was 32.3% as compared with 9.76% only in the cumulus not seen group. Feichtinger <italic>et al</italic>., in their study, have shown the presence of cumulus in follicles &#x0003e;15 mm by 3D US.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT5">5</xref>] Follicles without visualization of cumulus in all three planes are not likely to contain mature oocytes. Poehl <italic>et al</italic>. also showed in their study that appearance of the intrafollicular cumulus structures by 3D US was correlated with the recovery rate of mature oocytes.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT6">6</xref>] They also found a significant correlation between the number of detected cumuli and the number of retrieved oocytes (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001), mature oocytes (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001) and number of fertilized oocytes (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001). Therefore, visualization of the cumulus by 3D US is a positive indicator of mature oocytes in both IUI and IVF procedures and has been found to be an indicator of successful fertilization in IVF cycles. The follicular fluid concentrations of leptine, a follicular angiogenesis-related factor are inversely related to the stromal blood FI.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT7">7</xref>] It has also been suggested that the follicles containing oocytes capable of producing pregnancy have a perifollicular vascular network that is more[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT8">8</xref>] uniform and distinctive.</p><p>Even when the follicle appeared mature according to the 2D US and color and pulse Doppler parameters, the pregnancy rates were significantly better only when the follicular volume was between 3 and 7 cc, cumulus was present and the perifollicular VI was between six and 20 and FI &#x0003e; 27. A study by Kupesic and Kurjak shows that when the ratio of follicular volume to blood FI (FV/FI) is between 0.4 and 0.6, the pregnancy rates are 39%, if &#x0003e; 0.6 it is 52% and when &#x0003c; 0.4 it is only 21%.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT9">9</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>3D US is much more accurate for volume assessment of the follicle, which is a much more reliable parameter than follicular diameter. The presence of cumulus, which can be confirmed by 3D US, increases the surety of the presence of a mature ovum in the follicle. The 3D PD gives an idea about the global vascularity of the follicle and the endometrium. Recently, 3D volume assessment and 3D PD indices VI, FI and VFI have also been tried in infertility management for assessment of polycystic ovary patients by Pascual <italic>et al</italic>. and have found a strong correlation between 2D and 3D volume as well as 3D PDA indices.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT10">10</xref>] Although still larger studies are needed to establish more precise values for follicular VI and FI, the results are fairly promising. Although it is possible to assess the follicular flow as expressed by the PSV and perifollicular color map,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT11">11</xref>] it is the 3D PD that proves the most precise
