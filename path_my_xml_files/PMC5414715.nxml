Currently, HA fillers are used for different purposes and are available with varying gel characteristics such as firmness and particle size. Emervel (Galderma SA, Lausanne, Switzerland) HA gel dermal fillers (from now on referred to as HA<sub>E</sub>) have been developed for use in facial tissue augmentation.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> The products in the HA<sub>E</sub> range are all manufactured using the optimal balance technology and have a HA concentration of 20 mg/mL. However, to allow for adaptation to different injection depths, treatment sites, and tissue quality, the products differ in the degree of cross-linking and calibrated gel particle size. Effectiveness and safety data for the HA<sub>E</sub> products are available for several facial indications.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Emervel Deep (HA<sub>ED</sub>), which was used in the present study, is intended for injection into the deep dermis to correct moderate to deep facial wrinkles, such as nasolabial folds (NLFs).<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup></p><p>Interim results (6-month data) from this randomized, controlled, split-face study with HA<sub>ED</sub> and Restylane Perlane (HA<sub>PER</sub>; Q-Med AB, Uppsala, Sweden) for the treatment of severe NLFs have been published previously.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Here, the final effectiveness and safety outcomes up to 12 months after the baseline treatment were reported, thereby extending the published literature on product duration and safety for HA<sub>ED</sub> in comparison with a well-established HA filler (HA<sub>PER</sub>) that has a similar intended use. This is also the first long-term study of HA<sub>ED</sub>, and the first long-term comparison of these two products for the treatment of severe NLFs.</p><sec id="s1"><title>Subjects and Methods</title><sec id="s1-1"><title>Study Design</title><p>This was a randomized, controlled, subject-blinded and evaluator-blinded, split-face, multicenter study. To compare the effectiveness and safety of HA<sub>ED</sub> with HA<sub>PER</sub> for the treatment of severe NLFs, subjects were followed up for 12 months after the treatment. Randomization of treatment to each side of the face was done centrally (one list per study center). Allocation concealment was achieved using randomization envelopes. The study protocol conformed to the ethical guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by independent ethics committees. The study included an open-label part where the first three subjects per center received HA<sub>ED</sub> in both NLFs. The rationale for this was to give the investigators an opportunity to familiarize themselves with the injection technique because HA<sub>ED</sub> had recently been developed at the time of the study. However, only outcomes from the blinded split-face comparison of HA<sub>ED</sub> and HA<sub>PER</sub> are presented here.</p></sec><sec id="s1-2"><title>Subject Selection</title><p>Adult subjects (&#x02265;18 years) who provided signed informed consent and had severe NLFs on both sides of the face (i.e., Score 4, rated using the 5-point wrinkle severity rating scale [WSRS]<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>) were eligible for inclusion in the study. Main exclusion criteria were (1) active skin disease or inflammation near or in the NLFs; (2) other relevant medical history (e.g., sensitivity to HA, bleeding disorder, impaired coagulation, severe keloids, or hypertrophic scars); (3) soft tissue augmentation with HA or collagen in the NLFs in the previous 18 months or any other soft tissue augmentation in the NLFs; (4) any aesthetic or dermatologic treatment in the face in the previous 12 months and during the study (except botulinum toxin Type A injections, which were allowed in the upper third of the face up to 1 month prior to baseline and from 3 months after the last injection in the study); (5) and pregnancy, nursing, or planned pregnancy.</p></sec><sec id="s1-3"><title>Treatments</title><p>At baseline, injection treatment with HA<sub>ED</sub> or HA<sub>PER</sub> (both products without lidocaine) was randomly assigned to either the left or right NLF. The evaluating investigator was not allowed to be present at the injection or assist in the preparations for injection, and subjects were blindfolded prior to and during the injection in order to maintain the blinding. If the blinded evaluator judged it necessary, the unblinded investigator could administer a touch-up injection 3 weeks after the baseline treatment. Local and/or topical anesthetics and/or infraorbital nerve block could be applied at the discretion of the investigator.</p><p>Injections were to be placed in the mid dermis using a 27-gauge needle. The aim was to achieve complete correction of the NLFs (without overcorrection). The injection technique and volume was decided by the investigator, provided that no more than 2 mL per product was injected at baseline and no more than 1 mL per product at touch-up.</p></sec><sec id="s1-4"><title>Assessments</title><p>The 5-grade WSRS<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> was used separately by blinded evaluators and subjects to evaluate the severity of subjects' NLFs. Mean change in WSRS from baseline was the primary effectiveness parameter. The percentage of subjects with at least one-grade improvement in WSRS from baseline (defined here as responder rate) was a secondary effectiveness parameter. Subjects were offered to receive a final retreatment at the end of the study. Those who wished to receive this retreatment were asked to indicate their preferred treatment side.</p><p>Safety assessments included the blinded evaluator's assessment of adverse events (AEs) at each study visit. In addition, subjects assessed local tolerability (bruising, edema/swelling, erythema, nodule formation, pain/tenderness, and pruritus) on a daily basis using a subject diary during 3 weeks after the baseline treatment, and if applicable, touch-up treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s1-5"><title>Statistical Analyses</title><p>Sample size was calculated based on the assumption that HA<sub>ED</sub> and HA<sub>PER</sub> were equally efficacious at 6 months, with a 90% power to demonstrate noninferiority. The safety and intention-to-treat (ITT) populations included all subjects who received all planned treatments. The per-protocol (PP) population included all randomized subjects with no major protocol deviations.</p><p>The primary effectiveness criterion was the mean change in the blinded evaluator's assessment of WSRS from baseline to 6 months after baseline. A Student <italic>t</italic>-test was used to calculate the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the mean between-treatment difference (HA<sub>PER</sub> &#x02212; HA<sub>ED</sub>). If the CI was above the margin of &#x02212;0.5 in both the ITT and PP populations, noninferiority was to be declared.</p><p>Responder rate data are presented descriptively. Imputation for any missing effectiveness data was done for the ITT population (last observation carried forward) but not for the PP population, for which analyses were based on observed cases. A two-sided McNemar test was used to analyze subject preference at the end of the study. Safety data were analyzed descriptively.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Subject Disposition</title><p>A total of 89 subjects were screened at the 6 study centers.

The results show that HA<sub>ED</sub> was noninferior to HA<sub>PER</sub> for the treatment of severe NLFs, assessed by mean change from baseline in WSRS score at 6 months. The effect lasted for at least 12 months in approximately 80% of subjects after 1 treatment. The final effectiveness results reported here are similar to the interim results reported previously.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup></p><p>Analyses of secondary effectiveness parameters pointed toward that there was a statistically significant difference in the mean change from baseline in WSRS over time, favoring HA<sub>ED</sub> compared with HA<sub>PER</sub>. However, this difference was seemingly small (ranging between 0.17 and 0.24) and needs to be corroborated by results from further studies. Furthermore, the clinical relevance of this difference needs to be confirmed. However, the preference assessment at the end of the present study indicated that a majority of subjects preferred the side treated with HA<sub>ED</sub> over the side treated with HA<sub>PER</sub>. These results are in agreement with the comparison of difference in mean WSRS score improvement from baseline.</p><p>Carruthers and colleagues<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> previously reported that the 6-month responder rate was 75% for HA<sub>PER</sub>. This is somewhat lower than the corresponding data recorded in the present study (90% for HA<sub>ED</sub> and 88% for HA<sub>PER</sub>), although similar volumes of HA gel were injected. In fact, the 12-month results from the present study are similar to the 6-month results reported by Carruthers and colleagues.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> It is possible that the difference in responder rates between studies is a reflection of differences in study populations and/or differences due to the subjective components of the outcome criteria.</p><p>In the present study, the effectiveness results (both in terms of mean improvement from baseline in WSRS and in terms of responder rate) showed a gradual decline over time after the baseline injection, which is expected as both HA<sub>ED</sub> and HA<sub>PER</sub> are biodegradable. A majority of subjects (&#x0003e;88%) were responders 6 months after the baseline injection, and approximately 80% of subjects were still responders 1 year after the baseline injection.</p><p>The HA fillers used in this study did not contain lidocaine, which was due to the fact the only the nonlidocaine version of HA<sub>ED</sub> was available at the time of the study; HA fillers that do not contain lidocaine have the advantage that they may be used in subjects for whom lidocaine is contraindicated or who are allergic to this class of local anesthetics. However, drawbacks relate to pain and reduced treatment comfort. Therefore, a lidocaine-containing version of HA<sub>ED</sub> is currently available.</p><p>Both fillers were well tolerated and associated with few treatment-related AEs. For both HA products, local tolerability reactions generally resolved within a week. The treatment-related AEs that occurred were of mild intensity, and all except one had resolved by the end of the study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s4"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Basically, HA<sub>ED</sub> was noninferior to HA<sub>PER</sub> as measured by the mean change from baseline in WSRS score at 6 months after the baseline treatment of severe NLFs. There was a statistically significant difference in mean change from baseline in WSRS score in favor of HA<sub>ED</sub> at 3 to 12 months after the treatment. However, this difference was small and needs to be corroborated by results from further studies. Furthermore, the clinical relevance of this difference is unclear. The overall responder rates were similar between HA<sub>ED</sub> and HA<sub>PER</sub> over time and remained high throughout the 12 months, ranging from 79% to 99%. The preference assessment at the end of the study indicated that a majority of subjects preferred the side treated with HA<sub>ED</sub> over the side treated with HA<sub>PER</sub>. However, neither product used contained lidocaine, so it is not known if these results would apply to the lidocaine-containing products.</p><p>Both HA gel products were well tolerated and were associated with a few treatment-related AEs, all of which were anticipated reactions to HA filler injection.</p><p>To summarize, the results of the present study show that HA<sub>ED</sub> was at least as effective and well tolerated for treatment of severe NLFs as HA<sub>PER</sub>.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors acknowledge Patrick Brun, MD, Dermatology, Cannes Hospital, Cannes, France, for serving as one of the study investigators and thereby contributing towards the collection of study data.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p>Galderma provided B.
