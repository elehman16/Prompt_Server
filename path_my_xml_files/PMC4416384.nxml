In this study we investigated the dose-exposure-response relationship of a triflusal formulation by population pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) modeling of its main active metabolite, hydroxy-4-(trifluoromethyl) benzoic acid (HTB).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This study was a randomized, open-label, multiple-dose, two-period, two-treatment, comparative crossover design. All volunteers received a single oral loading dose of 900&#x000a0;mg of triflusal on Day 1, followed by a dose of 600&#x000a0;mg/day from Day 2 to 9. Using data from 34 healthy volunteers, 476 HTB plasma concentration data points and 340 platelet aggregation data points were used to construct PK and PD models respectively using NONMEM (version 6.2). As the PD endpoint was qualitative, we implemented binary analysis of &#x02018;inhibition&#x02019; and &#x02018;non-inhibition&#x02019; rather than using the actual value of the test. The final PK-PD model was evaluated using a visual predictive check (VPC) and bootstrap.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The time-concentration profile of HTB over the entire dosing period was described by a one-compartment model with a first-order formation rate constant for HTB. Weight was selected as a covariate for clearance and volume of triflusal, respectively. The structure and the population estimates for triflusal PK were as follows: oral clearance (<italic>CL/F</italic>)&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.2&#x02009;&#x000b7;&#x02009;(weight/71.65)<sup>0.845</sup>&#x02009;L/h, oral volume of distribution (<italic>V/F</italic>)&#x02009;=&#x02009;8.3&#x02009;&#x000b7;&#x02009;(weight/71.65) L, and <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>f</italic></sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.341&#x000a0;h<sup>-1</sup>. A sigmoid relationship between triflusal concentration and the probability of significant inhibition with shape factor was chosen as the final PD model. No time delay between concentration and response was identified. The final structure between predicted concentration <inline-formula id="IEq1"><inline-graphic xlink:href="40360_2014_365_IEq1_HTML.gif"/></inline-formula> and the probability of inhibition of platelet aggregation (IPA) relationship was as follows: Probability of <inline-formula id="IEq2"><inline-graphic xlink:href="40360_2014_365_IEq2_HTML.gif"/></inline-formula>. Thus, we concluded this relationship is more like quantal concentration-response relationship. The current dosing regimen was considered to be efficacious based on the <italic>EC</italic><sub><italic>50</italic></sub> estimate of 84.9&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mL obtained in this study.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>A PK and binary probability PD model of triflusal was successfully developed for Korean healthy volunteers.

Triflusal is less effective in inhibiting COX-1 and reducing TXB2 than aspirin, but more effective than HTB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. HTB increases the effects of triflusal on COX-1 inhibition compared with salicylic acid, the main metabolite of aspirin, which competes with the prodrug for the active site on the cyclooxygenase enzyme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>Several previous reports have described the pharmacokinetic (PK) characteristics of triflusal.

The estimate and the between-subject variability for PK-PD parameters were investigated. The first-order conditional estimation (FOCE) method with interaction option was used whenever applicable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The between-subject variability of each parameter of the basic model was applied using the exponential model:
<disp-formula id="Equa"><graphic xlink:href="40360_2014_365_Equa_HTML.gif" position="anchor"/></disp-formula></p><p>where P<sub><italic>ij</italic></sub> is the value of the <italic>j</italic><sup>th</sup> parameter in the <italic>i</italic><sup>th</sup> individual, &#x003b8;<sub><italic>j</italic></sub> is the typical value of the <italic>j</italic><sup>th</sup> population parameter, and &#x003b7;<sub><italic>ij</italic></sub> is a random variable for the <italic>i</italic><sup>th</sup> individual in the <italic>j</italic><sup>th</sup> parameter. It is assumed that &#x003b7;<sub><italic>ij</italic></sub> is normally distributed, with a mean of zero and a variance of &#x003c9;<sup>2</sup>, and that &#x003b7;<sub><italic>ij</italic></sub>&#x02009;&#x02248;&#x02009;N(0, &#x003c9;<sub><italic>ij</italic></sub><sup>2</sup>).

The combined additive and proportional error model on the following equation was initially applied to explain the gaps between the observed values and those predicted by individual PK parameters:

A similar approach was made to the PD observations. The standard errors, which give information on the precision of the parameter estimates, were explored using NONMEM&#x02019;s &#x0201c;$COVARIANCE&#x0201d; step.</p><p>Models were evaluated using diagnostic scatter plots, goodness-of-fit plots, and the log likelihood ratio test (LRT). The results for LRT were considered statistically significant if the objective function value (OFV) decreased by 3.84 (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.05); this was used as a cut-off criterion for model improvement.</p><p>For PK, various absorption functions and distributional (1-compartment vs. multi-compartment) models were compared. When linking PK-PD relationship, two different models &#x02013; binary probability and inhibition of build-up &#x02013; were tried sequentially to find the best description on the PD data. The binary probability model uses a form of relationship similar to the Michaelis-Menten equation, <inline-formula id="IEq5"><inline-graphic xlink:href="40360_2014_365_IEq5_HTML.gif"/></inline-formula> to explain instantaneous PK-PD relationship. In this equation, C<sub><italic>pred,ij</italic></sub> is the estimated concentration over time for individuals, <italic>EC</italic><sub><italic>50</italic></sub> is the plasma concentration corresponding to the half-maximal response, and <italic>&#x003b3;</italic> is the shape factor. To implement this approach, the PD data (% platelet aggregation) was transformed to a binary format based upon the finding that the distribution of PD observation (the maximum platelet aggregation observed in each sample) was clearly bimodal (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The values above 74% were regarded as no inhibition of platelet aggregation (IPA), and thus as DV&#x02009;=&#x02009;0, whereas values below 74 were regarded as IPA (DV&#x02009;=&#x02009;1), according to a guideline presenting the normal ranges for the degree (%) of aggregation in platelet-rich plasma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. To find a reliable initial estimate for this model, a logistic regression procedure was performed in advance. For a binary output variable, Y, we can model conditional probability P(Y&#x02009;=&#x02009;1 | X&#x02009;=&#x02009;x) as a function of x [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].

The objective of this study was to develop a population PK and PD model of the triflusal formulation, an established uncoated capsule, in healthy Korean male subjects. Plasma concentrations of the active metabolite, HTB, and the degree of platelet aggregation inhibition were measured to demonstrate the PK and PD properties. Reasonable estimates for parameters of the PK model were obtained, reflecting the potential for accurately predicting the information sought. The plots of the observed concentrations versus population-predicted or individual-predicted concentrations showed that the PK model was well structured, and the plot of time versus conditional weighted residuals suggested that the errors had homogeneous variances.</p><p>Our final HTB PK structure includes first-order formation and 1-compartment disposition. This is plausible judging from the immediate increase in HTB concentration on the day of full-PK study after dosing time and the rate of concentration increase which is the fastest at immediate post-dose and decreases thereafter (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). This finding is consistent to the model used by Valle et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. On the contrary, Yun et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] suggested a 2-compartment model for HTB disposition. But we considered this model would behavior like a 1-compartment model because the distributional rate constant between compartments were much (approximately 60 times) larger than the elimination rate constant and the equilibrium between compartments will be obtained within 1&#x000a0;h after dose. Judging from the time of maximum plasma concentration attainment (postdose 4&#x02013;5&#x000a0;h), this distributional characteristic might be superimposed by the absorption as well as the elimination.</p><p>Covariate model building was established by the relationship between the subjects&#x02019; body features and parameters in the PK model. Weight accounted for approximately 19 % and 39 % of between-subject variability for <italic>CL/F</italic> and <italic>V/F</italic>, respectively, judging from the decrease of &#x003c9;<sup>2</sup> for corresponding parameters. Particularly, <italic>V/F</italic> was directly proportional to weight (exponent&#x02009;=&#x02009;1) and the fact suggested that weight may be used as a scaling factor for triflusal dose. However, definite conclusions could not be made for following reason; 1) this study did not consider the PK of triflusal; thus, weight might be influential to the disposition of triflusal including metabolic fraction to HTB (which was only explained with <italic>F</italic> in this study), 2) the clinical significance of this finding needs further investigations together with its pharmacodynamics variability, therapeutic index and clinical effectiveness. In addition, even though HTB is mainly (&#x0003e;60%) excreted in urine, <italic>CLCR</italic> was not selected as a meaningful covariate for HTB <italic>CL/F</italic>. We consider that the effect of weight superimposed that of <italic>CLCR</italic>.

The saturated value of <italic>E</italic><sub><italic>max</italic></sub> as 1 seemed reasonable, because there was no significant model improvement when the parameter was allowed to be estimated.</p><p>Another method, the binary probability model to construct the PD model using transformed binary data, was introduced to show characteristics of the PD data without much information loss. This model resulted in successful explanation of binary data characteristics by the estimates, even though a turnover model was not constructed because of the modified binary data characteristics. To date, this is the first report evaluating quantitative PD data transformed into qualitative binary data possessing one of two values. We recommend this new approach of using probability to estimate parameters that show predictive ability for the presence of platelet aggregation. This model also provided a specific method for potential use with binary data in the case of high intra-individual variability for PD.</p><p>This study has some limitations. First, only HTB concentrations were used in our population PK and PD model without measurement of the parent drug. Although triflusal is a prodrug which has no pharmacologic effect, if a study involving the concentration measurement of both triflusal and HTB is conducted, a better description for the HTB formation will be obtained. This approach may enable the identification of influential factors for HTB formation process including first-pass metabolism and hepatic clearance of triflusal. Second, despite the possible loss of information from the data transformation, a PD model using probability (binary data model) was developed to evaluate the extreme values in our PD data, as seen in the scatter diagram. To overcome this problem, more accurate and precise quantitative analytic method to measure the degree of platelet aggregation should be required.</p><p>Using the VPC, which is one method of model evaluation, prediction is possible when given not only different dosage- and time-concentrations but also the probability of IPA. Accordingly, optimal dosage regimens could be determined by model-fitted parameter estimates without additional clinical trials. The model may be clinically useful for other similar studies. Finally, this study was conducted in healthy volunteers, rather than in patients. Thus, it is also necessary to construct a model estimating reasonable parameters from patients in a more realistic setting.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>A PK and binary probability PD model of triflusal was successfully developed for Korean healthy volunteers.
