using Gonstead techniques on posture in female university students. [Subjects] In this
study, 30 female university students were selected and divided into a pelvic adjustment
group of 15 subjects as an experimental group and a stretching group of 15 subjects as a
control group. [Methods] Step length difference (SLD), stance phase difference (STPD),
swing phase difference (SWPD), single support difference (SSD), and step time difference
(STD) were evaluated in the subjects using an OptoGait. [Results] Whereas the adjustment
group showed statistically significant differences in SLD, STPD, SWPD, SSD, and STD, the
stretching group did not show any statistically significant differences in any of the
items. [Conclusion] Pelvic adjustment can be applied using Gonstead techniques as a method
of reducing differences in normal gait variables between the left and right sides in
adults.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Pelvic adjustment</kwd><kwd>Optogait</kwd><kwd>Gait analysis</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Gait refers to moving the body to targeted points using the legs as a complex and
integrated activity with low energy consumption involving alternative and harmonious
movements with normal tension of the antigravity muscles<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. During gait, the smaller the step length difference (SLD), stance
phase difference (STPD), swing phase difference (SWPD), single support difference (SSD), and
step time difference (STD) between the left and right feet are, the higher the stability of
the gait will be. Securing the stability of gait is an important factor when it comes to
preventing falls. A fall may not only cause fractures and brain damage but mat also reduce
mobility and motility, thereby bringing about many restrictions on living activities and
leading to a declined quality of life<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Improvements in muscle endurance and gait velocity have been reported after performance of
lower extremity exercises, and recent studies have emphasized that strengthening of not only
the lower extremity muscles but also the lumbar muscles would improve the functional
stability of the body and consequently enhance balance and gait ability<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. The pelvis is a structure located between the hip joint and
the lumbosacral region to which many muscles are attached to adjust the movements of the hip
joint and the lumbosacral region. Therefore, the position of the pelvis is the most
important element determining the body&#x02019;s sagittal alignment and posture<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. The lumbosacral joint affects the lumbar vertebrae, and the
position of the lumbar vertebrae above the lumbosacral joint is determined by the position
of the lumbosacral joint. The angle of the lumbosacral joint may vary depending on the
position of the pelvis. Dynamic problems of the musculoskeletal system can be said to arise
from the lumbar vertebrae, depending on the position of the pelvis. Anteroposterior gradient
movements of the pelvis may affect the stability of the vertebrae and the alignment of the
body. Therefore, proper alignment of the pelvis is an important element in gait<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Many studies have been conducted on the stability and postures of the pelvis, which are
important for gait. There have been some cases in which lumbo-pelvic stabilization and
posture were improved through bridge exercises<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>, and there have been others in which lumbo-pelvic stabilization and
posture were improved through diverse mat exercises<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, these methods have drawbacks in that they require time,
space, and active participation from the subjects. On the other hand, pelvic adjustment is a
treatment method that does not require much time. Although many previous studies have
examined the effects of pelvic adjustment on functional leg length inequality<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>, balance<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>, posture<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>, and
so on, no previous research has examined the extent of changes in gait brought about by one
session of adjustment. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the immediate effects
of one session of pelvic adjustment on the gait variables of female university students.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Thirty female university students were selected and randomly assigned to a pelvic
adjustment group of 15 subjects as an experimental group and a stretching group of 15
subjects as a control group. Those who had problems with their muscular, skeletal, or
nervous system; those who felt pain in their lumbar region or pelvis during daily living;
those who had improper postures due to burns or postoperative scars; and those who could not
walk normally were excluded from the study. All included patients understood the purpose of
this study and provided written informed consent prior to their participation in accordance
with the ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinki.</p><p>The adjustment group that participated in this study had a mean age of 21.5&#x000b1;4.9&#x02005;years, a
mean height of 163.0&#x000b1;7.3&#x02005;cm, and a mean weight of 54.1&#x000b1;7.1&#x02005;kg; the stretching group had a
mean age of 20.2&#x000b1;4.3&#x02005;years, a mean height of 163.4&#x000b1;6.6&#x02005;cm, and a mean weight of 57.1&#x000b1;9.5&#x02005;kg.
Chi-squared tests were used to analyze the groups with regard to sex, and independent
t-tests were used to analyze the groups with regard to age, height, and weight. The analyses
showed no statistically significant difference (p&#x0003e;0.05), indicating that there was no
problem in the homogeneity between the two groups.</p><p>In this study, the pelvic adjustment applied to the pelvic adjustment group was the
high-velocity, low-amplitude technique for prone positions among Gonstead&#x02019;s theories. The
direction of adjustment was set up before correction through gait analysis and Gillet
tests<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Each subject was instructed to
take a prone position and the height of the pelvis of the subject was checked to provide
anterior rotation impacts on the innominate bone if it was posterior rotation displaced and
to provide posterior rotation impacts on the innominate bone if it was anterior rotation
displaced. When giving the impacts, the therapist overlapped her two hands and placed them
on the posterior-superior iliac spine or ischial spine of the subject to give the impacts
using her body weight, gravity, and acceleration<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. This adjustment was conducted 3&#x02013;5 times by one physical therapist
with at least 10&#x02005;years of clinical experience. In the case of the stretching group, to
relieve any imbalance in muscles that may result in the imbalance of the pelvis, the muscles
around the pelvis&#x02014;specifically the erector spinae muscle, the rectus abdominis, the iliac
muscle, the psoas major muscle, the quadriceps femoris muscle, the leg adductor muscle, and
the quadratus lumborum muscle&#x02014;were stretched. During the stretching, the therapist helped
the subjects so that each muscle could be extended a little further than the maximum
extended posture, and each subject was instructed to maintain each maximum extended posture
for 10&#x02013;15 seconds. After each stretching posture, the subject slowly restored the initial
posture, took a rest for five seconds, and stretched once again. Each stretching posture was
carried out three times in total, and the time spent for each session of stretching was 15
minutes.</p><p>The OptoGait (Microgate Italy, Bolzano-Bozen, Italy), used to measure gait variables, is
gait analysis equipment made up of an optical detection system having 96 LEDs that transmit
information using infrared frequencies via a transmission bar and the same number of LEDs on
the receiving bar on the opposite side. The transmission and receiving bars of the OptoGait
are installed on the two sides of a treadmill, and the SLD, STPD, SWPD, SSD, and STD during
gait are calculated based on communication between the two bars being blocked by the
patient&#x02019;s movements. The lengths of time a subjects runs, jumps, performs a series of jump
tests, makes contact with the floor, or remains in the air can be calculated accurately from
data captured with 1,000 instances of transmission/receiving per second. The dedicated
software analyzes these basic data measured in real time and converts them into a series of
movements.</p><p>The measured data were analyzed using SPSS 12.0 KO (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA), and the
collected data are presented as means and standard deviations. The significance of
differences between before and after the experiment in each group was tested using paired
t-tests and the significance of differences between the two groups was tested using
independent t-tests. The significance level &#x003b1; was set to 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The pre- and post-intervention measurement results in the adjustment group and the

misalignment in the pelvis and the lower extremities, which affects posture, gait patterns,
and balance. The pelvis supports the abdomen, connects the vertebrae to the lower
extremities, transmits body weight from the vertebrae to the lower extremities while
standing, and enables proper posture to be maintained in order to generate smooth movements
of the upper extremities<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Studies have
reported that proper posture can be maintained and the upper body and the lower body can be
controlled during movement to enhance gait ability only when the pelvis is in the neutral
position<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Differences in lower
extremity lengths can be found in all clinical cases, and these differences cause imbalance
in the joints, vertebrae, and pelvis and disturb normal biodynamic functions<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>A normal position and the stability of the pelvis are thus important for a balanced gait.
Although many previous studies have analyzed the gait of hemiplegia<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup> or cerebral palsy patients<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup> after diverse interventions using three-dimensional gait analysis,
no study has analyzed the gait of such patients after pelvic adjustment; moreover, no
studies that analyzed the gait of healthy adults after pelvic adjustment could be found.
Therefore, the aim of this study was to apply pelvic adjustment to healthy adults and see if
immediate changes in gait would occur.</p><p>Accordingly, changes in gaits were analyzed after pelvic adjustment was applied using
Gonstead techniques. As a result, the SLD, STPD, SWPD, SSD, and STD between the left and
right sides decreased, indicating that pelvic adjustment had immediate effects on balanced
gait in the female university students. In particular, the pre-intervention difference in
SLD, which was 3.3&#x000b1;1.6 in the adjustment group and 3.7&#x000b1;4.0&#x02005;cm in the stretching group,
resulted from the anterior and posterior rotation rates of the left and right innominate
bones being different. The post-intervention SLD of the adjustment group decreased to
0.7&#x000b1;0.5&#x02005;cm because the posteriorly rotated innominate bone was imposed with impact for
anterior rotation and the anterior rotation pelvis was imposed with impact for posterior
rotation through pelvic adjustment.</p><p>In previous papers related to pelvic adjustment, Gong et al. (2011) advised that functional
leg length inequality was reduced through pelvic adjustment among Gonstead&#x02019;s techniques, and
these changes in leg length inequality reduced differences in foot pressure<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Moreover, Park et al. (2012) reported that
the balance of 20 elderly males was improved through pelvic adjustment using Gonstead
techniques<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>, while Cho (2013) stated
that pelvic adjustment improved posture in female university students<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The results of previous studies indicating that pelvic adjustment using Gonstead techniques
improved postures, reduced differences in leg lengths, enhanced balance, and reduced
differences in foot pressure are similar to the results of this study, which indicated that
pelvic adjustment applied with Gonstead techniques had immediate effects on balanced gait in
the female university students.</p><p>The changes balanced gait in the female university students brought about by pelvic
adjustment, as mentioned above, are considered to have occurred because the pelvis is an
important structure that supports the vertebrae and transmits body weight to the lower
extremities. Functional leg length inequality is considered to have been reduced through
pelvic adjustment, and these changes in leg length inequality are considered to have induced
proper postures, as well as affects on gait variables, so that balanced gaits were shown.
Therefore, the author recommends utilizing pelvic adjustment in patients who require
properly balanced gaits. However, how long pelvic adjustment will enable balanced gait to be
maintained should be examined through follow-up studies.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This research was supported by Korea Nazarene University Research Grants in 2014.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Perry</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Garrett</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Gronley</surname><given-names>JK</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Classification of walking handicap in the stroke
