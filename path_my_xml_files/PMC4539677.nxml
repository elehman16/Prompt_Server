OT position incidentally found in the second stage of labour is also associated with operative delivery in high risk cohorts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Caesarean section is now a major contributing factor to maternal mortality and morbidity following childbirth in developed countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Obstetric intervention by forceps and vacuum delivery is associated with complications to the maternal genital tract and neonate, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>Manual rotation from the OP to the occiput anterior (OA) position is a safe, relatively simple and easy to perform procedure which could reduce the operative delivery rate (defined as vacuum delivery, forceps delivery and/or caesarean section), and therefore increase the chances of a normal vaginal birth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. It is performed by only a minority of obstetricians and midwives in Australia and New Zealand, and yet is considered to be acceptable by the vast majority [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However, obstetricians and midwives would perform a manual rotation if there was evidence that it resulted in an absolute risk reduction of about 18% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], suggesting that demonstration of efficacy will translate into clinical practice. One cohort study with a mixed population of OT and occiput posterior (OP) positions showed promising results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], but there has been no randomized controlled trial of attempted manual rotation for OT position in the second stage of labour.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Epidemiology</title><p>The prevalence of OT position is 19 to 49% at the onset of labour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], 10 to 20% in the second stage of labour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and 3 to 8% at delivery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In one prospective cohort, the operative delivery rate was 87% when OT position was present at birth, compared with 24% when the fetus was in the more common OA position [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. When the OT position was present at the beginning of the second stage of labour, the operative delivery rate was 49% compared with 31% when the position was OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The association between OT position in the second stage labour and operative delivery is maintained after adjusting for multiple confounders, including ethnicity, parity, epidural use, abnormal second stage Cardiotocograph and maternal age (odds ratio for OT versus OA: 2.0, 95% confidence interval: 1.1 to 3.7) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>Thus, of all women who plan a normal birth, 10 to 20% will have a fetus in the OT position early in the second stage of labour. These women will be eligible to have a manual rotation to modify their background risk (of approximately 50%) of intervention with forceps, vacuum or caesarean section.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Complications of occiput transverse position</title><p>The OT position is associated with more frequent augmentation of labour, episiotomy, third or fourth degree perineal trauma, febrile morbidity, prolonged second stage of labour and low five-minute Apgar test score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>The intervention in current practice</title><p>Manual rotation is a well-accepted component of obstetric practice, particularly in the context of rotating the fetus to the OA position immediately prior to the application of non-rotational forceps, such as Neville-Barnes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. However, it is also used in a prophylactic setting (without assisted delivery) to reduce the complications associated with OT delivery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In a survey of obstetricians in Australia and New Zealand, 70% believed it was acceptable in a prophylactic setting; however, only 38% had performed a manual rotation in the last year, and most of these had only performed one or two [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Both obstetricians and midwives reported they would perform a manual rotation if there was an 18% absolute risk reduction in operative delivery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Thus demonstration of efficacy would provide substantial scope for the intervention to be introduced into widespread practice.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>The efficacy of the intervention</title><p>There is only one study which assessed the efficacy of manual rotation for OT position in the second stage of labour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. This retrospective database cohort study reported on both OT and OP positions as a single group, and found a 9% risk of caesarean section when manual rotation was performed compared with a 41% risk when it was not [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The authors had information on the fetal position at the time of birth, but not earlier in the second stage of labour when the procedure was performed. Thus OP fetuses that were destined to rotate naturally to the OA position would have been included in the intervention group, but not the control group, which would result in an overestimation of the caesarean section rate in the control group and of the efficacy of manual rotation. The authors did not report on the success of manual rotation for OT and OP positions separately.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>The safety of the intervention</title><p>Manual rotation has long been considered to be safe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. One retrospective cohort study reported lower rates of complications when it was performed for OP position compared to when it was not (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Complications of manual rotation versus expectant management (data from Shaffer <italic>et al</italic>.)

In the TURN-OUT trial, manual rotation will be performed at full dilatation that theoretically will minimize the risk of cervical laceration.</p><p>There is also a single case report of an umbilical cord prolapse associated with a manual rotation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In this report, an emergency caesarean section was performed and the baby was born alive and presumably well. Other risk factors such as amniotomy, application of a fetal scalp electrode and external cephalic version were more frequently associated with umbilical cord prolapse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>The timing of the intervention</title><p>Manual rotation from the OP position may be performed at full cervical dilatation or late in the first stage of labour. In a French case control study (n = 147) in a labour ward where prophylactic manual rotation was performed routinely, two risk factors for inability to rotate the fetus were identified: (1) attempted rotation before full dilatation and (2) failure to progress in labour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Thus we consider that it would be reasonable to attempt prophylactic manual rotation after full dilatation is achieved, but relatively early in the second stage of labour, before the fetal head becomes impacted in the maternal pelvis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Rationale for operative delivery as the primary outcome</title><p>Operative delivery was selected as the primary outcome for the TURN-OUT trial because it is clearly associated with important short and long term outcomes for the woman and her baby [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Other important obstetric parameters will be measured, but will be reported as secondary outcomes. Reducing the rate of operative delivery for OP position is perceived to be very important by obstetricians and midwives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In high income countries, emergency caesarean section is associated with significant maternal morbidity and a five-fold increase in maternal mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Explanation for choice of comparator</title><p>A sham procedure was chosen as a comparator to minimize the risk of performance bias. There would be substantial scope for management to differ according to treatment allocation if it was known.

The technique employed will be at the discretion of the operator performing the procedure. The intervention will be performed by obstetricians or midwives who are experienced in performing a manual rotation and have performed at least 20 procedures. All operators will complete a questionnaire outlining their technique and experience.</p><p>With the membranes ruptured, a vaginal examination is performed and the woman is asked to bear down. Constant pressure is exerted with the index finger against the lambdoid suture to rotate fetal head. This may take two to three contractions and the position is commonly held for two contractions while the woman bears down to reduce the risk of reverting back to the OP position. Alternatively, the examiner places two fingers behind the fetal ear or the entire hand behind the occiput and applies constant flexion and rotation to the fetal head.</p><p>For the purposes of the TURN-OUT Trial, the procedure will be described as a &#x02018;digital rotation&#x02019; if only the fingers are used, and as a &#x02018;manual rotation&#x02019; if the whole hand is used.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Comparator</title><p>Once full dilatation has been diagnosed (when the woman has the first urge to push or after one hour, whichever occurs first), women randomized to the sham rotation will have the same apparent vaginal examination as the intervention, but no rotational force will be applied.

Adherence with treatment allocation will be monitored by comparing these datasheets with the computer randomisation records. All interventions and usual care provided by doctors and midwives looking after the participant will be allowed.

An hour after full dilatation or at the first urge to push, a study investigator (with no clinical responsibility for the woman in the trial) will confirm the OT position by a second (pre-procedure) bedside ultrasound. If the fetal position is still OT and the woman still wishes to participate then the study investigator will randomise the woman to either manual or sham rotation. The treatment allocation will be recorded on a randomisation sheet, which the investigator will keep on their person and not show to any of the participant&#x02019;s medical staff. After the manual rotation or sham has been performed the ultrasound will be repeated, ensuring that the woman and her medical staff do not see the screen. The investigator will leave and the woman will have her usual care from this point onwards. The investigator will record the findings on vaginal examination, details of the procedure and post-procedure ultrasound findings on the same data sheet as the pre-procedure ultrasound. The study investigator will keep this data sheet on their person and not show it to any of the participants&#x02019; medical staff.</p></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Outcomes</title><p>Mode of delivery will be ascertained from the medical records to measure the primary outcome. Labour and delivery outcomes, perineal trauma, blood loss, duration of hospitalisation, short term neonatal outcomes, admission to the neonatal ICU, maternal or neonatal readmission to the same institution and other components of the combined secondary outcomes will be ascertained by a study investigator not involved in clinical care, using the medical records and by contacting participants&#x02019; clinicians for further information if required. Maternal depression, health-related quality of life (SF-12), birth satisfaction (visual analogue score), maternal or neonatal readmission to another institution, ongoing breastfeeding, pelvic floor symptoms and components of the combined secondary outcomes will be collected by structured maternal questionnaires at six weeks, six months and 12 months post-delivery, as outlined in section <xref rid="Sec21" ref-type="sec">Outcomes</xref>. Questionnaires will be completed by mail-out, online via the trial website and by telephone, depending on the participants&#x02019; preferences (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Data collectors will be unaware of the treatment allocation at all times.</p><p>As the primary outcome is mode of delivery and randomisation occurs during the second stage of labour, we expect 100% ascertainment for the primary outcome. Study investigators will perform site visits about four times per year to promote recruitment, provide education for clinical staff and site investigators and audit of centre medical records to verify accuracy of data collected by sites. Participants will receive a telephone call at each time point by research staff not involved in their care to ask their preference for follow-up. Unless she declines further participation, each participant will receive a reminder telephone call, and will be offered completion of the questionnaire by telephone if they feel they cannot complete it by mail or online.</p></sec><sec id="Sec31"><title>Data management</title><p>Data collected will be entered into a registered electronic database by research staff blinded to treatment allocation who are not involved in the clinical care of participants. Hardcopies of participants&#x02019; data will be stored in a locked office. The electronic database will include the study identification number, but no directly identifying data such as medical record number, date of birth or personal address. The de-identified database will be backed up on a server at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital. Data linking identifying details to the study number will be kept at a separate location in a locked filing cabinet. At the end of the study, data will be kept in a locked filing cabinet, and de-identified electronic data will be kept on a portable medium, such as a USB drive, in a separate secure location at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital. All electronic data will be checked for accuracy by a second member of the research team, and any apparent data entry errors will be discussed by the primary investigators and investigated and/or corrected as required.</p></sec><sec id="Sec32"><title>Analysis</title><p>Analysis will be on an intention-to-treat basis (according to treatment allocation), including withdrawals and losses to follow-up. Losses to follow-up for the primary outcome are not expected because randomisation will occur at full dilatation and the primary outcome is the mode of delivery. The results will be reported according to the Consolidated Standards for Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines.</p><p>Demographics and other potential confounders will be compared by treatment allocation in a univariate analysis. Categorical outcome measures will be compared by proportions (chi-squared test), means for normally distributed data (t-test) or rank order for non-normally distributed data (Mann-Whitney U test).</p><p>A logistic regression analysis of treatment allocation and other variables on the primary outcome measure, operative delivery, will be performed. The following variables will be considered for the logistic regression model: maternal body mass index, maternal age, maternal height, maternal ethnicity, gestation, induction of labour, gestational diabetes, neonatal gender and RCOG CTG classification in the second stage of labour. Parity, study site and the presence of epidural for intrapartum analgesia at the time of randomisation will not be included because randomisation is stratified for these variables. Only variables where <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c;0.25 in the univariate regression will be included in the multivariate model. Continuous variables that do not show a linear association with the logit function will be divided into quartiles and treated as categorical. Interaction terms will be considered for treatment allocation versus each of the other variables and, where clinically appropriate, between non-treatment variables. <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c;0.01 will be considered evidence of interaction. Terms will be excluded from the model in a stepwise backward manner until all remaining terms are both statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c;0.05) and clinically significant (that is, removal of the term results in a clinically significant change in the estimate of the odds ratio of treatment allocation for the primary outcome). The analysis will be performed using SAS 9.2 (or a more recent version of SAS, Statistical Analysis Software. Cary, USA).</p></sec><sec id="Sec33"><title>Additional analyses</title><p>Subgroup analyses will be performed according to the technique of manual rotation employed (manual/whole hand versus digital/fingers) and according to operator ability (data will be divided into two approximately equal groups according to the success rate of the operator who performed the manual rotation).</p></sec><sec id="Sec34"><title>Data and Safety Monitoring Committee</title><p>Draft terms of reference for a Data and Safety Monitoring Committee provide for potential cessation of the trial if significant safety concerns are raised. The Data and Safety Monitoring Committee will consist of three people who are not involved in the study and do not have a working relationship with the primary investigators. Adverse events will be reported to the committee. Any serious complications will be referred to the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee. There will be no external auditing of the trial. This study has been approved by the Ethics Review Committee (RPAH Zone) of the Sydney Local Health District, Sydney, Australia (protocol number: X110410).</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec35" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This trial addresses an important clinical question concerning a commonly used procedure that has the potential to reduce operative delivery and its associated complications. Due to the nature of the intervention, a number of issues are worthy of discussion.</p><p>First, empirical evidence suggests that blinding reduces bias in randomised controlled trials. However, blinding may be difficult in the case of procedural interventions. In this trial, we intend to assess the efficacy of blinding by asking the woman&#x02019;s clinician to guess the treatment allocation after manual rotation or sham rotation has occurred. The purpose of this is to allow the reader to assess the risk of bias associated with knowledge of treatment allocation.</p><p>Second, the efficacy of procedural interventions may depend on the experience and training of individual operators. The success of manual rotation by individual operators will be assessed by recording the ultrasound-determined fetal position after the manual rotation or sham procedure has been performed. We will report on any major differences between the success rates of individual practitioners.</p><p>Third, due to the ethics of consent in labour, consent will be obtained when it is unknown if the fetus will be in the OT position in the second stage of labour, which is an eligibility criterion. Thus, it is likely that only a minority of consented participants will be randomised, which will result in a large workload per randomisation.</p><p>Finally, women who progress rapidly in labour may give birth before they can be randomised and women with regional analgesia will have more opportunity to be consented. This could result in the study population having a higher background risk of the primary outcome than non-consented women who meet our eligibility criteria, which could impact the generalizability of our findings.</p><sec id="Sec36"><title>Protocol amendments and confidentiality</title><p>If modification to the study protocol is considered necessary then permission will be sought from the ethics committee and the changes will be described in the final report. All the information collected from the study will be treated confidentially, and only the researchers will have access to it. Hard copies of data collection forms will be stored in a locked office. The electronic database will be de-identified and stored at a different location to codes linking identifying data to study identification numbers. The electronic database will be on Microsoft Access, password-protected, and only accessible by research staff.</p></sec><sec id="Sec37"><title>Roles and responsibilities</title><sec id="Sec38"><title>Trial Management Committee</title><p>The committee consists of Hala Phipps, Jon Hyett and Bradley de Vries, who are responsible for the following:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Study planning,</p></list-item><list-item><p>Organisation of Steering Committee meetings,</p></list-item><list-item><p>Randomisation,</p></list-item><list-item><p>Reporting of any serious adverse events to the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee,</p></list-item><list-item><p>Budget administration and organising contracts with individual centres,</p></list-item><list-item><p>Providing advice for site investigators,</p></list-item><list-item><p>Auditing and visiting sites,</p></list-item><list-item><p>Data verification, and</p></list-item><list-item><p>Following up of study participants.</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="Sec39"><title>Site investigators and data manager</title><p>In each participating centre a lead investigator (obstetrician) will be responsible for identification, recruitment data collection and completion of relevant trial forms, along with adherence with study protocol.
