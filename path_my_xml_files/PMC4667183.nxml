In this study we assessed GTP mitigation on biomarkers of fumonisin B<sub>1</sub> (FB<sub>1</sub>), a class 2B carcinogen, in blood and urine samples collected from an intervention trial. A total of 124 exposed people were recruited and randomly assigned to low-dose (GTP 500&#x02009;mg, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;42), high-dose (GTP 1,000&#x02009;mg, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;41) or placebo (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;41) for 3 months. After one-month of intervention, urinary FB<sub>1</sub> was significantly decreased in high-dose group compared to that of placebo group (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.045), with reduction rates of 18.95% in the low-dose group and 33.62% in the high-dose group. After three-month intervention, urinary FB<sub>1</sub> showed significant decrease in both low-dose (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.016) and the high-dose (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0005) groups compared to that of both placebo group and baseline levels, with reduction rates of 40.18% in the low-dose group and 52.6% in the high-dose group. GTP treatment also significantly reduced urinary excretion of sphinganine (Sa), sphingosine (So), and Sa/So ratio, but had no effect on serum Sa, So, and Sa/So ratio. Analysis with mixed-effect model revealed significant interactions between time and treatment effects of GTP on both urinary free FB<sub>1</sub> levels and Sa/So ratios.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Fumonisins (FNs) are a family of naturally occurring mycotoxins mainly produced by <italic>Fusarium verticilioides</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>.

Chemoprevention was proposed as a promising strategy to help these high-risk individuals<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. Green tea polyphenols (GTP), major components in green tea leaves, have been shown to be highly effective in inhibiting a variety of carcinogen-induced tumorigenesis in animal models at different target organ sites<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>.

Levels of Sa, So and Sa/So ratio in blood had previously been proposed as potential biomarkers due to their association with treatment in animal models as well as the mechanistic implication; however, the reliability of these biomarkers in human populations remains questionable, mainly due to the influence of other factors and inconsistency in human studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. For example, Solfrizzo <italic>et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref> found that Sa/So ratio in South Brazil population was significantly higher than that of North Argentina, despite of similar maize and FNs intake in the two areas. Similar phenomenon was found by van der Westhuizen <italic>et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>, in assessing Sa and So levels in different areas of former Transkei, South Africa. They found no association between levels of Sa, So and/or Sa/So ratio and dietary levels of FB<sub>1</sub> in both urine and plasma samples in area of low and high oesophageal cancer incidences in Transkei region of South Africa<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>. Others, as well as our previous studies, also found neither between FB<sub>1</sub> exposure and serum Sa/So ratio<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>, nor association between serums Sa/So ratio and oesophageal cancer risk<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>. One hypothesis for this lack of correlation may be due to role of blood stream in buffering sphingolipids. Because new sphingolipids were continually synthesized <italic>de novo</italic> and released into bloodstream, this would in turn result in high variation in the sphingolipid levels. Moreover, the two sphingolipids were affected differently by the salvage pathway of sphingolipid metabolism, which may also cause discrepancies in serum ratio.</p><p>There have been great concerns in recent years on co-contamination of AFB<sub>1</sub> and FB<sub>1</sub> in cereal grains and potential health risks of dietary co-exposure to these two mycotoxins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Co-contamination of AFB<sub>1</sub> and FB<sub>1</sub> in dietary components, especially in corn and corn products, has been reported worldwide<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>.

Synergistic interactions on toxicity and co-carcinogenicity were found in various animal models co-exposed to AFB<sub>1</sub> and FB<sub>1</sub>, including in trout, rats, chicks, and mosquito fish<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>. Co-exposure to these two mycotoxins has also been suggested to be linked with the aetiology of acute mycotoxicosis, reproductive and developmental disorders, as well as primary liver cancer and oesophageal cancer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. It has been well known that AFB<sub>1</sub> is potent genotoxic agent, and genetic alterations played important roles in its mode of actions, whereas FB<sub>1</sub> is not genotoxic, and its tumorigenic effect is believed to be mainly via epigenetic mechanisms, including disruptions of apoptosis, cell cycle, and sphingolipids signalling pathways.</p><p>While molecular mechanisms related to the synergistic adverse health outcomes induced by co-exposure are under investigation, several intervention strategies targeting co-exposure to AFB<sub>1</sub> and FB<sub>1</sub> have been devised and studied. Given the source of mycotoxin production, sorting and cleaning up has shown to effectively reducing FB<sub>1</sub> and AFB<sub>1</sub> exposure<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. Alternatively, conjugation of AFB<sub>1</sub> and FB<sub>1</sub> with enterosorbents may prevent absorption, thereby reducing internal dose and toxic effects. Calcium montmorillonite clay in diet was shown to effectively bind to AFB<sub>1</sub>, and to some extent FB<sub>1</sub>, reducing the absorption of both, as well as urinary excretion of the biomarkers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>. Another intervention involves chemically modifying these two mycotoxins in food source via alkaline treatment (nixtamalization), which greatly reduced the amount of AFB<sub>1</sub> and FB<sub>1</sub> in food and significantly reduced toxicity observed<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>. Effectiveness of this strategy in reducing human co-exposure and toxicity is in active investigation.</p><p>By comparison, we previously found chemopreventive effect of GTP in reducing AFB<sub>1</sub> biomarkers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref> in the same population, and this study demonstrated a mitigation of FB<sub>1</sub> exposure via reducing FB<sub>1</sub> biomarkers, rather than by a physical means of intervention. While the direct binding of GTP to AFB<sub>1</sub> and FB<sub>1</sub> seems unlikely, GTP modulated the expression of key enzymes involved in Phase 2 detoxifying enzymes or ceramide synthesis pathway, both of which played significant roles in AFB<sub>1</sub> and FB<sub>1</sub> toxicity and carcinogenicity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>.

As potent antioxidants, GTP may also play a role in maintaining the integrity of cell membrane and preventing lipid oxidation, which may mitigate the toxic effects of FB<sub>1</sub>.</p><p>The toxicokenetics of FB<sub>1</sub> were characterized by low absorption, rapid distribution and elimination, and a lack of phase 1 metabolism in animal models <italic>in vitro</italic> or <italic>in vivo</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. Because of the absence of measurable metabolites, free FB<sub>1</sub> itself was proposed as a biomarker<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. Kinetics study showed that urinary excreted FB<sub>1</sub> consists of average 0.5&#x02013;1% of dietary intake, and would be eliminated from the system rapidly<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. The enteric track plays a major role in limiting FB<sub>1</sub> absorption, as it is the primary entry into bloodstream for both AFB<sub>1</sub> and FB<sub>1</sub>. In cell model, enteric cells are shown to limit FB<sub>1</sub> absorption, in particular, the P-glycoprotein and multidrug resistance associated proteins, which, when inhibited, significantly increases the passage of FB<sub>1</sub> through the cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref>. Co-exposure to AFB<sub>1</sub> and FB<sub>1</sub> may potentially affect the enteric cellular structure, resulting in increased absorption of both AFB<sub>1</sub> and FB<sub>1</sub><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref>. Treatment with GTP, on the other hand, reduces the oxidative effect, allowing preservation of the integrity of enteric barrier, therefore mitigating the exposure to both toxins. Given the potential role of the enteric system involved in absorption and metabolism of AFB<sub>1</sub> and FB<sub>1</sub>, the enteric system can be a potential target for chemopreventive measures, both in terms of structural integrity and the gut micro-environment. GTP can promote the growth and maintenance of gut microbiota<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">59</xref>, potentially modulate the absorption and metabolism of AFB<sub>1</sub> and FB<sub>1</sub>.</p><p>In summary, GTP can effectively mitigate urinary FB<sub>1</sub> biomarkers in a high risk population via several mechanisms as discussed above, and supplement of GTP can potentially be a useful chemopreventive strategy for reducing co-exposure to AFB<sub>1</sub> and FB<sub>1</sub>.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Chemicals</title><p>GTP used for the study was obtained from the US-China joint venture Shili Natural Product Company, Inc.
