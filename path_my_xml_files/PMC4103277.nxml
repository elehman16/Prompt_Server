Subjects with known hypersensitivity to individual ingredients or any other closely related agent from quinolone or retinoid class, those suffering from severe acne requiring systemic drugs for management or any severe concomitant diseases, patients receiving any systemic antibiotics during two weeks prior to study, pregnant women and nursing mothers were excluded from the study.</p><p>This was an 8 week (Sep 2010-May 2011), non-randomized, open-labeled, prospective study conducted at five centers (B J Medical college and Civil Hospital, Asarwa Ahmedabad, Mukhi Skin Clinic Nagpur, Rajiv Gandhi Medical College and Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Hospital, Kalwa, Thane, M. S. Ramaiah Medical College, MSR Nagar, Bangalore, and Lokmanya Tilak Municipal General Hospital and Lokmanya Tilak Municipal Medical College Mumbai) across India. The study consisted of three follow up visits- end of week 2 (Day 14 &#x000b1; 2), end of week 4 (Day 28 &#x000b1; 2), and end of week 8 (Day 56 &#x000b1; 2). All subjects were screened after obtaining a written informed consent for participation in the study. Eligible subjects were asked to apply 1% nadifloxacin and 0.1% adapalene gel (manufactured by Wockhardt Ltd, Aurangabad, Aug 2010, batch no: SSD (546)-03-09, expiry: July 2012) over the affected area of the face once daily in the night after washing face and before going to bed. The drugs were supplied by the investigator. The efficacy parameters were evaluated at each visit. At the end of week-8, the subjects were also investigated for laboratory parameters - complete blood count (CBC), liver profile [Serum Glutamic Oxaloacetic Transaminase (SGOT) and Serum Glutamic Pyruvate Transaminase (SGPT)], and renal profile [Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN)] and serum creatinine.</p><p>The efficacy of the 1% nadifloxacin and 0.1% adapalene gel was evaluated based on the reduction from baseline in the number of non-inflammatory lesions (comedones), reduction in the number of inflammatory lesions (papules, pustules, nodules), reduction in the total number of acne lesions, reduction in the severity of acne as per combined acne severity classification,[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and improvement in global assessment scale of acne toward normal clear skin.</p><p>For this study, 30 subjects were planned to be enrolled at each center to arrive at a sample size of 100 analyzable subjects. Descriptive statistics was used for demographic variables. For total, inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesion counts, Friedman test was used for a comparison from baseline. For the comparison of acne severity scores, global assessment score from baseline to end of week 8, gamma statistics was used. Gamma statistics measures the strength of association of the cross tabulated data (baseline and end of week-8 data in this case) with variables when both are measured at the ordinal level. The laboratory parameters were analyzed using Wilcoxon's signed rank test. Data was analyzed using SPSS analytic software 9.2, (USA, Enterprise Guide version 4.2).</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>Results</title><p>Overall, 119 subjects were enrolled (Ahmedabad-30, Nagpur-30, Bangalore-30, Thane-18, and Mumbai-11) in the present study.

This reduction in the total acne lesions over the entire treatment period correlates well with the simultaneous decrease in the severity of acne. Thus, by the end of 8 weeks, 74% of the patients were in the mild severity acne group with 71.5% of the patients having their score approaching to that of normal healthy skin by the end of week 8. Similarly, progressive reduction in acne severity (69.2%) and physician's global assessment score for acne severity (75.0%) at the end of week 8 was also noted.</p><p>Acne vulgaris is a chronic inflammatory disease with a complex pathogenesis. As multifactorial effects are demanded from acne therapy, combination therapy is often recommended.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] According to recent guidelines regarding acne therapy, oral antibiotics should not be used alone, and combination with a topical retinoid is highly recommended in cases of an inflammatory disease. Topical retinoids target the microcomedones, which are the precursor of acne lesions, and are the preferred drugs for maintenance therapy. Adapalene is a third-generation topical retinoid, which is safe, efficient, well tolerated.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Adapalene is a synthetic naphthoic acid derivative with retinoid activity, and it interacts with unique receptors because of its different chemical structure as compared with other retinoids. This property makes adapalene a potent modulator of cellular differentiation, keratinization, and inflammatory processes.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Several published studies have established the efficacy and safety of nadifloxacin in the management of acne.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] A combination of retinoid and an antibiotic is effective in acne patients as antibiotics can penetrate up to deeper layers of skin given their property of comedonal drainage (which facilitates the penetration of other topical agent) and the thinning effect of retinoids on stratum corneum.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</p><p>Nadifloxacin is a synthetic bactericidal fluoroquinolone with a broad spectrum antibacterial activity against aerobic Gram-positive and Gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria, including <italic>P. acnes</italic> and <italic>S. epidermidis</italic>.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] In recent years, antibiotic-resistant propionibacteria have been isolated with increasing frequency and carriage of resistant strains has been associated with antibiotic treatment failure.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] A systematic review identified 12 studies that investigated the presence of resistant <italic>P. acnes</italic> in the skin of people who had received topical or systemic antibiotics.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Nadifloxacin, by virtue of its proven potent action and tolerability and relative newness, is a newer alternative to clindamycin for the management of acne. A 10-year surveillance study (<italic>n</italic> = 4274) in the UK found that resistance of <italic>P. acnes</italic> to erythromycin and clindamycin increased from 34.5% in 1991 to 55.5% in 2000 (peaking at 64% in 1997).[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] Such high risk of antibiotic resistance necessitates the search for newer potent antibiotics that can be judiciously combined with retinoids to ensure better efficacy.</p><p>Several published studies have established the efficacy and safety of nadifloxacin in the management of acne.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] A comparative analysis of the efficacy and safety of the combination of antibiotic and retinoid (adapalene) with adapalene monotherapy in patients with moderate to severe acne showed that the combination therapy led to a significantly greater reduction in the number of acne lesions after 8 weeks than adapalene monotherapy. The combination therapy improved inflammatory acne earlier than adapalene along with a 40% reduction in the lesions by week 2 with the combination compared to about 19% reduction with adapalene alone.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] Similarly, the results of the present study show 98.2% reduction in the lesions by the end of week 8. In the global assessment score for acne severity, an aggravation in acne severity was observed at week 2 among the patients with score 5. This could be due to the unmasking of underlying micro-comedones caused by adapalene in the combination. Initial flare up of acne is a common observation with retinoids.</p><p>In the present study, only 15 subjects reported 25 AEs, which were mild to moderate in severity. Thus, the results of the current study have demonstrated that once daily use of fixed dose combination of 1% nadifloxacin and 0.1% adapalene gel is a safe and well-tolerated topical treatment for mild to moderate acne.</p><p>In conclusion, the combination of nadifloxacin (1%) and adapalene (0.1%) has been found to be effective in the treatment of mild to moderate acne with good tolerability. However, the lack of a control group and non-comparative design of study limits the utility of these results. We cannot also deny any bias in the study due to its open labeled design. These findings should be considered as preliminary findings and further research is needed in the form of well-designed, adequately powered trials with a control group to understand the efficacy of fixed combination of nadifloxacin (1%) and adapalene (0.1%) treatment in Indian subjects.</p><boxed-text position="float"><p><bold>What is new?</bold></p><p>Though these two products are being used separately in the management of acne, this is the first time that this fixed combination is formulated and evaluated in Indian patients The fixed combination of adapalene (0.1%) and nadifloxacin (1%) could be a safe and effective treatment for mild to moderate acne vulgaris.</p></boxed-text></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgement</title><p>&#x0201c;All authors participated in analysis and interpretation of data and critical revision of the manuscript.
