Didactic lectures by the single disciple are the most common mode of teaching in the majority of the medical colleges in India.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] This method of teaching is not only time-consuming but also have limited focus on clinical skills and interaction with patients and thus are poorly motivating for the students.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Moreover, students do not achieve a comprehensive understanding and loose clinical relevance of the basic sciences at the time of their clinical training due to a significant diversity of interests, resources, and approaches between different departments while teaching different aspects of a particular topic.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Many innovations and trends in medical education have been undertaken globally in the past few years which include self-directed learning, problem-based learning, integrated teaching, and community orientation.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Medical educationists all over the world recognize that integration in medical education is one of the major educational reforms required.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Multidisciplinary integrated teaching ensures that the entire teaching material is covered by every faculty member, regardless of areas of personal expertise and/or research.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] It not only develops creative thinking but also encourages the student to form their own opinions about issues of importance.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>Treating of patients should always have a holistic approach for better results and can be attained by well-trained doctors. As we know for many diseases, an optimal treatment requires targeting different physiologic pathway and pathologies in a concerted synergistic effort.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Integrated teaching is one of the teaching-learning methods which help in correlating the symptoms, signs, and diagnosis. Hence, it is expected that integrated teaching sessions might be an important education strategy in medical education for the students for adequate retention of the knowledge as well as the clinical applicability of the basic sciences. This may improve student's learning abilities for a better understanding of pharmacology and may prove a key factor in the delivery of an effective educational programme in coming times. An integrated curriculum may promote positive working relationship too, as teachers become aware of one another's contributions.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Theoretically, the integrated method of teaching looks superior to the other methods, but we do not have convincing evidence to prove its superiority over the established method like didactic lectures particularly in the teachings related to medicine. It can be worthwhile to compare the integrated teaching with the didactic teaching for knowledge acquisition and skill learning so that evidence can be generated for the future reference.</p><p>The present study was thus designed to compare the integrated teaching methods with conventional teaching sessions on medical undergraduates for comprehensive learning and better retention of knowledge as well as the clinical applicability of basic sciences during their clinical postings.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>The study was carried out in the Department of Pharmacology, on the 2<sup>nd</sup> year MBBS students. Approval from the institutional ethical committee was taken. Two topics, i.e., hypertension (HT) and diabetes mellitus (DM) were selected for the study. Core group including faculty of different departments was constituted to finalize the teaching schedule for integrated teaching (IT) and conventional lecture. Before study, the faculty, as well as students, were sensitized about the integrated teaching sessions. To ensure the complete coverage of the topic without repetition and in the stipulated time, several meeting with faculty members of different discipline engaged in IT session was conducted. The learning objectives of the topics to be covered by each department were discussed. Powerpoint presentation was prepared by each faculty participating in IT session which was compiled as a final single presentation keeping in mind the content as well as the time allocated to each faculty. Multiple choice questions (MCQs) related to the topic and the feedback questionnaires (both for students and faculty) were prepared.</p><p>Written informed consent was taken from the students before each session. To conduct the session, students were divided into two groups. Didactic lectures on HT were delivered to one group. The other group was exposed to multidisciplinary integrated teaching session on HT by faculties of Physiology, Biochemistry, Pathology, Pharmacology and Medicine. For the next integrated session on DM, the groups were swapped; the one which received didactic lectures in earlier session received multidisciplinary integrated teaching session and vice versa. The integrated session on DM was taken by faculty members of Physiology, Biochemistry, Pathology, Pharmacology, Pediatrics, and Endocrinologist.</p><p>To evaluate the performance of students, a posttest was conducted for both groups immediately after the session. Twenty MCQs of single best response type was prepared by the faculty members of the Pharmacology excluding the members participating in the study. This questionnaire was sent to some senior faculties of pharmacology working in other institutions for face and construct validation. MCQs were modified based on the comments sent by these senior faculties. Feedback of the students on a predesigned questionnaire about the various aspects of the learning activity was then obtained on a 5 point Likert scale rating for 12 items and an open-ended question. Feedback from the core group faculty as well as other faculty was also taken on a predesigned questionnaire on a 5 point Likert scale rating for 10 items and an open-ended question.</p><p>Calculation of satisfaction index (SI) of each item of students and faculty feedback questionnaire was done by the following formula:</p><p><inline-graphic xlink:href="IJABMR-7-57-g001.jpg"/></p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Descriptive statistics were reported in the form of mean, standard deviation (SD), median, range, frequency, and percentages.

About 84% of the students agreed that clinical application is well-addressed during integrated teaching and 68% of students expressed a positive feeling about the learning through integrated teaching. About 72% of students believed that knowledge and skills acquired during integrated teaching could help them to perform better in clinical practice. They felt that their doubts were better addressed and cleared in such interactive sessions. A significant proportion of students believed that more topics should be taught with the integrated methodology.

The posttest score obtained in the didactic method of teaching was significantly more than the integrated method. There was no significant difference between two teaching methods on sessions on HT, but the score obtained in a didactic lecture on diabetes was more than that of integrated teaching. The reason for this unexpected high score in didactic teaching method session on DM cannot be explained, and this result is taking the overall results in favor of didactic teaching method. Due to time constraints, only two topics were compared for this study. This might not be adequate to assess the impact of any teaching style. Since the feedback from students as well as the faculty was in support of integrated teaching thus further evaluation with a comparison of more number of sessions is imperative to reach to some concrete conclusion.</p><p>Similar studies are published from different institutions of India and other countries, and it was observed that students and faculty feedback was positive for the integrated teaching as compared to the didactic teaching method, but the improvement of posttest score was not observed in every study.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] In this study, faculty opined that majority of the teaching should be through the integration between different departments. Similar opinions were observed in other studies, shows the acceptability of medical faculty for this method of teaching. The need for initiation of integrated teaching as policy is a demand from various academicians in India and other part of the world. There is a need of structured module based integrated curriculum based on body organ or system which is taught by multidisciplinary faculty. The curriculum and process should be reviewed by the faculties periodically to make changes based on previous experience.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>This study has some limitations. The study was conducted in one specialty of the medical science, i.e., pharmacology and two topics from the whole course were selected. For comparison of teaching methodologies, it is always advisable to use the same method for multiple topics of different specialties. This should be kept in mind before generalizing the findings of this study to other specialties.</p><p>There is a lot of discussion that the integrated teaching method is superior to the conventional teaching method. Through this study, it is concluded that there is not any significant impact on the learning outcomes of students as reflected by posttest scores, but still, students preferred this method of teaching over conventional method in the feedback provided, thus the positive aspects of this teaching method style cannot be completely neglected. This small intervention revealed that though the learning by integrated teaching has potential to improve the knowledge, skills, and comprehensive learning, the students find it exhaustive. We need to put more efforts to make it more interesting and interactive and hence that students should not lose interest during integrated teaching sessions. If the planning and implication of integrated teaching are done properly, it may lead to better learning outcomes. This might be useful to improve their prescription skills and to be a better-qualified health professional.</p><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-6" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>
