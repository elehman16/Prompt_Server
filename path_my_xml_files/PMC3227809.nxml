The stepped-care model has been shown to be associated with consistently superior outcomes compared with usual care, although almost all trials are from high-income countries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup> with the exception of one trial from Chile,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup> and all focused only on depression. The MANAS trial sought to examine how to extend the reach of proven depression treatments to resource-poor primary care settings in two key ways: first, the intervention was designed for delivery by lay health workers; and second, it was designed to be appropriate for the full range of common anxiety and depressive disorders seen in primary care.</p><p id="P13">Earlier, we published the findings of the impact of the intervention on primary mental health outcomes (recovery from ICD-10 common mental disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>) at the primary end-point of 6 months.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup> Those analyses found that there was a modest benefit on these outcomes (risk ratio RR = 1.22, 95% CI 1.00&#x02013;1.47), but also that the benefits were only evident in patients attending public facilities (RR = 1.55, 95% CI 1.02&#x02013;2.35); no impact was found in people attending private facilities (RR = 0.95, 95% CI 0.74&#x02013;1.22). This paper extends those findings and describes the impact of the intervention at three time points over the 12 months following trial enrolment on a wider range of outcomes, including mental health, suicidal behaviour and disability.

Through this process, 22 eligible facilities were identified of which 12 were randomly selected for inclusion in the trial. Details of the process of identification and stratification of facilities are described elsewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup> Facilities were randomly allocated within each stratum to either the intervention or control arm using a 1:1 allocation ratio by the trial statistician (H.W.) using the website <uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="www.randomization.com">www.randomization.com</uri>.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Participants</title><p id="P18">All primary care patients aged over 17 years were screened with the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup> using a cut-off score of 5/6 to identify &#x02018;screen-positive&#x02019; individuals based on psychometric properties evaluated in these settings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup> Eligibility criteria for participation in the trial were: screening positive for common mental disorders; being resident in Goa for the subsequent 12 months; speaking Konkani, Marathi, Hindi or English; not requiring urgent medical attention; and not having difficulty with hearing, speaking or cognition that makes interviewing difficult. If the individual gave written or verbal consent, a structured clinical diagnostic interview (the Revised Clinical Interview Schedule or CIS-R)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> (see below) was administered to provide a baseline assessment of severity and ICD-10 diagnostic categorisation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup> Based on these assessments, trial participants were categorised into four <italic>a priori</italic> groups for analyses: all participants (screen-positive group); the subgroup of those who screened positive who had ICD-10 diagnoses of common mental disorders (ICD-10 diagnosis group); the subgroup of those with ICD-10 common mental disorder diagnoses with the specific diagnosis of depression (depression subgroup); and the subgroup of those who screened positive who did not meet ICD-10 criteria for common mental disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup> (subthreshold subgroup).</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Sample size</title><p id="P19">Sample size estimates have been described in detail previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup> Briefly, we assumed: a coefficient of variation of 0.2; prevalence of ICD-10 common mental disorders of 66% among participants who screened positive; follow-up of 75% at 6 months.

The collaborative approach involves three key team members: the lay health counsellor, the primary care physician and a visiting psychiatrist (clinical specialist). The lay health counsellors had non-healthcare backgrounds and underwent a structured 2-month training course.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup> Each facility team was supported by a psychiatrist who visited about once a month and was also available for consultation on the phone. Each lay health counsellor acted as a case manager for participants who screened positive for common mental disorders and took overall responsibility for delivering all non-drug treatments, in collaboration with the primary care physician and the visiting psychiatrist, with the ultimate goal of a planned discharge upon recovery. Individuals could be discharged either in a planned manner (for example, recovered) or unplanned (for example, did not return despite adherence interventions).</p><p id="P22">There were four components to the intervention. First, all patients were offered psychoeducation, which involved explanation about the nature of the symptoms; the association of common mental disorders with interpersonal difficulties; the need to share emotional symptoms with the doctor and to share personal difficulties with caring family members or other key persons in their social network; strategies for symptom alleviation, for example breathing exercises for anxiety symptoms; the need for adherence to other treatments; and providing information about social/welfare agencies when required. Antidepressants were recommended for moderate or severe common mental disorders and for individuals who did not respond to psychoeducation alone on the basis of routine clinical assessments by the lay health counsellor. In the public facilities, the antidepressant of choice, fluoxetine, was provided free. In the private facilities, doctors could prescribe antidepressants of their choice, which were purchased by patients as usual. Once initiated, antidepressants were recommended for a minimum of 90 days at an adequate dose (for example, at least 20 mg per day of fluoxetine). Physicians were given training over half a day and a manual. Physicians were asked to encourage participants to meet the lay health counsellor, to avoid the use of unnecessary medications and to provide usual care for any coexisting physical health problems. Interpersonal psychotherapy delivered by the lay health counsellor was offered to participants who had moderate or severe common mental disorders, either in addition to antidepressants or as an alternative to antidepressants for those who did not respond to them. Interpersonal psychotherapy was chosen because of it demonstrated effectiveness in another low-income country,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup> and for its focus on interpersonal problems such as grief, disputes and role transitions, which were common themes in the adverse life experiences among individuals with common mental disorders in Goa.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup> A minimum of six sessions were offered. Referral to a visiting psychiatrist was reserved for individuals who were unresponsive to the earlier treatments; were assessed to be at high suicide risk at any stage; had significant comorbidity with alcohol dependence; had associated significant other medical problems; posed diagnostic dilemmas; or for whom the primary care physician requested a consultation.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Control intervention &#x02013; enhanced usual care</title><p id="P23">Physicians in usual care practices received screening results and were given a treatment manual prepared for primary care physicians.

Furthermore, analyses testing for effect modification by type of facility over the 12-month period showed consistent evidence of effect modification for all outcomes except suicide (online Tables DS1 and DS2), confirming our decision to present stratified results in the paper. Intention-to-treat analyses were based on cluster-level summary values for each of the outcomes, the recommended approach for cluster randomised trials with fewer than 15 clusters per arm.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup> The overall common mental disorders prevalence was estimated as the geometric mean of the cluster (facility) prevalences (summing across the three visits) within each arm. For suicide plans/attempts, one cluster had zero outcomes, and so the arithmetic mean of cluster suicide prevalences was estimated. For continuous outcomes, the overall means were estimated as the arithmetic mean of the cluster-level mean scores within each arm. For CIS-R scores, results are presented as the mean score and the mean percentage change in score from baseline.</p><p id="P34">Risk ratios were estimated using data from all follow-up time points (maximum of three) for which there were data. Although missing data at baseline was associated with age and gender, there was no evidence that this was associated with outcomes measured at follow-up, suggesting that the data were missing at random after conditioning on age and gender. Thus, data were not imputed, and analyses excluding missing data but adjusted for age and gender should be unbiased. Risk ratio estimation also assumed a constant effect during follow-up. To test this assumption, we used an extension of the method of Cheung <italic>et al</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup> to test evidence for a linear trend in intervention effect over time, and also tested for effect modification between the effect at 2 and 12 months respectively to assess whether the effect waned over time.</p><p id="P35">All intervention&#x02013;control comparisons were adjusted for: the imbalance between arms of case type at baseline (depression, anxiety, subthreshold symptoms); age and gender, since the probability of missing data was associated with these at baseline; and within-individual correlation between visits. For binary outcomes, adjustment was done by calculating the expected number of cases at each time point in each cluster using generalised estimating equation logistic regression, adjusting for strata, case type, age and gender and within-individual correlation between visits. The total expected number of cases over the three visits in each cluster was then compared with the total observed number, and expressed as a ratio of total observed/total expected. The adjusted risk ratio (RR) was obtained as the ratio of the geometric mean of the cluster total observed/total expected ratios in the intervention arm compared with the geometric mean of the cluster ratios in the control arm. An approximate variance for the log risk ratio in each arm was obtained from the residual mean square from a two-way analysis of variance of cluster log (total observed/total expected) on stratum and study arm. A 95% confidence interval for the risk ratio was calculated from this variance using a stratified <italic>t</italic>-statistic.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup> For the continuous outcomes, the analogous analysis was carried out using linear regression.

The trial population was predominantly female (82%), with a mean age of 46.3 years (s.d. = 13.3). Of the 2242 (81%) with an ICD-10 diagnosis at baseline (ICD-10 diagnosis group), 774 (35%) had depression, including comorbid anxiety disorders (depression subgroup). The most common diagnosis was mixed anxiety&#x02013;depressive disorder (<italic>n</italic> = 1032; 46% of all those with common mental disorders); the remaining 436 (19%) had a &#x02018;pure&#x02019; anxiety disorder.

The proportions completing the outcome assessment were were 89% at month 2, 87% at month 6 and 85% at month 12. Overall, 2181 (78%) of all screen-positive participants were seen at all three follow-up visits.

The intervention also showed benefits in reduction in the risk of suicidal behaviours (plans or attempts) and disability days (days of no work or reduced work) and weaker effects on overall disability scores in these participants. Although some benefit was noted in reduction in the prevalence of ICD-10 common mental disorders, psychological morbidity scores and disability days in those in the subthreshold subgroup, in general these were of a smaller magnitude and weaker statistical significance. Moreover, no impact was observed on any outcome, apart from a non-significant reduction in the risk of suicidal behaviours, for any diagnostic group in participants attending private primary healthcare facilities.</p><p id="P44">The findings in this paper extend in three important ways the findings of the 6-month primary end-point analyses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup> that the intervention improved the mental health outcomes of people with common mental disorders, and that these benefits are only evident in public primary care attendees. First, they show substantial benefits sustained across the 12-month follow-up period on both clinical outcomes in individuals attending public healthcare facilities. Second, they demonstrate an overall benefit for the diagnostic subgroup of individuals with depression in these longitudinal analyses. Third, they demonstrate the impact of the intervention on suicidal behaviour and disability outcomes, both of which are important health outcomes in their own right. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first trial from a low- and middle-income country demonstrating the impact of interventions for a mental disorder on suicidal behaviours, a major public health priority in these countries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup> The apparently larger absolute effects of the intervention in the short-term are in line with other trials for the treatment of common mental disorders,

including those in this study setting,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup> although the difference in effect over time was not statistically significant in our study.</p><p id="P47">Process indicators for the intervention up to 6 months, which marked the maximum intervention period, were published earlier;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup> they showed excellent uptake of the low-intensity psychoeducation component, moderate uptake of the antidepressant component and low uptake of the more intensive interpersonal psychotherapy component. It may be argued that more intensive and longer treatments, such as aggressive pharmacotherapy and structured psychological treatments, could further increase the size and durability of the effect of the intervention.</p><p id="P48">The large difference in effect by facility type (public or private) may be attributed to at least two key factors: first, that the great difficulty we had in enroling GPs from private facilities meant that those who did participate were a non-representative, highly motivated group of practitioners committed to care for common mental disorders. Second, it is possible that the &#x02018;personalised client-centred&#x02019; care that characterises such private practices<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup> cancelled out the added value of the lay health counsellor in the intervention. Preliminary findings from in-depth interviews with the participating practitioners supports the latter possibility. It is notable that our intervention was able to lead to outcomes in public facility attendees that were at least as good as those observed in private facility patients.</p></sec><sec id="S19"><title>Implications</title><p id="P49">The MANAS trial is the largest such trial in psychiatry from a low- and middle-income country. Apart from the limited coverage of the high-intensity psychological treatment component of the intervention, the trial was able to achieve all its <italic>a priori</italic> recruitment, intervention and follow-up targets. Based on our findings, we recommend the extension of the MANAS model to public primary healthcare facilities in India. Future research should focus on promoting the development and evaluation of culturally appropriate, affordable and acceptable psychological treatments, and more aggressive and longer-term management in those individuals whose condition is refractory.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S20"><title>Funding</title><p id="P50">The MANAS Project is entirely funded by a <funding-source>Wellcome Trust Senior Research Fellowship in Clinical Science</funding-source> to V.P.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1" fn-type="conflict"><p id="P51"><bold>Declaration of interest</bold></p><p id="P52">None.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><p id="P53">We are grateful to the members of the Trial Steering and Data Monitoring &#x00026; Ethics Committees for their inputs, which led to the final protocol described in this paper.
