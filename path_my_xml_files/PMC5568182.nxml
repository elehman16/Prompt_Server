</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Background</title><p id="Par10">Within Europe, almost half of working age adults are failing to meet physical activity (PA) guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Modifiable inactive behaviours are associated with non-communicable diseases (e.g. coronary heart disease and type-2 diabetes) and the prevalence of premature mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. An inactive workplace has been linked with diminished organisational health outcomes, increased sickness absence, reduced productivity and workplace engagement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Workplace PA interventions can positively influence employee and organisational health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Exercise/gym classes, walking, active-transport, educational training, active work stations and activity challenges have been utilised in the workplace with varying degrees of effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. However, research to date is yet to comprehensively examine the efficacy of sport and team sport on health outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Indeed, a further critique of workplace PA literature has been the failure to assess the efficacy of participation against social group and organisational health outcomes (e.g. communication, team performance, job satisfaction) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par11">Participation in workplace team sport has the capacity to improve individual, social group and organisational health outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Several randomised control trial (RCT) and quasi-experimental studies demonstrate that participation in competitive or non-competitive team sports can significantly improve cardiorespiratory fitness, musculoskeletal function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and psychological wellbeing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. These factors have the capacity to contribute to the reduced prevalence of non-communicable diseases associated with sickness absence, diminished productivity and all-cost mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Qualitative studies suggest participation in team sports may also improve workplace relationships, communication and team cohesion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par12">Improvements in individual health and social group outcomes are known to contribute to the function of the organisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. However, perhaps due to a limited level of funding and expertise, and the non-clinical community setting (i.e. the workplace), the research examining participation in team sport has been limited by the reliance on qualitative methods (e.g. focus groups and individual interviews) and interventions that lack strong theoretical underpinnings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Researchers are yet to examine the impact of participation in workplace team sport on social group health outcomes (e.g. cohesion, communication, interpersonal relationships) with validated measures. Furthermore, the type of sport played is reported in most manuscripts but not the intensity it is played at, or the duration, volume and frequency of participation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. This challenges researchers in determining what &#x02018;dose&#x02019; of team sport equals the benefits reported in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par13">Participation in team sport is challenged by social comparisons with colleagues and superiors, the organisational culture and the facilities available within the workplace [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], and psychological barriers relating to autonomy, competence and relatedness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Self-determination theory (SDT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] suggests supporting people&#x02019;s innate needs for autonomy (i.e. feeling free and fully volitional to engage in team sport), competence (i.e. feeling capable to complete a skill in team sport) and relatedness (i.e. feeling supported, understood and valued by a social group) through the provision of an activity (e.g. team sport) may promote wellbeing and autonomous motivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Good evidence indicates supporting basic needs is an effective behaviour change strategy within a workplace, sports and exercise setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. For these reasons, workplace team sport interventions should be underpinned by behaviour change theories with a focus on the social environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p id="Par14">This study evaluated the impact of a workplace team sport intervention (i.e. &#x02018;Changing the Game&#x02019;; CTG) underpinned by SDT. The primary intention of this study was to examine the impact of CTG on aerobic fitness (estimated VO<sub>2</sub> max). Secondary intentions were to investigate participation in CTG&#x02019;s impact on individual, social group and organisational health outcomes. These included subjective vitality, leisure-time PA, quality of life, occupational stress and fatigue, group cohesion, relationships with superiors and colleagues, communication, job satisfaction, individual and team job performance, and work engagement.</p><p id="Par15">The intervention study was evaluated using a process evaluation underpinned by the RE-AIM approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. This was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention approach and its theoretical underpinning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and will be reported elsewhere (i.e. findings due for publication in late 2017<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn1">1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Design</title><p id="Par17">The intervention was a 12-week non-randomised study (quasi-experimental design), which comprised two regional worksites from the same large service organisation (located an estimated 130&#x000a0;km apart). One worksite was assigned to the CTG (intervention group), while the other continued with normal working conditions (control group). Non-randomised intervention designs in health promotion are frequently adopted where feasibility and practicality issues challenge implementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In the current study, access to a local sport facility determined the intervention site.

</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Intervention</title><p id="Par18">CTG consisted of 12 weekly 1-h lunchtime moderate-intensity team sport sessions in an indoor sports hall (30&#x000a0;m&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;18&#x000a0;m) located 400&#x000a0;m from the participating organisation. The sessions were funded by the researchers&#x02019; university and consisted of rounders (weeks 1 and 7), netball (weeks 2 and 8), basketball (weeks 3 and 9), soccer (weeks 4 and 10), cricket (weeks 5 and 11) and handball (weeks 6 and 12). The sessions included a 10-min warm-up and familiarisation period, and a 40-min game (breaks given when requested by participants). The sports were chosen by the research team due to their moderate-intensity, transferability of skills and adaptability. Evidence suggests sports with transferable skills may support the needs for competence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The sessions were delivered by two female workplace champions trained by the first author in the basic rules of each sport and in supporting basic needs for autonomy, competence and relatedness in their sports participation (training information available on request from the corresponding author). Prior to the intervention participants were invited to take part in a taster session to help minimise perceptions of negative competence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Throughout the CTG sessions, participants were encouraged to place an emphasis on having fun, to reflect on their individual and team skills development and social growth rather than competition and performance. Workplace champions discussed the potential benefits of participating in team sport with the participants who were able to opt out of any stage of the team sport sessions. Participants were given the opportunity to take ownership and alter any rule, skill or tradition associated with the sports as a team. This supportive leadership style can promote autonomous motivation and adherence to participation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Adaptations made to the rules of each sport (e.g. removing double dribbles in basketball) has the capacity to support a participant&#x02019;s need for competence, provide self-efficacy and promote the adoption of more autonomous forms of motivation (i.e. identified, integrated and intrinsic regulation) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Needs for relatedness refer to the development and maintenance of interpersonal relationships with individuals (e.g. colleagues) and within workplace teams or groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Relatedness may have been fostered through the social support, group identity and cohesion of colleagues and superiors playing team sports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Participants</title><p id="Par19">A services organisation listed on the Financial Times and London Stock Exchange (FTSE) 100 located in the UK participated in this study. This organisation has a global workforce of 7048 employees (5080 operate in UK), across multiple worksites with employees in predominately office-based roles. This organisation was selected based on its size and structure and was recruited by email. A consultation group of employees, managers, workplace champions and employer representatives guided the intervention through a participatory approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The role of the consultation group was to advise on challenges specific to the participating organisation and discuss the implementation, delivery and evaluation of the programme within their organisation. Regular meetings were conducted with this working group throughout the intervention period.</p><p id="Par20">Criterion-based sampling based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria was adopted.</p><p id="Par21">Participants were recruited between May and June 2016, within the organisation through email, social media notifications and posters that outlined the purpose of the study. To ensure participants were motivated to participate, employees in both the intervention and control groups were recruited under the assumption they may be receiving team sport through their workplace. The intervention group was selected by access to a sports hall. More specifically, the intervention group was selected by its proximity to a sports hall, while the control group was selected from an isolated worksite. The control group did not have regular interactions with the intervention worksite. Employees interested in participating were sent an electronic or paper copy of the information sheet and informed consent form. Informed consent was obtained from all individual participants included in the study. Participants were screened and excluded from participation if they were under 18&#x000a0;years of age, were sub-contracted by another organisation, were contracted to work less than 3&#x000a0;days-a-week, had planned absences during the intervention period or were unable to provide informed consent.

To our knowledge, this intervention study represents the first attempt to examine the impact of a multi-team sport programme within a workplace setting on multiple indicators of health.</p><p id="Par30">A 10.32% increase in VO<sub>2</sub> max was observed in the intervention group. Other intervention studies examining the impact of workplace soccer on aerobic fitness have observed improvements of 5% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Improvements in VO<sub>2</sub> max are attributable to the prolonged exposure to high-intensity PA (HIPA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. HIPA improves cardiac output and skeletal muscle oxidation and capillarisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Decreased VO<sub>2</sub> max (&#x02212;&#x02009;1.75%) in the control group may be explained by the sedentary job roles performed by these employees [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. A previous review of research with intervention designs suggests sedentary behaviour has a detrimental impact on cardiac output [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par31">Team sport may have a protective effect on BMI. Increases in the control group&#x02019;s BMI (3.5%) may be attributable to the increased plasma glucose, triglycerides, lipoprotein and waist circumference associated with sedentary job roles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Increases in energy expenditure in the intervention group may have caused participants to compensate by increasing nutritional intake and therefore BMI (.54%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. This finding should be treated with caution given the absence of an RCT design, biomarkers, DEXA scans, skinfolds and nutritional intake. Adopting these measures may draw firmer conclusions.</p><p id="Par32">Non-randomised (quasi-experimental) designs are however robust [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. An RCT design may have been unethical, unfeasible or unrealistic to promote health within this workplace setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Likewise, quasi-experimental designs are effective at evaluating the efficacy of interventions and may be preferred due to feasibility, and the practical challenges of conducting a controlled design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p id="Par33">CTG did improve interpersonal communication within teams over time (3% in intervention group). This finding provides the first empirical support for several qualitative studies exploring the benefits of participation in workplace team sport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Improvements in communication may be explained by the time employees spent together participating in an activity of common interest with shared goals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Qualitative evidence indicates employees learn more about their colleagues&#x02019; communication style in a non-work environment with shared goals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par34">The employees in this study did not exclusively participate with their day-to-day colleagues, and therefore, the effect on working relationships, cohesion and team productivity may have been confounded. Future investigations examining workplace team sport may consider re-examining social group outcomes with a cluster RCT design whereby individual work teams are clustered into study arms. Although markers of individual health outcomes (e.g. psychological wellbeing) and organisational health outcomes (e.g. job satisfaction, productivity, work-engagement) did not significantly improve following participation, it would be unwise to suggest that team sport does not influence individual and organisational health. Rather, post hoc power analysis using G*Power [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] revealed most secondary outcome measures were unpowered (apart from quality of life) and unable to detect a significant interaction. Quality of life has shown to be a subjective state, and therefore, our findings may have been confounded by factors internal (e.g. salary, working practises) and external (e.g. personal relationships, lifestyle choices) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] to the intervention. It may be of interest to researchers to re-examine markers of individual and organisational health with adequately powered outcome measures through day level (i.e. directly pre-post team sport) and over the long term (e.g. 6&#x000a0;months, 12&#x000a0;months).</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Limitations</title><p id="Par35">The participants in this study represent a one large private services organisation. To prevent contamination, care was taken to select two isolated regional worksites. The groups did however differ in gender and average working hours at T<sup>0</sup>. Therefore, the study groups may not have been counterfactual. Given the absence of a RCT design and these differences between the groups, the results may have been confounded and caution should be applied when interpreting these findings. Although CTG was successful at recruiting female participants, only 29% of the intervention group were female. While this figure is proportionate to the number of females who work in the organisation (30% reported in 2016 annual report), researchers still may wish to understand why less female employees participate in team sport with their colleagues. Likewise, 89% of intervention group and 85% of control group participants reported meeting PA guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. This figure is higher than the national average for working-age adults (67% of males, 55% of females). This may suggest workplace team sport attracts primarily active employees, rather inactive employees at risk of non-communicable illnesses and diseases. Future research may consider investigating the impact of workplace team sport with inactive employees.</p><p id="Par36">A further limitation is the low number of employees initially recruited into a fully funded study from a large organisation. The current study&#x02019;s process evaluation indicates recruitment over a 1-month period and ineffective communication strategy reduced the reach of the programme (process evaluation due for publication in 2017<sup>1</sup>). Intrapersonal, interpersonal, organisational and environmental factors may have facilitated participation or created obstacles for attendance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Consistent with previous qualitative research, workplace demands, culture and practises challenged the consistent participation of employees [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Future research should continue to account for these factors using a participatory approach to implementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p id="Par37">PA behaviour may be influenced by team sport participation over time. While the IPAQ and self-reported diary provide adequate psychometric properties, future research measuring PA would benefit from the addition of objective measures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. To maintain self-efficacy and competence, the current study avoided examination of sport intensity with heart rate monitors. While logical, this is a limitation of the study. Further, research may consider measuring intensity with heart rate monitors or perceived exertion (RPE) (e.g. the Borg Scale). Finally, data representing communication and occupational fatigue was not normally distributed and should be treated with caution. Future research may consider readdressing team sports impact on these outcomes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par38">The current study examined the impact of a 12-week workplace team sport intervention on individual, social group and organisational health outcomes. Results indicate workplace team sport can improve aerobic fitness, PA behaviour and interpersonal communication within teams. These results suggest team sport may be an effective and viable form of health promotion within a workplace setting. Promoting forms of PA such as team sport within workplace settings is required to meet UK public health guidelines and reduce the financial and societal burden faced as attributable to an inactive population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Therefore, it remains important to continue to understand why employees choose to participate in team sport and promote programmes which encourage participation. The current study suggests this may be achieved by promoting team sports which are supportive of autonomy, competence and relatedness. Researchers should consider testing the efficacy of a multi-team sport programme within a workplace setting over the long term with cluster RCT designs (i.e. randomise on workplace team level) and further objective measures of health (e.g. objective measures of physical activity, skinfold, DEXA scans, sickness absence).</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="Fn1"><label>1</label><p id="Par16">The process evaluation referenced in this article is due for publication in 2017.
