The mean prevalence of <italic>H. pylori</italic> in peptic ulcer disease patients is found to be as high as 80%&#x02013;90%, especially in developing countries like India. Several studies have shown that the eradication of <italic>H. pylori</italic> decreases the recurrence of ulcer in patients with peptic ulcer disease.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>Standard triple therapy (STT)[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] which includes proton pump inhibitor (PPI), clarithromycin, and amoxicillin or metronidazole is the commonly used regimen for <italic>H. pylori</italic> eradication.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] However, lower eradication rate with the STT has become a matter of concern. Graham and Fischbach analyzed the published results of STT and found that only 18% of them could achieve the eradication of more than 85%.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] With the emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains, there is a need for newer regimens to achieve higher eradication rates.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>Sequential therapy (ST)[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and hybrid therapy (HT) are used as an alternative to STT and have shown promising results in previous studies. A study done earlier in the present institute showed higher eradication of <italic>H. pylori</italic> by the use of ST than that of STT, but the difference was not statistically significant.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] At present, STT is the standard of care for the treatment of <italic>H. pylori</italic> in the present hospital, and the eradication rate was found to be 81.25%. A study conducted in Iran showed that HT is more effective in <italic>H. pylori</italic> eradication (89.5% vs. 76.7%) when compared with ST, in patients suffering from peptic ulcer disease.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Hsu <italic>et al</italic>. in their recent study showed <italic>H. pylori</italic> eradication rate of 99.1% with HT.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>The factors that affect the outcome of ST resulting in lower eradication rates than expected could be varied dose, duration, etc., which were chosen empirically for this regimen.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] The possible explanation for better eradication of HT may be due to longer duration of treatment, sequential administration of drugs, and amoxicillin causing lysis of bacterial cell wall which helps in the diffusion of macrolides into the cell, thereby enhancing the efficacy of clarithromycin in the second phase of treatment.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Some studies have demonstrated that the eradication rates of ST might improve by increasing the duration and by modifying the drug schedule.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] However, there is only limited data available to substantiate the superiority of HT in comparison to other regimens in achieving target eradication rate for <italic>H. pylori</italic>.

The study was approved by the ethics committee of the institute and has been performed in accordance with the ethical standards laid down in an appropriate version of the Declaration of Helsinki (as revised in Brazil 2013). The study has been registered in the Clinical Trial Registry (URL &#x02013; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ctri.nic.in/Clinicaltrials/login.php">http://ctri.nic.in/Clinicaltrials/login.php</ext-link>) with the registration no-CTRI/2016/04/006881.</p><p>All consecutive patients attending the department of surgery with peptic ulcer disease or gastritis who were positive for <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection were included in the study. The details of the patients and the findings were recorded. Assessment of eradication of <italic>H. pylori</italic> was carried out at the end of 6 weeks following the completion of therapy. Completion of therapy included the duration of administration of ST or HT followed by the course of PPI for ulcer healing.</p><p>Patients who had received any form of <italic>H. pylori</italic> eradication therapy in the past, those with associated findings in endoscopy such as malignancy, portal hypertensive gastropathy, etc., and with gastric ulcers confirmed to be malignant by endoscopic biopsy were excluded from the study.</p><p>The study was designed as a prospective, open-labeled, parallel arm, randomized controlled trial (RCT). Block randomization was carried out using a computer program with randomly selected block sizes of four and six. Allocation concealment was ensured by serially numbered opaque-sealed envelope (SNOSE) technique.</p><p>All patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (UGIE), after obtaining written informed consent. The procedure (UGIE) was well tolerated by the study population. No procedure-related complications and withdrawal of consent due to inconvenience caused by the study procedure has been encountered during the study period. Two percent lignocaine viscous or spray was used as a local anesthetic, allowing a contact time of 5 min. Gastric ulcer or duodenal ulcer on endoscopy was defined as a breach in the continuity of mucosa of the size of 5 mm or more with an apparent depth. Gastritis was diagnosed on endoscopy as localized redness or beefy red mucosa in the stomach without the presence of any gastric or duodenal ulcer disease. For the diagnosis of <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection, urease test, histology by Giemsa stain, and stool antigen test (SAT) for <italic>H. pylori</italic> were used. Although urea breath test is a noninvasive and safe method for the diagnosis of <italic>H. pylori</italic>, the kit is not available in the present institute, hence, it was not used in the study. Two biopsy samples from pyloric antrum and corpus each were taken for urease test and histology by Giemsa stain. A positive <italic>H. pylori</italic> state was defined if one, two, or all the three tests were positive for <italic>H. pylori</italic>. A negative <italic>H. pylori</italic> test was defined if all the three tests were negative. The study participants and the principal investigator were aware about the treatment given. However, the consultants who performed endoscopy and the consultants who evaluated the biopsy samples were unaware of the treatment given.</p><p>Urease test[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] was done using a solution earlier standardized in the present institute,[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and positive urease test for <italic>H. pylori</italic> was defined as the change of the color of the solution from yellow to pink.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>SAT is done by an enzyme immunoassay or immunochromatographic assay. It detects <italic>H. pylori</italic> antigen in stool sample with the use of monoclonal or polyclonal anti-<italic>H. pylori</italic> antibody. Monoclonal SAT is superior to polyclonal in the initial diagnosis and eradication of <italic>H. pylori</italic> after treatment.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] The sensitivity and specificity of SAT in predicting <italic>H. pylori</italic> are 59.4% and 72.6%, respectively.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Although the sensitivity is low, it can be used in low-resource settings, relatively younger patients (below 45 years) with no signs of complications. Each patient was asked to collect freshly passed stool sample in a sterile, wide-mouthed, screw-capped, leak proof, vial that was already labeled with the patient's name, hospital number, and date of collection, and SAT was performed as per standard instructions.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>Patients with <italic>H. pylori</italic> positivity were randomized into two groups using the SNOSE technique. One group received HT while the other group received ST. The HT comprised omeprazole 20 mg bid, amoxicillin 1 g bid for 7 days followed by omeprazole 20 mg bid, metronidazole 400 mg tid, amoxicillin 1 g bid, and clarithromycin 500 mg bid for the next 7 days. The ST comprised omeprazole 20 mg bid, amoxicillin 1 g bid for 5 days followed by omeprazole 20 mg bid, clarithromycin 500 mg bid, and metronidazole 400 mg tid for the next 5 days. In all peptic ulcer disease patients, PPI was continued for 4 weeks for ulcer healing.</p><p>Follow-up endoscopy was done after 6 weeks of completion of complete therapy to confirm ulcer healing and <italic>H. pylori</italic> eradication. For eradication, two biopsy samples were taken each from the corpus and the antrum of the stomach for the two tests. Eradication was defined as negative urease test or histology for <italic>H. pylori</italic>. Any one or both tests when positive were considered positive <italic>H. pylori</italic> status. If peptic ulcer was present at 6-week follow-up or, if the patient was positive for <italic>H. pylori</italic>, the patient was considered for rescue therapy for <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection. The rescue therapy consisted of 10-day course of levofloxacin (500 mg bid), amoxicillin (1 g bid), and omeprazole (20 mg bid). If the patient was negative for <italic>H. pylori</italic> on follow-up endoscopy, appropriate anti-secretory therapy measures were carried out. The medication was given to the patient by the principal investigator after verifying the availability of the drugs for completing the course. At the end of drug therapy, the telephonic conversation was established with the patient to access the compliance. The reason for noncompliance if any also was documented. The most common reason for noncompliance in both the groups was intolerability to drug therapy due to metallic taste. The cost of drug therapy was calculated per course by adding individual cost of the drug included in each regimen which was provided from the hospital.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The sample size was calculated using OpenEPI software.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Considering the detection of eradication rate more than 15% between the two regimens on two-tail basis with 95% confidence interval (CI) and power of the study &#x0003e;80% and expected dropout rate of 10%, the sample size was calculated to be 64 in each group. <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>R<sc>ESULTS</sc></title><p>In the present study, out of 194 patients present for initial endoscopy, 120 patients were <italic>H. pylori</italic> positive (61.85%) [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>].</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>CONSORT flowchart</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JPP-8-62-g001"/></fig><p>Mean age in HT and ST groups was 39.90 &#x000b1; 10.715 and 40.80 &#x000b1; 12.977 years, respectively.

Resistance develops partly due to irrational antibiotic use and in part by increased virulence of the microorganism. <italic>H. pylori</italic> not being an exception has shown an increasing resistance not only for monomicrobial therapy but also for dual therapy in the past two decades. To overcome this shortfall, combinations of antibiotics have been introduced with each targeting a particular function to eradicate the pathogen. Undesirably, resistance to the commonly used STT by <italic>H. pylori</italic> has also been shown to be increasing by many studies from the various regions. ST and concomitant therapy with four drugs were introduced in the recent years to overcome the unacceptable eradication rate by STT.</p><p>Jafri <italic>et al</italic>. in their meta-analysis have proved that ST has superior eradication rate compared to STT.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Although ST achieves higher eradication than STT, the target eradication rate has not been demonstrated by other studies. Recently, a novel concept with HT has been shown to have promising results by few trials. However, the superiority of the HT over ST in achieving target eradication rate needs to be evaluated. The present study has tried to assess the efficacy of HT in achieving the target eradication rate and compared the eradication rate with that of the ST.</p><p>The prevalence of <italic>H. pylori</italic> varies with different geographical locations, with high infection rates in the population living in developing countries, in India being over 80% in rural areas.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] The <italic>H. pylori</italic> positivity in the present study population was 61.85%. Majority of the study population was young, being &#x0003c; 40 years. The mean age of the patients did not differ significantly between HT and ST groups. More than half the patients in both groups were females; however, the gender distribution did not show any significant difference.</p><p>In the present study, ST group had <italic>H. pylori</italic> eradication rate of 73.3% and 81.5% by ITT and PP analysis, respectively. A better eradication rate was shown by Eisig <italic>et al</italic>. where the rate was 86% and 89.6% by ITT and PP analysis, respectively.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] A study from Taiwan also demonstrated a higher eradication of 92.3% by ITT and 93.1% by PP analysis with ST.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] A meta-analysis consisting of ten RCTs with 3006 enrolled patients showed superior eradication rate with ST compared to STT (with an odds ratio of 2.99 [95% CI 2.47&#x02013;3.62] resulting a number need to treat of 6 [95% CI 5&#x02013;7]).[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] The present study achieved a lower eradication rate that may be attributed to the increasing antibiotic resistance of the population.

In the present study, eradication of <italic>H. pylori</italic> depends on the completion of full course of HT or ST. Hence, the cost of therapy was calculated which could possibly play an important role in the implementation of treatment for <italic>H. pylori</italic> eradication. The price of a complete course of HT was $10.77 whereas it was half the cost ($6.347) for ST, indicating ST to be economically better than HT. Increased total duration of therapy in the HT group, i.e. 14-day course with the addition of amoxicillin in the second phase of 7 days compared to that of 10-day course with less number of drugs in ST justifies the higher cost for the HT course in the present study.
