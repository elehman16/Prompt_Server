A statement from the European Patient Safety Foundation (EuPSF), the European Resuscitation Council (ERC), the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) and the World Federation of Societies of Anaesthesiologists (WFSA), approved by the WHO, recommends that all schoolchildren receive CPR training every year from the age of 12.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> If all students receive practical CPR training in school, a large proportion of the population will have basic skills within a few decades. Such a situation could potentially increase CPR intervention of bystanders in OHCA and have a significant impact on public health.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7&#x02013;12</xref></p><p>Brief DVD-based courses are successful in teaching CPR skills.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12&#x02013;16</xref> How short and simplified the training can be without negatively affecting students&#x02019; skills and their willingness to act is, however, largely unknown.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> There are plenty of different mobile applications (app) intended to spread how to perform CPR. An app is easily accessible and the format might appeal to young people. The aim of this study was to evaluate alternative CPR training methods by comparing the practical CPR skills and the willingness to act in 13-year-old students, directly after a 30&#x02005;min app-based or a 50&#x02005;min DVD-based training session, and at 6&#x02005;months of follow-up.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study population and design</title><p>In accordance with the Swedish school curriculum,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> the intervention was applied in grade 7 (13-year-old students). Invitations to participate in the study were sent to the headmasters of all council schools in two municipalities (140&#x02005;000 inhabitants). Eighteen of 24 schools agreed to participate. Four schools did not respond and two had CPR education only for grade 9. Prior to the study, students and their guardians obtained a letter with study information.

In addition to the main intervention, some classes were randomised to various additional interventions, which were equally distributed in both groups. Ten classes were randomly assigned to perform a practical test only at 6&#x02005;months. Thus, more students participated at the 6-month retest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2015010717F1">figure 1</xref>).

Ten teachers were previous CPR instructors and 19 teachers received a 5&#x02005;h education to become CPR instructors. All teachers obtained individual oral and written information to ensure that they were up to date with present CPR guidelines and training. The teachers acted as facilitators; they introduced the lesson, gave advice on the fly, answered questions and completed the course. For the app-based method, the students practised independently by using eight images with related text in a mobile application; introduction, checks responsiveness, opens the airway, checks respiration, alarm, chest compressions, ventilations and CPR 30:2.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> For the DVD-based method, the whole class practised CPR and recovery position together, based on instructions from a 31&#x02005;min DVD.

The participants&#x02019; actions regarding check responsiveness, check respiration and call for help were assessed by direct observation of the investigator (AN).

The optimal conduct was 30s to check responsiveness, check respiration and call for help, followed by 2.5&#x02005;min of CPR. During the CPR, participants were expected to perform at least five cycles of 30 compressions and two ventilations. The tests were conducted at the schools with one student at a time. The student was introduced to the test by the following story: &#x02018;You see an adult, someone you know, who collapsed in front of you. There is no one more on site. Show how you would act in a real life situation&#x02019;. During the test, the test leader answered questions about the victim&#x02019;s condition only if relevant actions had already been carried out. Directly after the practical test, students received individual constructive feedback from the investigator for 2&#x02005;min. The students then answered a fixed-response questionnaire, where questions were asked about background factors and willingness to act. A majority of students responded to the survey online and each question had to be answered in order to proceed to the next. Two of the questions allowed the student to add their own comments. Prior to our study, the comprehension of the questionnaire was tested and found satisfactory in a separate cohort of 175 students.

Fear to do harm (8% in the DVD group and 7% in the app group) and fear of touching a stranger (6% in the DVD group and 5% in the app group) are the two most common reasons for not wanting to perform chest compressions.

First, a 50&#x02005;min DVD-based training method was superior to a 30&#x02005;min app-based education in terms of teaching practical CPR skills to seventh grade students. Second, there was no significant difference in willingness to act between the app and DVD groups. The study was carried out in schools from all socioeconomic areas and included 86% of eligible students, strengthening the generalisability of our findings.</p><p>The total score of the modified Cardiff test differed significantly by 2&#x02013;3 points between the app and DVD groups on both occasions. The importance of this difference is unclear, since the size of a clinically relevant difference has yet to be established. The largest differences in favour of the DVD-based method were found for the following components: check responsiveness by talking, open airway, compression/ventilation ratio and ventilation. Three of these variables can be related; if students fail to create an open airway, they will fail with the ventilations, which result in the students making repeated attempts and thus losing the correct compression/ventilation ratio. Indeed, several studies have shown that a large proportion of participants after CPR training have limited knowledge on how to correctly perform a rescue breath.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>

<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></p><p>The cause of the differences observed between the app and DVD groups in this study is unknown. This study was not designed to explain the cause of any potential differences. In both methods, the students trained individually on a MiniAnne manikin and the training did not include any planned interaction or cooperation with classmates. In the DVD-based method, all students practised the same task at the same time. It gave quantity of training and the teachers received an overview of the training and could easily see if a student did not follow the instructions. In the app-based method, the students could choose individually how many times they repeated the practical exercises. That makes it more difficult for the teacher to get an overview of the training and it is unclear if the students took responsibility and repeated the exercises until they felt they had mastered each part. The moving instructions of the DVD in combination with repeated training might be considered a strength of the DVD-based method. An advantage with the app method is that it can provide support in acute situations, and the app is also available after training has been completed, with the opportunity to repeat and to share with others. The DVD method has been applied for several years and has been revised and developed repeatedly. The app method is new and may need further development, for example, by specifying the number of repetitions to be performed during training. A weakness with both the app and the DVD methods is that no systematic and individual feedback was given to the students during training. The training was given to the entire class at the same time, to easily fit into the school schedule, but at the expense of limited opportunity to give feedback. Feedback is known to be one of the most powerful influences on performance.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>
<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> The issue of feedback is essential and should be explored in future research.</p><p>In our study, practical CPR skills were significantly reduced from measurement directly after training to 6&#x02005;months in both groups, which is similar to other studies.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> In evaluating the CPR skills of the participants, we consider the results of the 6&#x02005;months test to be of most importance, since these results reflect the long-term knowledge of the students. At 6&#x02005;months, the DVD group obtained 58% (33 points) and the app group 53% (31 points) of the maximum score, which is comparable with results of previous studies where seventh grade students performed 50% and adults 57&#x02013;61% of the total score at 3&#x02013;4&#x02005;months after training.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>
<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></p><p>At the 6&#x02005;months retest, both groups performed 4&#x02013;5&#x02005;mm deeper compressions compared with baseline. Previous studies show significant correlations between age, weight, height and compression depth.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>
<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29&#x02013;31</xref> However, in our study, it is unlikely that the strength of the students improved so much during 6&#x02005;months as to explain the improved compression depth. Interestingly, similar results were observed in a prestudy, despite the retest being carried out after only 3&#x02005;months.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> The oral feedback received by the students after the first test might have helped them to perform deeper chest compressions at the retest. Also, we cannot exclude the fact that the students at the retest were more familiar with the test doll and thus performed better. The proportion of students who applied incorrect hand position was high in both groups (at retest; 96% vs 95%). Previous studies, using diverse definitions, indicate a large variation (13&#x02013;90%) regarding correct hand position.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>

<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Isbye <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> argue that the definition of &#x02018;incorrect hand position&#x02019; is important when results are compared. The poor hand positioning in our study could possibly be explained by the fact that the compression place on MiniAnne, used during training, is &#x02018;marked&#x02019; and thus the students might not reflect on correct hand positioning. At the test situation, however, the ResuciAnne has a &#x02018;whole chest skin&#x02019; without marking.</p><p>Students generally have a positive attitude towards CPR training.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>

<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> In our study, there was no significant difference in willingness to act between the app and DVD groups.

<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>
<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> In our study, fear to do harm was one of the most common reasons for not wanting to perform chest compressions on a stranger. In CPR training, it is important to emphasise that &#x02018;laypeople cannot do anything wrong&#x02014;the only wrong thing would be to do nothing&#x02019;.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> A common barrier for ventilation was fear of disease transmission. Therefore, it is important to emphasise that the risk of disease transmission during CPR intervention is very low.<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>

Further studies are needed to identify optimal and alternative teaching methods.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Study limitations</title><p>First, we cannot exclude that the duration of the training (30 vs 50&#x02005;min), rather than the type of training per se, accounted for the differences observed in the tests. However, in the app-based education, training on recovery position was excluded. Thus, there was time enough for the students in the app group to carry out the same amount of cycles of compressions and ventilations as in the DVD group.</p><p>Second, the questionnaire used to evaluate willingness to act contains only hypothetical questions. They do not fully answer how the students would act in a real situation.</p><p>Third, it is a risk that the instructors experience and/or enthusiasm affects the learning. Therefore, the methods were standardised to ensure equivalent education, the teacher only had a role as a facilitator during the training, and the practical exercises were based on instructions from the app and the DVD, respectively.</p><p>Fourth, we cannot exclude the possibility of contamination between classes of the same school. However, a potential contamination is not expected to have a significant impact on the test results, since the hands-on training is by far the most important factor to acquire practical CPR skills.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Also, if contamination existed and had an effect on test results, it would rather lessen than enhance any differences between groups.</p><p>Lastly, we do not know if the number of students in each class affects the outcome, but the instructor only had the role of a facilitator and previous studies have shown that larger DVD-based groups are performing equivalent to smaller traditional instructor-led groups.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Overall, a 50&#x02005;min DVD-based training seemed to be superior to a 30&#x02005;min app-based education in terms of teaching practical CPR skills to seventh grade students. After CPR training, a majority of students, regardless of the training method, were willing to make a life-saving effort. However, only a third of the students would do both compressions and ventilations if a stranger suffered a cardiac arrest. This needs to be considered when creating educations.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank all the students and teachers who participated in the study.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> AN contributed to the study design, developed the modified Cardiff test and the questionnaire, conducted all measurements, analysed results and wrote the initial draft of the manuscript.
