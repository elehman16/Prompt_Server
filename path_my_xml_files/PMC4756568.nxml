These include: Conventional complete dentures, implant-supported overdentures (ISOs) and implant-supported fixed prostheses.</p><p>While restoration of the edentulous mouth with conventional complete dentures was associated with a number of problems related mainly to denture stability and overall satisfaction,[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] rehabilitation of the edentulous mouth with implant-supported fixed prostheses is associated with higher costs coupled with surgical and technical complexities. This may be considered a barrier for the wide clinical application of full-arch implant-supported fixed prostheses, despite their superior outcome in terms of oral function, patient satisfaction, and oral health-related quality of life.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>The provision of conventional maxillary complete denture and ISO in the mandible was found to be a predictable treatment option that can satisfy the functional and esthetic needs of a large proportion of completely edentulous subjects.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Improved denture retention, enhanced denture stability, better chewing function, greater biting force, and increased patient satisfaction are some of the advantages that can be gained from treatment with ISOs compared to conventional dentures.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] This is coupled with realistic costs and relatively limited surgical and restorative procedures. The introduction of immediate loading concept of dental implants has added another value to the option of ISOs, where speedy restorative procedures can enhance the positive response of edentulous patients to treatment with ISOs.</p><p>Though the clinical success of ISOs is dependent on a number of factors, it can be argued that successful treatment outcome with ISOs is highly related to the existence of harmonious relationship between the prosthetic superstructure and its supporting implants. Faulty prosthetic construction may generate unfavorable torque forces upon the supporting implants and could disrupt their osseointegration.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Theoretically, minimizing the amount of unfavorable torque forces affecting the denture can be achieved by carefully shaping the polished surfaces and appropriate arrangement of the artificial teeth, so that the surrounding musculature tends to stabilize the denture during function. This refers to the neutral zone concept that can be utilized during the construction of complete dentures.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] It was first described by Wilfred Fish in 1931.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] The neutral zone philosophy is based upon the concept that within the denture space, there is a specific area for each individual patient where the function of the musculature will not unseat the denture and the forces generated by the tongue are neutralized by the forces generated by the lips and cheeks.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Positioning artificial teeth in the neutral zone achieves two objectives. First, the teeth will not interfere with the normal muscular function and second, the forces exerted by the musculature against the dentures are more favorable for stability and retention.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Various techniques were proposed to record the neutral zone in the edentulous mouth.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] However, regardless of the technique used, the literature lacks any information about the effect of neutral zone record on bone response around dental implants supporting an overdenture. This is despite both the neutral zone concept and the ISO treatment modality being relatively old.</p><p>The aim of this study was to observe the changes in marginal bone height around immediately loaded implants supporting a mandibular overdenture constructed according to the neutral zone technique and to compare these changes with those around ISOs constructed according to the conventional methods.</p><p>The examined hypothesis was: There is no difference in marginal bone loss around immediately loaded implants supporting mandibular overdentures constructed according to the neutral zone concept and around immediately loaded implants supporting conventionally constructed mandibular overdentures.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This study was approved by the Scientific Committee of the Faculty of Dentistry, Suez Canal University, Ismailia, Egypt.</p><p>Twelve completely edentulous patients were selected from the Prosthodontic Department, Faculty of Dentistry, Suez Canal University.

The polished surface contour was developed using conventional waxing method and its principles.</p><p>For patients in group B, the dentures were constructed according to the neutral zone record, by which the position of the posterior teeth and the polished surface contour were determined as follows:</p><p>

Also, a graduated periodontal probe under local anesthesia was used to map the bone width in the selected area.</p><p>Each patient received two root form titanium implants [TUT Dental implants; Egyptian Co. for Dental Implants (ECDI), Cairo, Egypt]. The used implants had the following features: Single piece with ball and socket, having O-ring attachment system, threaded, sandblasted, 3.4 mm in diameter, and 13 mm in length.</p><p>Flapless surgery was performed to insert the implants in the canine region in both sides. Then, the lower denture was delivered after modification and application of soft lining material (Acrostone, Relining material; Acrostone Dental Factory, Cairo, Egypt). Patients were instructed to chew soft food and follow oral hygiene measures. After 10 days, the soft liner was removed and the O-ring attachments with their keepers were attached to their ball abutment, and picked up directly to the fitting surface of the lower denture using self-cure acrylic resin, while the patient was closing in centric position. The denture was checked in the patient's mouth for occlusion and pressure areas. Before discharge, patients were motivated to maintain hygiene of their implants and dentures, and were asked to attend successive follow-up visits for evaluation.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-6"><title>Evaluation of the marginal bone height changes</title><p>Each patient in both groups was evaluated radiographically immediately after implant loading and at 6, 12, and 18 months after implant loading using direct digital panoramic machine (Curix 242 S; Agfa-Gevaert N.V., Mortsel, Belgium) [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>].

Thus, factors that may affect the long-term osseointegration of the dental implants supporting and retaining the overdentures are worth investigating. This study was designed to examine the impact of neutral zone technique as a denture stabilization factor on bone response around ISOs. The outcome measure was changes in marginal bone height around ISOs constructed with the neutral zone technique in comparison with that around conventionally constructed ISOs. The rate of bone loss around dental implants is an important indicator of a successful osseointegration. Adell <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] indicated that mean bone loss for implants should not exceed 1.5 mm for the first year and 0.1 mm per year following that. In a literature review about the outcome of implant inserted in a flapless surgery, the mean radiographic bone loss for the successful implants ranged from 0.7 to 2.6 mm after 1 year of implant placement.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] The findings of this clinical study show that mean radiographic bone loss in both study groups was within the normal range after 18 months observation time. Also, the rate of bone loss around immediately loaded implants supporting conventionally constructed mandibular overdentures was similar to that around immediately loaded implants supporting mandibular overdentures constructed according to the neutral zone concept. It seems that the application of the conventional measures in the construction of ISOs is sufficient to produce a favorable bone response around the supporting implants.</p><p>A review of the literature shows that many factors can be implicated in the reduction of bone around dental implants. These include surgical trauma during drilling, forced tightening of implants upon installation, covering the gingival margins around the implant, excessive functional and masticatory forces upon the implants, and faulty prosthetic superstructure.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>A possible explanation for our results is that a flapless surgical protocol was followed to reduce the amount of surgical trauma. Moreover, patients in both groups were subjected to periodical recall visits and instructed to follow high levels of oral hygiene. Also, patients with risk factors for developing peri-implant diseases were not selected for this trial.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Furthermore, a measure to reduce the displacement forces affecting the overdentures was implemented in both study groups. The artificial teeth in the conventionally constructed overdentures were arranged on the crest of the ridge and the polished surfaces were made concave according to the traditional well-known principles of waxing-up removable dentures. On the other hand, overdentures in the second group were made according to the neutral zone concept. Moreover, the retention elements for the overdentures in both study groups were ball attachments. Such type of implant attachment provided a long-term favorable marginal bone loss around overdentures supported by two implants in the mandible.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</p><p>Rehmann <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] indicated that despite the expected benefit of the neutral zone technique for the function and stability of the complete denture, it cannot be recommended for routine clinical application. This is because of the relatively complex procedures associated with its application and the need for a sufficiently skillful practitioner and a cooperative patient. Our results are in line with this view. It can be argued that there is no clear added value in terms of bone response around ISOs to prefer the use of the neutral zone technique over the conventional technique in the construction of mandibular ISOs.</p><p>A limitation of this study is that the sample size was relatively small. Also, the study comprised only male patients and the observation period was limited to 18 months following implant insertion. Further research that considers these limitations is recommended to confirm our findings.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>By taking the limitations of this
