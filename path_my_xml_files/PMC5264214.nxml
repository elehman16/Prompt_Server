Treating to achieve remission and low disease activity improves patient outcomes and reduces long-term joint damage. While use of biologic therapies has contributed greatly to effective disease control, treatment with one or more conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (csDMARDs) remains the mainstay of initial therapy in patients with RA.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> However, many patients continue to have active disease despite treatment with csDMARDs or do not tolerate csDMARD therapy. In this situation, standard current practice is to add a biological agent, typically a tumour necrosis factor inhibitor. However, the emergence of new therapies, including novel, small molecule therapies termed targeted synthetic DMARDs,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> might change such a paradigm.</p><p>Baricitinib is an oral drug that preferentially inhibits Janus kinase (JAK) 1 and JAK2. JAK1 and JAK2 are widely expressed and mediate signalling of multiple cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of RA, such as interleukin-6, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and interferons.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Baricitinib has shown efficacy in phase II studies of patients with RA.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> The baricitinib phase III RA development programme includes four global phase III studies evaluating patients at distinct stages in the RA treatment continuum, and an associated long-term extension study (RA-BEYOND).<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6&#x02013;11</xref> This report describes the results of the RA-BUILD trial, a phase III study of baricitinib in patients with moderately to severely active RA who were refractory to or intolerant of csDMARDs. This study incorporated a supportive assessment of the effect of baricitinib on radiographic progression of structural joint damage.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Patients</title><p>Patients were &#x02265;18&#x02005;years old with active RA (&#x02265;6/68 tender and &#x02265;6/66 swollen joints; serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP) &#x02265;3.6&#x02005;mg/L (upper limit of normal 3.0&#x02005;mg/L)) and an insufficient response (despite prior therapy) or intolerance to &#x02265;1 csDMARDs.

As a supportive objective, radiographic joint damage was evaluated using the van der Heijde modified Total Sharp Score. Radiographs were obtained at the screening visit (baseline) and week 24 (if the most recent radiograph was at least 8&#x02005;weeks earlier), or at the time point of rescue for rescued patients. Radiographs were obtained upon study discontinuation if &#x0003e;12&#x02005;weeks had elapsed since the last prior radiograph.

The occurrence and severity of all adverse events (AEs) were recorded. The National Institutes of Health Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), V.3.0, or National Cholesterol Education Program categories were used to describe selected laboratory abnormalities. During the study, an independent data safety monitoring committee reviewed data from this and other ongoing phase III studies of baricitinib. An independent cardiovascular evaluation committee adjudicated potential cardiovascular events.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Estimates determined that 220 patients per treatment group would provide &#x0003e;95% power for comparison between baricitinib 4&#x02005;mg and placebo in ACR20 response rate (assumed 60% vs 35%, respectively) at week 12. Randomised patients treated with &#x02265;1 dose of study drug were included in the efficacy analyses under a modified intent-to-treat principle (analysis set).</p><p>A stepwise family-based hypothesis testing strategy controlled type I error for primary and key secondary endpoints at 12&#x02005;weeks for ACR20, HAQ-DI and DAS28-CRP change from baseline, SDAI score &#x02264;3.3, MJS duration, MJS severity, worst tiredness and worst joint pain, with corresponding hypotheses tested for baricitinib 4 or 2&#x02005;mg versus placebo (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">supplementary figure</xref> S1). Only if all tests in a family were significant did the sequence proceed to the next family of tests in the hierarchy; otherwise, subsequent evaluations were considered as supportive analyses in the context of this method with strong control for the familywise error rate. Treatment comparisons for categorical and continuous efficacy measures were performed using logistic regression and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), respectively, with baseline value (for continuous measures), treatment, region and centrally confirmed the presence of baseline joint erosions in the model. Fisher's exact test was used for categorical safety data or when sample size requirements for the aforementioned logistic regression model were not met. Continuous safety data were analysed using ANCOVA with baseline value and treatment in the model. Duration of MJS was analysed using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Analyses were assessed with a significance level of 0.05 (two-sided) unless otherwise defined by the gatekeeping procedure (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">supplementary figure</xref> S1).</p><p>Patients who were rescued or discontinued were defined thereafter as non-responders (non-responder imputation) for all categorical efficacy outcomes. For continuous efficacy outcomes, the last observations before rescue treatment or discontinuation were carried forward (modified last observation carried forward method). For continuous secondary efficacy measures that were included in the hierarchical testing (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">supplementary figure</xref> S1) and where discontinuation was due to an AE, the baseline observation was carried forward to the week 12 timepoint (modified baseline observation carried forward method). Linear extrapolation was used to impute missing data for analysis of the structural progression endpoint at week 24. For patients who were rescued or discontinued, baseline data and the most recent postbaseline radiographic data prior to or at initiation of rescue therapy or discontinuation were used to extrapolate week 24 scores. Analysis methods dependent upon other missing data mechanisms (eg, mixed models for repeated measures, tipping point analyses) were conducted to ensure conclusions were robust. Safety observations were analysed by assigned treatment until the time of rescue or completion of the treatment period.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Patients</title><p>From 1241 screened patients, 684 patients were randomised (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ANNRHEUMDIS2016210094F1">figure 1</xref>).

Low-density and high-density lipoprotein (LDL/HDL) cholesterol increased in both baricitinib groups compared with placebo; mean LDL:HDL ratio was unchanged at weeks 12 and 24.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study evaluated the safety and efficacy of baricitinib in patients with RA with an inadequate response to csDMARDs and na&#x000ef;ve to bDMARDs. In this patient population, once daily oral baricitinib produced significant improvements compared with placebo at 12&#x02005;weeks. Importantly, a beneficial treatment effect was observed in all baricitinib-treated, analysed subgroups, irrespective of concomitant csDMARD use. This study demonstrates a short-term (24&#x02005;weeks) symptomatic benefit of baricitinib, but the radiographic progression data indicate a beneficial effect on joint damage. These data suggest baricitinib is an effective disease-modifying agent for treating the signs and symptoms of RA, with 4&#x02005;mg being the most effective dose.</p><p>AEs that occurred during the treatment period and SAEs, including serious infections, were balanced across treatment groups. Events of herpes zoster were typical in nature but were confined to the baricitinib groups. Although robust evaluation of the safety profile of baricitinib in RA will require analysis of data integrated across studies, including long-term exposures, a dose&#x02013;response was not observed for important measures of safety in this study. Baricitinib was associated with mean reductions in neutrophils, and increase in LDL and HDL cholesterol. Rapid, very small increases in serum creatinine were observed, without increases in abnormal values. This may reflect minor changes in renal tubular secretion of creatinine.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Asymptomatic increases in CK were seen, a finding noted for other JAK inhibitors.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23&#x02013;25</xref> Small platelet increases were seen; mechanisms that could link JAK1/JAK2 inhibition to platelet increases have been described.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>
<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Importantly, most laboratory changes were predominantly of small magnitude and transient, and abnormalities leading to discontinuation occurred in &#x0003c;1% of patients. The clinical significance of these changes is unclear.</p><p>The statistically significant improvements observed with baricitinib 4&#x02005;mg are also clinically relevant. First, the ACR20 response rate difference to placebo exceeded 20%, which is widely considered to reflect a clinically relevant treatment effect for ACR20.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Treatment efficacy appeared to plateau between week 12 and week 16 for many of the evaluated symptomatic outcomes, and importantly, treatment benefit remained stable over the study duration (24&#x02005;weeks). In addition to symptomatic benefit and effect on PROs, this study suggests a benefit on structural outcomes, which could be demonstrated after 24&#x02005;weeks of treatment. Joint damage is considered a relevant surrogate marker of long-term disability.</p><p>Limitations include the relatively short-term duration that prevents definite conclusions concerning the exact potential role of this new therapy in the armamentarium of RA management. This study included two active dose regimens but was not designed to compare these doses for statistically significant differences. The data suggest that both doses may effectively treat signs and symptoms of RA, but that baricitinib 4&#x02005;mg has a more rapid and pronounced effect in improving measures including PROs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ANNRHEUMDIS2016210094F2">figure 2</xref>), composite disease activity scores (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ANNRHEUMDIS2016210094F2">figure 2</xref> and online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">supplementary figure</xref> S2) and a more robust structural preservation effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ANNRHEUMDIS2016210094F3">figure 3</xref>). There was a relatively high placebo response observed for the primary endpoint. In the placebo group, 39% of patients achieved an ACR20 response at week 12. The reason for this placebo ACR20 response rate is unclear and was not driven by a particular geographic pattern; placebo ACR20 responses appeared consistent across regions in this global study (USA/Canada 34%, Asia 38%, Eastern Europe 42%, Central/South America and Mexico 43%, Western Europe 44%, Rest of World 45%). Additionally, ACR20 response rates of this approximate magnitude have been seen in other contemporary clinical trials.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>
<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29&#x02013;31</xref> Thus, the placebo ACR20 response observed in the RA-BUILD trial appears to be within contemporary norms and was not driven by geographic outliers.</p><p>In summary, the results of this phase III study provide evidence that selective inhibition of JAK1 and JAK2 with once daily baricitinib produces clinical and structural efficacy in patients with active RA who have failed csDMARDs. Additional studies in different populations and long-term exposure are needed to provide further insight into safety and sustainability of response.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Correction notice:</bold> This article has been corrected since it published Online First.
