limited and repetitive motions. The abnormal motions and habits will undermine the central
axis of the human body and its balances, while causing pain. The occurrence of pain result
in further compromises in the postures, as it causes the body to compensate for it. And, as
a result, it will be the source of the functional disorders, such as the reduced
flexibility, limitations in motions, and other inability disorders.</p><p>The initial stage of the functional disorder occurs in the neck and shoulder. The unstable
position of the neck and the pain affect the torso and the hip joint, which causes
difficulties in maintaining the posture and walking, further causing pains in the low back
and legs and other neurological issues. There have been many treatment methods and treatment
devices developed in the existing studies. However, there involve difficulties for
application in terms of the level of professional skills required to use them and the cost
of the treatment devices, etc. Such difficulties have been being mitigated since 2000, due
to the development of the form roller exercises and the exercise methods. In addition to the
physical therapies, this method is being used for the relaxation of fascia and stretching in
various occupation groups, while taking less time and cost compared to the existing
therapies<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The form roller exercises relax the fascia using the body weight and reduces the tension in
the muscles. With this, it increases the effect of muscle massaging and the range of the
movement of the joints<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. The form roller
exercises relieve the muscles of cramping as massaging does. And, it soothes the nerves and
facilitates blood circulation, helping the body recover from fatigue. Mohr et al.<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup> showed in their study with 40 participants
of whom the flexion range of the hip joint was less than 90 degrees over a six-month period
where the static stretching exercises and the form roller exercises were compared that the
form roller was effective in enhancing flexibility. Pearcey et al.<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that the form roller exercises increased the
pressure pain threshold of the muscles and enhanced the functioning and performance of the
muscles.</p><p>The efficacy of the form roller exercises make them popular in various medical and health
domains. However, the method of application and the manufacturing technology for the form
roller itself are now faced with their limitations. In order to enhance the efficacy of the
form roller, it is intended to apply the vibration technique of the existing physical
therapy to the form roller exercises. The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of
such a new method with the existing form roller exercises, as a preliminary study to develop
a new training method using the form roller exercises in the future.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>To this study, 30 students of G university were enrolled. The selection criteria was that
the individual were to give their informed consent after being brief on and presented with
the informative material in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki and should be free
of the orthopedic, internal-medicinal, or neuro-surgical conditions that affected the
muscles around the hip joint and the walking abilities over the past six-month period. Among
those who gave their informed consents, those who had 5 or higher VAS points when
pressurized at the point of pressure pain in the form roller, rectus femoris, hamstring,
gluteus, and iliotibial tract, which affect the functional motions of the hip joint, were
selected.</p><p>The point of pressure pain of the participants was determined according to positional
release therapy and the manual of trigger point and myofacial therapy by Kerry et al.<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup> and Dimitrios<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. The participants were grouped into the form roller group (15) and
the vibration form roller group (15). The two groups were exposed to an exercise regimen of
three sessions per week, over four weeks. Each session was composed of five minutes of
warming-up, 20 minutes of main exercises, and five minutes of cool-down exercises.</p><p>The form roller exercises program used a form roller and a vibration foam roller (TRATAC
Active Roll made of Expanded Polypropylene, Naum Care, South Korea). And, in this study, the
3700 RPM mode was used. Using the form roller, self-fascia-relaxation exercises were
performed. The self-fascia-relaxation exercises of each muscle were performed after three
sessions of instructions and posture training by a therapist. And, the participants were
supervised while performing the exercises to ensure accurate motions during the
exercises<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. In order to examine the
changes in the muscle performances, a goniometer (Baseline, USA) was used to measure the
operational range of the joints. The measured ranges were the flexion, extension, internal
rotation, and external rotation of the hip joint<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Commander Algometer<sup>TM</sup> was used to examine the changes in
the pressure pain. The measurements were taken three times in accordance with the method
suggested by Manga (2008)<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>, and the
average of these measurements was used.</p><p>For the statistical analysis of this study, SPSS 18.0 for Windows was used to analyze the
joint performance of the hip joint and the pressure pain. In order to examine the changes
between groups, independent t-tests were conducted, while paired t-tests were conducted to
compare within the same group before/after the test. The significance level for the
statistical analysis was set to 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Of the demographic characteristics of the participants, the age (FRE group 20.60 &#x000b1; 0.83,

function as the causes of deterioration of the mental confidence and social life, due to the
undermined daily-life functions, walking abilities, and body conditions. In this study, in
order to solve such problems in the earlier stages, the researchers compared the
effectiveness of the self-stretching therapy using the form roller exercises and the
vibration foam roller exercise, in order to manage the muscles around the hip joint in a
more effective manner, as they are related to the walking motions.</p><p>Normally, the minor pains appearing in the muscles gradually develop into muscular pains
and contractions. And, when the part with the pressure pain is stimulated, the related
pains, pressure pains, motor-neural disorders, or autonomous nervous reactions can be
triggered. In order to solve this problem, the pains have been under control through regular
exercises, stretching, and vibration techniques.</p><p>In terms of the influence on the motion range of the joints, the normal form roller
exercises group showed significant increases in flexion, extension, and internal rotation,
and the vibration foam roller exercise group in flexion, extension, external rotation, and
internal rotation. In the inter-group comparison, the vibration foam roller exercise group
showed a significant increase in the flexion and internal rotation. According to De Bruyne
et al.<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup> the flexibility in the hamstring
was increased, while Mohr et al.<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup> reported
that the form roller exercises were effective in the flexion of the hip joint. Based on such
results, the self fascial relaxation exercises, using form rollers became popular in yoga,
Pilates, and fitness centers since the 2000s<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Also, massages such as the form roller exercises relieves the
muscle of the cramps, stimulates the deeper part of the muscles, and, through such
stimulations, calms down the nerves, relaxes the muscles, facilitates the blood circulation,
and helps fatigue recovery<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>With regard to the influence on the pressure pain, the two groups showed statistically
significant decreases in the rectus femoris, hamstring, and gluteus. And, in the comparison
between the groups, there was an effective reduction in the iliotibial tract of the
vibration foam roller exercise group. In support of the findings in this study was Cheathaam
&#x00026; Kolber<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>, where the quadriceps and
hamstring had their threshold values reduced effectively. Also, in similar studies regarding
vibration, it was reported that vibration may control pain or enhance the exercise
performances when used in combination with them<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Also, it has been reported that the subtle vibration energy can
not only build up the muscular tissues by facilitating the contraction and relaxation of the
muscles but also be advantageous in the less amount of tissue damage risks, while having
dynamic effects such as circulation facilitation, stretching of the soft tissues, prevention
of adherence destruction, enhancement of flexibility in tissues, and reduction of pain<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. The vibratory stimuli applied to the
muscle activate the muscle spindles. As a result, not only the muscles under the direct
influence of the vibratory stimuli but also the muscles near them can be affected<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Pollock et al.<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that vibratory stimuli on quadriceps could
enhance the sensitivity to the knee-tendon reflection. Yang et al.<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup> reported effectiveness in activation of the sensory
receptors. This is a method that is actively used in many treatments. And, the same result
was obtained in this study, too.</p><p>The positive aspect of this study was that the participants participated in the exercises
out of curiosity on the vibration foam rolls, and they found that, unlike the normal form
roller exercises, the pain was diminished during the exercises. The limitations of this
study were that the participants experienced form roller exercises for the first time, and
they had much difficulties in learning the initial motions of the exercises and the
influence of daily life on the hip joint was not controlled. The result of this study showed
the effect of the vibration form roller exercises. Therefore, various exercise methods would
have to be developed in order to overcome the limitations in the existing form roller
exercises.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Borje</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Peter</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><name><surname>Martin</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Effects of whole-body vibration exercise on human bone
