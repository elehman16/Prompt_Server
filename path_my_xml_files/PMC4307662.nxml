Newer techniques such as topical and sub-Tenon's anesthesia, which avoid sharp needle placement into the orbit, have obvious advantages over traditional peribulbar and retrobulbar blocks. These techniques are not only less painful on administration, but also as effective in pain control during surgery as sharp needle blocks. However, prerequisites for these techniques are a well-informed, motivated, and cooperative patient and a skilled competent surgeon.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>Between the two techniques, topical anesthesia has some advantages over sub-Tenon's block; such as saving time in administration, shorter duration of action, allowing the patient to rapidly regain sight after surgery and less pain during administration of anesthesia. However, there is evidence that patients report more pain intra-operatively under topical anesthesia when compared with sub-Tenon's anesthesia.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of topical anesthesia and sub-Tenon's anesthesia in providing pain relief during phacoemulsification.</p><p>The objectives of this study were to compare the patient's comfort levels during the administration of anesthesia, as well as intraoperatively and postoperatively. It also noted overall patient co-operation and any surgical complication following topical and sub-Tenon's anesthesia for phacoemulsification.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><p>This is a randomized controlled trial carried out between September 2009 and August 2010 at a tertiary care eye hospital in Coimbatore city, South India. Two hundred patients who underwent phacoemulsification through self-sealing clear corneal incisions and foldable intra-ocular lens implantation were enrolled in this study. One hundred patients received topical anesthesia (Group 1) and 100 (Group 2) received sub-Tenon's anesthesia. Patients were allocated randomly using a random number table to receive topical anesthesia with 0.5% proparacaine (Paracaine, Sunways India Pvt. Ltd. India) in Group 1 and sub-Tenon's infiltration with 2% lignocaine (Xylocaine, AstraZeneca Pharma India Pvt. Ltd. India) in Group 2.</p><p>Patients who had sensitivity to lignocaine, poor mydriasis &#x0003c;5 mm, history of epilepsy, excessive anxiety, inability to lie flat, inability to understand the pain scale or to comply with instructions (deafness, people suffering from psychiatric disorders, mentally challenged subjects) were excluded from the study.</p><p>Data collection was performed by means of interviews; a predesigned semi-structured questionnaire was used to collect the data. Written consent was obtained from the respondents after explaining the procedure in the local language (Tamil). The study protocol was submitted for ethical clearance to the Institutional Ethics Committee of the hospital and clearance was obtained before commencement of the study.</p><p>Patients were asked to grade pain on a visual pain scale (Grade 0 - no pain, Grade 1 - slight irritation, Grade 2 - mild pain, Grade 3 - significant pain) during administration of the anesthetic, during surgery, immediate postoperatively and 30 minutes postoperatively. Visual pain scale used in the study is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Visual analog pain scale.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JOVR-9-329-g001"/></fig><p>The surgeon also graded overall patient co-operation during surgery on a scale of 0-3 with 0 being the least co-operation and 3 being the greatest. Surgical satisfaction depended on patient co-operation (eye movement, lid squeezing) and time taken for surgery. The intra-operative complications in the two groups were also recorded.</p><p>The data was statistically analyzed by SPSS 11.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for descriptive statistics and tests of significance. Student's <italic>t</italic>-test was used to compare mean age of the patients in each arm of the trial. Chi-square test was used to compare the pain felt by the patients during various phases of assessment and also patient co-operation during surgery as graded by the operating surgeon between the two arms of the trial.

A tuberculin syringe with 26 gauge needle or loaded with local anesthetic solution (2% xylocaine, Dispo Van, Single use needle, India. 0.45 &#x000d7; 13 mm). Patient was asked to look up and out to expose the inferonasal quadrant. The 26 gauge needle was inserted below the conjunctiva and Tenon's capsule and 0.25 mL of local anesthetic (2% xylocaine) was injected into the sub-Tenon's space.</p><p>Conventional technique: a small incision was made in the conjunctiva and Tenon's fascia. Local anesthetic was injected using a small blunt sub-Tenon's cannula inserted through this hole. However, the selection of a cannula or needle depended on availability, cost and preference of the surgeon.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>A total of 200 patients who underwent clear cornea phacoemulsification were assessed. One hundred surgeries were performed under topical and 100 under sub-Tenon's anesthesia.</p><p>The mean age of the patients in topical and sub-Tenon's group was 61.64 years and 62.87 years respectively (<italic>F</italic> = 2.56, <italic>P</italic> = 0.11). Under among the topical group, 55 were male and 45 were female subjects. The sub-Tenon's group comprised of 47 male and 53 female subjects. Fifty-four right eyes and 46 left eyes were operated under topical anesthesia whereas 64 right eyes and 36 left eyes were operated under sub-Tenon's anesthesia. The majority (79%) of patients in both groups were operated for senile immature cataract. Other causes included senile mature cataract, posterior subcapsular cataract, hypermature cataract, brown cataract, near mature cataract and presenile immature cataract.</p><p>During administration of anesthesia, the pain scores did not show any statistically significant difference (Pearson's &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> = 5.658 and <italic>P</italic> = 0.059) between the topical and sub-Tenon's groups.

They reported a significantly higher median pain score in the topical group which made the operative procedure more stressful for both the patient and surgeon.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] They recommended topical anesthesia only if the cataract surgery was performed through a clear corneal incision. Similarly, Manners and Burton[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] have reported a higher pain score in the topical group despite the fact that patients in this group received an additional sub conjunctival injection of lidocaine 2% to facilitate scleral cautery, as the surgery was performed through a scleral incision.</p><p>It has been assumed that, with topical anesthesia, phacoemulsification and intra-ocular lens implantation were less painful when performed through a clear corneal incision than when performed through a scleral tunnel incision, as the former has the advantage of preserving the conjunctiva and avoiding cautery.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] However, a study by Srinivasan et al[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] shows that even with clear cornea incision, patients undergoing topical anesthesia had significantly higher mean pain score immediately and 30 minutes after surgery. This was reported in their double blind randomized placebo controlled trial comparing topical and sub-Tenon's anesthesia for routine cataract surgery.</p><p>Zafirakis et al[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] were the first to compare topical and sub-Tenon's anesthesia for phacoemulsification and intra-ocular lens implantation through a clear cornea incision. They recruited 100 patients in whom randomization was satisfied so that half of the first-eye surgeries and half of the second eye-surgeries were assigned to each anesthetic group. They concluded that patients having cataract surgery under topical anesthesia had more intra-operative and postoperative discomfort than patients receiving sub-Tenon's anesthesia. However, patients having topical anesthesia reported less pain during its administration and had fewer complications. Both anesthesia methods provided high levels of pain control without additional sedation.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>In our study, phacoemulsification was performed through a clear cornea incision. It was found that patients undergoing surgery under topical anesthesia had more pain than sub-Tenon's anesthesia intra-operatively. The literature review of intra-operative pain[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] reveals that topical method results in higher pain levels during surgery as compared to sub-Tenon's which is consistent with our results. However, one should note the differences in pain scores in all these studies although statistically significant, are not necessarily clinically significant.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] The increased pain could be due to the application of speculum to the eyelid or pain from the ciliary body, both of which would not be anesthetized under topical anesthesia,[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] pain in the surgical technique may reduce pain felt under topical anesthesia.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>Regarding, pain during administration of anesthesia, studies[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] provided slight evidence of higher pain during administration of sub-Tenon's anesthesia. This could be due to the fact that the pain of anesthetic administration was measured after the operation[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and so patients could have confused the pain of the procedure with the pain of administration.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] As this is a comparison between a procedure that just requires instillation of drops with a more invasive one using a blunt cannula, there is always going to be some degree of discomfort involved in sub-Tenon's, but usually this is short lived.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Hence, the pain scores may not be clinically significant. It is possible that pain during the administration of sub-Tenon's could be reduced by different techniques, which could include changing the speed of delivery, volume delivered, concentration used and warming of the anesthetic drugs.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] In our study, pain scores in sub-Tenon's were slightly higher than topical, but there was no statistically significant difference between the two.</p><p>Similar to the study by Srinivasan et al,[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] our study also measured postoperative pain immediately and 30 minutes after surgery. Their study showed higher pain scores in the topical group than in sub-Tenon's group whereas in our study, no difference was found in postoperative pain scores between two types of anesthesia. Zafirakis et al[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] measured pain 24 hours postoperatively and reported that all patients in topical anesthesia group had a statistically significant pain score versus the sub-Tenon's group 24 hours postoperatively.</p><p>Our study also recorded intra-operative eye movements, lid squeezing and complications. There was difference in eye movement between two groups. More lid squeezing was noted in the topical group than the sub-Tenon's group. No complications were seen in the topical group whereas few cases of minor complications such as chemosis and subconjunctival hemorrhage were noted in sub-Tenon's group. Other studies which noted complications are by Srinivasan et al,[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Vielpeau et al[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and Zafirakis et al[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Chemosis and sub conjunctival hemorrhage were noted in sub-Tenon's group by Vielpeau et al[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and Zafirakis et al,[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] while there was more eye squeezing and less akinesia in topical group.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] This may be due to less effective block in topical group as compared to the sub-Tenon's group. In Srinivasan et al[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] study, more serious complication such as posterior capsule tear and vitreous loss occurred in the topical group, more than twice as often as in the sub-Tenon's. This could be potentially due to the fact that topical anesthesia provides no akinesia, which makes surgery more risky.</p><p>R&#x000fc;schen et al[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] looked at patient satisfaction and reported that patients were more satisfied with sub-Tenon's anesthesia than topical anesthesia. The difference in the satisfaction scores was not huge and may not be clinically significant.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] In our study, surgeons noted the patient's co-operation and found that the majority in both groups were significantly co-operative.</p><p>The quality of anesthesia of different topical agents may vary in small incision cataract surgery, but no study appears to have compared the effectiveness of all available topical anesthetics.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Although amethicone tends to be used in UK and tetracaine in USA,[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Chittenden et al[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] preferred oxybuprocaine 0.4% as it is less irritant. Srinivasan et al[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] used proxymethocaine 0.5%. In our study, proparacaine 0.5% was used.</p><p>The choice of anesthetic technique will always depend on a balance between the patient's wishes, the operative needs of the surgeon, the skills of the anesthetist and the facility where such surgery is being performed.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>This study has shown that sub-Tenon's anesthesia provides better pain relief than
