<bold>Objective: </bold>Mindfulness skills are assumed to be related with emotions. Deficits in emotion &#x0200e;regulation could lead to development and persistence of mood disorders. Dysthymia and double &#x0200e;depression are two chronic types of depression. This chronicity can be attributed to the one&#x02019;s &#x0200e;inability to regulate his/ her mood. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effect of mindfulness-&#x0200e;based cognitive therapy (MBCT), which is one of the proposed methods for emotion regulation, &#x0200e;on depression and the ability of emotion regulation of patients with dysthymia.&#x0200e;</p><p>
<bold>Method: </bold>This clinical trial was conducted on 50 dysthymic and double &#x0200e;depressed patients. They were selected through convenience sampling and assigned into &#x0200e;intervention and control groups. The control group received only medication, while the MBCT &#x0200e;group participated in an eight- session program once a week with each session lasting for two to &#x0200e;two and half hours in addition to receiving medication. All the participants filled out Beck &#x0200e;Depression Inventory II and Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale before and after the &#x0200e;program. Data were analyzed using the SPSS statistical software (Version 16) and univariate &#x0200e;covariance statistical method.&#x0200e;</p><p>
<bold>Results: </bold>While there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups with &#x0200e;respect to the demographic characteristics, we observed a statistically significant improvement in &#x0200e;the defined variables in post-test of the MBCT group compared to the case group.&#x0200e;</p><p>
<bold>Conclusion: </bold>The results of this study revealed that combining MBCT and pharmacotherapy &#x0200e;could cause significant improvement in depression symptoms and increase the patient&#x02019;s ability to &#x0200e;regulate emotion compared to pharmacotherapy alone&#x0200e;.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key Words</title><kwd><italic>Dysthymia</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Emotion Regulation</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy</italic></kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The concept of depression has been recognized among the physicians. Avicenna, in his book &#x0200e;Canon of Medicine, referred to depression as &#x0201c;melancholy&#x0201d; and defined it as a disorder in which &#x0200e;the thought deviates from the natural path leading to destruction and fear. He believes that this &#x0200e;disorder is caused by ill-tempered dry and cold humor. In his opinion, dry and cold humor is &#x0200e;opposed to and hurts the spirit (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>).&#x0200e;</p><p>Dysthymia can be initially differentiated from major depression by its chronic nature and less &#x0200e;severe symptoms. Among the signs considered for major depression in DSM-IV, only &#x0200e;psychomotor disorder and suicide thoughts cannot be observed in dysthymia. This is somewhat &#x0200e;in line with the studies conducted by Beck et al. (1987) who reported suicide thoughts and loss &#x0200e;of appetite not to be the features of dysthymia (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>).&#x0200e;</p><p>A high rate of comorbid disorders are observed in this disorder, which is usually accompanied by &#x0200e;other psychological disorders such as anxiety disorders, drug abuse, and alcohol abuse. In &#x0200e;addition, more than 75% of individuals with dysthymia experience exacerbations in their &#x0200e;symptoms in the form of major depressive disorder (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>-<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), which is defined as &#x0201c;double &#x0200e;depression&#x0201d; (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Following the signs of dysthymia predicts strong risk factors for major &#x0200e;depression for both children and adults (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).&#x0200e;</p><p>Emotion regulation or control has been a central concept for many Asian and European &#x0200e;philosophers. For instance, Spinoza, a 17th century philosopher, was highly interested in emotions; &#x0200e;he differentiated the negative emotions and positive ones and emphasized the regulation of the &#x0200e;passions. Studies by Block and Block (1980) on ego resilience directly affected the present &#x0200e;works on emotion regulation. Block emphasized the inefficient nature of over-controlling and &#x0200e;importance of flexible, optimum control for more compatibility (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p><p>Mood disorders are accompanied by disorders in perception and processing of the emotional &#x0200e;information and storing it in the memory. These disturbances may play a role in providing the &#x0200e;grounds for problems in interpersonal behaviors as well as the commencement and continuation &#x0200e;of mood disorders (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).&#x0200e;</p><p>Some concepts in emotion regulation have emphasized controlling the emotional experiences, &#x0200e;emotional expression, and particularly severe control of negative emotions and reduction of &#x0200e;emotional arousal. On the other hand, some others have emphasized the functional nature of the &#x0200e;emotions in conceptualization of emotion regulation, suggesting that emotion regulation is not &#x0200e;similar to emotion control and does not mean immediate reduction in negative emotions. Hayes &#x0200e;et al. (1996) stated that making attempts to avoid internal experiences such as unwanted thoughts &#x0200e;and emotions provides the grounds for a large number of psychological disorders. In addition, &#x0200e;trying to control or suppress the emotional experiences may increase emotion regulation &#x0200e;disorders. Thus, these recent conceptualizations of emotion regulation emphasize the importance &#x0200e;of acceptance and valuation of the individuals&#x02019; emotional responses (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).&#x0200e;</p><p>This is what mindfulness approaches do by completely focusing on the present experiences &#x0200e;through a moment-based approach. Mindfulness-based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) combines &#x0200e;aspects of Beck&#x02019;s cognitive therapy with meditations to train people to become more aware of &#x0200e;their bodily and mental experiences such as thoughts, feelings and external environments without &#x0200e;judging them. MBCT enables people to view their thoughts and emotions as transient phenomena &#x0200e;rather than facts (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). On the contrary to Beck&#x02019;s cognitive therapy, MBCT does not aim to &#x0200e;correct the cognitive errors; it removes the thoughts from consciousness and help the individuals &#x0200e;to abandon the troublesome situations when immediate change is not possible (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Baer (2006) believes that being in a mindful status facilitates the exposure and prevention of responses &#x0200e;in emotional as well as psychological conditions. Similarly, Linehan (1993 a) states that &#x0200e;mindfulness practice may be beneficial for the individuals who fear from facing their emotions &#x0200e;&#x0200e; (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).&#x0200e;</p><p>The MBCT method was planned initially to prevent relapse in depression, and a large number of &#x0200e;studies have shown its impact on the acute phase of depression and treatment-resistant &#x0200e;depressions (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>-<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>).</p><p>Our target sample in this study was a group with chronic depression. Given the burden that this &#x0200e;type of depression causes the individual and society, choosing the most effective treatment plan &#x0200e;to deal with dysthymia and double depression is important and yet controversial. While some &#x0200e;studies have shown the superiority of SSRIs to psychotherapy alone in dysthymic patients (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), some others have emphasized the rapid and robust effect of medication and its little role in &#x0200e;reducing risks once it is discontinued (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Imel et al. (2008) found that psychotherapy has &#x0200e;significant benefits at follow-up and prophylactic effects not retain by medication (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) &#x0200e;However, the majority of researches have suggested combined treatment as having the most &#x0200e;improvement rate compared to each of these methods alone (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> and <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). In the case of MBCT, &#x0200e;Kuyken (2008) suggests that adding MBCT to usual treatment with antidepressants significantly &#x0200e;reduced residual symptoms and relapse/ recurrence rates of depression over 15-month follow-ups (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>).&#x0200e;</p><p>According to the mentioned studies, it seems that adding psychotherapy to pharmacotherapy in &#x0200e;the treatment of patients with dysthymia could have an additive effect. In this study, we aimed &#x0200e;to evaluate MBCT method to achieve the positive results in a group of patients with chronic &#x0200e;depression. &#x0200e;</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Method</title><p>
<bold><italic>Participants</italic></bold>
</p><p>Using convenience sampling, we selected 75 patients out of all patients who referred to two of &#x0200e;the psychiatric clinics affiliated to Shiraz University of Medical Sciences. These individuals had &#x0200e;been regularly referred to the collaborator psychiatrists during their course of disorder and were &#x0200e;diagnosed to have dysthymia or double depression disorder. A master of clinical psychology &#x0200e;interviewed the participants using SCID-I to ensure they met the diagnostic and inclusion criteria &#x0200e;for this study. According to the study criteria, 50 individuals were entered into the study and &#x0200e;randomly assigned to control and case groups. The case group received MBCT in addition to &#x0200e;medication, while the control group received medication only. All the study participants had &#x0200e;been receiving antidepressants of any type depending on the psychiatrist&#x02019;s clinical judgment for &#x0200e;at least six months before the study. They participated in the study without changing the type &#x0200e;and dosage of medication they have been using treatment as usual (TAU). All the participants signed the informed &#x0200e;consent form before entering the research project.&#x0200e;</p><p>The inclusion criteria of the study were as follows: Suffering from depression for at least two &#x0200e;years based on the DSM-IV-TR diagnostic criteria of dysthymia or double depression; being &#x0200e;older than 18 yrs.; having at least a high school diploma; not receiving any other psychological &#x0200e;treatment elsewhere such as individual psychotherapy that could coincide with the study; not &#x0200e;being diagnosed with severe mental disorders such as psychosis, mania, or a full criteria &#x0200e;personality disorders in the clinical interview; lack of drug or alcohol abuse while taking part in &#x0200e;the study; and not suffering from depression resulting from a simultaneous physical problem. &#x0200e;Moreover, the participants had to attend to at least five to eight treatment sessions.&#x0200e;</p><p>
<bold><italic>Procedure</italic></bold> &#x0200e;</p><p>This study was conducted with a two-group quasi-experimental or static group comparison &#x0200e;design to evaluate the effect of MBCT program on emotion regulation and treatment of patients &#x0200e;with dysthymia who received medication.&#x0200e;</p><p>
<bold><italic>Measures</italic></bold>
</p><p>Beck Depression Inventory-2 (BDI-II): This 21-item self-report questionnaire is a revised version &#x0200e;of BDI questionnaire that was developed to measure depression, and it is more consistent with &#x0200e;DSM-IV-TR compared to the first edition. BDI-II is used to assess the severity of depression in &#x0200e;people older than 13 years. Furthermore, Mohammadkhani and Dobson (2007) showed BDI-II as &#x0200e;a valid and reliable instrument for the Iranian population. The reliability coefficient for all the 21 &#x0200e;items was 0.913. The correlation of each item with the questionnaires indicated that item 15 (lack &#x0200e;of energy) with a coefficient of 0.618 had the highest possible recognition and item 19 (difficulty &#x0200e;concentrating) with a coefficient of 0.454 had the least ability to diagnose. To determine the &#x0200e;construct validity of the questionnaire, the correlation between the BDI-II and Depression Scale &#x0200e;of Brief Symptom Inventory was calculated to be 0.87 (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>)&#x0200e;&#x0200f;.&#x0200f;</p><p>Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale: Gratz developed this scale in 2004. It is a 36-item, &#x0200e;multidimensional, self-report questionnaire, which evaluates the individual&#x02019;s emotion regulation &#x0200e;patterns and includes six subscales. This scale has been designed based on the experimental and &#x0200e;conceptual works that define emotion regulation as follows: Awareness and perception of the &#x0200e;emotions; acceptance of the emotions; the ability to control the impulsive behaviors and trying to &#x0200e;achieve goals while experiencing negative emotions; the ability to use flexible emotion &#x0200e; regulation strategies to regulate the emotional responses for the individuals to reach their goals &#x0200e;and situational needs. Problem in each of these domains could indicate a disorder in emotion &#x0200e;regulation. &#x0200e;</p><p>This scale assesses six subscales including not accepting the emotional responses, problem in &#x0200e;performing the behaviors leading to one&#x02019;s goal, impulse control problems, lack of emotional &#x0200e;awareness, limitation in finding emotion regulation strategies and lack of emotional clarity (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>).&#x0200e;</p><p>Sharifi et al. (2009) standardized this questionnaire in Iran. The reliability of the questionnaire &#x0200e;was calculated using bisection and Cronbach's alpha methods to be 0.86 and 0.8, respectively for &#x0200e;the whole questionnaire (P&#x0003c;0.01), indicating acceptable coefficients for the questionnaire. To &#x0200e;determine the concurrent validity of the questionnaire, its scores were correlated with the scores &#x0200e;of Zuckerman Sensation Seeking Scale, and a significant positive correlation was found between &#x0200e;them (n = 59, r = 0/26, p = 0.43). &#x0200e;</p><p>Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnosing Axis I Disorders in DSM-IV-TR (SCID-I): This &#x0200e;interview was designed by First, Spitzer, Gibbon, and Williams (2002), and it is used for &#x0200e;diagnosing dysthymia and refusing differential diagnoses. It has appropriate reliability and &#x0200e;validity for diagnosing psychological disorders. Sharifi et al. (2004) calculated psychometric &#x0200e;properties of the questionnaire for the Iranian population. Diagnostic agreement with clinical &#x0200e;interview by two psychiatrists according to Kappa index was above 0.6. Total Kappa index for &#x0200e;all current diagnosis was 0.52 and it was 0.55 for lifetime diagnosis (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>).&#x0200e;</p><p>
<bold><italic>Treatment Process</italic></bold>
</p><p>Segal et al. derived the program protocol from &#x0201c;MBCT for depression&#x0201d; (2002), which is &#x0200e;displayed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>. It included eight weekly sessions with the duration of two to two and half &#x0200e;hours. Clinical interview was performed in a briefing session before the 8th session, and the &#x0200e;participants were evaluated in terms of inclusion and exclusion criteria, and treatment method &#x0200e;was explained to them.&#x0200e;</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Three participants dropped out from each group, so the final sample of the study was 44, each &#x0200e;group consisting 22 participants. The control group included 6 males and 16 females, while the &#x0200e;case group included 5 males and 17 female. The mean age of the control group was 35.2 (&#x000b1;9.4) &#x0200e;years and it was 30.7 (&#x000b1;7.9) years for the case group. &#x0200e;Considering the fact that the participants were selected through convenience sampling, to be able &#x0200e;to generalize the study findings, we evaluated the two groups considering the demographic &#x0200e;variables including age, sex, and level of education. The results of Chi-square test and &#x0200e;independent t-test revealed no significant difference between the two groups in these variables. &#x0200e;The mean scores of depression and emotion regulation disorder in the two groups before and &#x0200e;after the intervention are presented in the following graphs. &#x0200e;</p><p>As the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> demonstrates, the intervention group&#x02019;s depression scores considerably decreased in &#x0200e;the post-test compared to the pre-test. The decrease was statistically significant (P = 0.000).&#x0200e;</p><p>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> displays a considerable decrease in the intervention group&#x02019;s mean score of emotion &#x0200e;regulation disorder in the post-test compared to the pre-test. On the other hand, a slight increase &#x0200e;could be observed in the mean score of the control group. The two groups were independently &#x0200e;considered in the analyses, so ANCOVA was used to control the effect of the pre-test. Before &#x0200e;performing ANCOVA, the variables were investigated concerning the necessary assumptions, &#x0200e;and the results revealed that parallelism of the slope of the regression line and normal distribution &#x0200e;of the data applied to the data in both groups. &#x0200e;</p><p>According to the following table, a significant difference was found between the two groups in &#x0200e;the emotion regulation disorder scores in the pre-test and the post-test (F = 7.2, P = 0.01). &#x0200e;Moreover, the study results revealed a significant difference between the two groups in the &#x0200e;subscales of &#x0201c;not accepting the emotional responses&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;problem in impulse control&#x0201d;, and &#x0200e;&#x0200e;&#x0201c;limitation in finding emotion regulation strategies&#x0201d;.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table1</label><caption><p>Curriculum of each Intervention Sessions&#x02019; content</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">

In other words, they are considerably &#x0200e;incapable of regulating their emotions after a loss or failure, which is a critical area in &#x0200e;depression (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). As <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> depicts, after the intervention, the mean score of depression in the &#x0200e;case group significantly differed from that of the control group. The mean scores of depression &#x0200e;decreased from severe to mild based on BDI-II in the case group, while the mean scores of the &#x0200e;control group was average based on BDI-II both before and after the intervention.&#x0200e;</p><p>The results of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> revealed a decreasing trend in the case group in terms of emotion &#x0200e;regulation variable after receiving MBCT intervention. This result is consistent with the findings &#x0200e;of Erisman, Salters-Pednault, and Roemer (n.d) that found levels of mindfulness have a &#x0200e;significant relationship with emotion regulation measured by Difficulties in Emotion Regulation &#x0200e;Scale (DERS) (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Thus, it seems that MBCT provides the individuals with dysthymia with more &#x0200e;efficient and effective strategies for emotion regulation.&#x0200e;</p><p>Prior to the emergence of acceptance-based approaches, controlling emotions was a proposed &#x0200e;way to manage them; however, studies have shown that suppressing emotions to regulate them &#x0200e;results in more negative consequences such as poor social adjustment and well-being (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). &#x0200e;Repressed emotions also underlie experiential avoidance which means trying to avoid experience &#x0200e;of emotions, feelings, thoughts and other mental contents (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>) and studies have shown it to have &#x0200e;a critical role in levels of anxiety disorders and human suffering such as prolonging the course of &#x0200e;depression (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Therefore, emotional acceptance by adopting a non-judgmental and &#x0200e;welcoming stance toward internal experiences have been encouraged in stark contrast to &#x0200e;struggling to eliminate, control or changing emotions (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). This concept has been discussed &#x0200e;extensively in the context of mindfulness-based theories. Mindfulness-based therapies by &#x0200e;changing one's relationship with his/ her experiences and cultivating the notion of acceptance &#x0200e;provides strategies for effective emotion regulation and self-regulation (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Furthermore, facing with &#x0200e;unpleasant emotional states repeatedly, which is broadly encouraged in MBCT, is also a kind of &#x0200e;exposure with these unwanted mental contents to the goal of extinction. Apparently, it differs &#x0200e;from cognitive therapy approaches in that the focus is on altering the content of thoughts (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, &#x0200e;&#x0200e;<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>).&#x0200e;</p><p>The results of <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref> showed that among the emotion regulation subscales, the main changes &#x0200e;could be attributed to three subscales of &#x0201c;acceptance of positive or negative emotions&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;problem&#x0200e; in impulse control&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;individuals&#x02019; finding strategies for regulating these emotions&#x0201d;. In line &#x0200e;with recent studies that propose emotional experiences rather than suppression as an effective &#x0200e;strategy for emotion regulation (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>-<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>), we can state that increasing one&#x02019;s acceptance &#x0200e;toward his/ her emotional responses can broaden one&#x02019;s mental space to search for new solutions to &#x0200e;manage internal impulses and external events. More recent theories of emotion regulation &#x0200e;emphasize that identification, acceptance, and being aware of the emotions lead to selecting the &#x0200e;most appropriate way for achieving the intended goals. The results also revealed that accepting &#x0200e;emotions rather than suppressing and denying them, impede self-blaming in the individual, a &#x0200e;component that studies found to create more problems in emotion regulation (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). &#x0200e;</p><p>On the other hand, the significant decrease in the mean score of &#x0201c;problem in impulse control&#x0201d; in &#x0200e;the intervention group showed the difference between experiencing an emotion and acting on its &#x0200e;base, which is highly emphasized in mindfulness interventions. For most people, experiencing an &#x0200e;emotion means acting upon it or suppressing it. In addition, mindfulness exercises and &#x0200e;meditations provide the individual with various choices to replace the usual inefficient strategies &#x0200e;when experiencing negative emotion-focused strategies used to distract from the present condition &#x0200e;and focusing on other environmental components. This can be confirmed by significant changes &#x0200e;in the scores of &#x0201c;problem in impulse control&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;limitation in finding emotion regulation &#x0200e;strategies&#x0201d; subscales. &#x0200e;</p><p>With respect to the other subscales, no statistically significant difference was observed between &#x0200e;the two groups in &#x0201c;lack of emotional clarity&#x0201d; subscales in the post-test. These subscales evaluate &#x0200e;the distinction among the emotions as well as the emotions&#x02019; verbal description, which seems to be &#x0200e;less affected by the mindfulness training. It seems that the change in the regulation of emotions &#x0200e;was affected by factors other than identifying accurate emotions. In the Iranian culture, depressed &#x0200e;people tend to report and recognize their mental contents as thoughts rather than feelings. Patients&#x02019; &#x0200e;inability to differentiate thoughts from emotions might be due to the inseparable nature of &#x0200e;differentiating thoughts, emotions or other mental contents as mindfulness literature did not make &#x0200e;such a distinction either (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Wilber (1996) proposes that "information processing occurs &#x0200e;hierarchically across cognitive, emotional and physiological systems, which have been suggested &#x0200e;to be functionally interdependent and inseparable" (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). However, more researches are needed to &#x0200e;enable us to interpret this result accurately.&#x0200e;</p><p>As no significant change was found in the &#x0201c;problem in performing purposeful behaviors&#x0201d; subscale, &#x0200e;and because our sample was a group of dysthymic patients, we dealt with two delineating factors of &#x0200e;chronic course of depression and chronic use of antidepressants, both of which are accompanied &#x0200e;by apathy features. Hence, transferring cognitive and emotional changes into behavioral ones can &#x0200e;be attributed to these features. The short-term course of the treatment can also be another reason &#x0200e;because converting the adaptive alternatives for emotional regulation into practical solutions to the &#x0200e;extent that the individuals can overcome their daily hassles is a time consuming process and needs &#x0200e;more long-term interventions. Moreover, making use of cognitive-behavioral interventions such as &#x0200e;self-control and positive reinforcement programs together with mindfulness might be &#x0200e;accompanied by more comprehensive effectiveness.&#x0200e;</p></sec><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>Non-random selection of this study and lack of follow-up due to time constraints were two of &#x0200e;the study limitations. Therefore, conducting more studies on this topic is highly recommended to &#x0200e;generalize the findings and evaluate the maintenance of the results over time. Moreover, the type &#x0200e;and dosage of antidepressant medication were not controlled in the two groups. Therefore, it &#x0200e;seems that evaluating the efficacy of MBCT combined with specific dosage or group of &#x0200e;antidepressants could more accurately determine the optimal mode of the combination therapy. &#x0200e;Furthermore, we suggest that anxiety, which seems to be a moderating factor in the effectiveness &#x0200e;of treatment be controlled in the future studies.&#x0200e;</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this study, it was found that the severity of depression and the ability of emotion regulation of &#x0200e;patients with dysthymia who had participated in MBCT sessions improved significantly &#x0200e;compared to the patients who did not participate in the program. Hence, it may be argued that &#x0200e;mindfulness skills could show their effects in relation to chronic depression, in which emotion &#x0200e;regulation has a central role.&#x0200e;</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This study was a part of the master thesis of Sajedeh Hamidian and was financially supported by &#x0200e;Shiraz University of Medical Sciences (Grant Number: 5964).
