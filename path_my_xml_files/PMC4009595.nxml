Clinically, the cardioprotective effects of volatile anesthetics have mainly been studied in cardiac surgery, differentiating between cardiac preconditioning [<xref rid="R002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and postconditioning [<xref rid="R003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] depending on the time of administration of the anesthetic agent. The effects on myocardium of these forms of administration of volatile anesthetics have been controversial and less conclusive than those reported at experimental level [<xref rid="R004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, the most significant results depend on the time when the anesthetic gas is administered: these are more evident when it is given throughout the surgical procedure, decreasing the cardiac biomarker levels and improving the myocardial function [<xref rid="R005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Today, the use of volatile anesthetics is no longer conditioned by the availability of an anesthesia station with a vaporizer. The development of the Anaesthetic Conserving Device, which may be described as a minivaporizer consisting of an activated charcoal membrane that allows for anesthetic absorption and reuse [<xref rid="R010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], permits the use of anesthetic gases (sevoflurane and isoflurane) with the usual ventilators in the critical care units. This makes possible the use of volatile anesthetics during the postoperative period [<xref rid="R011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>The purpose of this study is therefore to assess whether the extended administration of a volatile anesthetic (sevoflurane) during the postoperative period has beneficial effects on markers of myocardial injury (troponin T) when compared with a sedation with propofol.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Leon University Hospital, Leon, Spain on 24 May 2011.

Sequentially selected patients were alternatively assigned to the study groups. Sample size calculation for an expected standard deviation (SD) in both groups of 0.7, to detect a means difference in troponin T (cTnT) levels of 0.5&#x000b5;g.L<sup>1</sup>(95% confidence level, 80% power), was 63patients per group. 72 patients per group were enrolled to provide for potential losses.</p><p><italic>Inclusion and exclusion criteria.</italic> Inclusion criteria were age over 18years, coronary or mixed (valve + coronary) surgery using CPB, and a minimum sedation period of 120minutes. </p><p>Patients with a history of malignant hyperthermia, propofol allergy, surgery without CPB, urgent surgery, and cryoablation surgery were excluded. Finally, patients with preoperative creatinine levels higher than 1.5mg.dL<sup>-1</sup>in a blood sample drawn within 24hours of surgery were excluded from the study.</p><p><italic>Intraoperative period.</italic> Patients were pre-medicated with a benzodiazepine the night before the procedure and with intramuscular morphine (35mg) in the morning of surgery. In accordance with the standard procedure for cardiac surgery with CPB, anesthesia was induced using midazolam (0.07mg.kg<sup>-1</sup>), fentanyl (4&#x000b5;g.kg<sup>-1</sup>), etomidate (3.5mg.kg<sup>-1</sup>), and cisatracurium (0.2mg.kg<sup>-1</sup>). Remifentanil and sevoflurane were used to maintain anesthesia, with a target bispectral index (BIS) value ranging from 40to 60. During CPB, sevoflurane was used with the same target BIS.</p><p><italic>Postoperative period.</italic> Interventions in the intensive care unit (ICU) included: </p><p>- Propofol (P) sedation group. Propofol infusion at 2mg.kg<sup>-1</sup>.h<sup>-1</sup>, with a loading dose of 1mg.kg<sup>-1</sup>if required to achieve a BIS ranging from 60to 80.

Remifentanyl 0.050.1&#x000b5;g.kg<sup>-1</sup>min<sup>-1</sup>was concomitantly administered. </p><p>- Sevoflurane (S) sedation group. Sedation with sevoflurane through the Anesthetic Conserving Device (AnaConDa&#x000a9;, Sedana Medical, Sundbyberg, Sweden), administered at an infusion rate ranging from 3and 8mL.h<sup>-1</sup>, to a target BIS ranging from 60to 80.

Prior studies have shown that the raise in the TnT levels following cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass was associated to increased mortality and longer ICU stay [<xref rid="R013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R014" ref-type="bibr"> 14</xref>]. By contrast, no statistically significant differences were seen in our study in terms of length of ICU or hospital stay, which should lead us to question whether the differences (0.19 and 0.22 &#x000b5;g.L1) found in our study have a clinical - and not just statistical - impact. In any case, attention should be called to the trend we identified (1 day of difference in the length of stay from surgery to hospital discharge favoring patients sedated with sevoflurane). Such difference was not statistically significant, possibly because of an inadequate sample size for this objective, but it would agree with the studies where troponin was found to be a predictor for surgical outcome.</p><p>According to these findings, we would like to emphasize the differences obtained in the time of postoperative sedation, which is longer in the propofol group (mean difference 20 minutes), although they are not statistically significant and would not cause any change in the TnT plasmatic levels. The shorter time until recovery after sedation with sevoflurane, as obtained in previous studies, could be an influencing factor for these results [<xref rid="R015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>We must remember that cardiac surgery constitutes a suitable, but still suboptimal model for the study of potential cardioprotective effects of anaesthetic agents [<xref rid="R016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The perioperative morbidity has decreased significantly, so it becomes increasingly difficult to prove that an additional protective measure will result in a change in perioperative morbidity and mortality [<xref rid="R017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] because we would need larger sample sizes.</p><p>Different meta-analyses [<xref rid="R018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R019" ref-type="bibr"> 19</xref>] have shown that the use of anesthetic agents decreases the use of vasopressors. The statistical analysis of our study sample showed no significant quantitative differences in the use of norepinephrine, dobutamine, and nitroglycerin for the first 48 hours after admission. However, the analysis of the data did show a trend to a decreased use of both norepinephrine and dobutamine and to an increased use of nitroglycerin in the sevoflurane group. This trend may condition the levels of TnT, and makes us wonder whether the use of vasopressors and vasodilators might be conditioned by the sedative agent used. It should be noted that there were no target mean blood pressure levels considered in the design of the study, and that the use of vasopressors was a decision of the anesthesiologist in charge. The use of vasopressor or vasodilator agents was recorded, but not the drug doses. </p><p>Renal toxicity is a critical aspect when assessing long-term exposure to sevoflurane. In the 70s, following marketing of methoxyflurane, it was postulated that a plasma level of this drug&#x0003e;50 &#x000b5;mol.L<sup>-1</sup>resulted in kidney damage [<xref rid="R020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. After that, it was questioned whether this threshold of 50 &#x000b5;mol.L1 could be extrapolated from all anesthetic gases [<xref rid="R021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R022" ref-type="bibr"> 22</xref>]. Damage caused by methoxyflurane was partly attributed to intrarenal metabolism, which does not occur with other anesthetic gases such as sevoflurane. Levelsofinorganic fluorine remains high until 48 hours after administration of sevoflurane. Data reported here show creatinine levels as a marker of kidney damage during the first 48 hours, with a biochemical measurement available on the day of hospital discharge. There was no difference among the two groups in the creatinine levels or in the peak creatinine levels at admission. A creatinine level &#x0003e; 1.5 mg.dL<sup>-1</sup>within 24 hours of surgery was an exclusion criterion. This, combined with a mean pre- operative hemoglobin &#x0003e; 13 mg.dL<sup>-1 </sup>(another determinant factor for the occurrence of acute renal failure after cardiac surgery [<xref rid="R023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]), would be the reason for the low incidence of acute renal failure and for the fact that no patient required extrarenal clearance procedures. The CPB time, the other factor especially associated to renal failure, did not differ among the groups. Sevoflurane may therefore be used in patients with prior kidney damage to assess its results in this patient group.</p><p>Continuous administration of sevoflurane in the postoperative period is permitted by the AnaConDa&#x000ae; (Anesthetic Conserving Device) system, which has an efficiency in terms of sevoflurane consumption similar to a circular circuit with fresh gas at 1.5 L.min<sup>-1</sup> [<xref rid="R024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>The AnaConDa&#x000ae; may be used with any ICU ventilator, and it has been shown to be a valid alternative to a conventional vaporizer when no anesthesia station is available [<xref rid="R025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. A critical aspect in the use of this device is environmental pollution, which respects the limits established by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health of 2 ppm during a working day [<xref rid="R026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The safe use, in terms of minimal contamination, of the AnaConDa&#x000ae; with a scavenging system in the ICU environments (values not exceeded 1 ppm) has been described [<xref rid="R027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Moreover, its safe use without any scavenging system has been demonstrated [<xref rid="R028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], making this unnecessary according to some authors [<xref rid="R029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>In terms of efficiency, the direct costs of the use of sevoflurane as sedative agent are significantly lower when compared to midazolam [<xref rid="R030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. When compared to propofol, there is no difference in costs between them in short-time sedation, when only the drugs are considered [<xref rid="R031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The sedation with sevoflurane is more expensive if we add the costs of the dispositive (AnaConda&#x000a9;). To date, there is not any study evaluating the indirect costs of both strategies in terms of time of sedation, time of mechanical ventilation or length of stay in the ICU.</p><p>The use of the AnaConDa&#x000ae; device is remarkably simple: it can be filled using a specific connection and the anesthetic can be administered through a syringe pump. The infusion can be easily modified to achieve the desired level of sedation, so that it can be monitored by the nursing staff with a minimum waste of time [<xref rid="R032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p><p>The study limitations include the sequential selection of patients, who were alternatively enrolled into each study group. A double-blind study was not conducted because of the characteristics of drugs administered for sedation; only the part related to statistical analysis was blinded. With regards to the use of vasoactive drugs, these were only administered according to the invasive blood pressure and the central venous oxygen saturation; no invasive monitors were used, and no postoperative echocardiography was performed to assess cardiac function.</p><p>In conclusion, continuous sedation with sevoflurane in the postoperative period of coronary or mixed (valvularand coronary) surgery may not only be considered as a valid alternative to propofol, butit might alsodecrease cardiac TnT levels. No differences were found in renal function when levels of creatinine were measured.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="nota_1" fn-type="presented-by"><p><bold>Source of Support</bold> Nil.</p></fn><fn id="nota_2" fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Disclosures</bold> None declared.</p></fn><fn id="nota_3" fn-type="other"><p><bold>Cite as:</bold> Marcos-Vidal JM, Gonz&#x000e1;lez R, Garc&#x000ec;a C, Soria C, Galiana M, De Prada B.
