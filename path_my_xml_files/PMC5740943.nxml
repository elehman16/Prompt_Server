However, which kind of antipsychotic was more effective and safe in the treatment of schizophrenia is still being debated. This study attempted to understand whether there are any differences in efficacy, acceptability, and safety between the five atypical antipsychotics in patients with first-episode schizophrenia.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">Two hundred cases of inpatients with first-episode drug-na&#x000ef;ve schizophrenia were randomly assigned to 6&#x02013;8&#x000a0;weeks of treatment with either of aripiprazole, risperidone, quetiapine, olanzapine, or ziprasidone from October 2012 to November 2014. The efficacy, acceptability, and safety measurement after 6&#x02013;8&#x000a0;weeks of treatment of the five kinds of antipsychotics were evaluated by the deduction rate of Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) total score, the proportion of treatment discontinuation, and adverse events, respectively. Whether the treatment discontinuation or combination therapy for baseline antipsychotics after titration mainly depended on ineffective or less effective on an initial-assigned antipsychotic during the study period.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">BPRS total scores in each antipsychotic group were significantly decreased at the end of the study (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.01), and only the deduction rate of BPRS total scores in the risperidone group was markedly higher than those in the groups of aripiprazole (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.01) and olanzapine (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05) after controlling the impact of the differences of age of onset. There were significant differences between quetiapine (<italic>&#x003c7;</italic>
<sup>2</sup>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;5.46, <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.019), olanzapine (<italic>&#x003c7;</italic>
<sup>2</sup>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;5.6, <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.018), and ziprasidone regarding the proportion of maintaining on initially allocated therapy. In addition, the difference in treatment discontinuation between male and female patients was also significant (<italic>&#x003c7;</italic>
<sup>2</sup>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;9.897, <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.002), and odds ratio of treatment discontinuation in male and female patients was 0.37 (95% CI 0.198&#x02013;0.693); however, no difference in treatment discontinuation was found between five antipsychotics. Extrapyramidal symptoms in the groups of quetiapine and olanzapine were notably less than the other three kinds of antipsychotics (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05), but there were no significant differences in other adverse events between the five antipsychotic groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">Risperidone was more effective than aripiprazole and olanzapine in treating first-episode schizophrenia. The present study revealed the superiority of quetiapine and olanzapine over ziprasidone with remarkably less severe extrapyramidal adverse effects, especially with lower drop-out and treatment discontinuation. There were no differences in terms of other adverse events although the risk of treatment discontinuation was higher in female patients.</p><p>

Antipsychotics (APs) are still a mainstay of treatment for schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, although some evidence in recent years questioned their effects on long-term recovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Treating first-episode schizophrenic patients with reasonable medications according to the characteristics of the symptoms in individuals is particularly critical for patients&#x02019; continuous relief of symptoms and their social functional recovery. If the symptoms of first-episode schizophrenia did not remit within a comparatively shorter time with adequate treatment, there would be a considerably high risk of a poor long-term outcome, particularly for the patients with deterioration in premorbid social functioning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par17">Although some first-generation antipsychotics (FGAs) were still used in some countries, they were no longer widely used in recent years due to high rates of extrapyramidal side effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) have not yet shown significant advantages than first-generation antipsychotics (FGAs), although they have been extensively utilized as the first-line drug for treating patients with first-episode schizophrenia over the past years, as they can often cause weight gain and even alter lipid and glucose metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Some of the reviews have recently suggested that whether FGAs or SGAs are more effective is still inconclusive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Although no difference in the efficacy between atypical APs from many meta-analysis or systemic review reports, the differences in adverse effects were robust, such as tolerability, metabolic disorders, and safety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. However, some research has revealed that there are no consistent differences in efficacy among atypical antipsychotics except for clozapine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The differences in effectiveness, treatment discontinuation, and side effects among atypical antipsychotics still remain an interesting topic in clinical practice although the conventional clinical trials in the real world usually cannot provide a hierarchy based on pairwise comparison of antipsychotic efficacy or head-to-head clinical trials. The good response to initial antipsychotics, as well as the treatment intolerance or discontinuation and subsequent relapse, was obviously associated with a high remission rate and subsequent development of social functional disability in first-episode schizophrenia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Whereas, in the CATIE study, up to 74% of patients interrupted their study drugs before 18&#x000a0;months, it is not surprising that high rates of discontinuation were common in some naturalistic studies in schizophrenic patients with a long exposure to antipsychotics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. A previous study has also indicated that it is unavailable to guide treatment decisions prior to medication response for treating first-episode schizophrenic patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p id="Par18">Indeed, there is no well-defined guideline for clinicians to determine which kind of atypical APs is more effective or available for treating first-episode schizophrenia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. To our knowledge, there is relatively little information about the differences in effectiveness, acceptability, and safety between 5 kinds of atypical antipsychotics in the treatment of first-episode schizophrenia despite the existence of many meta-analyses or head-to-head study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p id="Par19">Properly balancing risks and benefits of antipsychotics, guaranteeing a better adherence to AP treatment, and achieving a better prognosis are the crucial factors and real challenges for the long-term clinical management of schizophrenia, especially in the treatment of first-episode schizophrenic patients. This study attempts to understand whether there are differences in efficacy, acceptability, and safety between the five kinds of atypical antipsychotics in the treatment of first-episode schizophrenia.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Study methods</title><p id="Par20">The study was carried out at the Huaian No. 3 People&#x02019;s Hospital, Teaching Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Jiangsu Province. The subjects were selected from among the inpatients from October 2012 to November 2014. The protocol for the study was granted approval from the scientific and ethics committee of Huaian No. 3 People&#x02019;s Hospital (Ethical Review No. HASYkjk 2012006). The patient or guardian signed the informed consent before the enrollment of the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par21">In the present study, an open-label and randomized controlled trial rooted in everyday clinical practice with a duration of at least 6&#x02013;8&#x000a0;weeks was conducted. Patients were screened by clinicians and underwent a DSM-IV diagnosis of schizophrenia based on the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. All eligible patients were randomized to one of the five kinds of APs (aripiprazole, risperidone, quetiapine, olanzapine, and ziprasidone), and the decision on the study drug to be used was based on the computer-generated random sequence after enrollment of the patients. Given the fact that the study was an open arm study, the decision on when and why the APs should be discontinued was mainly based on the clinical decision of the treating physician for all-cause, such as poor therapeutic effects or severe adverse events, or consultation with the treating team during the entire study period. No other specific strategies of maintaining or improving compliance were recommended during the study period. If poor therapeutic effects or no response or severe adverse events appeared after antipsychotic titration, the clinician would make timely decision to combine with another antipsychotic or discontinue the initially allocated antipsychotics 1&#x02013;2&#x000a0;weeks before the initial treatment according to the predefined study protocol.</p><p id="Par22">Switching to another antipsychotic would be considered as the treatment discontinuation due to no therapeutic effects during the study period.

The acceptability of each kind of antipsychotic was assessed by the discontinuation rate and the remaining use of the initially assigned medication rate at the end of the study. The safety of each antipsychotic at the end of the study was mainly evaluated by extrapyramidal symptoms, blood routine test, liver function test, and electrocardiogram (ECG) examination between the five kinds of antipsychotics.

The treatment discontinuation of initially assigned APs and maintaining the use of initially assigned APs (including patients with the use of concomitant APs and maintaining initially assigned APs until the study endpoint) were considered as the dependent variables.

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par35">Current information about the choice of APs for the treatment of first-episode schizophrenia was relatively limited when an initially prescribed atypical antipsychotic treatment failed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. To our knowledge, the differences in effectiveness, acceptability, and safety between 2&#x02013;3 kinds of second-generation antipsychotics in the treatment of first-episode schizophrenic patients mostly came from meta-analysis and some pairwise studies, but comparison between 5 different kinds of atypical antipsychotic drugs is rare.</p><p id="Par36">This study showed all five kinds of atypical APs (aripiprazole, risperidone, quetiapine, olanzapine, and ziprasidone) have markedly clinical curative effectiveness in the treatment of first-episode drug-na&#x000ef;ve schizophrenic patients. Whereas the deduction rate of BPRS total score at the endpoint of the study in the risperidone group was significantly higher than that in the aripiprazole and olanzapine groups, it was suggested that risperidone may be better than aripiprazole and olanzapine in terms of short-term clinical efficacy. This result was in line with the survey conclusions of the Expert Consensus Guideline, which showed that most clinicians chose risperidone as an alternative drug when olanzapine at an appropriate dosage fails to produce sufficient response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. This is also consistent with the results of Leucht&#x02019;s research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], but inconsistent with reports from Krzystanek&#x02019;s meta-analysis, which showed that the curative effect of olanzapine was remarkably better than those of some other second-generation antipsychotics, i.e., aripiprazole, risperidone, quetiapine, and ziprasidone, except for clozapine and amisulpride [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p id="Par37">The comparison of acceptability between the five kinds of atypical APs revealed that quetiapine and olanzapine were significantly better than ziprasidone after the endpoint of the study, especially in terms of maintaining the use of the initially assigned APs, whereas the differences between other atypical APs were not found. This might be associated with fewer extrapyramidal symptoms in patients with quetiapine and olanzapine treatment, even at higher doses. In contrast, ziprasidone often has relatively more extrapyramidal symptoms, especially when used at higher doses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. This is completely consistent with the result of Roussidis et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] and partially consistent with the results of Leucht&#x02019;s research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], but inconsistent with the research by Jin et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] who suggested that treating clinicians often tended to exclude olanzapine and prefer aripiprazole or ziprasidone as one of the possible choices in patients with metabolic problems. In fact, patients with aggression, excessive excitement, or noisy, rather than metabolic problems, were often needed to be controlled rapidly using concomitant antipsychotic. This concurred with the reports by Edlinger and Cotton et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] who concluded that olanzapine has desirable effects during acute inpatient treatment despite the sedative effects. Other reasons for this inconsistency might be related to the inconsistent criteria in terms of judging acceptability of study drugs and relatively fewer patients enrolled in the ziprasidone group in this study. Crespo-Facorro et al. reported that first-episode schizophrenic patients treated with quetiapine had a higher risk of treatment discontinuation than those treated with aripiprazole and ziprasidone at midterm due to insufficient effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. However, no significant differences were found in treatment discontinuation of the initially assigned APs between the five APs in the present study; the possible reason might be that the mean dose of quetiapine used may not be enough for treating first-episode schizophrenic patients. In addition, gender was markedly related to treatment discontinuation of the initially assigned APs, and the risk of treatment discontinuation in male patients was significantly lower than that in female patients. It might be related to intolerability that occurred easily or more concerns on discomfort in female patients.</p><p id="Par38">The National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] suggested choosing an antipsychotic with best efficacy and tolerability for an individual is more appropriate than the drug category [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The differences in extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) during this trial were consistent with some previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Quetiapine and olanzapine with less EPS displayed high-level therapeutic adherence and showed great significance for successful treatment of first-episode schizophrenic patients. Whereas the side effects of weight gain and metabolic disturbance are much more concerned in recent years, these disadvantages should not be ignored.</p><p id="Par39">In summary, all five atypical antipsychotics (aripiprazole, risperidone, quetiapine, olanzapine, and ziprasidone) had markedly curative effects on first-episode drug-na&#x000ef;ve schizophrenic patients. Risperidone showed better antipsychotic effects than aripiprazole and olanzapine in this study. The acceptability of quetiapine and olanzapine was remarkably better than that of ziprasidone, especially regarding maintaining the use of initially allocated APs. The risk of treatment discontinuation was higher in female patients. The differences in EPS were commonly observed in the treatment of aripiprazole, risperidone, and ziprasidone although other adverse effects were similar.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Limitations of the study</title><p id="Par40">This was an open-label trial that was prone to bias when conclusions to be made. In addition, what needs to be further explained was that the efficacy was often difficulty to be judged if the use of augmentation was taken, even it is attributed to the sole antipsychotic treatment. The associated problems, such as metabolic disorder and sexual dysfunction, were not analyzed because of incomplete records and design of the trial. In addition, the number of patients enrolled in the ziprasidone group was somewhat smaller due to non-compliance, receiving ECT, and drop-out. And the reasons for treatment discontinuation in each antipsychotic group were not fully recorded and analyzed. Large, well-designed trials are warranted to gain more information about the therapeutic effects, acceptability, and adverse effects of different atypical antipsychotic drugs.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>BPRS</term><def><p id="Par5">Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>APs</term><def><p id="Par6">antipsychotics</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FGAs</term><def><p id="Par7">first-generation antipsychotics</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SGAs</term><def><p id="Par8">second-generation antipsychotics</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CATIE</term><def><p id="Par9">Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DSM-IV</term><def><p id="Par10">the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ECT</term><def><p id="Par11">electroconvulsive therapy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SD</term><def><p id="Par12">standard deviation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OR</term><def><p id="Par13">odds ratio</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ECG</term><def><p id="Par14">electrocardiogram</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EPS</term><def><p id="Par15">extrapyramidal symptoms</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>CW designed the study.
