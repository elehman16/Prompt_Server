The cost-effectiveness of these strategies is important because the randomized trial demonstrated that nurse-initiated routine screening with streamlined counseling and rapid HIV testing results in substantially higher testing rates, higher rates of receiving test results, and equivalent sexual risk behaviors and HIV knowledge post-intervention, when compared to traditional HIV counseling and testing.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><p>We estimated the health and economic effects of strategies to increase HIV testing rates and receipt of results using a decision model.

Calibration and validation of the decision model and its outputs occurred as an iterative process throughout its development.

Patients were offered HIV testing and received their results through one of three methods: (1) traditional HIV testing and counseling (Model A), (2) nurse-initiated screening with traditional HIV testing and counseling (Model B), or (3) nurse-initiated screening with rapid HIV testing and streamlined counseling (Model C) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). For each strategy, we replicated the rates of HIV testing and receipt of results observed in the RCT.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref> Each month, the model assessed the patients&#x02019; HIV status, whether their HIV was identified, the clinical course of HIV disease, the costs and consequences of HIV transmission and of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) for patients identified with HIV and eligible for treatment. Estimates for HIV natural history, treatment, transmission of HIV and quality-of-life were derived from high-quality published literature and expert clinical judgment.

For an HIV-infected patient (49.7&#x000a0;years), Model B increased life expectancy by 0.64&#x000a0;years or 0.47 QALYs compared with Model A. If the nurse-initiated strategy included rapid testing and streamlined counseling (Model C), life expectancy was increased by 0.87&#x000a0;years or 0.63 QALYs compared to Model A (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).

Model B was more effective and costly, and Model C was the most effective and most costly (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Note that lifetime costs in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> include all direct medical costs for screening, counseling and treatment, as well as age-specific medical costs unrelated to HIV care, and that our estimated HIV prevalence of 0.398% was based on the trial results. Although Model B is more effective than Model A, Model C has a more favorable cost-effectiveness ratio than does Model B; thus Model B is eliminated by extended dominance (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Extended dominance occurs when a more expensive strategy has a lower cost-effectiveness ratio than a competing (dominated) strategy; in this case, the more expensive alternative would always be preferable, since the outcome gain more than compensates for the cost. The additional gains in health benefit from Model C cost $36,390/QALY, without consideration of the benefit from reduced transmission. Including these benefits resulted in a more favorable cost-effectiveness ratio of $10,660/QALY (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).

In sensitivity analyses we explored the effect of these two elements. If 89.3% of patients received their test results through rapid-testing and streamlined counseling (base-case estimates), then even if the HIV test acceptance rate was reduced to 40%, the cost-effectiveness ratio of Model C increased from the base case estimate of $10,660/QALY only to $13,240/QALY.</p><p>Sensitivity analyses with other model variables (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) did not change our results substantially.

We used testing and counseling costs and receipt of test result outcomes from a previously performed randomized trial as inputs to a model-based analysis that estimated lifetime costs and health outcomes. This approach enabled us to assess the cost-effectiveness of these strategies by including both short- and long-term costs and health outcomes, in accordance with guidelines for the conduct of cost-effectiveness analyses.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></p><p>Our main finding is that nurse-initiated routine screening with streamlined counseling and rapid HIV testing is cost-effective relative to traditional HIV counseling and testing. The increased effectiveness and the resulting cost-effectiveness occur because this strategy resulted in much higher rates of receipt of test results. This strategy, at $36,390/QALY gained, met conventional thresholds for cost-effectiveness relative to Model A. When we considered the benefit to sexual partners from reduced transmission, rapid testing with streamlined counseling was even more favorable and cost $10,660/QALY gained.</p><p>Although the CDC now recommends routine HIV screening in all health-care settings, implementation of screening remains a challenge, and few health-care systems have integrated screening into routine care. We believe that three elements of Model C contributed to the success of this strategy. First, the use of non-physician providers, in our case, nurses, substantially increased the rate of testing. This finding is consistent with a substantial body of literature that supports the use of non-physician providers for preventive care.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref> For example, a systematic review of 81 studies found that the most potent type of intervention to increase preventive services was organizational change, including designation of non-physician staff to perform specific prevention activities.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref> Use of non-physician providers has the additional potential advantage of reducing per-person test costs by substitution of less expensive personnel. In our trial, aggregate costs were higher for the strategies that used nurse-initiated screening (Models B and C), but the increase in costs was related to the higher rates of testing, which offset the reduction in time and personnel costs.</p><p>The second important component of this strategy was streamlined counseling. With traditional testing and counseling, counseling costs are substantial, and for patients with negative tests are approximately 15 times higher than the cost of the HIV test itself.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref> In the randomized trial, traditional pre-test counseling required 20 min on average. In contrast, streamlined pre-test counseling took 7 min, which resulted in a reduction in counseling costs of 65%. In the trial, there were no differences in HIV knowledge or in sexual risk behavior between the traditional or streamlined counseling groups.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref> This result is consistent with that of the RESPECT-2 randomized trial of over 1,600 patients that compared rapid HIV testing and counseling in one visit to standard testing and counseling over two visits.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref> However, the counseling for rapid testing in RESPECT-2 required 30 min and was likely both more costly and more intensive than our streamlined counseling. In addition, in post-hoc subgroup analyses in RESPECT-2, one time counseling appeared modestly less effective in men, suggesting that further evaluation of streamlined counseling is needed.</p><p>The third important component of this strategy was rapid testing. Rapid testing enabled patients to receive test results in approximately 20 min, whereas traditional testing required two visits and results were not available for 1 to 2 weeks. In our trial, the test costs were similar for rapid versus traditional testing. Our results about receipt of testing are consistent with a number of studies that indicate that rapid testing substantially increases the receipt of results<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref> and is acceptable to patients.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref> Recent studies have also indicated the potential economic benefits of rapid testing strategies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></p><p>Although the convenience of rapid testing is an important advantage, continued evaluation of the accuracy of rapid testing is necessary. In our trial, we had only one positive result, which was a true positive; thus, the false-positive rate was 0. However, a trial of testing in emergency department with rigorous quality control found a false-positive rate of approximately 3.1%.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref> Patients should be counseled that positive rapid tests require confirmation.</p><p>Our trial was performed at two VA primary-care clinics in southern California, which raises the question of whether the results will be applicable in other settings. Although the rates of acceptance and receipt of result are likely to vary across settings, we believe the three components of our most effective strategy (initiation of testing by non-physician providers, use of streamlined counseling and rapid testing) are likely to be useful in other settings. Rapid testing has been evaluated in many environments, and use of non-physician providers has been studied in many prevention domains, as noted previously. The use of streamlined counseling addresses an important challenge to providers who have many competing demands on their time.</p><p>Our study has several limitations. As noted, our trial was performed in VA primary and urgent care settings, which have different patient populations than many primary or urgent care practices. In our trial, about 17% of patients approached for participation agreed to enter the study. Because this was a research study, informed consent was required, and the requirements for follow-up may have discouraged some patients from participating. Thus, the implications for implementation of screening outside a trial are not known. The cost-effectiveness of screening however would not be affected by the participation rate since a change in participation would increase/decrease costs and benefits proportionally. In addition, the VA populations we studied do not reflect the distributions or the risk groups in some other populations or settings. Because our results may not be generalizable to non-VA setting, further study in other settings would be helpful. In addition, longer term assessment of effectiveness of streamlined counseling would be useful; our follow-up did not extend beyond 4 weeks. Finally, our cost-effectiveness analysis assumed that identified patients would have access to HIV care, which is true in the VA, but may not hold in some settings. The benefit from screening would be less than we estimated if patients did not have full access to care.</p><p>We believe our study is relevant to primary care settings. Although the need for informed consent in our study precludes completely reproducing routine opt-out screening in a medical setting, we did offer testing routinely to all patients, which is in essence the CDC recommendation. We note, however, that there are potential barriers to implementation of nurse-based screening with rapid testing (Model C), which include lack of nursing time, prioritization of other tasks over HIV testing, lack of familiarity with rapid test procedures among nursing staff and the logistics of lengthening clinic encounters because patients must wait for test results. The importance of these barriers is likely to vary by clinical setting.</p><p>The current CDC guidelines recommend routine screening in health settings, a substantial change in policy from targeted risk-based screening. How best to implement routine screening is uncertain. We found that nurse-initiated screening with streamlined counseling and rapid testing (Model C) was an effective strategy to increase testing and receipt of results, and is cost-effective by conventionally accepted thresholds when compared with traditional counseling/testing. Our study suggests that this strategy has substantial promise as an approach for integrating routine HIV screening into the practice of primary care.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><sec id="AppESM1"><title>Electronic Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d28e1589" content-type="local-data"><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.
