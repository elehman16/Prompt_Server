[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] and quality of life, particularly as a result of complications
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. However, morbidity and mortality related to diabetes can be attenuated by a 15 - 20% reduction in body weight
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. It is also possible, through lifestyle interventions, to prevent or delay the development of diabetes in &#x02018;at risk&#x02019; individuals with pre-diabetes
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Lack of adherence to the weight loss plan prescribed is one of the challenges when recommending dietary modifications to free-living individuals. In dietary interventions, compliance and motivation of the participant generally decrease over time, regardless of the dietary regimen prescribed
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Changing a dietary pattern when it is either failing or because of boredom may produce a better result than forcing the participant to persist with the same pattern or drop out. Behavioural choice theory suggests that patients who receive the treatment that they prefer will have better outcomes in the context of a behavioural modification
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In chronic conditions, and particularly with regard to dietary modifications, the involvement and preferences of the patient may be particularly important as treatments are likely to require considerable long term lifestyle changes. Normal clinical practice is rarely as flexible as this with few practitioners endeavouring to determine patient needs and likes but we believe this is essential for long term success. Few lifestyle intervention studies have investigated choice or preference of treatment in terms of obesity and they have mostly been short in duration or small in size. In a small pilot study, Murray
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] found no differences between the group who received their preference and those who did not. Similarly, Renjilian found no difference comparing those who received their preferred treatment (group or individual therapy) for obesity and group therapy was far more successful
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. It is possible in this study that the power of group therapy trumps the loss of choice. In contrast to the behavioural choice theory, Burke <italic>et al</italic>. in a large 18&#x000a0;month study found that those who received their preference had less weight loss than those who did not
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. A larger two year study by Borridale <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] found that those who did not receive their preference did significantly better than those who did. No gender effects were explored. Thus overall the literature would suggest that choice has either no effect or counterintuitively leads to worse outcomes in obesity trials. This may relate to the reasons people have become obese in which free choice is clearly detrimental.</p><p>No dietary preference weight loss studies have been performed dealing specifically with diabetes or pre&#x02013;diabetes. To our knowledge there have also been no dietary intervention studies investigating preference of treatment that have allowed subjects to change diets during the intervention. Weight loss is greater in men than in women in most studies, including those in people with type 2 diabetes
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In the present work, we conducted a 12&#x000a0;month weight loss study in people with diabetes and pre-diabetes with the hypothesis that giving the participant the ability to choose from and interchange between a selection of diets, as opposed to being prescribed a set diet throughout, will (i) reduce dropout rates, and (ii) lead to improved weight loss and cardio-metabolic outcomes. We expected men would lose more weight than women and that weight loss would be greater with dietary choice in both groups.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>A total of 144 volunteers with a prior diagnosis of type 2 diabetes or pre-diabetes (self-reported as diagnosed by a physician) aged 40 &#x02013; 75 y and a current BMI &#x0003e;27&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup> were recruited, primarily using advertisements in a diabetes magazine and the daily newspaper. Potential participants were posted a brief summary of the principles of each of the three diets and were further able to view the diet plans during a pre-enrolment information session where they were told that all three diets had been shown to be effective in weight loss, with no bias towards any one diet. At the information session, participants gave consent and selected their diet of choice should they be randomly allocated to the Choice group. At the baseline visit they were given full dietary information for the CSIRO diet (No Choice group) or the diet that they had earlier selected. Informed written consent was obtained from all volunteers, and the study was approved by the Alfred Health Human Ethics Committee (24/11).</p><p>Subjects on any medication for type 2 diabetes, including insulin, were considered eligible. Exclusion criteria were prior gastric surgery for weight loss, already following a weight loss diet, taking appetite-altering drugs, or an unwillingness to adhere (e.g. they only wanted to follow one particular diet if enrolled in the study) to one or more of the experimental diets for 12&#x000a0;months (excluding short periods of up to three days).

Subjects were randomized by random number generated using computer software (Excel 2007, Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA) to either the &#x0201c;No Choice&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;Choice&#x0201d; group after consenting to participate with an allocation ratio (Choice: No Choice) of 1 : 1.03. All enrolment procedures (random number generation, participant enrolment and assignment to one of the two groups) were undertaken by one or more of the researchers using an identical procedure to ensure consistency. Those allocated to the Choice group (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;71) could choose which of the three study diets they wanted to follow and were able to seek permission from the research team to switch between these diets at any time. Those in the No Choice group (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;73) were placed on the CSIRO diet without any option to change diets. Dietary advice was given by an Honours student and a Nutrition PhD. No dietetic professionals were used. Both knowledge transfer about the diet composition as well as motivation was explored in the diet sessions. Behavioural issues such as snacking and alcohol use which would be common to all diets were explored.</p><p>Primary outcomes were weight and HbA<sub>1c</sub>. Secondary outcomes were fasting glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol (total, HDL and LDL) and high sensitivity c-reactive protein (hs-CRP) measured at baseline, 3&#x000a0;months, 6&#x000a0;months and 12&#x000a0;months using venous fasting blood samples. Weight (Model: Well-being, A&#x00026;D Company Limited, Tokyo, Japan), blood pressure (BP) (OMRON Automatic Blood Pressure Monitor, Model HEM-907, OMRON Corporation, Kyoto, Japan) and height (using a stadiometer) were recorded at baseline. In between the baseline and 3&#x000a0;month visits, participants met with a member of the research team fortnightly, with only weight and BP recorded. At these fortnightly visits, further dietary advice was provided to all participants during a one-on-one 20&#x000a0;minute consultation. Participants were encouraged by the research team to return to the clinic to be measured regardless of whether they complied with any dietary protocol. For the remainder of the study (excluding the 3, 6 and 12&#x000a0;month visits), visits increased to 6&#x000a0;weeks apart and changed to researcher-led group sessions of an hour in duration covering nutrition education (e.g. interpreting nutrition information on food labels) and behavioral issues with regard to weight loss and weight maintenance. There was no segregation of participants by diet group allocation (&#x02018;No Choice&#x02019; or &#x02018;Choice&#x02019;) or diet (CSIRO, SB, MED) for these group sessions.

Even with the same diet (CSIRO) men on No Choice did better (weight loss of 4.6&#x000a0;kg versus 2.4&#x000a0;kg for those in Choice), although this was not statistically significant (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.17) because of the small sample size.

<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Due to the fact that participants were asked to select their diet preference before they were allocated to the Choice or No Choice group, it was possible to determine how many participants received their diet preference and also determine if there was a gender preference in the overall group. Of the people who were placed in the No Choice group, 24 had selected MED and 19 had selected SB as their diet preference. As such, just under half (41%) of the 73 participants in the No Choice group were placed on their diet of preference (CSIRO), compared to 48% of participants in the Choice group who chose CSIRO diet and would therefore have been given their diet of preference even if they had instead been placed in the No Choice group. There was no significant difference between diet groups regarding those who chose CSIRO and those who did not. There were significant (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) gender differences between diet preferences (prior to diet group allocation) when comparing the proportion of males and females who selected SB versus MED, SB versus CSIRO and CSIRO versus MED. Men favored SB (9 f, 21&#x000a0;m) and MED (22 f, 29&#x000a0;m) whilst women favored CSIRO (35 f, 28&#x000a0;m). These gender ratios were similar to those for participants who were actually placed in the Choice group, i.e. women favored the CSIRO diet (19 f, 16&#x000a0;m), whilst the MED diet (9 f, 15&#x000a0;m) and SB diet (2 f, 9&#x000a0;m) were more popular amongst men, although differences in gender proportions were only significant for SB relative to the two other diets (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05).</p></sec><sec><title>Diet changes</title><p>Only five participants in the Choice group changed diets during the study: two from MED to CSIRO, one from MED to SB, one from CSIRO to SB and one from CSIRO to MED (Figure&#x000a0;

Study staff were not aware of any participant in the No Choice group attempting to follow any diet plan other than CSIRO (i.e. had changed diets) nor any participant in the Choice group who had changed to another Choice diet without the prior knowledge of study staff. This was based on frequent questioning of participants by study staff during check-ups.</p></sec><sec><title>Retention rates</title><p>Of the 144 participants at baseline, those remaining in the trial at key milestones were: 122 participants (85%) at 3&#x000a0;months, 112 participants (78%) at 6&#x000a0;months and 96 participants (67%) at 12&#x000a0;months (Figure&#x000a0;

Although a larger number of men (73%) compared to women (59%) completed the trial, the gender difference was not significant. There was no instance of participant withdrawal due to a participant being randomly allocated to Choice (when No Choice was preferred) or No Choice (when Choice was preferred). Retention rates by allocated group (Choice and No Choice) were comparable (Choice: 66%, No choice: 67% at 12&#x000a0;months) with no significant difference between Choice and No Choice at 3, 6 or 12&#x000a0;months (p&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.05). The withdrawal rate from the SB diet was significantly higher than for the other diets at 3&#x000a0;months (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) with 4 out of the 11 subjects withdrawing in the first 12&#x000a0;weeks. Of the five withdrawals from SB, three were due to the participant not achieving their weight loss or health goals, which was not a common reason for withdrawal from the other diets (only two other participants gave this as a reason for withdrawal - both in the No Choice group). The most common reason for non-completion, generally, was due to work and/or travel commitments, making it difficult for participants to attend appointments during the study and/or to follow the prescribed diet. Because of the difficulties with the SB diet we have done a separate analysis excluding participants who chose this diet.</p></sec><sec><title>Physical activity changes</title><p>Of the 96 completers, complete baseline and 12&#x000a0;month self-report data on physical activity (PA) was provided by 78 subjects (Choice n&#x02009;=&#x02009;38, No Choice n&#x02009;=&#x02009;40).

The results presented here support a gender-specific approach when offering nutritional advice for weight loss and diabetes management. Specifically, our findings suggest that men may achieve better weight loss outcomes when given a single option. Although our data suggest that offering an array of options to men for weight loss may not lead to the best outcome for the group, clearly within the group there would be many men who would welcome and do better with an array of choices. Some practitioners would also not be comfortable offering only one solution to men. The reasons for men to not do as well with a choice of diets and the ability to change diets is not clear but may relate to lack of confidence in decision making about food and a lack of knowledge compared with women. Dietary advice was given by an Honours student and a Nutrition PhD. No dietetic professionals were used. Both knowledge transfer about the diet composition as well as motivation was explored in the diet sessions. Behavioural issues such as snacking and alcohol use which would be common to all diets were explored even when those in the No Choice group who received their desired diet were removed from the analysis there was still a diet by time by gender interaction ie the loss of choice was the most important factor rather than the diet per se.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. In weight loss studies once a man has made a decision that weight loss is required (which they do much less often than women) they are much more successful at achieving weight loss regardless of the dietary intervention.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Limitations of the present study</title><p>This study was limited by a lack of diet records, measures of satisfaction and a lack of alternative diets in the No Choice group to ensure no one in this group was given their desired diet. Underlying personal traits or behaviors related to the type of diet a person chose may have also effected their success in implementing behavioral lifestyle changes (as opposed to the actual diet plan). For example, people who enjoy cooking, previously shown to be a factor in successful weight management
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], may have chosen CSIRO whilst people who do not make good food choices may have preferred the &#x02018;black and white&#x02019; rules of excluding carbohydrate in SB. Some individuals may have lost considerable weight regardless of the diet due to possessing a good support network, or the necessary skills and behaviors likely to lead to success. Despite the researchers&#x02019; best efforts to be impartial, there may have been bias in the nutritional counseling provided to one group (e.g. diet, gender, diet group) over another. Participants themselves may have had perceptions of what the best diet or diet group was and this may have influenced or been influenced by other participants during group sessions.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, the option to change dietary patterns did not improve retention rates in this weight loss intervention, although gender differences exist in terms of diet selection and weight loss outcomes. For men, clear direction was important. Current dietetic practice generally places little emphasis on gender-specific approaches when offering nutritional advice for weight loss and diabetes management. This is particularly pertinent in the case of women with chronic physical medical conditions who may be attempting to make lifestyle changes without their family&#x02019;s support or willingness to adapt to different dietary patterns. Prescribing a set weight loss regimen to such a patient without consideration of such familial obstacles is more likely to be ineffective and may in fact contribute to the person&#x02019;s low self-esteem (and further weight gain) from repeated failed weight loss attempts.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>BP: Blood pressure; CSIRO: CSIRO diet; DBP: Diastolic blood pressure; HbA1c: Glycosylated haemoglobin; HDL: High-density lipoprotein; hs-CRP: high sensitivity c-reactive protein; LDL: low-density lipoprotein; MED: Mediterranean diet; PA: physical activity; SB: South Beach diet; SBP: Systolic blood pressure.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors have no conflict of interest to report.
