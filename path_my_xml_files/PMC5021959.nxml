Those infants with subsequent behavioral, motor or cognitive dysfunction represent 8&#x02013;11% of all live births. Yet, no interventions employed during pregnancy attenuate risk of morbidity in those at-risk infants. Dietary supplementation with omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (&#x003c9;-3 PUFAs) has been shown to reduce stroke-induced neuropathology in rat models emulating this adverse clinical event. To extend those studies we sought to determine whether maternal dietary supplementation with &#x003c9;-3 PUFAs would confer neuroprotection against hypoxia-induced neurochemical dysfunction in newborn rat pups exposed to repetitive hypoxic insults.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We provided pregnant rats with either a &#x003c9;-3 PUFA enriched diet or else a standard rat chow diet. At postnatal day 7, pups were assigned randomly to either repetitive hypoxic insults or repetitive bursts of room air. On postnatal day 12, pups were sacrificed and brain dopamine levels characterized.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Baseline brain dopamine levels did not differ between rat pups born to dams who received &#x003c9;-3 PUFA enriched versus standard rat chow diets.

The absence of such interventions undermines progress towards mitigating the morbidity and mortality associated with these adverse perinatal events.</p><p>An emerging body of literature suggests that omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (&#x003c9;-3 PUFAs) confer neural resiliency against a number of insults <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Yet, there remains a paucity of data describing whether dietary supplementation with &#x003c9;-3 PUFAs can confer neuroprotection against hypoxic insults occurring in their newborns. To overcome this barrier, this study was designed to characterize the extent that maternal prenatal dietary supplementation with &#x003c9;-3 PUFAs will confer neuroprotective resiliency to the newborn against hypoxia-induced dopamine dysfunction, one neurotransmitter system that is exquisitely vulnerable to such insults <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s0010"><label>2</label><title>Material and methods</title><p>All studies were performed at <italic>Emory University under an IACUC approved protocol (170-2003).</italic> Pregnant rats received dietary supplementation with &#x003c9;-3 PUFAs by adding menhaden fish oil 15% weight by weight (w/w) (Sigma-Aldrich) into standard rat chow mix, to achieve a total daily dose of 3.5&#x02013;4.0&#x000a0;g. The &#x003c9;-3 PUFA enriched diet was initiated on day 1 of pregnancy (confirmed by presence of vaginal plug) and continued through 12 days post-delivery of their pups. Therefore, &#x003c9;-3 PUFA enriched pups received both pre- and postnatal (via maternal colostrum) dietary enrichment with &#x003c9;-3 PUFAs. Control rats pups were born to dams that were maintained on a standard rat chow diet during pregnancy and thereafter.</p><p>Beginning on postnatal (PN) day 7 and continuing through PN 12, both &#x003c9;-3 PUFA-enriched and control newborn pups were assigned randomly to receive either repetitive hypoxic insults or bursts of compressed room air, as described below, for 2&#x000a0;h blocks of time. At the conclusion of each 2&#x000a0;h period, all pups were returned to the dam for a 45&#x000a0;min interval, for feeding and grooming. This sequence was repeated 2 more times each day, totaling three 2-hour sessions of repetitive hypoxic insults or bursts of compressed air. During PN 7&#x02013;12, pups were exposed to either a total daily dose of 6&#x000a0;h of repetitive bursts of hypoxia or normoxia. On PN 12, at the conclusion of the protocol, pups were euthanized for neurochemistry. Our protocol for inducing repetitive hypoxic insults has been previously validated (<italic>23</italic>) to insure that it does not induce maternal separation-induced stress in newborn rat pups, which can evoke changes in neurochemistry <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>.</p><sec id="s0015"><label>2.1</label><title>Hypoxia-inducing system</title><p>Our hypoxia-inducing system consists of a clear Plexiglas chamber, solenoid valves, and compressed gas <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. The internal environment within the system is warmed and humidified to the appropriate level for each postnatal day of age <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Attached to the hypoxia-inducing chamber is one gas cylinder containing 10% oxygen, 3% carbon dioxide, and nitrogen and a second gas cylinder containing only compressed air. After placing the rats into the chamber, a programmable timer opens the solenoid valve between the hypoxic gas cylinder and hypoxic chamber for a 20&#x000a0;s period, allowing introduction of the hypoxic gas mixture at a flow rate of 10 liters per minute, which provides 18.5 complete air exchanges per minute within the chamber. As the solenoid valve closes, the second solenoid valve, attached to the gas cylinder containing only compressed air, opens for 40&#x000a0;s. These alternate on and off to expose the rats to 20&#x000a0;s bursts of hypoxia, followed by 40&#x000a0;s bursts of room air, thereby inducing 60 hypoxic events per hour. This novel system allows for a user-selected frequency and duration of hypoxic insults, thereby permitting us to determine the specific hypoxic &#x0201c;doses&#x0201d; delivered. In addition to the hypoxia-inducing chambers, we also use identically constructed normoxic chambers. Solenoid valves of these chambers are attached to cylinders containing only compressed air, which cycled through the chambers at the same flow rates and frequency as gas flowed through the hypoxia-inducing chamber. The normoxia chamber acted as a control for rats receiving hypoxic gas and for any potential impact associated with maternal separation <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Additionally, the duplicate use of solenoid valves and a compressed gas source on the normoxia chamber allow further control of other factors such as sound, pressure changes, or temperature fluctuations, all of which are intrinsic to compressed gas sources.</p></sec><sec id="s0020"><label>2.2</label><title>HPLC assessment of brain tissue content of dopamine</title><p>Briefly, rats were decapitated and neural tissue was dissected from the precommissural striatum at coordinates previously described <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.

That review summarized outcomes from multiple clinical trials assessing whether supplementing infant formula with &#x003c9;-3 PUFA's was safe and beneficial, to term infants.

Therefore, their conclusion that &#x003c9;-3 PUFA's added to diets of healthy newborn children <italic>did not enhance</italic> physical, neurodevelopment or visual outcomes is not surprising. It also could explain the divergence between other study findings that &#x003c9;-3 PUFA enriched diets could preserve physical, neurodevelopmental or visual integrity in rodent models of hypoxic, ischemic, anoxic events <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Despite those compelling findings, there have been no randomized controlled clinical trials to assess the efficacy of &#x003c9;-3 PUFA enriched diets for conferring neural resiliency against hypoxic insults in prematurely born children. Our preliminary studies suggest that prenatal dietary supplementation with &#x003c9;-3 PUFA's do indeed confer neuroprotection against such adverse clinical events.</p><p>Our novel rodent model of maternal dietary supplementation enabled us to better control for environmental factors that we have frequently encountered during our human-based studies <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. For example, our rodent model is not encumbered by the complexities associated with controlling for human dietary indiscretion that can negatively impact the assessment of nutritional supplements. In addition, the experimental flexibility provided by our rodent model enabled direct measurements of dopaminergic function and structure that cannot be readily performed in humans. We believe that by first defining the neurochemical outcomes conferred by &#x003c9;-3 PUFA dietary supplementation in our rodent model, our future human-based protocols will be free to focus on hypothesis testing, rather than generation.</p><p>We selected to use 7&#x02013;12 day old rat pups since seven day old rat's cerebral cortex is comparable to humans born around 37 weeks (premature birth) <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. By 12 days of age, the rat pup's cortex is developmentally similar to a human born between 40 and 42 weeks gestation (term birth). We have previously shown that during this period of critical brain development, hypoxic insults induce significant impairment in brain dopamine systems <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Therefore, to be considered effective, we believe any putative neuroprotectant should confer resiliency to the dopamine system, against hypoxia, during this time period of vulnerability. Our findings suggest that &#x003c9;-3 PUFAs may achieve this goal.</p><p>Another relevant feature of our model is the use of an isocapnic, hypoxia-inducing gas mixture of 10% oxygen, 3&#x02013;5% carbon dioxide, and balance nitrogen. This mixture evolved from our prior studies in both humans <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref> and animals <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref> employing both hypobaric and hypoxic challenges. During those studies we added 3.0&#x02013;5.0% carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) into the inspired gas mixture to provide an &#x0201c;atmospheric&#x0201d; pressure near 38&#x000a0;Torr. During hypoxic challenges, the addition of 3.0% supplemental inspired CO<sub>2</sub> maintains the partial pressure of arterial CO<sub>2</sub> (PaCO<sub>2</sub>) within the normative range of 38&#x02013;45&#x000a0;mmHg. This prevents the acute reduction in PaCO<sub>2</sub> that can occur during post-apnea hyperventilation (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). Thus, during our protocol, pups become hypoxemic and hyperventilated, their inspired gas mixture sustained a PaC0<sub>2</sub> within the upper end of the normative range. The net result was a relatively pure hypoxic insult without corresponding hypo- or hypercapnia, and other abrupt perturbations to acid&#x02013;base physiology. We believe that minimizing potential blood acidosis (induced by CO<sub>2</sub> buildup during apnea or anoxia) and alkalosis (induced by post-apnea hyperventilation), our gas mixture and hypoxia-inducing protocol provides insight into the pathogenic effect of hypoxia alone, and subsequently the neuroprotective effect of &#x003c9;-3 PUFAs against hypoxia. Future experiments may be performed with gas mixtures designed to induce both hypoxia and hypercapnia, to further define the efficacy of &#x003c9;-3 PUFAs against more severe apneic events.</p><p>Our selection of 10% oxygen within our gas mixture was informed by our prior studies in which we employed indwelling arterial catheters with simultaneous pulse oximetry to measure both partial pressures of arterial oxygen (PaO<sub>2</sub>) and hemoglobin oxygen saturation (SaO<sub>2</sub>) in rats exposed to hypobaric as well as hypoxic hypoxia <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. Those studies revealed that a sustained inspired oxygen content of 10% produced a PaO<sub>2</sub> of approximately 40&#x000a0;mmHg with a corresponding SaO<sub>2</sub> of 75&#x02013;80%. As <xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> illustrates, an SaO<sub>2</sub> near 80% is within the range observed during apneic events in a prematurely born infant at a gestational age of approximately 50 weeks at the time of the recording.</p><sec id="s0045"><label>4.1</label><title>Limitations and future studies</title><p>We acknowledge that our study design cannot provide insight into whether putative &#x003c9;-3 PUFA conferred neuroprotection originated within the <italic>fetal brain</italic> prior to birth via &#x003c9;-3 PUFA's conveyed in fetal circulation, or following birth via &#x003c9;-3 PUFA's conveyed in mother's colostrum <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. If neuroprotection occurred prior to birth, this may suggest that &#x003c9;-PUFA's were conveyed directly through placental circulation.

In addition, future studies are also needed to characterize the relationship between the dietary content of consumed &#x003c9;-PUFA's with subsequent circulatory and neuronal levels.</p><p>Our study was not designed to uncover the potential mechanism through which &#x003c9;-3 PUFA's conferred their beneficial effects. Recent observation by Chang et al. <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref> suggest that the DHA component of &#x003c9;-3 PUFA's suppress post-ischemia neural damage by suppressing release of proinflammatory cytokines. Oxidative damage was concomitantly attenuated by reducing c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) phosphorylation and activating protein (AP-1) signaling. Future studies are needed to determine if these same mechanisms contributed to the neuroprotection of the dopamine system that we observed in &#x003c9;-3 PUFA enriched newborns pups exposed to hypoxic insults.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0050"><label>5</label><title>Conclusions</title><p>In spite of this study's potential limitations, our novel findings suggest that it may be feasible to confer some degree of neuroprotection to newborns at risk for hypoxic insults. Our future studies are directed towards characterizing the extent that behavioral, motor and cognitive function is also preserved in &#x003c9;-3 PUFA enriched newborns exposed to those insults. Collectively, those and other studies are necessary to confirm and extend findings presented here. Doing so may also provide the scientific rationale to begin considering the feasibility to shift current clinical paradigms away from focusing only upon maximizing the remaining function of the post-hypoxic brain, to proactively conferring neuroprotection against such insults.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation
