Surgery can result in greater impairment of quality of life than the original prolapse itself (such as the development of new-onset urinary incontinence, or prolapse at a different site). Anterior and posterior prolapse surgery is most common (90&#x000a0;% of operations), but around 43&#x000a0;% of women also have a uterine (34&#x000a0;%) or vault (9&#x000a0;%) procedure at the same time. There is not enough evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to guide management of vault or uterine prolapse. The Vault or Uterine prolapse surgery Evaluation (VUE) study aims to assess the surgical management of upper compartment pelvic organ prolapse (POP) in terms of clinical effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and adverse events.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>VUE is two parallel, pragmatic, UK multicentre, RCTs (Uterine Trial and Vault Trial). Eligible for inclusion are women with vault or uterine prolapse: requiring a surgical procedure, suitable for randomisation and willing to be randomised. Randomisation will be computer-allocated separately for each trial, minimised on: requiring concomitant anterior and/or posterior POP surgery or not, concomitant incontinence surgery or not, age (under 60&#x000a0;years or 60&#x000a0;years and older) and surgeon. Participants will be randomly assigned, with equal probability to intervention or control arms in either the Uterine Trial or the Vault Trial. Uterine Trial participants will receive either a vaginal hysterectomy or a uterine preservation procedure. Vault Trial participants will receive either a vaginal sacrospinous fixation or an abdominal sacrocolpopexy. Participants will be followed up by postal questionnaires (6&#x000a0;months post surgery and 12&#x000a0;months post randomisation) and also reviewed in clinic 12&#x000a0;months post surgery. The primary outcome is the participant-reported Pelvic Organ Prolapse Symptom Score (POP-SS) at 12&#x000a0;months post randomisation.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Demonstrating the efficacy of vault and uterine prolapse surgeries is relevant not only to patients and clinicians but also to health care providers, both in the UK and globally.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Current controlled trials <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN86784244">ISRCTN86784244</ext-link> (assigned 19 October 2012), and the first subject was randomly assigned on 1 May 2013&#x000a0;</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s13063-016-1576-x) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Uterine</kwd><kwd>Vault</kwd><kwd>Prolapse</kwd><kwd>Hysterectomy</kwd><kwd>Suspension</kwd><kwd>Symptoms</kwd><kwd>Randomised controlled trial</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000272</institution-id><institution>National Institute for Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>11/129/183</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Glazener</surname><given-names>Cathryn</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>The reasons for the trial (see also Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> for further background):</p><p>Gynaecologists have recognised for some time that both anatomical failure and recurrence of prolapse symptoms after surgery are common: one in three women who have a prolapse operation will go on to have another, though not necessarily in the same compartment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. More recently, it has also been recognised that surgery can be followed by a greater impairment of quality of life than from the original prolapse itself (e.g. the development of new-onset urinary incontinence after surgery, or prolapse at a different site). While anterior and posterior prolapse surgery is most common (90&#x000a0;% of operations), around 43&#x000a0;% of women also have a uterine (34&#x000a0;%) or vault (9&#x000a0;%) procedure at the same time. Indeed, this demonstrates that women who have a hysterectomy have around a 27&#x000a0;% chance of needing a subsequent vault prolapse repair.</p><p>These data are derived from the first 700 women recruited in PROSPECT (PROlapse Surgery: Pragmatic Evaluation and randomised Controlled Trials in women with anterior or posterior pelvic organ prolapse), a large HTA-funded UK randomised controlled trial (RCT) of anterior or posterior prolapse surgery with or without the use of mesh (HTA No. 07/60/18) also being undertaken by the research team. VUE is a follow-on trial in which women will be randomised to different surgical options for upper compartment prolapse (vault and uterine). This protocol sets out our plans for running VUE.</p><p>Our aim is to identify the optimal surgical procedures for women with a vault or a uterine prolapse, which will provide women with the best symptomatic cure and lowest adverse effect and reoperation rates. Given the number of prolapse procedures currently performed and the anticipated rise in the need for such surgery with an ageing population, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] the potential cost implications for the health service are considerable. The findings will guide gynaecologists in their surgical practice and purchasers in their choice of provision of health care. The study aims to identify which procedures are not only most clinically effective but also most cost-effective.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Summary of evidence base</title><p>Systematic reviews have demonstrated that there was not enough evidence to guide practice for women contemplating surgery for their vault or uterine prolapse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The trials for vault surgery were individually too small to be conclusive and, hence, guide practice. Three RCTs broadly addressed hysterectomy versus uterine preservation approaches, but differences in the approaches and techniques used, and the outcome measures reported, precluded any useful meta-analysis or conclusions. Thus, there is no reliable evidence to guide women and their gynaecologists in choosing the best surgical cure for vault or uterine prolapse.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Implications for proposed project</title><p>There is insufficient information about any of the surgical options to guide management of vault or uterine prolapse in women. We have identified, from PROSPECT and Health Episode Statistics (HES) data that around a third of women with prolapse have a hysterectomy for uterine prolapse. At least 25&#x000a0;% (HES data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]) and 27&#x000a0;% (PROSPECT data) of these women go on to have a subsequent vault prolapse procedure. The evidence base for treating either of these groups of women is clearly inadequate, with very little evidence regarding subjective prolapse symptoms, effect on quality of life, cost-effectiveness and safety.</p><p>This study will fulfil the research need identified by the Cochrane review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and the Interventional Procedures (IP) review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] for adequately powered RCTs of the surgical options for women having vault or uterine prolapse surgery. It will comprise two of the largest, rigorous and independent RCTs comparing traditional prolapse operations with each other. We will take into account the different clinical characteristics of women having concomitant procedures such as anterior or posterior repair, or incontinence surgery, and identify confounding factors which may predict outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Choice of comparators</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Uterine Trial</title><p>The two options for uterine prolapse concern removal or retention of the uterus. There are a number of surgical approaches to both options (vaginal, open abdominal, laparoscopic, robotic laparoscopic) and for pragmatic reasons we intend to allow surgeons to choose the techniques which they routinely use, within certain broad categories. This will allow the maximum number of gynaecologists to recruit to VUE.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Vault Trial</title><p>The two broad approaches to vault suspension are vaginal or abdominal. There is a general clinical opinion that the vaginal approach has a higher recurrence rate but it is simpler to perform and has less morbidity, but there is no good evidence to underpin this. Again there are different techniques to both approaches, and we intend to allow gynaecologists to use their preferred operations, again within certain broad categories.</p><p>These comparators will be further debated within the clinical and research community through the Research Committee of the British Society of Urogynaecology (BSUG) with the aim that VUE will be adopted by the Society.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Principal objectives</title><p>The two parallel trials will compare:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p><italic>Uterine Trial</italic>: in women having uterine prolapse surgery, the effects of removal of the uterus versus uterine preservation</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Vault Trial</italic>: in women having vault prolapse surgery, the effects of a vaginal vault suspension versus an abdominal vault suspension</p></list-item></list></p><p>The primary objective is to determine the optimal surgical management for women with upper compartment (vault or uterine) pelvic organ prolapse in terms of clinical effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and adverse events (AEs).</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Secondary objectives</title><p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>To determine the differential effects on other outcomes such as urinary, sexual and bowel function, quality of life, general health, need for secondary surgery and adverse effects</p></list-item><list-item><p>To identify possible effect modifiers (e.g. concomitant procedures, age, complex prolapse types)</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Methods/design</title><p>VUE comprises two parallel, multicentre, RCTs of surgery for women with vault or uterine prolapse.

A log will be maintained of all women meeting the eligibility criterion (listed for vault or uterine prolapse surgery), describing reasons if they do not enter the study. Every woman will be allocated a unique Study Number.</p><p>Local procedures at the participating hospitals are different and the timing and mode of approach to women and the consent process will vary to accommodate both the variability at the sites and the needs of the women. Each eligible woman will be given or sent a Patient Information Leaflet describing the study, a customised Surgical Information Sheet, a baseline questionnaire and a Consent Form. Each woman will have the opportunity to discuss the study with her gynaecologist. Women will also have the opportunity to discuss all aspects of the study with the local clinical team (staff at preadmission clinics and ward staff while admitted), the research nurse, family and friends and, if appropriate, with their GP before admission. Women may make a decision to participate during a consultation with their gynaecologist, during a visit to hospital (e.g. when they attend a clinic appointment, when they attend for preassessment or when they are admitted for surgery), or alternatively at home. If the woman agrees to be contacted at home (recorded on the Surgical Assessment Form), she may receive a telephone call from the local research nurse to discuss any queries. Women who decide to participate following telephone counselling can either send their completed documents (Consent Form and baseline questionnaire) through the post to the local team at their treating hospital or bring it with them if they are returning to hospital for another consultation or surgery.</p><p>Each woman will be asked for her signed informed consent to be randomised and followed up after her prolapse surgery by postal questionnaires and an examination in the Gynaecology Outpatient Department. The Patient Information Leaflet and the Consent Form will all refer to the possibility of long-term follow-up and being contacted about other prolapse research if the women are willing.</p><p>Each GP will be informed about each of their patients who participate in the study. Hospital staff will be informed about the study by the principal investigator (PI) and the research nurse so that they can answer queries from participants and their relatives.</p><p>All women who enter the study will be assigned a Study Number, complete a baseline questionnaire including measurement of prolapse, bowel, urinary, vaginal and sexual symptoms, and have an objective prolapse assessment (Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification (POP-Q) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]) carried out by the gynaecologist or the research nurse. Women who consent will be randomised into one of the trial arms appropriate for her type of prolapse. Randomisation will be carried out as close to the time of surgery as is practical, taking into account the hospital routines and timely need for setting up the operating theatre.</p><p>All consenting women will be asked to complete the follow-up questionnaires at 6 and 12&#x000a0;months at home. They will also have a review appointment with their gynaecologist at 12&#x000a0;months to evaluate the results of surgery using the POP-Q examination and identify problems or need for other treatment. This amounts to considerably more postoperative surveillance than is available routinely in the NHS, and should ensure that all women receive optimum care.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Number of centres involved</title><p>We aim to recruit women from approximately 40 centres, many of which also participated in PROSPECT.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Methods to protect against sources of bias</title><sec id="Sec15"><title>Randomisation (avoiding selection bias)</title><p>When contact details, essential baseline information and confirmation of signed consent are entered into the Internet-based VUE database, the local researcher will be able to randomise the woman in the trial for which she is eligible (see flow diagram, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Randomisation will be carried out as close to the time of surgery as is practical taking into account the hospital routines and time needed for setting up the operating theatre.</p><p>Every woman will be logged with the Study Office and given a unique Study Number. Randomisation will utilise the existing proven remote automated computer randomisation application at the study administrative centre in the Centre for Healthcare Randomised Trials (CHaRT, a fully registered UK CRC Clinical Trials Unit) in the Health Services Research Unit, University of Aberdeen. This randomisation application will be available as an Internet-based service.</p><p>Randomisation will be computer-allocated separately for each trial and minimised on:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>need for a concomitant anterior and/or posterior POP operation or none</p></list-item><list-item><p>need for a concomitant incontinence procedure (e.g. tension-free vaginal tape (TVT)) or not</p></list-item><list-item><p>age (under 60&#x000a0;years or 60 and older), and</p></list-item><list-item><p>surgeon</p></list-item></list></p><p>The choice of operations available to randomised women will be determined by whether they are having vault or uterine prolapse surgery. The basic criterion for joining the study is that the gynaecologist must be uncertain regarding the best operative technique for the majority of patients, and they must be competent to perform the operations to be compared (i.e. be &#x02018;beyond&#x02019; the learning curve).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Ensuring standardisation of intervention and outcome measurement (avoiding performance bias)</title><p>Both specialist urogynaecologists and general gynaecologists will be eligible for recruiting and randomising women, thus extending the generalisability of the trial and the future transfer of skills. All gynaecologists will be proficient in performing the POP-Q [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] method of objective quantification of prolapse descent used pre and postoperatively.</p><p>All gynaecologists will complete a Surgical Standardisation Form to provide details of their preferred operative techniques. The gynaecological surgeons who have agreed to participate in the study have extensive experience and training in prolapse surgery. Any additional training required will be conducted by the clinical grant applicants and will be directed towards ensuring standardisation of their existing techniques and outcome measures.</p><p>The research nurses and the surgeons will complete a Recruitment Officer Case Report Form (ROCRF) (developed for PROSPECT and to be adapted for VUE) at the time of surgery to ensure a complete record of all surgical techniques and materials used and any intraoperative difficulties or complications. The research nurses in each centre will ensure completeness and accuracy of data entry using remote data capture via a study web-based portal at the Study Office in Aberdeen, authored and managed by the UK CRC-registered Clinical Trials Unit in Aberdeen (CHaRT).</p><p>As this is a pragmatic trial, postoperative care will be according to local centre practice but clinical and resource-use data will be recorded.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Loss to follow-up (attrition bias)</title><p>We have used a conservative estimate of 15&#x000a0;% loss to follow-up in the power calculations. We will take very active measures to minimise such loss, such as telephoning the women, using retention incentives and checks with their GPs. In addition we will obtain consent from the women to enable us to access centrally-held NHS data, for example, via the NHS Strategic Tracing Service in England and Wales, and using Community Health Index (CHI) numbers from the Information Services Division in Scotland. We have extensive experience of using such strategies and measures and have received ethics approval to do so in previous studies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Other sources of bias (detection bias)</title><p>Group allocation will be concealed from the woman and the ward staff if clinically possible, although blinding in theatre is not possible given that this is a surgical trial. However, we do not feel that it is necessary or ethical to perform sham incisions to conceal the route of surgery. Outcome assessment is largely by participant self-completed questionnaire, so avoiding interviewer bias. However, the clinical review at 12&#x000a0;months in the Outpatients Department (secondary outcome) will be conducted by staff blinded to allocation by performing the POP-Q examination, without knowledge of the actual procedure performed when possible. Participants will undergo an objective vaginal POP-Q assessment before the group allocation is revealed. Women and research staff will not be explicitly informed of which operation was randomly selected, although examination may reveal which operation was actually carried out, and women will be told if they wish to know.</p><p>Research staff who are blinded to allocation will conduct the data collection, data entry and analysis using Study Numbers only to identify women and questionnaires. All women will be actively followed up, with analysis based on the intention-to-treat principle. All analyses will be clearly predefined to avoid bias, and will be rehearsed in PROSPECT to ensure compatibility of results.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Original sample size</title><p>In the Uterine Trial, 268 women in each arm would be required to achieve 90&#x000a0;% power to detect a difference in the primary outcome measure (i.e. POP-SS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] at 1&#x000a0;year following surgery) of 0.28 of a standard deviation at a significance level of 5&#x000a0;% (two-sided alpha). Allowing for 15&#x000a0;% loss to follow-up at 1&#x000a0;year would require 315 to be recruited to each arm (630 in total). The accumulating PROSPECT data indicate that a conservative estimate of the standard deviation of the primary outcome is 7 units and a difference in means of 2 units would represent a clinically important difference in POP-SS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Therefore, a standardised effect size of 2/7&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.28 standard deviations (SDs) is used.</p><p>A smaller number of women would be expected to be recruited to the Vault Trial. Using data from the women recruited to PROSPECT to date with vault or uterine prolapse, the expected number of recruits to the Vault Trial can be estimated at 27&#x000a0;% of that recruited to the Uterine Trial. Therefore, in the time that 630 women could be recruited to the Uterine Trial, an expected 85 women would be recruited to each arm of the Vault Trial (170 in total). A trial of 170 would have 80&#x000a0;% power to detect a difference of 0.43 SDs at a 5&#x000a0;% significance level (two-sided alpha). A standardised effect size of 0.43 equates to a difference in means of 3 units in the POP-SS measure.</p><p>In total, based on these assumptions, the number of recruits required across both trials would be 800 women.</p><p>PROSPECT data show that the mean monthly number of women randomised is 2.2 per centre and that 39&#x000a0;% of anterior/posterior prolapses, 259/(405&#x02009;+&#x02009;259) (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>) required concomitant upper vaginal prolapse surgery. Given that PROSPECT has the same inclusion criteria as this study and assuming that randomisation rates will be the same as in PROSPECT, a centre can be expected to recruit 0.86 women per month from those who would previously have been randomised in PROSPECT. PROSPECT data also show that 7&#x000a0;% of women presenting with vaginal prolapse require upper compartment surgery only &#x02013; these women are not eligible for randomisation in PROSPECT, but would be eligible to be randomised in VUE. Assuming that randomisation rates are the same in this group of women, the expected monthly recruitment can, therefore, be inflated to 0.93 per site, i.e. 0.73 for the Uterine Trial and 0.2 for the Vault Trial. In order to recruit 630 women to the Uterine Trial and 170 to the Vault Trial, 40 centres will need to be recruited over twenty-four calendar months, allowing for a staggered start. The trial inception will be in the three centres led by the coapplicants, with recruitment subsequently rolling out to the other centres.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Recruitment extension and increase in Vault Trial sample size</title><p>At steady state, recruitment rate of the Uterine Trial was assumed to be approximately 29 women per month. Recruitment has been slower than anticipated, and is currently averaging 15 per month. Reasons for lower recruitment include women&#x02019;s preference (particularly for a hysterectomy) and lower than anticipated consent rates (around 30&#x000a0;% of those approached to participate in the Uterine Trial consent to do so, compared to the 50&#x000a0;% anticipated). As a result, an extension to the recruitment phase (an additional 15&#x000a0;months) is necessary to achieve the original target sample size (630).</p><p>PROSPECT data showed that the number of women requiring vault repair is approximately 27&#x000a0;% of the number presenting with uterine prolapse. Therefore, during the original time period for randomising 630 women to the Uterine Trial, it was anticipated that a further 170 women requiring vault repair would also be randomised to the Vault Trial.</p><p>Recruitment rates to the Vault Trial are in line with original predictions. With an additional 15&#x000a0;months of recruitment, the Vault Trial will continue to recruit beyond the original sample size of 170.</p><p>Conservatively assuming an average of 7 women randomised per month, we project a revised total of 280 Vault Trial participants may be recruited, which is 140 per arm or 119 allowing for 15&#x000a0;% loss to follow-up. This would give 80&#x000a0;% power to detect a difference of 0.36 SDs at 5&#x000a0;% significance level (two-sided alpha). A standardised effect size of 0.36 SDs equates to a difference in means of 2.5 units in the primary outcome (POP-SS), considering a SD of 7. This is a smaller difference than originally calculated (i.e. 3 units, with 80&#x000a0;% power). This also equates to a relative reduction in the width of the confidence interval of 22&#x000a0;% when compared to the precision without the extension. As the POP-SS at baseline is higher in women with vault prolapse (15.2 versus 12.0 in women with a uterine prolapse, data from PROSPECT) we could reasonably expect a greater difference after surgery.</p><p>It is anticipated that 1820 eligible women will need to be screened in order to achieve the recruitment rates required (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Recruitment numbers expected</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th>Uterine Trial<break/>

Personal costs to the women will also be investigated.</p></sec><sec id="Sec46"><title>Resource use and costs</title><p>Health care resource use will be recorded prospectively for every patient within the study. For the surgical interventions, operative details will be recorded at the time of surgery (e.g. the time the surgery takes, the time spent in recovery, grade of surgeon and assistant, grade of anaesthetist). A parallel exercise will establish resources used immediately before, during and after (i.e. in recovery) the operation, for example, other staff, consumables (surgical requisites, mesh), and capital (costs associated with using the theatre facilities, costs of using reusable equipment). Costs to the patients will be collected using a questionnaire based on one developed by the UK working party on patient costs. The use of secondary care services (e.g. length of hospital stay, outpatient appointments, readmission) will be abstracted from patient notes or questionnaires. The use of primary care services, including medications will be collected using a patient questionnaire. Unit costs/prices will be obtained using published estimates for health care services and/or interventions.</p><p>Self-purchased health care is likely to include items such as pads bought by the participant, prescription costs and over-the-counter medications.

Incremental cost-utility ratios will be computed comparing the interventions. The difference in utility will be expressed in terms of QALYs. Where appropriate the analysis of incremental costs, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness will be based on similar statistical models as those outlined in the statistical analysis above. Similarly, and where the data allow, the identification of appropriate subgroups for analysis will be similar to that of the statistical analysis. This &#x02018;within-trial&#x02019; analysis will include both deterministic and stochastic sensitivity analyses to explore statistical and other forms (e.g. around unit costs or the source of utility estimates) of uncertainty.</p></sec><sec id="Sec49"><title>Modelling of longer-term outcomes</title><p>While the within-study results will prove useful it is important to note that prolapse is a chronic condition and the effects of treatment on costs and outcomes may persist into the future. An economic model which considers a longer-time horizon will be developed to provide additional information for policy-makers. In the model, the findings of the trial will be extrapolated to the patient&#x02019;s lifetime. The model will describe care pathways that women may follow and will include the initial surgery and any subsequent treatments. The structure of the model will be developed in collaboration with clinicians and trial collaborators. Parameter estimates for relative effectiveness up to 1&#x000a0;year, costs and utilities will be derived from the trial data. Data from the trial will be supplemented with data from other sources (e.g. Cochrane reviews). Estimates of mortality will be based on data from life tables. Mortality rates will be adjusted, where necessary, using relative risks of mortality after prolapse surgery. These data will be obtained from the literature. These data will be assembled systematically and will follow guidelines for good practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>Outcomes in the model will be expressed in terms of an incremental cost per QALY. Parameter uncertainty will be integrated by the incorporation of probability distributions into the model and involve Monte Carlo simulation. Other forms of uncertainty such as that associated with choices made about the structure of the model, discount rate, etc., will be addressed through sensitivity analysis. The base case and sensitivity analyses will be presented as cost-effectiveness acceptability curves (CEACs). Where data allow, the model will be reestimated for the subgroups identified above for the within-trial analysis. The model will also be used to identify priorities for further research by investigating the expected value of information.</p><p>All study analyses, including the within-trial and modelling analyses, will be conducted according to an economic analysis plan that will be agreed in advance by the VUE Steering Committee.</p></sec><sec id="Sec50"><title>Recruitment rates and milestones</title><sec id="Sec51"><title>Original recruitment rates</title><p>Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> shows the original projected recruitment of centres and participants, and projected number of women to be approached.

This may include analyses of data from other comparable trials. In the light of these interim analyses, the DMC will advise the Steering Committee if, in its view:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>One of the methods of prolapse surgery has been proved, beyond reasonable doubt, to be different from the control (standard management) for all or some types of women (in respect of either effectiveness or unacceptable safety concerns)</p></list-item><list-item><p>The evidence on the economic outcomes is sufficient to guide a decision from health care providers regarding recommendation of which operation to choose</p></list-item></list></p><p>The TSC can then decide whether or not to modify intake to the trial.

The risks are that they may have a suboptimal operation, but any operation carries a risk and it is not known which is optimal or more risky. The benefit to women, the NHS and society is that at the end of the trial it will be known which operations are most effective and cost-effective.</p></sec><sec id="Sec73"><title>Information about risks and benefits and informed consent</title><p>Women will be informed of possible benefits and known risks of participation in the trials by means of a Patient Information Leaflet, discussion with the local research nurses and their own consultant gynaecologist. Women will be having prolapse surgery anyway, and we do not anticipate that they will run additional risks by participating in the trial. They will sign a Consent Form approved by the Ethics Committee. They will be consented to participating in the study with follow-up, being randomised, being contacted in the future about this and other research including electronic tracing using NHS data, and data linkage with computerised NHS data sources. Women who are not able or not willing to be randomised will not be recruited.</p><p>A standardised Surgical Information Sheet, similar to that in use in PROSPECT and using new Patient Information Sheets produced by the BSUG, will be adapted to provide specific clinical information for women about uterine and vault surgical options, including known complications.</p></sec><sec id="Sec74"><title>Satellite studies</title><p>It is recognised that the value of the study will be enhanced by ancillary studies of specific aspects.

All the materials and techniques are already being used in the NHS for prolapse surgery. Your participation in the study is therefore only to help us evaluate these procedures and should not involve any additional risk to you. Taking part in this study does not affect your normal legal rights. Whether or not you do take part, you will retain the same legal rights as any other patient in the NHS (which include professional indemnity insurance for negligence). If you wish to complain about your health care or any aspects of this study, the normal NHS mechanisms will be available to you.&#x02019;</p></sec><sec id="Sec76"><title>Publication</title><p>The success of the study depends entirely on the wholehearted collaboration of a large number of women undergoing prolapse surgery, as well as their nurses and physicians.

The study&#x02019;s publication policy is described in detail in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>. The results of the study will be reported first to the study collaborators. The main report will be drafted by the PMG and circulated to all clinical collaborators for comment.

The benefit to women, the NHS and society is that, at the end of the trial, it will be known which operations are most effective and cost-effective.</p><p>The main practical challenge of this trial has been participant recruitment. Early into the recruitment period we noted a patient preference for the Uterine Trial. Around 70&#x000a0;% of those approached declined to participate, and of these 30&#x000a0;% had a preference (most commonly for a hysterectomy as opposed to uterine preservation). This was somewhat expected but the extent of patient preference was higher than anticipated. The main reasons for patient preference were due to discussions with family members/friends on their experiences, GP influence and an assumption that removing the uterus (hysterectomy) would &#x02018;cure&#x02019; the prolapse. We developed a number of strategies to improve participant recruitment, including changes to the patient information leaflet, further site training. We intend to publish this separately.</p><sec id="Sec78"><title>Trial status</title><p>The first participant was randomised into the trial on 1 May 2013, and the trial is currently open to recruitment in 45 UK centres, with the last participant follow-up expected in August 2017.</p><p>VUE Protocol Version 5: 1 November 2015</p></sec></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec79"><title>Additional files</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="13063_2016_1576_MOESM1_ESM.pdf" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>Further background information.
