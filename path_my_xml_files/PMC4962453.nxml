Medication is often the treatment of choice, as it currently is most effective. However, medication has only short-term effects, treatment adherence is often low and most importantly; medication has serious side effects. Therefore, there is a need for other interventions for youngsters with ADHD. Mindfulness training is emerging as a potentially effective training for children and adolescents with ADHD.

Participants will be youngsters (aged 9 to 18) of both sexes diagnosed with ADHD, referred to urban and rural mental healthcare centers. We aim to include 120 families. The mindfulness training, using the MYmind protocol, will be conducted in small groups, and consists of 8 weekly 1.5-h sessions. Youngsters learn to focus and enhance their attention, awareness, and self-control by doing mindfulness exercises. Parents will follow a parallel mindful parenting training in which they learn to be fully present in the here and now with their child in a non-judgmental way, to take care of themselves, and to respond rather than react to difficult behavior of their child. Short-acting methylphenidate will be administered individually and monitored by a child psychiatrist.

Children and adolescents with ADHD show inattentive, impulsive, and hyperactive behavior that interferes with their (social) functioning or development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] and occurs in more than one setting (e.g. in social situations, at school, at work, or at home). Following the diagnostic criteria of the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] inattentive behavior refers to difficulties with organizing and planning tasks or activities and with maintaining attention over prolonged periods of time, such as wandering off during tasks or lacking persistence. Examples of hyperactive behavior are running and climbing in inappropriate situations, fidgeting or tapping with hands or feet, and excessive talking. Impulsivity refers to difficulties with inhibiting proponent responses, such as interrupting or intruding on others&#x02019; conversations or activities, answering before a question has been completed, and making important decisions without forethought. Depending on which key symptom is most present, three types of ADHD classifications can be distinguished: a predominantly inattentive presentation (also known as Attention Deficit Disorder, ADD), a predominantly hyperactive/impulsive presentation, or a combined presentation.</p><p>It has been demonstrated that children and adolescents diagnosed with ADHD have a substantial economical impact on society [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. A meta-analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] reviewed seven European-based studies and found that the average total annual costs related to childhood ADHD lie between &#x020ac;9,860 and &#x020ac;14,483 per patient, and national annual costs ranged from &#x020ac;1,041 to &#x020ac;1,529 million. With 648 million, most costs were related to education. Health care costs for childhood ADHD were estimated between &#x020ac;87 and &#x020ac;377 million, and social services costs were &#x020ac;4.3 million per year. From a family perspective, family members of children and adolescents with ADHD add to the economical burden with &#x020ac;161 million of health care costs, and with &#x020ac;143 to &#x020ac;339 million because of productivity losses.</p><p>Medication and psychosocial interventions are the most commonly used treatments for reducing ADHD symptoms in children and adolescents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Regarding medication for ADHD, psychostimulants, especially methylphenidate, is globally the most prescribed drug [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and is being used increasingly since the 1990&#x02032;s, with a calculated global consumption of 72 tons (2.4 billion defined daily doses for statistical purposes) of methylphenidate in 2013 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Over the years, the highest consumption of methylphenidate took place in the United States. However, since 2000 many other countries, including the Netherlands, show a sharp increase in the use of methylphenidate as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In the Netherlands 130,000 youngsters were using methylphenidate in 2012 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], which was at the time 3.2&#x000a0;% of Dutch youngsters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In 2014 the largest group of methylphenidate users were children with ADHD between 11 and 14&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], more than 70 out of 1000 children in this age category with ADHD were using methylphenidate. Although the amount of diagnoses in the Netherlands increased over the years, and therefore the use of medication as well, the percentage of children on medication remains stable, which is about two-thirds of the children diagnosed with ADHD and one-third of the children diagnosed with ADD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Many studies have shown that methylphenidate is effective in the treatment of childhood ADHD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and that, when controlled for placebo effects, it has beneficial effects for about 70&#x000a0;% of the children with ADHD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. According to international guidelines it is recommended to prescribe methylphenidate as a first drug of choice when pharmacological treatment is indicated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Only when this drug does not reach its intended effects, guidelines advise to move on prescribing other medication (mainly dextroamphetamine and atomoxetine). International guidelines further advise that pharmacological treatment should always be part of a more comprehensive treatment program that includes psycho-education and may include behavioral treatment, parent training, and/or teacher-administered behavior therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. However, guidelines of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] also suggest that when a patient with ADHD experiences robust beneficial effects from pharmacological treatment, and therefore shows normal functioning in several life domains, that this treatment alone is satisfactory. This recommendation is supported by randomized controlled trials (RCTs) such as the Multimodal Treatment of ADHD (MTA) study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and a meta-analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], comparing methylphenidate with psychosocial treatment and their combination.</p><p>In MTA study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] 579 children were randomized over 14&#x000a0;months of methylphenidate treatment, intensive behavioral treatment, a combination of these two treatments, or standard community care. Children receiving combined treatment and medical treatment showed a larger decline in ADHD symptoms compared to children receiving behavioral treatment or community care. Moreover, the combined treatment did not have an additive effect in reducing ADHD symptoms compared to medical treatment alone. Van der Oord et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] compared 24 studies, including the MTA study, about the effectiveness of methylphenidate, psychosocial treatment, or their combination in children with ADHD. It was concluded that both methylphenidate and psychosocial treatment were effective in reducing ADHD symptoms, but that psychosocial treatment alone had smaller effects than methylphenidate and a combined treatment. Similar to the findings of the MTA study, in this meta-analysis psychosocial treatment did not show to have additive value to methylphenidate in recuding ADHD sympotms either. Another meta-analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] compared randomized controlled studies evaluating the effects of non-pharmacological treatment for ADHD, both dietary interventions (Restricted Elimination Diets; <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;7, artificial food color exclusions; <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;8, and free fatty acid supplementation; <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;11) and psychosocial interventions (cognitive training; <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;6, neurofeedback; <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;8, and behavioral interventions; <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;15). For all 6 types of interventions results illustrated a reduction in core ADHD symptoms when rated by a person (often unblinded) closest to the therapeutic setting. However, when ratings from persons blind to the treatment condition were evaluated, only free fatty acid supplementation and artificial food color exclusion remained effective in reducing core ADHD symptoms. The authors concluded that the effect sizes found for non-pharmacological treatments are substantially lower than those found in studies on ADHD medication and that better evidence from blinded assessments is needed for psychosocial interventions for ADHD in order to be offered as evidence-based treatments. In an earlier meta-analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], 174 studies on the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions (parent-based, teacher-based, and child-based) for children with ADHD were included. The overall results show that psychosocial interventions are effective in reducing ADHD symptoms and that effect sizes found in this study are comparable to those found for stimulant medication for ADHD. The difference between the latter two meta-analyses is, however, that Sonuga-Barke et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] only included RCTs falling into the highest category of evidence, that is evidence from at least one RCT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], whereas Fabiano et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] also included studies falling into lower categories of evidence (e.g. uncontrolled studies and single-case studies). Besides, Fabiano et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] included children with externalizing behavior problems but without a diagnosis of ADHD, which may explain part of the highly positive outcomes as well. Lastly, a large recent review on the effects of methylphenidate alone for children and adolescents (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;12.245, ages ranged from 3 to 21&#x000a0;years) with ADHD included 185 RCTs comparing methylphenidate versus placebo or no intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Results show that methylphenidate may reduce the key symptoms of ADHD and may improve general behavior and quality of life. However, due to mostly poor designed research trials and, therefore, high risk of bias for all included studies, the quality of de evidence is low. Better designed RCTs, especially regarding the blinding process, are needed to further establish the evidence of the effectiveness of methylphenidate. Moreover, the authors stress the importance for large RCTs of non-pharmacological treatments for ADHD.</p><p>In sum, the international guidelines for treatment of ADHD, supported by the current knowledge about the effectiveness of methylphenidate compared to the somewhat more ambivalent evidence of the effectiveness of other treatment options, suggest that methylphenidate for children with ADHD is, to date, still the first-line treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Moreover, looking at the cost effectiveness of medication versus behavioral treatment, medication also seems to be the preferred option as it was estimated that medical costs per child with ADHD is $1079 during a period of 14&#x000a0;months, whereas costs for behavioral treatment per child with ADHD is $7176 during that same period of time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Nevertheless, concerns about the frequency of methylphenidate prescriptions and its possible disadvantages are rising increasingly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. These concerns are with good reason, given the literature on the substantial limitations of (stimulant) medication for ADHD. First, usage of stimulant medication may result in side effects such as insomnia, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, headache, anxiety, stress, and nervousness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. In the MTA study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] 64.1&#x000a0;% of the children suffered from one or more mild, moderate, or severe side effects. Second, stimulant medication works only short-term and symptoms return once medication is stopped [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Therefore, children with ADHD must continue the use of medication for extended periods of time in order to maintain the beneficial effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Third, as previously stated, about 70&#x000a0;% of children with ADHD show a symptomatic response to methylphenidate, however, up to 30&#x000a0;% of the children do not benefit from methylphenidate at all [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. When other pharmacological treatments for ADHD are systematically administered, still 10&#x000a0;% of the children do not respond to any of the medications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Fourth, treatment fidelity is often low with nonadherence rates between 13.2 to 64&#x000a0;% in people with ADHD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Nonadherence is greater for short-acting stimulants compared to long-acting stimulants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Nonadherence may be due to inadequate supervision including delayed or missed doses, but also because patients may forget or refuse to take medication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The most prescribed stimulants are short-acting, including methylphenidate, and require intake of 2 or 3 times a day. As a consequence children need to take medication in public, for example at school, which may be embarrassing or (socially) stigmatizing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Fifth, stimulant medication is a contraindication for people with schizophrenia, hyperthyroidism, cardiac arrhythmias, angina pectoris, and glaucoma. Furthermore, extra caution needs to be taken in case of hypertension, depression, tics, epilepsy, anorexia, autism spectrum disorders, severe mental retardation, or a history of drug abuse or alcoholism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Sixth, the safety of medication for children with ADHD is not fully known [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Whereas short-term side effects may be reversible when medication is stopped, little is known about long-term side effects. There is limited literature of the impact of long-term medication use on growth, blood pressure, heart rate, and the occurrence of suicidal, psychotic, and manic symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Some studies found that children with ADHD who take medication for several years show reduced growth and weight compared to their peers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. The difference in growth, however, seems to attenuate over time and there is debate about whether the ultimate adult growth is affected. Seventh, the effectiveness of long-term use of methylphenidate is not fully known [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Studies on the effectiveness of ADHD medication show robust effects on symptom reduction and other life functioning domains up to 2 years later [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. So far, little is known about the effectiveness beyond this period. However, results of the MTA study 8-year follow-up data failed to demonstrate the benefits of medication treatment beyond 2 years for most of the children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].</p><p>Because of the above named limitations and uncertainties, children and their parents may not view medication as a considerable option. They are not open to try medication but would like to receive non-pharmacological treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. To conclude, medication is worldwide the primary treatment of choice for children with ADHD, but has enormous disadvantages, and psychosocial treatments, so far, failed to demonstrate sufficient efficacy. Therefore, there is a large demand for alternative treatment options. Mindfulness training became increasingly popular in the last decade, with studies showing promising results in this burgeoning field, and is for many reasons a potential contender in the treatment for childhood ADHD.</p><p>Mindfulness training is an intervention based on Eastern meditation techniques, that aims to increase awareness by paying attention on purpose in the present moment, enhance non-judgmental observation, and reduce automatic responding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Individuals are encouraged to direct their attention towards internal experiences such as bodily sensations, emotions, thoughts, and action tendencies, as well as to environmental stimuli such as smells and sounds in their surroundings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. The ability to focus and sustain attention in the present moment and to bring back the attention to the present moment whenever it wandered off, which is trained during a mindfulness course, may be especially beneficial for children diagnosed with ADHD, as 1 of the core symptoms of ADHD is inattention. Practicing mindfulness may give children more control over their attention, which may, in turn, be beneficial for other psychological symptoms as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Furthermore, the ongoing streams of internal and external stimuli that enter 1&#x02019;s awareness are to be observed without evaluating or judging them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. By doing so, 1 learns -by first person experience- to be accepting of whatever is present, independent from the valence of the stimulus. Patterns of thoughts, emotions, and reactions will be recognized, and hence, by consciously bringing attention to them, these automatic patterns can be interrupted. Individuals learn to respond rather than to react to stimuli. This ability also may be especially beneficial for children diagnosed with ADHD, as the other core symptom is hyperactive and impulsive behavior. By noticing which impulses are arising or the tendency to react hyperactive, 1 creates the possibility to choose how to respond, rather than to react on automatic pilot.</p><p>Mindfulness meditation has been incorporated into programs such as Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>] and Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. MBSR was originally developed for chronic pain patients in order to help them cope with their illness, whereas MBCT (mindfulness meditation incorporated with cognitive therapy) was developed as a relapse prevention method for patients suffering from recurring depression. Evidence from a large number of studies suggests that mindfulness based interventions are associated with positive psychological effects, such as improved well-being, quality of life, and regulation of behavior, and reduced psychopathology and emotional reactivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Strong evidence for the effectiveness of mindfulness in reducing depression, anxiety, and stress in adults exists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Moreover, preliminary evidence from mindfulness studies suggests a reduction in physical complaints, such as (chronic) pain and somatization disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. Gu, Strauss, Bond, and Cavanagh [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>] conducted a meta-analytic review about which mechanisms of change underlie improved mental health and wellbeing in adults who followed a mindfulness based intervention. Results evidence that the effects of mindfulness based interventions indirectly improved mental health (e.g. depression, stress, anxiety, mood states, and negative affect) through changes in cognitive and emotional reactivity, mindfulness, and repetitive negative thinking. Preliminary but insufficient evidence was found for self-compassion and psychological flexibility as mechanisms of change. However, another study did find evidence that self-compassion is a mediating mechanism in MBCT&#x02019;s treatment outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>].</p><p>Although the effects of mindfulness training in adults are well established, research on the effectiveness of mindfulness training in child and adolescent psychiatry is a relatively new domain. The majority of research in this field addresses children and adolescents in non-clinical samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. The meta-analysis conducted by Zoogman et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] included 20 studies on mindfulness based interventions with youth, of which four were clinical studies. Results show a small to moderate universal effect size for all mindfulness interventions taken together (<italic>del</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.23), surpassing the effects of active control groups. Moreover, findings suggest that mindfulness training may be more beneficial for clinical samples than for non-clinical samples, and also more effective in reducing symptoms of psychopathology than other outcome measures. These studies show preliminary evidence that mindfulness based interventions are also beneficial for youth with a variety of psychological symptoms, as improvements were reported on measures of attention, internalizing and externalizing behavior problems, sleep, anxiety, and academic performance.</p><p>Regarding studies that specifically focused on the effects of mindfulness training for children and adolescents with ADHD (and their parents), so far, 8 studies have been performed.</p><p>The study of B&#x000f6;gels et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>] included 14 clinically referred adolescents (aged 11 to 18) suffering from externalizing disorders and their parents, of which two adolescents had a primary ADHD diagnosis and another two had co-morbid ADHD. The adolescents followed an early version of the 8-week MYmind mindfulness training with a parallel mindful parenting training for their parents (B&#x000f6;gels SM. MYmind: a mindfulness training for children with ADHD and their parents. In preperation). Adolescents and their parents were measured at waitlist, pre-test, post-test, and at 8-week follow-up. After the training, adolescents reported a substantial improvement on personal goals, internalizing, externalizing, and attention problems, happiness, and mindful awareness, and scored substantially higher on the d2 Test of Attention. In turn parents reported at post-test an improvement in their adolescents goals, externalizing and attention problems, self-control, attunement to others, and withdrawal. These effects were maintained at 8-week follow-up.</p><p>In the study of Singh et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>], two children with ADHD (aged 10 and 12) and their mothers participated. Children received a 12-session mindfulness training parallel to the mindful parenting training of their mothers, using a multiple baseline across mothers and children design. Mothers reported an improvement in compliance by their child as a result of the mindful parenting training, compliance was further increased by the child training. Results were maintained during the 24-week follow-up. Moreover, their results evidenced an improved mother-child interaction and satisfaction with their parenting. Children in this study were only assessed on a behavioral outcome, but not on core symptoms of ADHD.</p><p>Zylowska et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>] conducted a feasibility study with a pre- and post-test design, with 24 adults and 8 adolescents with ADHD, who followed an 8-week mindfulness training adapted for ADHD. After the training participants reported a decline in self-reported ADHD symptoms, but not hyperactivity, and improvements on neurocognitive tasks for measures of attentional conflict, but not working memory. In adults improvements were found in anxiety and depression. Due to the low numbers in this study no separate conclusions were drawn for adolescents alone.</p><p>In a study of Haydicky et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>] effects of a 20-week Mindfulness Martial Arts training were evaluated in 60 children in a clinical sample of adolescent boys (aged 12-18) with learning disabilities, using a pre-and post-test design and a waitlist control group. Twenty-eight participants were diagnosed with co-occurring ADHD of which 14 were assigned to the mindfulness training and 14 to the waitlist control group. Findings in this subgroup showed a decrease in parent-rated externalizing behavior, oppositional defiant problems, and conduct problems. In another study of Haydicky et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>] effects of the 8-week MYmind mindfulness training, for adolescents with ADHD (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;18, aged 13-18) and a parallel mindful parenting training for their parents (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;17), were evaluated using a pre-post-follow-up design and a within-group waitlist control without randomization. At post-test adolescents did not report improvements on any of the measures. However, parents reported a decline in their adolescents&#x02019; inattention, conduct problems, and peer relationship problems and in their own parenting stress. Parents also reported an increase in their mindful parenting. Generally, gains achieved during the training were maintained at the 6-week follow-up and adolescents now reported a decrease in their own internalizing problems.</p><p>Another study measured the effects of the MYmind mindfulness training for 13-18 year old adolescents with ADHD (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;9) and a parallel mindful parenting training for their parents (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;13), using a time-series design during baseline, the training, and six months follow-up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. Results showed a decline in parent and adolescent stress, and parent and adolescent distress due to family conflict. Parents, but not adolescents, reported a reduction in adolescents&#x02019; inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. These improvements were generally maintained at follow-up six months later.</p><p>Finally, two studies were conducted by B&#x000f6;gels and colleagues. The first study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>] assessed the effects of an early version of the 8-week MYmind mindfulness training for children with ADHD (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;22, aged 8-12) with parallel mindful parenting training, using a pre-post-follow-up design and a within-group waitlist control without randomization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. Results showed a significant reduction of parent-rated ADHD behavior of themselves and their child, which was maintained at follow-up. Furthermore, a significant reduction of parental stress and over-reactivity at follow-up was shown. The second study assessed the effects of an early version of the MYmind mindfulness training for adolescents with ADHD (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;10, aged 11&#x02013;15) with parallel mindful parenting training, using a pre-post-follow-up design without randomization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. Findings showed a reduction of self-reported ADHD behavior in adolescents and improvements on objective neuropsychological computerized tasks of attention. Based on fathers&#x02019; and teachers&#x02019; reports a decline in ADHD behavior in adolescents was shown. Fathers reported reduced parenting stress as a result of the mindful parenting training and mothers reported a decline in parental over-reactivity. At 8-week follow-up the effects were even stronger than at the post-test, however, the effects waned off at 16-weeks follow-up.</p><p>In sum, preliminary effectiveness of mindfulness training for children and adolescents with ADHD is clearly demonstrated in the above-mentioned studies. However, the current stage of research in this field is limited by a lack of randomized and controlled (clinical) trials with large samples, standardized formats for interventions, objective measures, and that are generalizable outside the intervention context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. Therefore, it is a logical step to further assess the (cost-) effectiveness of mindfulness training, in children and adolescents with ADHD, in a well-designed RCT with a large number of participants, in which mindfulness training is evaluated against methylphenidate, the current treatment of choice for childhood ADHD.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Objectives</title><p>The primary objective of this RCT is to compare mindfulness training with the currently most effective treatment, methylphenidate, for children with ADHD. To the scope of our knowledge these two treatments have never been compared before in an RCT concerning children with ADHD. Effects of mindfulness training for children combined with mindful parenting training on the primary outcome measures of attention and hyperactivity/impulsivity are compared to those of methylphenidate in children and adolescents with ADHD. In addition, we will compare the effectiveness of mindfulness training versus methylphenidate with respect to: 1) cost-effectiveness; 2) secondary child measures: a) psychopathology, b) stress, c) quality of life, d) happiness, and e) sleep (problems); 3) secondary parent measures: a) parents&#x02019; own ADHD and psychopathology, b) stress, c) quality of life, d) sleep (problems), and e) parenting sense of competence; and 4) potential mechanisms of change: a) mindful awareness (of parents and children in general, of parents in their parenting role, and parental self-compassion), b) emotion regulation (child self- and emotion regulation, and family emotion regulation), and c) parenting (parenting style and mind mindedness). Additionally, treatment adherence (attendance to weekly sessions by parent and child and minutes of home practice by parent and child) will be monitored.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Trial design</title><p>A multicenter RCT with follow-up measurements is used to measure the effects of mindfulness training versus the effects of methylphenidate. After enrolment in the study participants sign informed consent and are randomized to the mindfulness arm or the methylphenidate arm. After randomization, participants fill in the pre-test (T1) and start the treatment they were assigned to. In the mindfulness arm participants receive 8 sessions of mindfulness training (1 session per week) and in the methylphenidate arm participants start the first 8 weeks of methylphenidate intervention. After those 8 weeks, participants fill in the post-test (T2). Subsequently, for participants in the mindfulness arm, 8 weeks without training follow after T2, and receive a booster session at the end of those 8 weeks. Participants in the methylphenidate arm continue taking methylphenidate for another 8 weeks. Four months (T3) and ten months (T4) after participants started their treatment, follow-up measurements are planned in order to determine whether training effects are long lasting. Between T3 and T4, a 6&#x000a0;month-period passes in which participants do not have to be in treatment, but they are free to consider other treatment options. Thus, participants in the methylphenidate arm can decide to continue their medication, change medication, stop medication, or to remain without treatment, or get enrolled in mindfulness training or another intervention. Participants in the mindfulness arm can decide to remain without treatment, start medication or participate in another intervention.

This study is approved by the Ethics Review Board of the Faculty of Social and Behavioral Sciences at the University of Amsterdam (no. 2014-CDE-3658). The preference study has similar objectives as the RCT and participants follow, except for randomization, the exact same procedures as participants in the RCT.

Eight weeks after the training both children and their parents receive a 1.5-h follow-up session. For the training the MYmind protocol is used: Mindfulness training for Youngsters with ADHD and their parents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. Participants learn to focus and enhance their attention, awareness and self-control by doing mindfulness exercises during the training and home practice. Both parents and children are asked to practice daily meditations. Parents follow parallel mindful parenting training (in a group, 1.5&#x000a0;h/week) based on the protocol described by B&#x000f6;gels and Restifo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. Parents learn to be fully present in the here and now with their child in a non-judgmental way, to take care of themselves, and to respond rather than react to difficult behavior of their child. They also learn how to guide their child in the meditation. The importance for parents to practice daily, in order for them to embody mindfulness, to function as a role model, as well as for their own inattention and impulsivity/hyperactivity symptoms, is emphasized. Although most of the training time children and parents are in separate groups, the first half hour of session 1 and 5, and most of session 8 and the follow-up session take place with parents and children together, in order to share experiences. Themes addressed in the MYmind training for children with ADHD and their parents are: 1) Beginners&#x02019; mind, 2) Home in our body, 3) The breath, 4) Distractors!, 5) Stress, 6) High way, walking way, 7) Acceptance &#x00026; autonomy, and 8) The future, and for the follow-up session: Each time, beginning a new (B&#x000f6;gels SM.

After the first face-to-face consultation with the child psychiatrist, in which children are physically and psychologically examined, they receive a prescription of 2.5 or 5&#x000a0;mg of short acting methylphenidate. After one week the psychiatrist contacts the child or his/her parent (s) by phone, when the medication already has the desired effect, the dose is not increased. However, when the medication is not yet effective, the dose is increased by 2.5 or 5&#x000a0;mg. Every time the dose is increased, the psychiatrist contacts the child or his/her parent (s) by phone one week later to evaluate the effects and, if needed increases the dose with another 2.5 or 5&#x000a0;mg with a maximum of 20&#x000a0;mg methylphenidate per dose until optimal titration is achieved. Every four weeks the child and at least one of his/her parents are invited to come to the treatment center for a face-to-face consultation with the child psychiatrist and a physical examination. All children start with three doses of 2.5 or 5&#x000a0;mg methylphenidate per day, morning, early afternoon, and late afternoon, seven days a week. In this manner both parents and teachers at school have the chance to observe changes in the child.

With respect to current effect sizes found in the literature for mindfulness and methylphenidate, a medium to large difference in effect size is expected. To detect a difference of a medium effect between the mindfulness group and the methylphenidate group, a total sample size of 120 (60 in both arms) is needed with an anticipated power of 0.80, assuming a significance level of 0.05 for a 1-sided test of hypotheses and correlations of 0.5 between measurement occasions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Randomization</title><p>Participants are randomized over mindfulness (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;60) and methylphenidate (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;60).

Experimental effects are indicated by significant parameters for group by time interactions. Effects of mindfulness training on inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity are compared to effects of methylphenidate on inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity. Also effects of mindfulness training on the secondary outcome measures are compared to effects on methylphenidate using multilevel (mixed model) analysis. Impact of covariates, such as social economic status, expectations of how helpful the treatment will be, stratification factors (treatment center, age, and gender), and ADHD symptom severity at T1 will be evaluated.

In addition, acceptability curves will be obtained representing the chance that mindfulness is a cost-effective intervention compared to medication.

Stimulant medication is effective in reducing ADHD symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and is currently the first choice of treatment worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], but has limitations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. These limitations concern the severe side effects, low treatment adherence, short term effects, non-effectiveness, contraindications, and that its long-term effectiveness and safety are not yet well known. Psychosocial treatments show to be far less effective in reducing ADHD symptoms compared to stimulant medication and a combined psychosocial and medical treatment failed to show additive benefits to medication alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Therefore, there is a need for an alternative non-pharmacological treatment. The bourgeon of studies in the field of mindfulness treatment for childhood ADHD show promising results in reducing ADHD symptoms and may be a potential alternative to medication given that the nature of this treatment targets the core symptoms of ADHD. With this study we aim to compare the (cost) effectiveness of mindfulness treatment for children with ADHD and their parents to the effectiveness of treatment with methylphenidate in a RCT. Study outcomes, e.g. presented at conferences and published in scientific and peer reviewed journals, will inform children with ADHD and their families, general practitioners, and the mental health care sector about the effectiveness of mindfulness training and whether mindfulness is a considerable alternative to medication in the treatment of childhood ADHD. To the scope of our knowledge, a study about the cost effectiveness of mindfulness training for children with ADHD and their parents has not been conducted so far. Outcomes will also inform health insurance companies which treatment is more cost effective (in the long term). However, we expect, based on the cost-effectiveness analyses in the study of Jensen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] and due to the intensity of MYmind training and the relatively low costs of the medical treatment, that MYmind training will be less cost-effective than medication, even when medication is continued during the whole 40&#x000a0;weeks of the study.</p><p>An anticipated limitation of this study is a nonparticipation bias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">111</xref>], as it is expected that a proportion of eligible participants has such a strong treatment preference that they are not willing to be randomized and, therefore, do not participate in this study. Those who are only open to medication or mindfulness treatment may differ in several characteristics from those who are willing to try both treatments. It is also anticipated that loss to follow-up bias will emerge during the course of the study for several reasons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">112</xref>]. Participants who are most in need for treatment because of the severity of the symptoms may also be those who drop out first because the intensiveness of participating in the study or the assigned treatment becomes too much of a burden. Another example is that participants agreed to be randomized, but are unsatisfied with the assigned treatment and are, therefore, no longer willing to participate, which may lead to systematic missing values in one or both conditions. An example may be that patients suffering from severe ADHD symptoms will refuse a nonmedical treatment and that less severe cases may refuse medical treatment. Both forms of dropping out are violating the ecological validity. Sampling bias is another anticipated threat to the study as participants are excluded when they have used methylphenidate in the past year. Since many children with ADHD already are on medication, a large part of our population is excluded from participation. Children who meet the in- and exclusion criteria are probably mainly those who are recently diagnosed or those who&#x02019;s symptoms have not been severe enough before to start medication. This part of the population may not be fully representative for the whole population. However, we do believe the exclusion criterion &#x0201c;current or previous use of methylphenidate in the past year&#x0201d; should be maintained, as medication-na&#x000ef;ve children and those who have tried it in the past are less likely to have knowledge about the effects of medication, and are therefore more neutral in their expectations before starting medication, then children who have recently used or are currently using medication. We believe that the latter group of children already has a very positive or negative attitude towards medication, which may lead to expectation bias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">113</xref>].</p><p>To conclude, this study will be the first to reveal whether mindfulness treatment for children with ADHD can be provided as an alternative to the current standard treatment of medication, and may reveal which mechanisms of change contribute to the effectiveness of the interventions. This study has the potential to impact clinical practice in important ways, as at present most children referred with ADHD receive medication, despite its disadvantages.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Abbreviations</title><p>ADHD, Attention-Deficit-Hyperactivity-Disorder; ASR, Adult Self Report; CAMM, Children&#x02019;s Acceptance and Mindfulness Measure; CBCL, Child Behavior Checklist; CSRQ, Chronic Sleep Reduction Questionnaire; DBDRS, Disruptive Behavior Disorder Rating Scale; DSM, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders; EDT, Emotion Discussion Task; FFMQ, 5 Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire; HSDQ, Holland Sleep Disorders Questionnaire; HSR, Healthy Self-Regulation Subscale; ICER, Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratios; IM-P, Interpersonal Mindfulness in Parenting scale; MBCT, Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy; MBSR, Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction; MM, Mind Mindedness; MTA, Multimodal Treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder; NWO, Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research; PS, Parenting Scale; PSOC, Parenting Sense of Competence; PSQI, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index; PSS, Perceived Stress Scale; QUALY, Quality Adjusted Life Year; RCT, randomized controlled trial; SCID, Structured Clinical Interview for DSM; SCS, Self Compassion Scale; SHS, Subjective Happiness Scale; SQC, Stress Questionnaire for Children; SQIH, Self-report Questionnaire for Inattention and Hyperactivity; TEA-Ch, Test of Everyday Attention for Children; TOF, Test Observation Form; TRF, Teacher&#x02019;s Report Form; WHO-5, World Health Organization Well-Being Index; WISC, Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children &#x02013; Third edition; YSR, Youth Self Report.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are grateful to Ruud van Roosmalen who, as the director of Buro van Roosmalen, accepted our request to include Buro van Roosmalen as a participating centre in this study.
