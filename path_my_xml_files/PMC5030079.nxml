Malaria then resurged and recurrent malaria after treatment with AL and stock-outs of AL were common. This study therefore aimed to assess the efficacy of AL and identify an alternative second line antimalarial. Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) was chosen as it has been shown to be safe and efficacious and to reduce the incidence of recurrent malaria.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Methods and Findings</title><p>In a multicentre randomised open-label non-inferiority clinical trial, AL or DP were given over 3 days to children aged 6 months-15 years with uncomplicated <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> mono-infection.

Due to widespread resistance to antimalarial monotherapies, the World Health Organization recommends artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) for treatment of uncomplicated <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> malaria. Artemether-lumefantrine (AL), dihydroartemisnin-piperaquine (DP) and artesunate-amodiaquine are the ACTs of primary relevance for use in Africa [<xref rid="pone.0161495.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>When AL was introduced for treatment of uncomplicated malaria in Guinea-Bissau in 2008, its efficacy was 97% [<xref rid="pone.0161495.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Despite this, malaria resurged between 2008 and 2012 [<xref rid="pone.0161495.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Data suggests that this increase was due to poorer than expected effectiveness of AL (unpublished data), unavailability of AL due to stock-outs and to increased use of the second-line drug quinine [<xref rid="pone.0161495.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Quinine is typically given for 3 instead of 7 days in Guinea-Bissau and has very poor efficacy when used in that way [<xref rid="pone.0161495.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Guinea-Bissau needs an alternative ACT for use when AL is not available or fails. Furthermore, concurrent use of multiple first line therapies may delay the development of drug resistance [<xref rid="pone.0161495.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>DP is taken once daily and has been shown to be safe, well tolerated and highly efficacious (&#x0003e;95%) in several African settings [<xref rid="pone.0161495.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0161495.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. DP also protects from re-infection for longer time than AL and has thereby been linked to reduced incidence of uncomplicated and complicated malaria infections as well as hospitalizations in high transmission settings [<xref rid="pone.0161495.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0161495.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. DP has however, never been used in Guinea-Bissau. Artesunate-amodiaquine is also a potential ACT for use in Guinea-Bissau. However, amodiaquine tolerant <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> exist in the country and the incidence has increased in recent years [<xref rid="pone.0161495.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0161495.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. We therefore conducted this non-inferiority randomised clinical trial to determine the efficacy and safety of AL and DP for the treatment of uncomplicated <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> malaria in Guinea-Bissau.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Ethics and registration</title><p>The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice.

If a child vomited again during the next 30 min, the child was given quinine intramuscularly and withdrawn. Concomitantly prescribed drugs were administered and recorded. <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> detected after day 7 were treated with AL.</p><p>Children were seen twice daily on days 0, 1 and 2 and then once on days 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35 and 42. Clinical condition was assessed, temperature measured and mothers were questioned about their child&#x02019;s general condition and the occurrence of fever, any symptoms, hospital admission or intake of any drugs each time a child was seen. Daily on days 0, 1, 2, 3 and 7, patients and / or their care-giver were asked if the patient had any of the following symptoms during the past 24 hours: Fever, convulsions, joint pains, diarrhoea, stomach pain, itch, rash, palpitations, inability to eat, sleep and drink, their general condition and any other symptoms. Symptoms were graded as not present, moderate or severe. In addition, the attending nurse assessed patient&#x02019;s general condition as well, ill or very ill and measured the temperature. If a child was not seen during a weekly visit, a health worker phoned the parent/guardian or revisited the house the following two days. Children were given free medication and were encouraged to return at any time if their health deteriorated. If a child was admitted to hospital, the diagnosis and treatment was recorded. Each time a child was seen, including unscheduled visits to the health centres, Giemsa stained thick and thin smears were made to identify and quantify any malaria parasites. Blood was put on to filter-paper (Whatman 3MM) for later genotyping whenever a slide was made except for days 1 and 2 and when no parasites were found during unscheduled visits. Filter-papers were put into separate sealed plastic bags to avoid contamination and stored with a desiccant (Minipax<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Sigma-Aldrich<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>).</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Laboratory methods</title><p>Children with symptoms suggestive of malaria were screened using rapid diagnostic tests (First Response<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) and Giemsa stained thick and thin smears using finger prick blood. Species were identified and asexual parasite density quantified (per 200 white blood cells) using 1000 times magnification and a sunlit microscope. A slide was considered negative after examination of 100 high power fields.</p><p>Haemoglobin was measured using a HaemoCue (&#x000c4;ngelholm, Sweden) on days 0, 3 and 42. Moderate anaemia was defined as haemoglobin &#x0003c;100 g/l in children under 5 years of age and &#x0003c;110 g/l in older children. For severe anaemia the corresponding haemoglobin values were 70 and 80 g/l, respectively.</p><p>DNA was extracted from two 3 mm punches of blood soaked filter-paper using a cheelex<sup>TM</sup> based extraction method. DNA was frozen in aliquots at &#x02013;20&#x000b0;C until amplification by PCR. New and recrudescent infections were distinguished using a nested PCR protocol according to WHO recommendations [<xref rid="pone.0161495.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Merozoite surface proteins 1 and 2 and <italic>P falciparum</italic> glutamate rich protein were analysed in matching day 0 samples and day of recurring <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic>.

Briefly, ETF was defined as the development of danger signs or severe malaria on days 1&#x02013;3 in the presence of parasitaemia. PCR verified recrudescence of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> between days 7&#x02013;42 was defined as LCF if the subject had symptoms of malaria and LPF if there were no symptoms. In the per protocol analysis ETF and PCR corrected LCF and LPF were considered as treatment failures whereas reinfections (identified by PCR genotyping) were censored. In the intention to treat analysis day 0 treatment failures, ETF and all reparasitaemias were considered as treatment failures. Patients were censored due to loss to follow up if they had moved from the study area or were not seen on two consecutive weekly visits. Patients were censored due to withdrawal of consent if they refused blood sampling for malaria diagnosis at any time during the study period.</p><p>The primary endpoint was PCR adjusted per protocol ACPR day 42. Secondary endpoints included intention to treat ACPR day 42, haemoglobin recovery, fever and parasite clearance and drug tolerability.</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Statistics</title><p>Assuming a PCR corrected per protocol day 42 ACPR of 97% (based on data from a trial with AL in 2008), 5% significance level (alpha), 80% power (1-beta), a non-inferiority limit (d) of 5% the sample size was calculated to be 288 not accounting for loss to follow up.

Nevertheless, the effect of sex, age group (&#x0003c;5, 5&#x02013;9 and 10&#x02013;14 years), parasite density (&#x0003c;50000, 50000&#x02013;99999 and &#x0003e;99999 <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic>/&#x003bc;L) and study site were assessed in the intention to treat analysis using a Cox proportional hazards model. No predictor had a significant effect. Data from the Mantel-Haenszel analysis only are therefore presented. Quantile regressions with bootstrapping (100 repetitions) were used to compare parasite densities, body temperatures and haemoglobin values. Quantile regressions were used as parasite density was not normally distributed and because we wished to analyse medians to minimise the effect of outliers. Symptoms, the proportion of children with anaemia, the proportion of children with parasitaemia and gametocytes on specific days were analysed using Fisher&#x02019;s exact test.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec014"><title>Results</title><p>A total of 8338 children were screened for malaria of which 494 were found to have <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> on examination of thick and thin smears.

The study was prompted by a perceived lack of effectiveness of AL when malaria resurged between 2008 and 2012 and a wish to identify a second line ACT [<xref rid="pone.0161495.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The &#x02265;95% PCR corrected efficacy of AL and DP allays fears of widespread AL resistance and shows that DP fulfilled WHO criteria for antimalarials to be introduced [<xref rid="pone.0161495.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Furthermore, DP was shown to be non-inferior and not superior to AL in the non-inferiority analysis. Thus both AL and DP can be recommended for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria in Guinea-Bissau.</p><p>The per protocol day 42 PCR corrected efficacy of DP (100%) was significantly better than that of AL (95%). There were four ETFs and three LCFs in the AL arm versus none in the DP arm. Furthermore, the median parasite density was significantly higher in the AL arm (1280 Pf/&#x003bc;l) compared to the DP arm (480 Pf/&#x003bc;l) on day one. On the other hand, the majority of children cleared <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> within 48 hours of starting treatment with AL or DP suggesting that <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> remain sensitive to artemisinin derivatives. The numbers are small and data should be interpreted with caution, especially as we do not have data on drug concentrations. However, AL has previously been linked to an increased risk of persistent parasitaemia on day one compared to DP [<xref rid="pone.0161495.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Furthermore, as shown in earlier studies, the frequency of genotypes associated with five-fold higher lumefantrine IC50 values was high (~75%) when AL was introduced in Guinea-Bissau [<xref rid="pone.0161495.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0161495.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The results therefore highlight the importance of continued AL efficacy monitoring in Guinea-Bissau.</p><p>Lower incidence of uncomplicated and complicated malaria infections, fewer hospitalizations, better haemoglobin values and lower risk of developing gametocytaemia have been found in children treated with DP compared to AL [<xref rid="pone.0161495.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0161495.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0161495.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. These effects have been attributed to a post treatment prophylactic effect due to the longer terminal elimination half-life of piperaquine compared to lumefantrine. In our study DP was no better than AL at preventing reinfections and haemoglobin values did not differ between treatment groups. This was no doubt due to the currently low transmission intensity (there were only two reinfections) at our site in line with data from a meso-endemic area of Kenya [<xref rid="pone.0161495.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. When malaria resurged in Bissau (2008&#x02013;2012), reinfections were common even during the short seasonal transmission period. A drug with a long post treatment prophylactic effect might limit onward transmission of malaria during epidemics. Based on previous data and the high efficacy of DP in this study it is possible that use of DP can minimise seasonal peaks of malaria in Guinea-Bissau.</p><p>Both drugs were well tolerated and fever clearance, symptom resolution and haemoglobin recovery were similar. DP has previously been linked to increased risk of vomiting in infants [<xref rid="pone.0161495.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and we found that the need to repeat treatment due to vomiting was non-significantly more common after the first dose of DP (n = 7) compared to AL (n = 4). However, vomiting was not seen with subsequent doses and no child was withdrawn due to vomiting indicating that both treatments were well tolerated.</p><p>As expected haemoglobin values were lower on day 3 than day 0. The day 3 haemoglobin value was also less likely to be effected by fever and dehydration as the clinical condition of the vast majority of children was assessed as good on day 3. Thus the increase of haemoglobin between days 3 and 42 is most probably a more accurate reflection of haemoglobin recovery than the day 0 and day 42 comparison commonly used.</p><sec id="sec017"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Both AL and DP fulfilled WHO criteria for treatment of uncomplicated <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> malaria and can be recommended for use in Guinea-Bissau. DP was not inferior to AL for treatment of uncomplicated <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> malaria. Haemoglobin recovery is better assessed by measuring haemoglobin on days 3 and 42 compared to days 0 and 42.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec018"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0161495.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Consort 2010 Checklist.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0161495.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0161495.s002"><label>S2 File</label><caption><title>Improving anti-malarial treatment options in Guinea-Bissau.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0161495.s002.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The study was funded by an Award from the Anthony Cerami and Ann Dunne Foundation for world health and a grant from Svenska L&#x000e4;kares&#x000e4;llskapet.
