Broadening treatment targets to include lipid-related risk factors beyond currently recognized CV risk markers may help further improve clinical outcomes <xref rid="pone.0089034-Dembowski1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Additional processes within the vessel wall, particularly inflammatory responses, contribute to plaque destabilization, atherothrombosis, and the clinical sequelae. Mediators of these processes therefore represent potential novel treatment targets for reducing CV risk and the burden associated with atherosclerotic CV disease.</p><p>Lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A<sub>2</sub> (Lp-PLA<sub>2</sub>) is an emerging CV risk marker that may play an important pathogenetic role in mediating inflammatory processes that contribute to plaque vulnerability and rupture <xref rid="pone.0089034-Zalewski1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Although Lp-PLA<sub>2</sub> has been described as a platelet-activating factor (PAF) acetylhydrolase <xref rid="pone.0089034-Stafforini1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, accumulating evidence suggests that the products of Lp-PLA<sub>2</sub>, lysophosphatidylcholine (lysoPC) and oxidized nonesterified fatty acids, can elicit a broad range of proinflammatory and pro-apoptotic effects <xref rid="pone.0089034-Wilensky1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Lp-PLA<sub>2</sub> is produced and secreted by activated macrophages and other inflammatory cells implicated as playing a central role in atherothrombosis <xref rid="pone.0089034-Stafforini2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. More recently, it has been shown that the so-called proinflammatory macrophage (M1 phenotype) expresses and secretes greater quantities of Lp-PLA<sub>2</sub> when compared with M2 polarized macrophages <xref rid="pone.0089034-Ferguson1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Since M1 inflammatory macrophages tend to be located within the lipid core of vulnerable plaques <xref rid="pone.0089034-ChinettiGbaguidi1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, the association described above presumably explains why Lp-PLA<sub>2</sub> is highly upregulated in macrophages located within the necrotic core and fibrous cap of vulnerable and ruptured human coronary plaques, but not within stable lesions <xref rid="pone.0089034-Kolodgie1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Indeed, in patients who underwent carotid endarterectomy, levels of Lp-PLA<sub>2</sub> and one of its products, lysoPC, were higher in plaques from patients who had experienced CV events compared with those who had not, suggesting that Lp-PLA<sub>2</sub> was a key component of a causal pathway for plaque vulnerability <xref rid="pone.0089034-Mannheim1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0089034-Gonalves1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. A recent analysis of carotid plaque Lp-PLA<sub>2</sub> and lysoPC content demonstrated a highly statistically significant correlation of both biomarkers with various plaque M1 macrophage-related proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1; and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 <xref rid="pone.0089034-Gonalves1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Finally, a pro-atherothrombotic role for Lp-PLA<sub>2</sub> is further supported by a body of epidemiologic evidence suggesting a greater risk of CV events with elevated plasma Lp-PLA<sub>2</sub>
<xref rid="pone.0089034-Thompson1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.</p><p>Darapladib is an oral, investigational, highly potent, and selective Lp-PLA<sub>2</sub> inhibitor that has been demonstrated to reduce atherosclerosis in a diabetic and hypercholesterolemic porcine model of accelerated coronary atherosclerosis <xref rid="pone.0089034-Wilensky2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> as well as in ApoE-deficient mice <xref rid="pone.0089034-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Administration of darapladib in the pig model not only inhibited coronary artery lesion development, but more profoundly reduced progression to advanced coronary lesions. A similar observation was noted in the IBIS-2 (Integrated Biomarker and Imaging Study 2) clinical trial, which compared the effects of 12 months of darapladib treatment with placebo on plasma C-reactive protein levels and coronary atheroma composition and deformability in 330 patients with angiographically documented coronary artery disease <xref rid="pone.0089034-Serruys1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Although the primary end points of the study were not met, and darapladib did not affect total atheroma volume, treatment did halt the increase in necrotic core volume as assessed by intravascular ultrasound virtual histology, suggesting a stabilization of the overall plaque. Whether these changes will translate into differences in clinical outcomes awaits the results of two large, fully enrolled, ongoing phase III trials: STABILITY (Stabilization of Atherosclerotic Plaque by Initiation of Darapladib Therapy Trial, NCT00799903), involving 15,828 patients with coronary heart disease <xref rid="pone.0089034-White1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, and SOLID-TIMI 52 (Stabilization of Plaques Using Darapladib - Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 52 Trial, NCT01000727), involving 13,026 subjects with a recent history of acute coronary syndrome <xref rid="pone.0089034-ODonoghue1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.</p><p>The primary objective of the current study was to test the hypothesis that darapladib could reduce the elevated Lp-PLA<sub>2</sub> activity within advanced atherosclerotic (carotid) plaques in a dose-dependent manner. The secondary objectives were more exploratory in nature, given the very short treatment period, and focused on changes of several potentially relevant plaque biomarkers, including an analysis of species of lysoPC. A portion of the data has been presented in abstract format <xref rid="pone.0089034-Johnson1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0089034.s003">Protocol S1</xref> and CONSORT <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0089034.s002">Checklist S1</xref>.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Patients</title><p>Men and women 35 years or older with carotid atherosclerosis requiring endarterectomy were eligible for participation in this study.

Eligible subjects were randomly assigned (1&#x02236;1&#x02236;1 fashion) to treatment with either darapladib 40 mg or 80 mg or matching placebo once daily. The randomization was stratified by statin use and gender. Allocation of eligible subjects was determined using a computer-generated list of random numbers. A central randomization schedule was created by the GSK study statistician using CMS, a GlaxoSmithKline internal randomization system, with a 1&#x02236;1&#x02236;1 allocation ratio between 3 treatment groups, using the block size of 4. The GSK Registration and Medication Ordering System (RAMOS) was used to sequentially allocate treatments to subjects as per the randomization generated within CMS. RAMOS also provided central allocation of drug supplies. Study medication was dispensed according to the protocol to randomized subjects under the supervision of the investigator: placebo patients received 2 bottles of placebo (pbo) and took two tablets from each bottle (i.e., 4&#x000d7;pbo); 40 mg patients received 1 bottle of 20 mg tablets and 1 bottle of placebo and took two tablets from each bottle (i.e., 2&#x000d7;20 mg+2&#x000d7;pbo); 80 mg patients received 2 bottles of 20 mg and took two tablets from each bottle (i.e., 4&#x000d7;20 mg).

The degree of carotid artery stenosis (83.5%) in this carotid endarterectomy study suggests the presence of advanced atherosclerotic lesions. Nevertheless, these results indicate that darapladib distributed into lesions to produce its pharmacodynamic effect in a dose-dependent manner, with the 40-mg dose associated with a greater than 50% reduction in Lp-PLA<sub>2</sub> activity and the 80-mg dose associated with an 80% reduction in activity compared with placebo. This demonstration of a pharmacodynamic effect of darapladib within atherosclerotic lesions is an important step in exploring whether Lp-PLA<sub>2</sub> activity contributes directly to plaque destabilization and atherothrombosis and whether darapladib can modulate these processes to stabilize plaques and reduce CV risk. It is noteworthy that a similar level of plaque Lp-PLA<sub>2</sub> activity inhibition was achieved with darapladib in a porcine model of coronary atherosclerosis, because in this model, Lp-PLA<sub>2</sub> inhibition was accompanied by a significant reduction in complex plaque development <xref rid="pone.0089034-Wilensky2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Also noted in the porcine study with darapladib treatment was a 72% reduction in the coronary expression of MMP-9, which is in line with the dose-dependent decrease in MMP-9 mRNA observed in the current study and may suggest that plaque MMP-9 expression is downstream of Lp-PLA<sub>2</sub> action. This is of potential significance because MMP-9 is greatly upregulated in culprit lesions and has been implicated in necrotic core expansion and plaque vulnerability <xref rid="pone.0089034-Sluijter1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0089034-Fiotti1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.</p><p>Results from recent studies indicate that Lp-PLA<sub>2</sub> staining/expression is most intense in lesions obtained from patients with advanced atherosclerosis (both coronary and carotid) <xref rid="pone.0089034-Kolodgie1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0089034-Gonalves1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. In two independent studies, levels of lysoPC, a product of Lp-PLA<sub>2</sub> activity, were found in significantly greater concentrations in symptomatic than in asymptomatic carotid plaques and were highly and significantly correlated with Lp-PLA<sub>2</sub> levels <xref rid="pone.0089034-Herrmann1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0089034-Gonalves1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Lp-PLA<sub>2</sub> concentrations in symptomatic lesions were greatest within the necrotic core and in the shoulder regions, which were also regions known to have high concentrations of macrophages and oxidized low-density lipoprotein <xref rid="pone.0089034-Kolodgie1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0089034-Vickers1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>.</p><p>In the current carotid endarterectomy study, no statistically significant differences were observed between treatment groups in plaque lysoPC levels (total or subfractions). Furthermore, no statistically significant differences were observed between treatment groups in serum biomarkers or in other plaque biomarkers, including Lp-PLA<sub>2</sub> mRNA. However, a short treatment regimen (2 to 4 weeks) was utilized, which could account for these results. In a separate dose-ranging trial <xref rid="pone.0089034-Davis1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> involving a longer duration of treatment (12 weeks) and including a 160-mg dose of the enteric-coated formulation of darapladib that provides comparable exposure to the 80-mg dose of the non&#x02013;enteric-coated formulation used in the present study, a significant reduction was observed in plasma IL-6 compared with placebo (P&#x0003c;0.028). No statistically significant changes were observed for other CV risk markers.</p><p>Although histopathologic assessment of carotid plaque composition was not performed on excised lesions, the excised plaques contained a surprisingly large amount of lysoPC (&#x0223c;3 &#x000b5;mol/g of tissue). If lesion Lp-PLA<sub>2</sub> was the primary source for the majority of this lysoPC, then the greatest benefit of darapladib would be dependent upon the clearance of this intra-lesional pool of proinflammatory lipid, which could conceivably take several weeks or even months of treatment to normalize. The reduction, however, in two markers of apoptosis, caspase-3 and caspase-8 activity, versus placebo and a correlation between Lp-PLA<sub>2</sub> inhibition and caspase activity are intriguing findings. Apoptosis is increased in atherosclerotic lesions, with most cell death occurring within the macrophage-rich necrotic core of the plaque <xref rid="pone.0089034-Wang2" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Although these measures of apoptosis were from a post-hoc analysis of stored tissue samples and would need to be reproduced in a prospective study, the reduction in these apoptosis markers would appear to be in agreement with results from two other studies involving the longer use of darapladib. In the Integrated Biomarker and Imaging Study (IBIS-2) <xref rid="pone.0089034-Serruys1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, treatment with darapladib for 12 months halted necrotic core expansion as assessed by serial intravascular ultrasound examinations. These findings are consistent with observations from a second study involving a preclinical model of atherosclerosis (diabetic, hypercholesterolemic porcine model), in which treatment with darapladib inhibited the progression to complex coronary artery lesions <xref rid="pone.0089034-Wilensky2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Whether these changes will translate into differences in clinical outcomes awaits the results of the previously mentioned ongoing phase III trials, STABILITY and SOLID-TIMI 52.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Limitations</title><p>This study does not address the potential clinical effects of Lp-PLA<sub>2</sub> inhibition with respect to CV events. Given the relatively small sample sizes and the short duration of treatment (2 to 4 weeks), these results should be viewed as preliminary and hypothesis-generating. Nevertheless, demonstrating a pharmacodynamic effect within human atherosclerotic lesions provides a rationale, along with results from other trials, for studying the effects of treatment with darapladib in larger trials of longer duration.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Although it is widely accepted that intensifying treatment for primary and secondary prevention of CV disease improves outcomes, CV event rates for high-risk individuals remain unacceptably high. Treatments that modulate processes involved in plaque destabilization and atherothrombosis may offer additional benefit for reducing CV events. The findings from this study suggest that darapladib does indeed distribute into advanced human atherosclerotic lesions to produce a dose-dependent reduction in Lp-PLA<sub>2</sub> activity that is comparable in magnitude to what has been observed in plasma. Results from ongoing event-driven trials are now needed to explore the effects of Lp-PLA<sub>2</sub> inhibition on CV outcomes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0089034.s001"><label>Appendix S1</label><caption><p>
