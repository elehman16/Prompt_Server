Body mass index (BMI), frequency, and intensity of physical activity, pain, function, and quality-of-life scores were assessed at baseline and at 4 and 12 months after the educational program. Bimonthly telephone calls were made to half of the participants. Correlations between BMI, level of education, coping skills, functional, and pain results was procured.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The groups were similar in terms of race, gender, affected side, and osteoarthritis severity. The results were not affected by the telephone calls or the patients&#x02019; level of education. At baseline, 25 performed physical activity, whereas 123 performed at 1 year. Seventy-two (36.36%) patients decreased BMI (45 by 1 point and 27 by more than 2 points). There were some weak correlations such as BMI reduction with pain and functional improvements and with coping results. Significant improvements in function and quality of life were found at 4 months. Quality of life remained improved at 1 year.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion:</title><p>The effect of this educational program in function and quality of life of patients with KOA is very subtle.

All patients were prescribed diacerhein. Paracetamol and codeine were offered for pain. A muscle relaxant and magnesium were prescribed for cramps. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) were used only occasionally for severe pain and for short periods of time. Vitamin D3 and calcium supplements were prescribed according to blood levels and bone densitometry results. When present, osteoporosis was treated with alendronate.

Patients were asked whether they performed physical activity with its frequency and intensity.<sup><xref rid="bibr21-2151458516645634" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> The social work team asked patients to report how many years of school they had completed. The nutritionist collected anthropometric data and calculated the body mass index (BMI).</p><p>After baseline evaluations and questionnaires, participants were randomly allocated into 4 groups (1-4, according to the intervals of 1, 2, and 3 months between the 2 days of lectures, or no lectures in the case of group 4) and 2 subgroups (A and B, according to the use of bimonthly telephone calls or no telephone calls, respectively) of 28 or 29 participants. All groups received a booklet on OA and a video with all of the lectures. Group 4 was required to watch the video once at the hospital and only then received the take-home material. Patients in groups 1 to 3 were asked to come to the hospital on 2 specific Saturdays according to the intervals of each group.</p><p>The program, explained partially in our short-term results,<sup><xref rid="bibr17-2151458516645634" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> comprised 2 days (from 7:00 to 17:00 hours, with meals included) of lectures and workshops on causes and treatment of OA. The first day comprised lectures by all teams of professionals and workshops with the physical and occupational therapists. Each professional team had a lecture of 30 to 40 minutes (orthopedic surgeons, psychology, physical therapy, occupational therapy, physical fitness, and social workers) or up to 80 minutes (nutritionist). The physical and occupational therapists also had a 60-minute workshop. The physicians introduced the anatomy of a joint and the pathology of OA, its causes, irreversibility, and management. The psychology team explained personality characteristics from childhood to adulthood, called attention to the difference between having and being a disease and being the results of your choices and not your conditions or feelings, and worked on coping skills. The physical therapists and the physical educators called attention to the importance of a regular exercise program and the differences between physical labor and such a program. While the physical therapists showed how to improve activity to move from pain to a state of no pain, physical fitness instructors focused on a variety of options of exercises to improve strength, resistance, and flexibility. The occupational therapists introduced the importance of protecting joints in daily activities through optimum ergonomic performance as well as by alternating different levels of energy expenditure. The nutritionist explained the importance of a well-balanced diet (reduced quantity, colorful, whole grains, eating every 3 hours, and low-calorie meals). The social work team showed where and how patients could and should include habits of regular leisure, sports and social gathering, and tasks. During the 2 workshops, the physical therapy team taught the patients the exercise series presented in the booklet and in the DVD, which was to be conducted at least 3 times a week. The occupational therapy workshop showed patients how to protect their joints during daily activities in a model house (bathroom, kitchen, bedroom, and workshop, particularly for men). The second intervention program was the same length (from 7:00 to 17:00 hours) and started with the social workers. Patients were asked about accomplishments and difficulties in performing the suggested activities. The psychology team led a group session where patients shared their experiences with the program. The physical therapists repeated the workshop taught in the first intervention. The occupational therapy team asked the patients to participate in the planning of a week&#x02019;s activities with a goal of avoiding unnecessary heavy-duty tasks and alternating different levels of energy expenditure. The nutritionist reviewed the slide sequence shown in the first class and answered questions for each specific topic related to a well-balanced diet. The physical fitness team did a workshop on relaxation and meditation. The medical team closed the program by quizzing patients on the definition, causes and management of OA, and recalling highlights of each team&#x02019;s presentations. Both days of lectures had 30- to 60-minute intervals, at 9:30 (30 minutes), 13:00 (1 hour), and 16:00 (30 minutes), for meals composed of the diet suggested by the nutritionist.</p><p>The printed material contained summaries of all classes from the first intervention day, including the actual exercises performed at the physical therapists&#x02019; and physical educators&#x02019; workshops as well as practical recommendations for daily living offered by the occupational therapists. The DVD had the 3 workshops (physical therapy, fitness, and occupational therapy) and all 7 explanatory lectures given in the first intervention, lasting a total of 143 minutes. All patients were asked watch the DVD and/or read the booklet no less than 3 times.</p><p>Subgroup A patients received telephone calls from the medical team 2 months after the lecture and every other month after that until the 1-year reassessment. Patients were asked about pain, medications, diet, occupational therapy participation, and social and/or physical activity and frequency. Patients were reminded repeatedly to watch the DVD and/or read the material; to exercise at least 3 times a week (preferably daily); and to change their social, occupational, and dietary habits.</p><p>Patients were reevaluated 4 and 12 months after receiving the educational material. Patients answered the questionnaires, physical activity query, and, during the medical interview, the need to follow a healthy diet, exercise (if possible, continuously increase exercise load), and change occupational and leisure habits was reinforced. Evaluators were blinded to the allocation. Weight and height were measured at baseline and at 1 year after the educational program. The BMI was calculated. The psychology team evaluated the patients with a coping scale adapted to the Brazilian population<sup><xref rid="bibr22-2151458516645634" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> at 1 year. The coping scale evaluated the patient&#x02019;s coping skills in terms of being focused on problems, their emotions and religion/fantasy thinking, and whether they were seeking social support. The Lequesne, WOMAC, VAS, and SF-36 scores and level of education were assessed at each visit according to group and telephone calls and to psychological coping results obtained at 1 year.</p><sec id="section6-2151458516645634"><title>Sample size</title><p>This is a pilot study to evaluate the best (time wise) intervention to add multiprofessional education to KOA clinical treatment.

Patients were allowed to participate regardless of inability to walk without aid or severe chronic diseases as long as they were already in treatment with recommendations from their specialists as to restriction of fluids, medications, and exercise routine. This could be a reason for the 4 deaths during the follow-up period. Some studies have excluded these types of patients.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-2151458516645634" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>

Patients must perceive the disease as important and the change in habits as beneficial. Patients are more receptive to health information when it is presented in terms of potential gain and uses examples that are of the same gender and race.<sup><xref rid="bibr23-2151458516645634" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="bibr24-2151458516645634" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> Years and grade of obesity, degree of OA, functional impairment, adversity coefficient, lack or presence of depression, and social&#x02013;oeconomic problems also influence results. Patients who were essentially problem focused showed a weak relation to function improvement (Lequesne, <italic>P</italic> = .05) at 1 year.</p><p>Objectively, from the program, almost 100 patients changed from null to some physical activity. At baseline, only 25 practiced regular physical activity (11 light, 12 moderate, and 2 vigorous) and at 1 year 123 were practicing some physical activity of which 74 light, 40 moderate, and 9 performed vigorous regular activity. These results were not shown as improved scores in WOMAC, Lequesne, or PCS of the SF-36. Seventy-two patients lost weight, but only 27 more than 2 points in BMI affecting somewhat the correlation between BMI and pain/functional scores.</p><p>In the search for factors affecting compliance to the program, we found weak correlations between coping domains and questionnaire results. We did not find relation between the patients&#x02019; level of education and pain and functional improvements. There was some indication that BMI reduction correlated with 1-year results of pain, function, and quality of life and with improvements in function (WOMAC) and quality of life, as expected,<sup><xref rid="bibr25-2151458516645634" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> mainly because, of the 198, only 27 reduced more than 2 points in BMI. Therefore, instead of offering educational material only, it might be better to intervene more frequently, allowing patients to exchange experiences with other participants and reinforce correct diet and exercise to maintain or even improve on the results obtained at 4 months.</p><p>The limitations of the study are (1) lack of control over the use of analgesics or other nonpharmacological measure. The educational program should be the core measure to all other types of OA treatment.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-2151458516645634" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Although educational programs are known to have a small ES,<sup><xref rid="bibr9-2151458516645634" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> in our experience, teaching patients with osteoporosis led to a high adherence to physical activity, medications, and diet after the educational program.<sup><xref rid="bibr13-2151458516645634" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Therefore, all patients were already instructed to pursue physical activity, acupuncture, physical therapy, and orthotics before the educational interventions. Anti-inflammatory drugs were prescribed only for periods of no longer than a week, if they were prescribed at all. At the assessments, medications were seldom changed, but the actual consumption of medications was not evaluated in this study. (2) Patients with K&#x00026;L grade IV were included. Despite being equally distributed across all groups, their greater physical limitations could have compromised the results. (3) The difference in BMI between groups 2 and 3 could be a potential bias; however, both groups were very similar in BMI changes during the study and showed no significant differences in changes in pain, function, and quality of life. (4) We did not analyze changes in hours of physical activity, percentage of body fat, or quality of food ingested before and after the program. These are future aims for the 2-year reassessment. (5) We did not consider previous studies to estimate the sample size. We had no experience with our population, their level of education, or their capacity to answer questionnaires, so we decided to perform this prospective randomized study as a pilot study to identify the best approach to improve pain, function, and quality of life in our patients with KOA. All groups showed some small improvement regardless of classes or telephone calls. They did have difficulties answering questionnaires,<sup><xref rid="bibr26-2151458516645634" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> but the interval between classes did not influence the results at 4 or 12 months.

Roughly, 12% (27 of 228 initial patients) reduced more than 2 points in BMI and increased physical activity to levels of improved pain, function, and quality of life. Coping skills and educational level of patients may affect adherence to treatment, and we may need to adapt the program improve patient&#x02019;s adherence.
