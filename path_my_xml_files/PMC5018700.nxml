The response increases and reaches its maximum level within one minute and ends within 5&#x02212;10 minutes after intubation.<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> These changes in BP and HR are well tolerated by healthy individuals; however, they may be fatal in patients with cardiovascular diseases or those with increased intracranial pressure. Opioids, a2-agonists, b-blockers, vasodilators, lidocaine, or magnesium sulfate have been used to reduce these hemodynamic responses.<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>-<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> The effectiveness of these drugs to blunt sympathetic stimulation has been found to be quite different throughout medical literature, because it was studied in different settings in relation to dose or route of drugs or type of surgery. Among the opioids, medications with rapid onset such as fentanyl have been commonly used for this purpose.<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> In the relevant studies with fentanyl, the optimal dosage and time of administration to successfully attenuate the sympathetic response was found to be 2 &#x000b5;g/kg at 5 minutes prior to endotracheal intubation.<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Recently, oxycodone has been used for the control of chronic pain, cancer pain, or post-operative pain in the form of intermittent intravenous (IV) injections or patient-controlled analgesia.<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>-<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> However, its potency has not yet been accurately determined, and most studies show the conversion ratio of oxycodone versus morphine as 1:1. The potency ratio between fentanyl and oxycodone has not been investigated clearly and is simply assumed to be 1:100. However, some studies comparing postoperative pain scores concluded that the potency ratio of fentanyl to oxycodone might be approximately 1:75 or that oxycodone might be more potent than morphine (4:3).<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> There have been no previous studies that have investigated the use of oxycodone to reduce the hemodynamic response during endotracheal intubation. So far, the effects of oxycodone and its optimal dosage during endotracheal intubation have not been studied. Therefore, we investigated the action and side effects during endotracheal intubation of IV oxycodone 140 &#x000b5;g/kg (1:70) or 200 &#x000b5;g/kg (1:100) compared to fentanyl 2 &#x000b5;g/kg.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Methods</title><p>This prospective, randomized, double-blind designed study was carried out between June 2014 and February 2015 at the Yeungnam University Hospital, Daegu, Republic of Korea in accordance with the principles of the Helsinki Declaration and after obtaining approval of the study from the institutional ethics committee and written informed consent from participants. Ninety-five patients, 18-65 years old, the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status 1-2, undergoing general anesthesia, were included in this study. Exclusion criteria included heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, severe obesity (body mass index &#x0003e;30), history of difficult intubation, or predicted difficult airway.</p><p>The patients were randomized using a computer randomization program into one of 3 groups: Group F: fentanyl 2 &#x000b5;g/kg (Fentanyl<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Myungmun, Korea), Group O/70: oxycodone (Oxynorm<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Mundipharma, UK) 140 &#x000b5;g/kg (1:70), Group O/100: oxycodone 200 &#x000b5;g/kg (1:100). Two anesthesiologists conducted the study. One was responsible for preparing the study drug, and the other for performing the anesthesia and assessing the side effects. Both the assessor and patients were blind to the group allocations and were not informed of the block size until the end of the study. Oxycodone and fentanyl were prepared in 10 mL syringes, and normal saline was added to a final volume of 5 mL to create an identical appearance. Then, the drugs were consecutively injected to each patient according to the randomization schedule.</p><p>Midazolam 0.03 mg/kg was IV injected into the patients for premedication in the preoperative holding area. In the operating room, routine monitoring devices were applied including electrocardiography (ECG), non-invasive BP, pulse oximetry, and bispectral index (BIS). After confirmation of baseline vital signs, the study drug was injected and the patients were carefully monitored for 5 minutes. During this period, patients were assessed for complications of opioid administration, particularly respiratory depression, hypotension, bradycardia, dizziness, chest stiffness, and pruritus. After that, propofol 1.5 mg/kg and rocuronium 0.8 mg/kg were injected to facilitate endotracheal intubation. Oxygen and air (FiO<sub>2</sub> 0.5) were delivered during the induction period. After the achievement of deep neuromuscular block confirmed by train of Four (TOF) monitoring, endotracheal intubation was performed, and sevoflurane 1.5% was added. If systolic BP (SBP) increased &#x0003e;150 mm Hg after intubation, sevoflurane was increased 0.5% in a timely manner and BP was rechecked every 2.5 minutes. Vital signs including SBP, diastolic BP (DBP), mean BP (MBP), HR, SpO<sub>2</sub>, and BIS were recorded before administration of the study drug (T1), just before intubation (T2), one minute after intubation (T3), and 7.5 minutes after intubation (T4). In case of hypotension (SBP &#x0003c;90 mm Hg), or bradycardia (HR &#x0003c;60 beats per minute [bpm]), ephedrine 4 mg, or atropine 250 &#x000b5;g, respectively, were injected. When hypertension (SBP &#x0003e;180 mm Hg), or tachycardia (HR &#x0003e;120 bpm) occurred, nicardipine (Perdipine<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Astellas Korea, Seoul, Korea) 500 &#x000b5;g or esmolol (Brevibloc<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Jeil Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Seoul, Korea) 20 mg, respectively, were administrated. Hypoventilation was defined as SpO<sub>2</sub> &#x0003c;90% during the 5 minutes after study drug administration, and when it occurred, the patient was encouraged to breathe deeply. If oxygen saturation did not recover, oxygen supply via face mask or manual assistance with ventilation was applied, as needed.</p><p>This prospective investigation was performed as a preliminary study because there were no previous reports about the use of oxycodone as an adjuvant to tracheal intubation. An effect size of 0.38 and a sample size of 24 participants per group were found to provide a 10% difference in MBP at one minute after tracheal intubation with a power of 0.8 and a type one error of 0.05. In consideration of a dropout rate of about 10%, 95 patients were enrolled in this study. Data was computed and analyzed by using Statistical Package of Social Sciences Version 18.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used to analyze MBP, HR, SpO<sub>2</sub>, and BIS, and the Bonferroni procedure was used for post hoc testing. Categorical data was analyzed with the chi-square test and continuous variables were analyzed using one-way ANOVA.

In the current study, the hemodynamic responses of the 3 drug regimens were similar, and the incidence of complications was also comparable. Endotracheal intubation and laryngoscopy are almost always accompanied by increases in BP and HR, so various medications have been used to blunt such stimulations. However, no agent has yet been revealed to be superior to the others, and they are used in combination according to patients&#x02019; physical status. Opioids are widely used for this purpose, but they are often accompanied by hypotension before intubation or during surgical draping. Hypotension after the administration of induction agents pushes anesthesiologists to perform hasty intubation. If sufficient muscle relaxation is not achieved, intubation could cause vocal cord contractions or injury.<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Also, hypotension often appears during the time between endotracheal intubation and the initiation of surgery; therefore, induction agents should have adequate hemodynamic profiles during the entire period of anesthetic induction. In the current study, MBPs were all above 60 mm Hg, even during the anesthetic induction, and the overall difference showed no statistical significance among the groups. There were no significant differences in complications among the groups; therefore, we conclude that oxycodone has clinically similar hemodynamic effects to those of fentanyl during induction of general anesthesia, both in 1:70 and 1:100 ratios.</p><p>Although the difference was not significant in this study, the overall trend showed lower MBP in the oxycodone groups. The reason is unclear but we hypothesized 3 possible explanations. First, the synergistic effect of propofol and oxycodone might be higher than that of propofol and fentanyl. Second, histamine released by oxycodone might induce decreased MBP. The potency of opioids has been compared in many studies with pain scores, not by hemodynamic profiles. For instance, as oxycodone does not release significant amounts of histamine, as morphine does, oxycodone has been found to decrease BP less than morphine at equianalgesic doses.<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> However, fentanyl belongs to the piperidine group and does not produce histamine release.<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> This may contribute to the MBP difference even at equianalgesic doses of oxycodone and fentanyl. Third, oxycodone exhibits effects by binding the &#x000b5;-opioid receptor, like other opioids. However, in animal studies, oxycodone has been revealed to have an additional antinociceptive profile through the k-receptor, which is located prudently on peripheral nerves.<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> K-receptor agonists, U-50 and 488H, have been reported to decrease left systolic peak pressure and HR in isolated rat hearts, which was not antagonized with naloxone.<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> And another k-receptor agonist, dynorphin, has been reported to decrease mean arterial pressure and dilate the superior mesenteric artery.<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> That might affect MBP in both oxycodone groups even though there is no significance. Oxycodone is a semi-synthetic opioid analgesic derived from the naturally occurring alkaloid, thebaine.<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Its onset is similar to that of fentanyl (2-3 min after IV injection) and its duration of action is slightly longer (t1/2: 4 hours 52 min versus 3 hours 39 minutes).<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> As the k-receptor is associated with visceral pain, the effect of oxycodone is better than that of morphine in intra-abdominal surgery.<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Also, in a comparison of oxycodone and fentanyl in postoperative pain control after laparoscopic cholecystectomy, 15 mg of oxycodone showed better analgesic effect than 200 &#x000b5;g of fentanyl.<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> These findings suggest that the potency ratio between oxycodone and fentanyl is not 1:100 in surgeries involving visceral pain.<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p><sec id="sec2-6"><title>Study limitations</title><p>Subjectively, complications were assessed by incidence rather than by severity. For instance, in one patient in Group O/100, manual ventilation was required to recover saturation from 66-90% SpO<sub>2</sub>. The patient needed several stimulations or interventions to maintain SpO<sub>2</sub> over 90%, but this result was interpreted as the same as desaturated patients who recovered oxygen saturation over 90% by a single stimulation only. In other words, only incidence but not magnitude of desaturation was assessed in this study. Also, dizziness, chest discomfort, and pruritus were assessed, but could not be considered in the results because the responses were not definite. Patients who were moderately sedated may have been confused or failed to answer the questions regarding these side effects. A high percentage of these patients belonged to Group O/100, even though BIS was comparable among the groups. Therefore, assessing unpurposed behaviors may have resulted in significant differences. Further studies are needed to establish the respiratory complications of oxycodone during the anesthetic induction period.</p><p>In conclusion, oxycodone could be successfully used to attenuate the sympathetic response during endotracheal intubation as effectively as fentanyl. Although the exact conversion ratio between fentanyl and oxycodone could not be determined in this study, both 140 &#x000b5;g/kg and 200 &#x000b5;g/kg of oxycodone provided stable MBP during anesthetic induction.</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p>
