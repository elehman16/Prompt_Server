Outcomes will be measured at the patient, GP, and PT levels using self-report, semi-structured interviews, and register based data. The primary outcome measure is patient-reported quality of care (OsteoArthritis Quality Indicator questionnaire) at 6-month follow-up. Secondary outcomes include referrals to PT, imaging, and referrals to the orthopaedic surgeon as well as participants&#x02019; treatment satisfaction, symptoms, physical activity level, body weight, and self-reported and measured lower limb function. The actual exposure to the tailor made implementation strategy and user experiences will be measured in a process evaluation.

The OA prevalence increases with age and is growing due to the aging of the population and the epidemic of obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. OA is one of the leading causes of pain and disability for the adult population worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and is one of the major contributors to years lived with disability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The costs of treatment and work-related losses are a considerable economic burden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Knee and hip joint replacements for treatment of advanced OA represent a common inpatient surgery. Due to the growing obesity epidemic coupled with aging of the population, the demand for these procedures is expected to accelerate and quadruple by 2030 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>Internationally, evidence-based recommendations and standards of care have been developed to improve OA management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. There is currently no known cure for OA, but non-pharmacological modalities like education, exercise, and weight reduction represent core interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The recent national recommendation for imaging in musculoskeletal diseases in general practice recommends conventional radiographs and not magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in decisions on indication for joint arthroplasty [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. However, Norwegian and international research indicate that an overall increased access to MRI will result in an increased number of MRI referrals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], probably also in people with OA.</p><p>Structured approaches and stepped care strategies for OA management in order to endorse quality of OA care have been developed in other countries. While Porcheret et al. developed a stepped care strategy for older adults in primary care with knee pain or knee OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], the Dutch stepped care strategy (Beating osteoARThritis (BART)) provided a framework for health care providers and people with hip or knee OA to discuss the optimal timing of the various treatment options [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In the UK MOSAICS study, practice nurses have been trained to provide OA consultations and follow-ups and coordinate referrals to the multidisciplinary care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In Australia, initiatives to reduce the surgery waiting list have been implemented, for example the Osteoarthritis Chronic Care Program (OACCP) in New South Wales. In this programme, a new model of care is being tested, in which a musculoskeletal coordinator assesses individuals and links them with relevant health care providers to support timely and effective care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. During 2008, a Swedish project called &#x02018;Better management of patients with OsteoArthritis&#x02019; (BOA) was initiated to improve OA care and reduce sick leave among people with OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The aim of BOA is to offer evidence-based OA information and exercise according to treatment recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and that surgical interventions should only be considered if non-surgical treatment has been tried and failed. In 2013, a similar project was started in Denmark &#x02018;Good Life with Arthritis in Denmark&#x02019; (GLA:D) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Although the health care systems and the models of OA care are somewhat different across countries, the recommendations in the various national and international guidelines are very similar. Thus, aspects of these approaches are likely to be applicable also for other countries.</p><p>In the new health sector reform, the Norwegian Directorate of Health has placed the main responsibility for OA treatment in primary health care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. However, recent Norwegian research has indicated that people with OA are not receiving the recommended and optimal treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. This was particularly evident for receipt of OA information, guidance on lifestyle changes, self-management, and weight management. Previous research in general practice has revealed that general practitioners (GPs) are reluctant to discuss weight issues with their patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. A British study on OA monitoring among GPs revealed that the GPs favoured monitoring physical function, pain, and analgesia use over body mass index (BMI), self-management plans, and exercise advice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The authors suggested that the provision of suboptimal care did not result from lack of knowledge and that interventions to improve OA care must address barriers to GPs engaging in optimal care provision [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. A study among Norwegian physiotherapists (PTs) in private practice showed that exercise treatment was frequently provided but also revealed that the PTs also provided several other treatment modalities with moderate to low quality of evidence or with no evidence from systematic reviews [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p>While good communication is an important element of health care quality, the GP consultation has a limited duration. This implies a challenge for the GPs with respect to patient communication and restricts the amount of information and guidance that can be included within a short consultation. Current OA guidelines recommend physical activity and a healthy lifestyle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. However, behavioural changes are hard to achieve, and long-term follow-up may be needed. To support for behavioural changes and self-management is a challenge within a GP consultation. A recent systematic review showed that organized follow-up on change of health behaviour can lead to increased level of physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Apart from private physiotherapy, there have up until recently been few other kinds of services that people with OA can be referred to. Frisklivssentral (FLS) (Healthy Living Centre) is a relatively new Norwegian primary health care service that aims to guide and support health-related behavioural changes for individuals with increased risk of, or those who already have, a disease or illness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. PTs represent the majority of employees at FLS, but people with other professions may also work at FLS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Close to half of the Norwegian municipalities had established FLSs by 2014. Earmarked subsidies are granted and other incentives for further development are present [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p>Based on international recommendations for OA care and previous research, the SAMBA model for integrated care for people with hip and/or knee OA in Norwegian primary health care has been developed (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>) and will be implemented in this study. The purpose of the model is to improve quality of OA care in primary health care services by implementing evidence-based international recommendations for OA care among GPs and PTs. An implementation of the model should ensure the provision of optimal, high-quality treatment, and that GPs and PTs deliver the same consistent message to people with OA. However, according to previous research, implementing new care models is challenging, and a systematic review highlighted that there are &#x02018;no magic bullets&#x02019; for improving quality of health care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], but identifying barriers and enablers of implementing guidelines can guide the selection of more effective implementation strategies that are tailored to address those determinants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p>The barriers and facilitators may be different at different levels of health care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Grol &#x00026; Wensing have suggested to categorize barriers to and incentives for change among health care professionals into awareness, knowledge, attitude, motivation to change, and behavioural routines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. For patients, knowledge, skills, attitude, and compliance are examples of barriers to and incentives for change. Further, barriers and facilitators at the social, organizational, economic, and political context may be present as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. According to Sanders et al., one key obstacle for a successful implementation in primary care may be to achieve &#x02018;coherence&#x02019; of the desired practice change with the GPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. GPs may not be able to overcome the inertia of previous practice, may not have the motivation to change, or may not recognize the new approach as distinct from usual practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Among determinants of guideline use among PTs in primary were care lack of time, poor availability, and limited access to evidence the most important barriers, whereas awareness of and positive attitudes towards guidelines and evidence-based practice, considering guidelines to facilitate practice, and knowing how to integrate patient preferences with guidelines were associated with frequent use of guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. In a recent publication, it is stated that one of the major barriers to implement effective management in OA care is suboptimal patient adherence with aspects of the management programme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p><p>Interventions tailored to prospectively identified barriers are more likely to improve professional practice than no intervention or dissemination of guidelines or educational materials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Previous research has showed that successful guideline implementation strategies should be multifaceted and actively engage clinicians throughout the process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. To identify barriers and facilitators for our OA care model, we performed three focus groups with eight GPs, six PTs, and three patient representatives, respectively (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Based on these discussions, we developed an implementation strategy tailored to the barriers and facilitators identified by the focus group participants (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The protocol has been reported using the SPIRIT recommendations and the CONSORT guidelines for non-pharmacological interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Multifaceted implementation activities to facilitate the implementation of the SAMBA model for integrated OA care</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Target group</th><th>Barrier</th><th>Activity</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Patients</td><td>Awareness, knowledge, preference</td><td>Education material</td><td>All patients receive an OA booklet from the PT with information about OA, treatment, and self-management.</td></tr><tr><td/><td>Awareness, knowledge, compliance</td><td>Reminder material, exercise diary</td><td>Together with the electronic questionnaire at 3&#x000a0;months, a check-list of recommended OA care will be provided.

The GP workshop will last about 1.5&#x000a0;h and consist of three parts: (1) a summary of international evidence-based recommendations for OA care; (2) an introduction to the SAMBA intervention; (3) a presentation by an orthopaedic surgeon on surgical treatment that is provided, the appropriate time to refer people with OA for assessment of surgical treatment, and what kinds of treatment (non-surgical) or other assessments (conventional radiographs) that should have been provided before a referral. The presentation is followed by a discussion with the GPs regarding the timing and the content of referrals for assessment of surgical treatment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>The PT workshop training package</title><p>The PTs will attend a 1-day workshop-based education programme as part of the &#x02018;Active life with osteoArthritis&#x02019; (ActiveA) programme, which is a Norwegian initiative similar to the Swedish BOA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] (http/:utv.boaregistret.se) and the Danish GLA:D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] (http/:glaid.dk). The ActiveA programme has been developed and is currently undertaken as collaboration between researchers at Oslo University Hospital and Diakonhjemmet Hospital, Oslo (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.aktivmedartrose.no/">www.aktivmedartrose.no</ext-link>).</p><p>The PT workshop includes education in delivering OA care in accordance with clinical guidelines in a standardized, evidence-based intervention. Education about healthy nutrition and weight reduction will also be included in the workshop. The PTs will receive a complete patient OA education programme (PowerPoint file) to use in their clinical setting as well as a selection of suggested exercises. Furthermore, the PTs will receive information and instructions regarding the SAMBA model for integrated OA care.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Recruitment of GPs and PTs</title><p>GPs and PTs working in private institutes or at FLSs will be invited during outreach visits to each practice and clinic. We aim to recruit 26 (30&#x000a0;%) of the GPs (currently 80 GPs), all PTs (currently 8) at the six FLSs, and 35 (50&#x000a0;%) of the PTs in private practice (currently 70 PTs). In order to facilitate a high attendance among the GPs, the project group will preferably use one of the regular, established meetings in each municipality for the workshop.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Recruitment of participants with hip and/or knee OA</title><p>Participants will be recruited among individuals that visit their GP with activity-related hip or knee pain/complaints. The GPs will identify eligible people with hip and/or knee OA, hand out a single-paged information sheet about the study, and ask for permission for giving the project group their name and phone number. For those who agree, their name and phone number are then mailed by the GP or their secretary in prepaid envelopes to the project group for further contact. The project coordinators will then provide study information by telephone and perform a screening in relation to the inclusion and exclusion criteria (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Those that comply with the criteria will receive the written information material and consent form and have 2&#x02013;3&#x000a0;days to decide if they want to participate in the study.<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Criteria for inclusion or exclusion</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Inclusion criteria</th><th>Exclusion criteria</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>&#x02022; Males and females 45&#x000a0;years or older<break/>&#x02022; Activity-related hip and/or knee pain/complaints<break/>AND<break/>&#x02022; Clinical signs and symptoms corresponding to hip and/or knee OA<break/>OR<break/> radiologically diagnosed OA<break/> OR<break/> registered in the medical journal with the ICPC codes L89 (osteoarthritis of the hip), L90 (osteoarthritis of knee), and/or L91 Osteoarthritis (not classified elsewhere).</td><td>&#x02022; Total hip or knee replacement in the actual joint(s) and no pain/complaints in the other hip or knee joint(s)<break/>&#x02022; Inflammatory rheumatic diseases (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, spondyloarthritis)<break/>&#x02022; Malignant illness or other major conditions (i.e. unstable cardiovascular disorders or lung disease, dementia) that restrict the ability to adhere to the recommended OA treatment<break/>&#x02022; Do not understand the Norwegian language</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p>A computer programme for identifying eligible people with hip and/or knee OA will be developed. The GP or their secretary may run the programme once a month in order to get a list of patients. This list includes patients that have consulted their GP in the last 30&#x000a0;days and are registered with the following International Classification of Primary Care (ICPC) codes in the past 2&#x000a0;years: L89 (OA of the hip), L90 (OA of the knee), L91 (OA not classified elsewhere), L13 (hip symptoms/complaints), L 15 (knee symptoms/complaints), or L20 (joint symptoms/complaints not classified elsewhere). The programme excludes people registered with ICPC codes L88 (rheumatoid arthritis), T92 (gout), and P70 (dementia). When the GP identify eligible people appearing on this list who were not informed about the SAMBA study during their consultation, a letter will be sent from the GP asking the individuals for permission to be contacted by the study coordinator. Information leaflets and wall posters in the GP waiting rooms as well as newspaper articles and information at local meetings in the Norwegian Rheumatism Association can raise awareness of the study so that the individuals can ask their GP about it. In addition, the PTs at FLS and in private practice will be instructed to ask recently referred people with OA if they have received a request to participate in the SAMBA study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Sample size calculations</title><p>Previous research in the &#x02018;Musculoskeletal pain in Ullensaker Study&#x02019; showed that about 12&#x000a0;% of the adult population self-reported OA in their hip and/or knee joints. Among these, 89&#x000a0;% visited their GPs in the previous year. The estimated adult population (aged 40&#x02013;70) in the six municipalities in &#x000d8;vre Romerike is about 35 000, of which about 4200 might have hip and/or knee OA and 3700 might visit their GP during a 1-year period. Based on results from a study in 2012 among 1052 members of the Norwegian Rheumatism Association with hip and/or knee OA, we have estimated the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) (using the 19 counties as clusters) to be &#x0003c;0.01. Further, we have estimated that a minimum of 194 individuals in each group among the six clusters with an average of 50 individuals per cluster, achieves 80&#x000a0;% power to detect a 10-unit difference between the group means of the primary outcome measure (OsteoArthritis Quality Indicator questionnaire); when the standard deviation for the primary outcome measure is 24 units, the drop-out rate is 30&#x000a0;%, and the intraclass correlation is 0.01, using a two-sided test with a significance level of 0.05. Hence, we aim to include at least 388 individuals in total.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>The primary outcome measure</title><p>The participants with hip and/or knee OA will self-report the primary outcome measure, as well as most secondary outcome measures, at five time points: baseline (shortly after the GP consultation) and then 3-monthly (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). The primary outcome will be patient-reported quality of OA care as measured by the OsteoArthritis Quality Indicator questionnaire, a 17-item questionnaire that includes quality indicators (QIs) related to OA patient education and information, regular provider assessments, referrals, and pharmacological treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The items were developed from a literature review of published QIs, expert panels, and patient interviews. The patient self-report questionnaire covers one A4 page with yes/no and &#x02018;not applicable&#x02019;/&#x02018;don&#x02019;t remember&#x02019; as response options, and a previous application has showed acceptable validity and reliability in an OA cohort [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The total QI pass rate for each person will be calculated as the total number of QIs they passed, divided by the total number of QIs for which they were eligible. At inclusion, the primary outcome measure may be used to assess the effect of the intervention of the GP consultation, whereas at follow-up, it may be used to assess the total effect of the new model.<table-wrap id="Tab3"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Primary and secondary outcomes</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th>Measurement scale</th><th>Time<sup>a</sup>

The secondary evaluation will be a cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) based on a disease-specific measure of function: Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score OoL subscale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]/ Hip disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score OoL subscale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] (K/HOOS). Incremental cost per K/HOOS will be calculated as the ratio of the difference between groups in mean cost to the difference in mean K/HOOS. By means of bootstrapping, cost-effectiveness acceptability curves (CEACs) will be used to consider the uncertainty surrounding the cost-effectiveness of the integrated OA care model by plotting the probability that the model is cost-effective according to a range of willingness-to-pay thresholds.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Baseline characteristics of the participants with OA, the GPs, and the PTs will be presented for the total study and stratified by cluster.

Multilevel mixed-models will be fitted to adjust for the effect of clustering (municipality), participant (patient), and repeated measures over time. Analyses of effect and process outcomes in regression analyses will include the baseline value of the outcome variable and be adjusted for covariates at the individual patient participant level (age, gender, education level, pain (NRS 0&#x02013;10), BMI, baseline function (K/HOOS ADL), self-reported comorbidity). To adjust for potential differences related to GPs behaviour, we will include attendance at the GP workshop as a covariate in analyses.
