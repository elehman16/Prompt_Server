This paper describes the study protocol for a web-based randomized controlled trial (RCT) of a commercially available program for overweight and obese adult males and females. The aim of this RCT was to determine and compare the efficacy of two web-based interventions for weight loss and maintenance of lost weight.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>Overweight and obese adult males and females were stratified by gender and BMI and randomly assigned to one of three groups for 12-weeks: waitlist control, or basic or enhanced online weight-loss. Control participants were re-randomized to the two weight loss groups at the end of the 12-week period. The basic and enhanced group participants had an option to continue or repeat the 12-week program. If the weight loss goal was achieved at the end of 12, otherwise on completion of 24 weeks of weight loss, participants were re-randomized to one of two online maintenance programs (maintenance basic or maintenance enhanced), until 18 months from commencing the weight loss program. Assessments took place at baseline, three, six, and 18 months after commencing the initial weight loss intervention with control participants repeating the initial assessment after three month of waiting. The primary outcome is body mass index (BMI). Other outcomes include weight, waist circumference, blood pressure, plasma markers of cardiovascular disease risk, dietary intake, eating behaviours, physical activity and quality of life.</p><p>Both the weight loss and maintenance of lost weight programs were based on social cognitive theory with participants advised to set goals, self-monitor weight, dietary intake and physical activity levels. The enhanced weight loss and maintenance programs provided additional personalized, system-generated feedback on progress and use of the program. Details of the methodological aspects of recruitment, inclusion criteria, randomization, intervention programs, assessments and statistical analyses are described.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Importantly, this paper describes how an RCT of a currently available commercial online program in Australia addresses some of the short falls in the current literature pertaining to the efficacy of web-based weight loss programs.</p><p>Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR) number: ACTRN12610000197033</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Obesity is a major health problem in Australia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], just as it is internationally, and is associated with a range of adverse physiological and psychological consequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. By 2000, 67% of men and 52% of women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] in Australia over 24 years of age were measured objectively as being overweight (Body Mass Index (BMI) &#x0003e;25) or obese (BMI &#x0003e;30). The 5-year AusDiab follow-up study demonstrated that 200,000 adults progress from being overweight to obese each year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Consequently, developing strategies to target obesity treatment and prevention is a national priority.</p><p>In 2008, the total financial cost of obesity in Australia was estimated to be $8.28 billion. This increases to $58.2 billion if indirect costs such as loss of wellbeing are included [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Although prevention of excess weight gain is the ultimate solution, even moderately effective treatments have the potential to improve health and curb heath care costs. For example, the Diabetes Prevention Program has shown that a 57% reduction in the risk of developing type-2 diabetes can be achieved by a weight loss of 5% of initial weight, if maintained for two years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>The proportion of the population desiring to lose weight, for either health or aesthetic reasons, is increasing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and has contributed to the growth of commercial weight programs, such as Weight Watchers and Jenny Craig and relatively new internet-based weight loss programs such as The Biggest Loser Club. However, industry-delivered weight loss programs, including those that are web-based, are rarely evaluated using rigorous research designs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Further, health professionals may be hesitant to recommend commercial weight loss programs unless they are evidence-based and/or they have been shown to be efficacious.</p><p>Accessing health services for obesity treatment is limited with inequitable services relative to population distribution. Internet-based weight loss programs have the potential to provide a service to large numbers of people, be widely accessible (metropolitan, regional, rural, remote, international) and cost effective for the individual. Web-based weight management is under-explored relative to the rapid uptake of the Internet by adults in Australian home environments. Currently in Australia 72% of households have access to the Internet and although there are lower access rates in rural and remote areas and among households with lower weekly incomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], we have previously shown that a web-based weight loss program is of interest to those in 'hard-to-reach' groups such as males, younger people, living in rural and remote locations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Internet programs may overcome traditional barriers to weight loss treatment due to 24 hour a day accessibility, affordability and anonymity for those who may avoid seeking treatment due to embarrassment or other reasons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. It can also provide a forum for social support through e-mail, bulletin boards, chat rooms, group forums and web-hosted meetings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Importantly, it can minimize participant burden and irritation associated with group sessions or clinic visits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], particularly time spent in waiting rooms, and has the potential to be used in a broad range of settings to optimise weight outcomes for patients.</p></sec><sec><title>The evidence base for web-based weight loss</title><p>We recently published a systematic review and meta-analyses examining the efficacy of Internet-based weight loss programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Of the 18 studies identified, seven were assessed for effectiveness based on percentage weight change and four were deemed effective. However, it was not possible to clearly establish the efficacy or the effectiveness of web-based interventions on weight loss due to the heterogeneity of study designs. Whether Internet-based programs are effective at achieving weight loss that is subsequently maintained is also largely undetermined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Although greater use of website features may increase weight loss, we do not know which specific components are more important or can reduce attrition. Therefore, examining the efficacy of commercially available Internet delivered weight management interventions, and determining the specific contributions of self-monitoring of diet, physical activity and body measurements, as well as use of features such as online support, are warranted.</p></sec><sec><title>Study aim</title><p>The aim of this paper is to report the study protocol used in an RCT examining the efficacy of a commercially available online weight loss program on initial weight loss and maintenance of lost weight up to 18 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Design and methods</title><sec><title>Ethics approval</title><p>The University of Newcastle's Human Ethics Research Committee approved this study.

Bandura's Social Cognitive Theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] proposes that behaviour change is influenced by environmental factors, personal factors, and attributes of the behaviour itself. This interaction is referred to as 'reciprocal determinism', as each factor may affect or be affected by the others. The online program targeted key mediators including self-efficacy (e.g. goal setting, self-monitoring of weight, body measurements, exercise and diet), outcome expectations (e.g. knowledge-based web components), modelling (e.g., interactive website features and demonstrations) and social support (i.e. forums, blogs, feedback, email and/or telephone contact).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Phase 1 - Weight-loss interventions</title><p>The interventions are delivered online for 12 weeks, with new program content distributed to the user weekly for both programs. At the end of 12 weeks participants could choose to repeat the same 12-week weight-loss program, or continue for an additional 12 weeks with the accumulated program content all available, or transfer to weight-loss maintenance if they lost a minimum of 10% of their baseline weight.</p><sec><title>Group 1 - Wait-list control</title><p>The initial 12-week waitlist control group was a separate control arm. These subjects were assessed at baseline and 12 weeks, and then re-randomized to Group 2 or Group 3. The time frame for the control was limited to 3 months as it is unrealistic to expect people who volunteer for a weight-loss study in anticipation of achieving weight loss to comply with waiting for longer than 3 months. They did not have access to the study website and were also asked to refrain from undertaking any other weight-loss program during this time.</p></sec><sec><title>Group 2 - Basic online program</title><p>These participants had free access to the study website for the duration of the project.

Portion sizes for individual food items were generated by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] and unpublished data from the 1995 Australian National Nutrition Survey; or the "natural" serving size for common items such as a slice of bread. Subjects were asked about frequency of their consumption over the previous six months with frequency options ranging from 'Never' up to '4 or more times per day' but varying depending on the food item. Twenty-one questions related directly to the intake of vegetables and 11 questions related to fruit. Seasonal availability of some fruits will be considered in the nutrient analysis.</p><p>Nutrient intakes from the FFQ were computed from the most current food composition database of Australian foods available, the Australian AusNut 1999 database (All Foods) Revision 17 and AusFoods (Brands) Revision 5 (Australian Government Publishing Service, Canberra) to generate individual mean daily macro-and micro-nutrient intakes.</p><p>The AES includes questions about the total number of daily serves of fruit, vegetables, bread, dairy products, eggs, fat spreads, sweetened beverages and snack foods, as well as asking the type of bread, dairy products and fat spreads used.

Participants were asked to wear pedometers for seven consecutive days and keep to their normal routine. At the end of the day participants were instructed to record their steps on a pedometer record sheet and reset their pedometers to zero. Participants were instructed to record if they did an activity like cycling, swimming, contact sports or another activity that did not involve stepping and include details (type of activity and duration), or if they forgot to wear their pedometer for an amount of time. Participants will be included in all analyses if they completed at least four weekdays of pedometer monitoring. The average of existing days will be imputed for participants who have included at least four days of data.</p></sec><sec><title>Online diet and physical activity diary</title><p>The Australian Biggest Loser Club online food and exercise diary is powered by the database (International Food and Exercise Database). This database holds the information on over 70,000 foods including 20,000 Australian foods, 250,000 food portions, 5000 meals and recipes, and 1000 exercises. It is derived from a combination of methods including: 1) nutrition information from branded products collected by SP Health; 2) recipes to derive commonly eaten foods developed by an Accredited Practising Dietitian; and 3) sources such as the Australian food database (NUTTAB 2006, Canberra). The METs of exercises have been obtained predominantly from the Ainsworth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] compendium of activities, and all exercise instructions have been compiled by SP Health.</p></sec><sec><title>Indicators of change in Health Status and Quality of Life</title><p><bold>Blood pressure and resting heart rate: </bold>systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure and heart rate were measured using an automated blood pressure monitor (NISSEI/DS-105E digital electronic blood pressure monitor (Nihon Seimitsu Sokki Co. Ltd., Gunma, Japan) under standardized conditions. Subjects were seated for five minutes before the first blood pressure measurement and a rest period of two minutes between measures. Blood pressure was measured three times. Further measurements were taken if the blood pressure or resting heart rate values fell outside of the acceptable ranges i.e. systolic within 10 mmHg, diastolic within 10 mmHg (preferably 5 mmHg) and resting heart rate within 5 bpm. The mean of the two closest systolic pressures and the diastolic pressure paired to them will be reported. The mean of the two lowest resting pulse pressures will be used.</p><p><bold>Blood sample biomarkers: </bold>blood samples were collected after an overnight fast and analysed using standard automated techniques at a single National Association of Testing Authorities accredited pathology service. The samples were analysed for lipids (Total Cholesterol, Low Density Lipoprotein (LDL) and High Density Lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides), thyroid function and liver function, C-reactive protein, glucose and insulin. Additional samples have been stored for future analysis of additional biomarkers.</p><p><bold>Quality of Life: </bold>SF-36, version 2.0 (QualityMetric Incorporated, Lincoln, RI, USA) is a multi-purpose, generic short-form health survey consisting of 36 questions using an 8-scale profile of functional health and well-being scores and psychometrically-based physical and mental health summary measures and scored according to standardised procedures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. It has been used widely in surveys of general populations and in differentiating the health benefits produced by a range of different treatments.</p></sec><sec><title>Use of Internet features and satisfaction with weight loss program</title><p>A process evaluation questionnaire was developed from a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] to assess the use of website features and satisfaction with the web based program, and completed by participants after 3, 6 and 18-months. Objective measurement of participants' use of the website features (e.g. log-ins to specific program features, diary entries, post to bulletin boards) was collected and stored by SP Health Pty Ltd throughout Phase 1 and Phase 2.</p></sec><sec><title>Timelines for Programs</title><p>Baseline assessments occurred in one session and participants in the two intervention groups were able to log on and commence the programs immediately after this initial assessment. This session was conducted early in the morning and participants were offered breakfast following the blood collection, anthropometric and blood pressure assessments. Participants repeated these assessments at 3, 6, and 18 months with the control group having their post-intervention assessments at 9 and 21 months (due to their 3 months wait-list period). To maximize adherence to these sessions, participants were asked to book into an assessment time that suits them using the online scheduling system, Doodle <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://doodle.com">http://doodle.com</ext-link> or alternatively via a telephone call. In addition, for participants difficult to contact other methods were employed such as text messaging and mailing letters. A contribution towards parking and travel costs of $AU10 was given to those attending assessment sessions.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Data analysis</title><p>Analysis will be on an intention-to-treat basis. Analysis of covariance will be used to test for differences in weight loss between groups at 3 months. The model will be fitted using linear regression with weight at 3 months as the outcome variable, treatment group as the predictor variable of interest and weight at baseline included as a covariate. Other independent variables included in the model will be: gender, kilojoule intake at baseline and physical activity at baseline. Differences in weight loss between groups in the weight maintenance phase will be analysed using generalised linear mixed models (GLMM). The outcome in the model will be the individual's weight at the post treatment assessments, the main predictor of interest will be treatment group and baseline weight will be included as a covariate. Other independent variables included in the model will be: time, gender, kilojoule intake at baseline and physical activity at baseline.</p><p>Statistical significance of the primary efficacy analysis (at three months and 18 months) will be based on Hochberg's multiple testing procedure with the family wise error rate for each time point held at 2.5%. All secondary hypothesis tests will be performed using a 2-sided 5% significance level. In addition, linear regression and GLMM will be used to describe relationships among the various dependent and independent variables.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The study described in this paper is one of the first randomized controlled trials of its kind in Australia. The results of this study of a commercially available program will provide much needed information about the efficacy of treatment approaches using the internet in real world settings. It is important internationally because web-based weight management interventions for adults to date have only shown moderate success and commercially available online programs have not been tested for efficacy using a robust study design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>This RCT addresses some of the short-falls in current web-based weight management interventions by (i) incorporating a large sample size compromised of representative samples of both men and women, and an intention to treat analysis plan; (ii) having an 18-month follow-up period, thereby allowing assessment of medium term program effectiveness; (iii) including several important secondary outcomes (metabolic profile, self-monitoring of dietary intake and physical activity, quality of life), and (iv) inclusion of a maintenance of lost weight phase. Data demonstrating whether the study yields positive long-term results from the end of the maintenance phase or not will allow other research groups to benefit from our experience and facilitate the implementation of well-designed RCTs to address the lack of quality web-based interventions. Importantly it will also ascertain whether commercial providers can deliver efficacious web-based programs targeting this important public health issue.</p></sec><sec><title>Funding</title><p>Australian Research Council Linkage Project grant (2009-2012) (#LP0990414, G0189752), with SP Health as the Industry Partner Organisation (#G0189753).
