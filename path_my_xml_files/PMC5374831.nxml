While there was no significant difference in the oxygenation associated with its use as compared to high tidal volume ventilation, the pulmonary mechanics were better maintained. This advantage was negated by the higher systemic IL-6 levels in postoperative period, albeit statistically similar, as compared to those following higher tidal volume ventilation.</p><p>Although there are previous studies regarding the use of various mechanical ventilation strategies during laparoscopic cholecystectomy,[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] there are none evaluating the use of low tidal volume strategy. The use of low tidal volume ventilation is firmly established for long-term usage in critically ill patients,[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and recently benefits have been shown following intraoperative use as well.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>We chose 6 ml/kg as a &#x0201c;low tidal volume&#x0201d; and 10 ml/kg as &#x0201c;high tidal volume&#x0201d;. Although tidal volumes as high as 15 ml/kg have been suggested for intraoperative use to prevent atelectasis, conventionally used volumes seldom exceed 10 ml/kg.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Previous studies evaluating &#x0201c;high&#x0201d; versus &#x0201c;low&#x0201d; tidal volumes during short-term intraoperative ventilation have compared volumes ranging from 9 to 12 ml/kg versus reduced volumes of 5&#x02013;8 ml/kg, respectively.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Thus, 10 and 6 ml/kg tidal volumes were chosen by us to represent a &#x0201c;high&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;low&#x0201d; volume. A PEEP of 10 cmH<sub>2</sub>O was added along with low tidal volume of 6 ml/kg, whereas no PEEP was added with the higher tidal volume of 10 ml/kg. In routine anesthetic practice, conventionally used high tidal volumes of 10 ml/kg do not require the addition of PEEP to maintain gas exchange. On the other hand, low tidal volumes may result in alveolar derecruitment and atelectasis as a result of minimal expansion,[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and it is thus recommended to add PEEP along with lowered volumes. A PEEP of 10 cmH<sub>2</sub>O minimizes tidal recruitment and derecruitment during anesthesia,[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] whereas lower levels of PEEP may paradoxically increase regional shear stress and lung injury due to repeated opening and closing of the alveoli.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Thus, we used the lowered tidal volume of 6 ml/kg along with a PEEP of 10 cmH<sub>2</sub>O.</p><p>The lack of improved oxygenation with low tidal volume as compared to high tidal volume ventilation is in contrast to the benefit observed during laparoscopic urologic surgeries.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] However, laparoscopic cholecystectomy may involve less respiratory compromise as compared to urologic surgeries consequent to variations in patient positioning. This inference of benefit of low tidal volume ventilation in the presence of greater respiratory compromise is also proven by the improved oxygenation associated with its use during one-lung ventilation.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] At the same time, there was an insignificant trend toward better oxygenation intraoperatively, toward the end of surgery, with the use of low tidal volume strategy. Although statistically insignificant, the effect size is not small (SEM = 0.5). This could demand further studies powered to detect intraoperative oxygenation indices as the primary outcome.</p><p>Low tidal volume ventilation resulted in significantly higher PaCO<sub>2</sub> and lower pH values. However, in the low tidal volume group, the baseline values of PaCO<sub>2</sub> measured just following the initiation of mechanical ventilation were also significantly higher than in high tidal volume group. This would likely be a reflection of the period of manual ventilation using a face mask and breathing system during induction of anesthesia before intubation and not the ventilation strategy <italic>per se</italic>. Following initiation of mechanical ventilation, the respiratory rate was titrated to maintain ETCO2 between 35 and 40 mmHg. As a result, the values of PaCO<sub>2</sub> and pH though statistically different were clinically similar between both groups and within normal physiologic range (35&#x02013;45 mmHg and 7.35&#x02013;7.45, respectively). Thus, the intraoperative higher PaCO<sub>2</sub> and lower pH cannot be used to conclude a lesser efficacy of low tidal volume ventilation for CO<sub>2</sub> elimination.</p><p>Similar to earlier evidence from nonlaparoscopic surgeries, the requirement of minute ventilation to maintain EtCO<sub>2</sub> in the normal physiologic range was statistically similar with the low and high tidal volume strategies.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] However, the respiratory rates required to maintain eucapnia with both strategies of ventilation were higher in our study as compared to earlier trials conducted in nonlaparoscopic surgeries,[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] as a consequence of the carbon dioxide insufflation. The trial exploring consequences of low versus high tidal volume ventilation in laparoscopic urologic surgery used predetermined, similar minute volumes in both groups rather than a titrated to maintain eucapnia, making a comparison with our study inappropriate.</p><p>A trend toward improvement in respiratory mechanics, i.e., clinically lower peak airway pressure, higher dynamic compliance, and a significantly decreased resistance was seen with low tidal volume ventilation. Although the P<sub>peak</sub> and compliance were statistically similar, and with a small effect size, they do appear to be clinically better with the use of low tidal volume ventilation. The significantly lesser resistance is a result of the lower inspiratory flow requirement consequent to decreased tidal volume delivery with low tidal volume ventilation, and it has been evidenced earlier also.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] In contrast, when combined with recruitment maneuver or used in patients with preexisting lung pathology undergoing thoracic surgery, low tidal volume ventilation is associated with significantly higher peak airway pressures.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>There was no significant difference in the mean arterial pressure or cardiac index between both ventilation strategies despite higher mean airway pressures with low tidal volume ventilation.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Previous trials noting blood pressure or cardiac index with these two ventilatory strategies have also suggested a lack of any appreciable difference in the hemodynamics.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>We chose IL-6 as a marker to estimate the mechanical ventilation-induced pro-inflammatory systemic response. Several inflammatory mediators have been previously measured to evaluate ventilation-induced inflammatory response and of these IL-6 appear very commonly studied and correlate with the clinical outcome following various modalities of ventilation.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] The serum levels of pro-inflammatory IL-6 increased over time with both ventilatory strategies. There was, however, no significant difference between the two groups although the level was clinically higher in postoperative period with low tidal volume ventilation. Most of the earlier studies have also noted a lack of significant difference in IL-6 following low and high tidal volume ventilation.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Thus, the strategy using 6 ml/kg tidal volume along with 10 cmH<sub>2</sub>O of PEEP was not associated with any significant improvement in gas exchange, hemodynamic parameters, or systemic inflammatory response over ventilation with 10 ml/kg volume without PEEP during laparoscopic cholecystectomy.</p><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-6" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><article-title>Ventilation with lower tidal volumes as compared with traditional tidal volumes for acute lung injury and the acute respiratory distress syndrome.
