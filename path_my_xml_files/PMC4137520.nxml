Theoretically the use of a drain should diminish the volume of hematoma; however the literature has conflicting data. Some authors state that drainage evacuates fluid from a limited area only and can be a cause of infection due to retrograde migration of bacteria. It can also impair the early postoperative rehabilitation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical outcome (especially postoperative pain) and intake of analgesics in patients who had undergone primary cemented total knee arthroplasty (TKA) with or without a postoperative drain.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>A prospective comparative study of 108 consecutive patients (121 knees) was conducted. They were divided into two groups: A study group, with no drainage and a control group with drain inserted at the end of surgery. A total of 121 patients were recruited into two groups. A study group consisted of 59 knees, in which we did not use drainage after TKA and a control group with 62 knees, in which drain was inserted post surgery. Both groups were comparable in terms of preoperative characteristics. The indication for TKA was osteoarthritis (<italic>n</italic> = 105) and rheumatoid arthritis (<italic>n</italic> = 16).</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>In patients without drainage we observed lower need for opioids, higher blood loss on the 1<sup>st</sup> postoperative day and a lower need for change of dressings. There were no statistically significant differences in terms of total blood loss, hidden blood loss, transfusion rate, range of motion, length of hospital stay or incidence of complications between the two groups. In 1 year observation there were no differences in clinical outcome between the two groups.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The present study conclude that there is no rationale for the use of drain after primary TKA. There are benefits in terms of lower opioid intake, lower blood loss on the first postoperative day and lower need for dressing reinforcement during hospitalization.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Blood loss</kwd><kwd>drain</kwd><kwd>dressing reinforcement</kwd><kwd>opioids</kwd><kwd>total knee arthroplasty</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="MESH"><title>MeSH terms</title><kwd>Arthroplasty</kwd><kwd>replacement</kwd><kwd>knee</kwd><kwd>blood loss</kwd><kwd>surgical drainage suction</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>I<sc>NTRODUCTION</sc></title><p>The use of drain in joint arthroplasty is a matter of controversy. Suction drains had been traditionally used to prevent the formation of a hematoma which, in turn, may decrease joint mobility, reduce local tissue perfusion and increase the likelihood of an infection. However, there is a paucity of available studies supporting these traditional beliefs. Some authors state that drainage evacuates fluid only from a limited area and does not prevent infection if retrograde migration of bacteria occurs.<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> It can also impair the early postoperative rehabilitation. In a recent metaanalysis, there is no clear advantage of the use of suction drains, apart from reduced need for change of dressing after total knee arthroplasty (TKA).<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Moreover, in patients who had undergone TKA with drainage, the risk of transfusion was higher.<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p><p>Majority of authors focus on blood loss and complication rate following TKA with or without drain insertion and there is a paucity of studies evaluating its impact on postoperative pain and intake of analgesics. Thus, we undertook a prospective, comparative study to assess the clinical outcome after primary cemented TKA in patients with or without postoperative drainage.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ATERIALS AND</sc> M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><p>124 elective primary TKA were performed in consecutive 111 patients (of them 13 subjects underwent non simultaneous bilateral surgery). The inclusion criteria were knee arthritis impeding daily activities. Exclusion criteria included significant bone loss that required augmentation, previous thromboembolism and intake of opioids preoperatively. We also excluded three patients for other reasons (a woman suffering from Alzheimer's disease, one man speaking a foreign language and one man who refused to participate in the study). The followup rates at 6 and 12 months were 100% and 96%, respectively.</p><p>A total of 121 patients were recruited into two groups. A study group consisted of 59 knees, in which we did not use drainage after TKA and a control group with 62 knees, in which drain was inserted post surgery. Both groups were comparable in terms of preoperative characteristics [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>]. The indication for TKA was osteoarthritis in 105 and rheumatoid arthritis in 16 subjects.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Clinical details of the patients</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJOrtho-48-404-g001"/></table-wrap><p>The regional ethical committee approved the study protocol and all patients provided informed consent.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Operative procedure</title><p>All operations were performed by the senior surgeon (DW). We used two prosthesis systems: Genesis II (Smith and Nephew, Memphis, TN, USA) and Search Evolution (Aesculap, Tuttlingen, Germany). We implanted 100 posterior stabilized prostheses and 21 cruciate retaining (CR) prostheses, all stabilized with cement. Similar numbers of posterior stabilized and CR prostheses were implanted in both groups. A pneumatic tourniquet was applied to each patient. It was deflated after applying compression dressings at the end of the surgery.</p><p>Knee arthrotomy was performed through a midline skin incision and a medial parapatellar capsular incision. Patella was everted. In the control group, drainage was placed intraarticularly. It was removed within first 24 h postoperatively.</p><p>Apart from spinal anesthesia (119 patients) and general anesthesia (2 patients), in all patients we injected 0.25% bupivacaine solution with epinephrine intraoperatively in the joint capsule, rectus femoris tendon and the infrapatellar fat pad. Skin was closed with intracutaneous continuous sutures. After surgery all patients were monitored in the recovery room for 24 h, where the pain was controlled with intravenous morphine pump infusion. Analgesics were administered on patient's demand under the supervision of a doctor, starting with nonsteroidal anti inflammatory medication. When it was necessary, opioids were given to provide pain relief.</p><p>All patients received low molecular weight heparin, starting 12 h before surgery. They also wore compression stockings from the 2<sup>nd</sup> postoperative day. Antibiotics (cefuroxime 1.5 g and amikacin 0.5 g) were administered intravenously 30 min before surgery. If the operation had extended, antibiotics were continued up to 3 days. Patients were transfused, if their hemoglobin (Hb) level decreased to less than 7.5 g/dL and symptoms of anemia developed.</p><p>In each case proper knee alignment was restored. Rehabilitation protocol was the same in both groups. On the 1<sup>st</sup> postoperative day patients stood up with a walker, performed active flexion of the operated knee up to 90&#x000b0;. Exercises with continuous passive motion were commenced. From the 2<sup>nd</sup> postoperative day, patients were allowed to walk on crutches with full weight bearing as tolerable.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Assessment</title><sec id="sec3-1"><title>Primary outcome factors</title><p>The primary outcome factors in our study were pain intensity and analgesic intake. Pain intensity was measured with the help of a visual analog scale (VAS). Intake of analgesics per patient were determined. The administered drugs were divided according to their membership in the World Health Organization analgesic ladder.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-2"><title>Blood loss and transfusions</title><p>In early postoperative period, we recorded Hb and the hematocrit (HCT) levels (preoperatively, then 8 h, 1 day and 2 days after surgery). We assessed the calculated blood loss (CBL), hidden blood loss (HBL), total measured blood loss (TMBL), transfusion rates. CBL was calculated using the Gross formula,<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> which uses the maximum reduction in Hb and estimated blood volume, depending on patient's height, weight and gender.<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> TMBL was the sum of the intraoperative blood loss noted by the anesthetists and drainage blood loss. HBL was determined by subtracting the TMBL from the CBL.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-3"><title>Dressing reinforcement</title><p>We evaluated requirement for dressing reinforcement and the length of hospital stay.

Slightly higher mean pain scores were seen in the control group, especially on the 1<sup>st</sup> postoperative day, when the drain was present but the difference was not significant.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to show that patients after TKA who had a drain, need higher doses of opioids. A study done by Holt <italic>et al</italic>. observed no statistically significant difference in postoperative opioid consumption after TKA, regardless of the presence of a drain.<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Confalonieri <italic>et al</italic>. evaluated patients after unicompartmental knee arthroplasty and noted lower analgesic requirements on the 1<sup>st</sup> postoperative day in patients without drain.<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> However, the authors did not specify what kind of analgesics was applied.</p><p>Disruption of continuity of skin and deeper tissues along with the application of the drain causes peripheral sensitization, resulting in a decrease of nociceptors threshold.<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> In addition concentration of local inflammatory mediators increases and secondarily induces central sensitization. This two level action causes pain hypersensivity and persistent decrease in the pain threshold at the site of injured as well as surrounding uninjured tissues. Moreover, opioid receptors are present in inflamed tissues.<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> It is possible that weaker analgesics are insufficient to control this pain. In contrast, opioid analgesics may sometimes cause adverse effects.<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></p><p>Yiannakopoulos and Kanellopoulos emphasized the often neglected fact, that drain tube removal causes pain and discomfort.<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> It is especially important, because proper pain management is considered to be fundamental for minimizing postoperative stress and improving the quality of life and comfort after surgery.</p><p>Although some articles suggest that a suction drain does not increase blood loss after TKA,<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> other authors demonstrated higher blood loss when it was used.<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> We confirm these results since we noted significant average reduction of Hb and HCT in drained patients on the first postoperative day. The possible explanation of this is that the presence of a drain reduces the tamponade effect.</p><p>The decrease of Hb concentration can lead to a higher probability of blood transfusion.<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Although we observed no significant differences in the overall transfusion rates in both groups, paradoxically in the drained group we have seen lower CBL in transfused patients compared to those who did not necessitate it. This may be associated with the fact that decision regarding transfusion was made not only by the orthopedic surgeon, but also by anesthetist. It seems that the presence of the drain was automatically treated by them as a risk factor for greater blood loss and regardless of indications, resulted in blood transfusion. It was not only our remark. Audet <italic>et al</italic>. established that blood transfusion after elective orthopedic surgery was reasonable in 68% cases on the day of surgery and in the next days it decreased to 35%.<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> The drained blood volume recorded in our analysis was smaller compared with data from other authors.<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> It may be a result of techniques to reduce blood loss which we used. These consist of tourniquet use, cementing of the prosthesis, local epinephrine infusion, minimally invasive manipulations on soft tissues.</p><p>In our study, we observed that significantly more changes of dressing were made in drained patients. Dora <italic>et al</italic>. had similar findings after total hip arthroplasty.<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Until date, most authors assessing this issue reported that in the absence of drain the need for dressing reinforcement was higher or at least did not differ significantly.<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Minnema <italic>et al</italic>. revealed that drainage is an independent risk factor for infection after TKA.<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> On the other hand, Ovadia <italic>et al</italic>. evaluated 58 patients following TKA and found significantly higher serous wound discharge when the drain was not used.<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Nevertheless, it did not affect the complication rate. Our analysis of range of motion, length of hospital stay and other outcomes as assessed with KOOS and SF-36 questionnaires showed no differences between both the groups.</p><p>Our study has some limitations. The number of subjects were small but comparable to other studies.<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> The difference in opinions on transfusion criteria between orthopedic surgeons and anesthetists might have affected the transfusion rate.</p><p>We conclude that there is no rationale for the use of drain after primary TKA.
