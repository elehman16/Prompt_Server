A quasi-experimental design was used in which the intervention group (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;246) was recruited separately from the reference group (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;54). Intervention group participants received a 3-month behavioral support intervention, which consisted of two one-hour face-to-face counseling sessions and three follow-up counseling contacts by e-mail or telephone at weeks three, six and nine. PA counseling, delivered by qualified PA counselors, aimed to satisfy participants&#x02019; basic psychological needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness. Reference group participants did not receive individualized PA counseling. Outcome measures included objectively assessed and self-reported PA and sedentary time and psychological need satisfaction. Assessments were held at baseline, immediately after the intervention (short-term) and 6&#x000a0;months post-intervention (long-term). Mixed model analyses and bootstrapping analyses were used to determine intervention and mediation effects, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The intervention group increased weekday daily steps both in the short- and long-term, while the reference group showed reductions in daily step count (ES&#x02009;=&#x02009;.65 and ES&#x02009;=&#x02009;.48 in the short- and long-term, respectively). In the short-term, weekday moderate-to-vigorous PA increased more pronouncedly in the intervention group compared to the reference group (ES&#x02009;=&#x02009;.34). Moreover, the intervention group demonstrated reductions in self-reported sitting time during weekends both in the short- and long-term, whereas the reference group reported increased sitting time (ES&#x02009;=&#x02009;.44 and ES&#x02009;=&#x02009;.32 in the short- and long-term, respectively). Changes in perceived autonomy and competence need satisfaction mediated the long-term intervention effects on daily step count.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>A 3-month individualized need-supportive PA counseling intervention among employees resulted in significant and sustained improvements in weekday daily step count and in decreased self-reported sitting during weekends.

In fact, recent self-reported physical activity (PA) data showed that more than one third of European adults did not meet contemporary PA recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] (i.e., either 30&#x000a0;min of moderate-intensity PA on five or more days a week or 20&#x000a0;min of vigorous-intensity PA on three or more days a week) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. As insufficiently active individuals are often unaware of their inactive lifestyle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], lifestyle PA interventions have been developed to stimulate a more physically active lifestyle, for example by targeting awareness among subgroups of populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Insufficiently active employees represent one of the target subgroups of these interventions, especially in view of the progressive increase in the prevalence of sedentary PA occupations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>The workplace offers a great setting to promote PA because of the possibility to reach a substantial proportion of insufficiently active employees and the large amount of time adults spend at their work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Recently, &#x02018;a lack of time&#x02019; has been categorized as the most commonly cited barrier to exercise and/or engage in PA among European adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Arising from this perceived time constraint, the majority of insufficiently active employees experience difficulties on how to integrate a regular PA pattern into their daily life.</p><p>A meta-analysis revealed an overall &#x02018;modest positive effect&#x02019; of workplace PA interventions on PA behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Workplace PA interventions were recently characterized into three subcategories: physical activity/exercise interventions, counseling interventions and health promotion interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Whereas the first category mainly focused on exercise engagement (e.g., exercise classes), the latter two intervention categories generally focused on lifestyle PA, (i.e., a daily accumulation of self-selected leisure, occupational or household activities that are at least of moderate intensity) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Examples of interventions targeting lifestyle PA include individualized behavior change programs in which participants are encouraged to incorporate PA of moderate intensity into their daily routine (e.g., active transportation to and from work) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>Lately, the need for more theory-driven PA interventions has been emphasized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Following the previously mentioned &#x02018;lack of time&#x02019; barrier, a perceived &#x02018;lack of motivation&#x02019; is considered to be the second most reported barrier to exercise and/or engage in regular PA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The most widely used comprehensive theory that targets and facilitates human motivation is the Self-Determination Theory (SDT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The central tenets proposed by SDT refer to the support of individuals to develop more autonomous and internalized forms of motivation (instead of externally-controlled extrinsic motivation) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Interventions based on SDT tend to create a need-supportive environment in which individuals&#x02019; behavior change can be facilitated through satisfaction of three basic psychological needs: 1) the need for autonomy refers to feeling volitional in making informed and well-considered decisions; 2) the need for competence refers to feeling capable of achieving desired outcomes; and 3) the need for relatedness refers to feeling mutually connected to important others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>The SDT has been driven interventions in multiple distinct contexts, including weight loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], smoking cessation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and diet regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. As adults tend to lose motivation towards exercise and PA, SDT-based PA interventions have been developed and implemented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. It has been shown that a need-supportive environment has the potential to facilitate and sustain PA behavior change (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]). Based on the abovementioned advantages of workplace interventions, principles of SDT could inform and guide workplace PA interventions.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, only one previous study has evaluated an SDT-based PA counseling intervention that was delivered at the workplace [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. In a randomized controlled trial among insufficiently active university employees, Van Hoecke et al. found significant positive long-term effects of a 4-month need-supportive PA coaching intervention on moderate, vigorous and total PA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The present study elaborates on that intervention by implementing additional self-monitoring tools including pedometers and PA diaries. Furthermore, the present study differs from the study by Van Hoecke et al. in terms of the additional intervention focus on sedentary behavior (in our intervention), the intervention setting (i.e., profit organization in our intervention versus university environment), and the assessment of PA levels (i.e., combined objective and subjective assessments in our study versus self-report only).</p><p>Taken together, the present need-supportive PA counseling intervention targets the two most frequently cited barriers to engage in PA (i.e., lack of time and motivation) by providing tailored PA counseling at the workplace and by creating a need-supportive environment intended to support employees in maintaining a regular PA pattern.</p><p>The PA counseling intervention aimed to satisfy the employees&#x02019; three basic psychological needs outlined by SDT. Examples of this approach include facilitating rather than prescribing PA (need for autonomy), supporting participants to implement their intention(s) to become physically active (need for competence) and encouraging participants to perform their PAs with colleagues (need for relatedness) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p>To this aim, the main objective of the current study was to evaluate the short- and long-term effectiveness of a 3-month individualized need-supportive PA counseling intervention at the workplace on PA and sedentary behavior. It was hypothesized that, compared to the reference group, the intervention group would show a more pronounced increase in PA behavior, and a decrease in sedentary time, both in the short- (immediately after the intervention) and long-term (6&#x000a0;months post-intervention) (hypothesis 1).</p><p>Besides examining the intervention effects on PA behavior, it is also important to evaluate the underlying mechanisms that explain the expected intervention effects. Previous PA intervention studies found mediating effects of self-efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], social support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] and decisional balance (i.e., weighing PA benefits and barriers) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], all arising from different theories and tested among adults and children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The current intervention aimed to satisfy participants&#x02019; psychological needs. Therefore, the second objective of the present study was to evaluate the mediation effects of psychological need satisfaction on changes in PA behavior. Because the intervention intended to influence participants&#x02019; psychological need satisfaction, we expected that the short- and long-term changes in PA behavior would be mediated by changes in psychological need satisfaction (hypothesis 2).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Participant recruitment and study design</title><p>Study participants were recruited from a large pharmaceutical company located in Flanders, the northern Dutch-speaking part of Belgium. The company employs over 3800 employees working across five worksites. Participants (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;300) were recruited from two of the five worksites in two time waves, representing the first half year of 2013 and 2014, respectively. All employees of the company were invited by e-mail to attend an information session in which the purpose, organization, duration, benefits and registration of the PA intervention program was clarified. Eligible employees who were interested could subscribe to enroll in the intervention by an online registration tool.</p><p>The online registration tool consisted of a company&#x02019;s health risk assessment (HRA) tool in which employees indicated the number of days and the accumulated number of minutes (in bouts of 10&#x000a0;min) during which they participated in moderate- and/or vigorous-intensity PA (MVPA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. More specifically, they were asked on how many days, over the last thirty days, they engaged in activities of moderate and vigorous intensity (separate questions for each intensity). Subsequently, respondents were asked to quantify the number of minutes they accumulated on an average day. To calculate the equivalent combination of MVPA, minutes of vigorous activity were weighted by two to account for their greater intensity. Employees who were classified as being insufficiently active (i.e., not meeting the health-enhancing PA recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]) were invited to participate in the PA intervention program.</p><p>Throughout the period of baseline measurements, the PA intervention program was promoted by means of internal communication (distributed by the Environment, Health and Safety office) including e-mails to all employees, leaflets, posters, and screen-based announcements.</p><p>Participants were measured using a quasi-experimental design, in which intervention group participants (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;246) were recruited separately from participants in the reference group (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;54). Both groups were recruited from the same two worksites and during the same recruitment period. The reference group was recruited by means of a general call for participants who were interested in monitoring their activity pattern and assessing their physical health.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Procedure</title><p>Participants read and signed an informed consent and all procedures were approved by the local Medical Ethics Committee of the KU Leuven, Belgium (s54788). At baseline, participants of the intervention group were screened on contraindications to engage in PA using the Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire (PAR-Q) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Participants were advised to visit a physician if they answered &#x02018;yes&#x02019; to one or more of the PAR-Q items. They were, however, allowed to participate in the PA counseling intervention.</p><sec id="Sec5"><title>Intervention</title><p>The 3-month intervention consisted of nine contact moments between participants and PA counselors (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;three): six face-to-face contact moments and three contact moments by e-mail or telephone (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Two of the six face-to-face contacts were explicitly planned as face-to-face counseling sessions, while the other four face-to-face sessions were mainly considered as measurement sessions. In addition, the three e-mail or telephone contact moments included PA counseling content and were part of the PA counseling (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The three PA counselors held Master degrees in Kinesiology, were educated in health-related PA counseling and were specialized in SDT-based counseling.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Time frame of the PA counseling intervention.

</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Intervention group</title><p>The initial session included an introductory talk in which participants expressed their general expectations and goals regarding the intervention program. After this short introductory talk, participants were asked to complete a questionnaire (on demographics, PA level and psychosocial variables; see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Thereafter, anthropometric measures (e.g., blood pressure, BMI, fat percentage) were collected by the PA counselors.</p><p>The measurement sessions consisted of two sessions that were separated by 1&#x000a0;week (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). In the first session of each measurement period (session one, three and five), participants filled out the questionnaire and PA counselors collected anthropometric measures. Based on the participants&#x02019; anthropometry, a PA monitor (SenseWear Armband (SWA)) was prepared and participants were instructed to wear the SWA during the following week. In the second session of each measurement period (session two, four and six), results on the SWA and physical health measures (anthropometry) were discussed and compared with general recommendations for the specific parameters. In case of post- (session four) and follow-up (session six) measurement sessions, PA and physical health measures were compared to participants&#x02019; results on pre- and post-test, respectively.</p><p>In line with previously conducted PA interventions, the face-to-face counseling sessions lasted up to 60&#x000a0;min [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. During the first face-to-face counseling session (session 2), an individually tailored PA plan was designed based on participants&#x02019; goal, preferences for type of activities and current level of PA. Individualized PA programs were offered to facilitate common lifestyle PAs to improve cardiovascular health such as walking, cycling, running and swimming. Participants were allowed to choose one or more of the offered PA programs.</p><p>In addition, participants were encouraged to select at least one action out of a predefined list of actions to reduce their sedentary time and increase PA in multiple contexts (including home, transportation, workplace and leisure time). Proposed actions to reduce sedentary time included statements such as &#x02018;I will stand during phone calls&#x02019; (work context) and &#x02018;I will try to limit television viewing time&#x02019; (home context). The suggested actions to increase PA included statements such as &#x02018;I will get off the bus one stop earlier&#x02019; (transportation context) and &#x02018;I will take the stairs instead of the elevator&#x02019; (work/leisure time context). This opportunity to choose was created to support feelings of autonomy by enabling participants to individually select actions that they considered as relevant for themselves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].</p><p>The three counseling contact moments between pre- and post-test were standardized and completed by e-mail or telephone depending on participant&#x02019;s preference. The majority of participants (77%) chose to be contacted by e-mail, while nearly a quarter of participants (23%) preferred to be contacted by telephone. The content of the e-mail or telephone conversations was guided by the individualized PA plan and based on information on participant&#x02019;s (baseline) PA behavior. More specifically, PA goals were evaluated and adjusted if necessary and participants were motivated to persist in and sustain their PA.</p><p>PA counseling was explicitly focused on fostering the three basic psychological needs outlined by SDT, (i.e., the need for autonomy, competence and relatedness) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>PA counselors intended to support <italic>the need for autonomy</italic> by allowing participants to choose from a number of options to facilitate lifestyle PAs (i.e., different types of individualized PA programs: walking, cycling, running and swimming programs). In addition, the need for autonomy was supported by providing participants with informational feedback (e.g., provide participants with individualized and personally relevant information regarding their PA preference) and by minimizing pressure (e.g., focus on facilitating rather than prescribing PA) during counseling sessions. These techniques encouraged participants to make informed decisions about the direction in which they preferred to proceed for the remainder of the intervention.</p><p>In order to support participants&#x02019; <italic>need for competence</italic>, PA counselors encouraged participants to consider how their intention(s) to become physically active might be implemented (i.e., implementation planning specified by the guiding questions &#x02018;What, where, when, with whom will I be physically active?&#x02019;; &#x02018;What do I want to achieve?&#x02019;; &#x02018;How do I remind myself to be active?&#x02019;). Implementing intentions based on these questions has been shown to be effective in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].</p><p>PA counselors intended to satisfy the <italic>need for relatedness</italic> by being empathetic (e.g., by demonstrating understanding), by providing positive feedback and by active listening during the counseling sessions. Moreover, participants were encouraged to engage in PA together with colleagues (e.g., form a group with colleagues to walk during lunch breaks) and seek support from colleagues. These techniques collectively aimed to stimulate participants to feel connected to both the PA counselor and colleagues alike.</p><p>Besides the need-supportive counseling, our intervention consisted of two additional behavior change techniques, namely barrier identification and self-monitoring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Participants were asked to identify barriers (e.g., environmental or social) that could potentially deter them to engage in regular PA. They were asked to formulate ways to overcome the self-formulated potential barriers. With respect to self-monitoring, participants received pedometers (Omron, Walking Style One 2.1) and PA diaries offering participants an opportunity to goal set and self-monitor their PA behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].</p><p>The main goal of the intervention program was to increase participants&#x02019; baseline PA level.</p><p>Ideally, participants would adopt more PA into their daily lives and more participants would attain the recommended PA norm of 30&#x000a0;min of daily MVPA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>In the second face-to-face counseling session (session four), 14&#x000a0;weeks after the start of the intervention, participants&#x02019; PA behavior change was evaluated and future challenges for PA were discussed in order to encourage participants&#x02019; maintenance in PA engagement.</p><p>Between post- and follow-up sessions, no contact occurred between intervention group participants and PA counselors.</p><p>During the final session at follow-up (session six), participants were provided with an information leaflet. This information leaflet centered on future maintenance of PA and included tips to remain physically active after the intervention has ended.</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Reference group</title><p>Participants in the reference group completed single pre-, post- and follow-up measurement sessions without receiving individualized PA counseling or a tailored PA plan.

Pittsburgh, PA, USA) worn over the triceps muscle of the right arm. The SWA measures PA behavior using multiple sensors (i.e., tri-axial accelerometer, heat flux, skin temperature and galvanic skin response sensor) and was found to provide accurate, reliable and valid measures of PA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Participants were instructed to wear the SWA for seven consecutive days (five weekdays and two weekend days) in order to provide reliable measures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. SWA data were combined with participants&#x02019; gender, age, height and body weight and were analyzed using computer-based SWA software (SenseWear professional software, version 7.0). Valid data included SWA data monitored on at least three weekdays and one weekend day for at least 720&#x000a0;min per day. PA intensity and daily step count were calculated. PA intensity was determined using MET values. Activities with a MET-value &#x02264;1.8 were considered as sedentary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>].

In addition, time spent in combined MVPA was calculated by combining moderate PA with vigorous PA, respectively (moderate PA: vigorous PA&#x02009;=&#x02009;factor 1:2). Minute by minute activities were averaged into daily totals (min/day). To allow comparisons with the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) measures, modified ten-min bouts of accumulated activities were introduced. Bouts were defined as ten or more consecutive minutes of activity, allowing for interruptions of 1 or 2&#x000a0;min below the MET threshold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Activities were averaged on weekdays and weekend days separately. Weekdays and weekend days were also combined into an average day using the following formula: average day&#x02009;=&#x02009;(weekday average*5)&#x02009;+&#x02009;(weekend day average*2)/7.</p><p>Besides the daily minutes of the different intensities of PA, we also integrated the daily minutes of MVPA and number of daily steps into variables that represent the health-enhancing MVPA and steps guidelines. More specifically, we determined the number of participants meeting the recommended number of 10,000 steps per day (for adults) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Furthermore, the number of participants achieving the recommended amount of 30&#x000a0;min of MVPA was determined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The guideline measures were determined for weekdays, weekend days and average days separately.</p></sec><sec id="FPar4"><title>Self-reported PA and sitting time</title><p>The 7-item short version of the IPAQ was used to measure self-reported PA. Participants had to report on how many days per week and for how long they engaged in walking, moderate- and vigorous-intensity PA (in bouts of 10&#x000a0;min) in the past seven days. In addition, participants reported the average minutes they spent sitting in the preceding seven days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. The IPAQ short form was found to have acceptable test-retest reliability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. The minutes of moderate and vigorous PA were combined (moderate PA: vigorous PA&#x02009;=&#x02009;factor 1:2) to form an MVPA measure.

At post-intervention, participants of the intervention group were questioned on the degree of perceived autonomy support using the short (six-item) version of the Health Care Climate Questionnaire (HCCQ) (e.g., exemplary item: I feel that my physical activity counselor provides me with choices and options) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>].

A fifth subscale included amotivation (e.g., &#x02018;I don&#x02019;t see why I should have to exercise&#x02019;). Following the example of previous studies, we combined subscales into the composite variables autonomous motivation (intrinsic motivation and identified regulation) and controlled motivation (introjected regulation and external regulation) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>].

Linear mixed model analysis with an unstructured covariance structure was used to determine time and intervention effects of the PA counseling intervention on objectively assessed PA, self-reported PA and psychosocial variables. To distinguish between short- and long-term intervention effects, two separate mixed model analyses were performed for each outcome variable.

Subsequent analyses indicated a minimum score of 4 with 63.4% of participants scoring 6 or more.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Discussion</title><p>The main objective of the present study was to evaluate the short- and long-term effects of an individualized need-supportive PA counseling intervention on employees&#x02019; PA and sedentary behavior. In line with our first hypothesis, the results of this study demonstrated that a 3-month individualized need-supportive PA counseling intervention was effective in increasing the number of weekday daily steps, both in the short- and long-term.</p><p>With regards to objectively assessed PA, we found short-term effects on weekday vigorous PA and MVPA. Meanwhile, no intervention effects were found on the remaining PA intensities. It should be noted however that main effects of time emerged on objectively assessed moderate PA, vigorous PA and MVPA, indicating an increase in PA levels in both the intervention and reference group. The fact that the participants in the reference group increased objectively assessed PAs could be the result of measurement reactivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. Another explanation of the observed reference group improvements relates to the fact that there were overlapping PA initiatives at the worksites throughout the measurement periods. An elaborate discussion on the content of these overlapping PA initiatives can be found in the strengths and limitation section. The increased PA level among reference group participants might also be the result of the (objective) monitoring of their PA level (i.e., measurement reactivity). This increased PA among reference group participants is a common phenomenon observed in behavioral intervention trials, especially in interventions that exclude participants who meet the PA guidelines (as was the case in the current intervention) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>].</p><p>The fact that we found significant intervention effects in daily step count and not in the different PA intensities could be due to the use of pedometers among intervention group participants. Pedometers provide instant feedback on the number of accumulated steps, and this immediate feedback might have facilitated this specific movement pattern. This interpretation is supported by a recent intervention study, in which participants increased their PA levels (including number of steps) when they received pedometers combined with need-supportive coaching [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. It is important to note, however, that providing pedometers alone did not increase PA levels throughout the intervention. Individualized need-supportive PA coaching was considered as crucial to increase and sustain PA levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>].</p><p>In order to determine the societal relevance of the post-intervention increases in daily step count, we translated the variables into the health-enhancing steps guideline of 10,000 steps per day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. The number of participants who met the steps guideline increased considerably in the intervention group, both in the short- and long-term. In fact, more than half of intervention group participants met the steps guideline after the intervention (51% for weekdays and 58% for average days). In addition to the steps guideline, we also examined the number of participants meeting MVPA guideline of 30&#x000a0;min of daily MVPA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The intervention resulted in an increase in the number of participants who self-reportedly met the MVPA guidelines, both in the short- and long-term. Objectively assessed MVPA guideline measures did not show intervention effects. The fact that we found intervention effects in self-reported MVPA and not in objective MVPA measures, could be the result of an overestimation of higher intensity PAs in self-reported measures compared to objective PA assessments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>].</p><p>At baseline, a subset of participants in the intervention group showed sufficient levels of PA based on both self-reported and objective measures of PA. The fact that some intervention group participants adopted sufficient PA levels was conflicting with the inclusion criteria, as we attempted to only include insufficiently active employees. The discrepancy between the inclusion measures and the baseline measures could be due to differences in questioning between the company&#x02019;s HRA tool (used as inclusion criterion) and the IPAQ (used as self-reported PA measure). The HRA tool emphasized higher intensity activities, e.g., exercise, while the IPAQ also referred to activities of light intensity such as walking. Moreover, the HRA tool referred to the last thirty days whereas the IPAQ recalled on the last seven days. In addition, there could be a substantial time period (up to 3&#x000a0;months) between assessment of the HRA tool and administering of the IPAQ. Another factor that could have contributed to the discrepancy is the possibility that HRA triggered employees to become more physically active prior to baseline assessments. The limitations of self-reported PA screening tools are discussed in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. In fact, it is not uncommon among PA intervention trials, that relatively active participants are recruited, even when the initial aim was to only include low-active participants. It has therefore been suggested to alternatively use objective PA assessments as screening tools, although these objective tools involve significant cost and time investments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>].</p><p>Despite the fact that the counseling was mainly focused on changing employees&#x02019; PA behavior, a short- and long-term reduction in self-reported sitting time during weekends was found. The specific reduction of self-reported sitting time in the weekends might result from the fact that most participants spend more time exercising and participating in sports on weekend days. This engagement in higher intensity PAs might, in part, have replaced sitting time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. We found main effects of time in objectively assessed weekend days&#x02019; moderate, vigorous and MVPA indicating an increase of higher intensity PAs in both the intervention and reference group. Moreover, the reduction of sitting time was targeted as a secondary outcome in our study, which might explain the lack of intervention effects on weekday sitting time. Martin et al. indicated smaller intervention effects when reducing sedentary behavior was considered as a secondary outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>].</p><p>A recent comprehensive systematic review examined the influence of interventions on sedentary time in adults and distinguished between PA interventions, PA and sedentary behavior interventions and sedentary behavior interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. Our study could be categorized as a PA and sedentary behavior intervention, as we also included intervention components to reduce sedentary behavior (e.g., participants were offered list of options to reduce their sedentary time at the workplace and at home/leisure time such as standing up during phone calls). While the review reported an overall intervention effect of 35&#x000a0;min per day (of PA and sedentary behavior intervention) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>], we found comparable intervention effects of 75 (short-term) and 27&#x000a0;min per day (long-term). A more recent meta-analysis, including only RCTs, found comparable results, albeit of less magnitude [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. Interventions at the workplace were found to result in a non-significant reduction in sedentary time of nearly 9&#x000a0;min per day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>].</p><p>The second objective was to evaluate mediating effects of psychosocial variables targeted by the PA counseling intervention. We evaluated the mediating influence of psychological need satisfaction as the PA counselors aimed to satisfy the participants&#x02019; basic psychological needs. The short-term intervention effects were mediated by changes in perceived competence need satisfaction and total need satisfaction, while the long-term intervention effects were mediated by changes in autonomy, competence and total need satisfaction. Previous evidence revealed a strong inter-correlation between the three needs (in particular between autonomy and competence) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. Therefore, the use of a (unidimensional) total needs variable seems to be justified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. As a consequence, the short- and long-term mediation effects of changes in total need satisfaction on changes in daily steps confirmed our expectations (hypothesis 2) and imply that the intervention resulted in significant intervention effects through satisfaction of the three needs, which is consistent with SDT-based assumptions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. There were, however, no mediating effects of relatedness satisfaction. These findings are in line with previous studies as a comprehensive review indicated no (cross-sectional) association between relatedness satisfaction and exercise/PA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The authors of the review provided a possible explanation of this lack of association, by pointing out that engagement in solitary activities (such as walking or jogging) might be satisfying without a specific need for relatedness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p>The autonomy supportive character of the counseling intervention was questioned among intervention group participants. The high mean scores (6.03; min-max: 4&#x02013;7 on a 7-point Likert scale) indicated that participants in the intervention group reported a high degree of autonomy support from the PA counselors during the counseling sessions. The autonomy supportive climate throughout counseling sessions might have contributed to the observed intervention effects.</p><sec id="Sec29"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>The strength of this study relates to the fact that it is among the first to evaluate the long-term effectiveness of an SDT-based worksite PA intervention among employees. The combination of subjective and objective assessments of PA forms the second strength of our study. A third strength concerns the examination of both (short- and long-term) intervention and mediation effects of the PA counseling intervention and psychosocial variables, respectively.</p><p>Nevertheless, our study also had some limitations that should be taken into account. A first limitation is the lack of full randomization. Because of the service providing nature of the PA counseling program to the company in which the intervention took place, we considered it to be unethical and inappropriate to fully randomize participants to the intervention or control condition. This had possible consequences on the extrapolation of our findings as a recent review on worksite PA interventions pointed out that randomized controlled trials were less likely to be effective compared to quasi-experimental studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The review indicated that the included worksite RCTs were more likely to be of longer duration than the controlled quasi-experiments. As speculated by the review&#x02019;s authors, the longer duration (&#x0003e;6&#x000a0;months) of worksite RCTs might explain the diminished effectiveness of these RCTs as it is more difficult to sustain an intervention effect in the long-term [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>A second limitation is the presence of overlapping worksite initiatives at the time of the intervention. There were overlapping initiatives related to promotion of PA and well-being including a <italic>Start to Run</italic> program and a well-being program called <italic>Energy for Performance in Live</italic> (EFPIL). These initiatives included sessions in which employees were informed about &#x02018;the do&#x02019;s and don&#x02019;ts&#x02019; when intentions were made to <italic>Start to Run</italic>. Employees were also informed on how to keep their energy level up throughout their workday (EFPIL). These worksite initiatives might have influenced the study participants in terms of their PA level. However, participants were questioned on whether they participated in one of the overlapping worksite health promotion initiatives (EFPIL). Eighty-nine percent of intervention group participants and 92% of reference group participants reported that they did not participate in EFPIL. This suggests that the majority of participants made no use of this specific worksite initiative.</p><p>Besides the overlapping worksite initiatives, a third limitation refers to the risk of contamination across participants in the intervention and reference group, as we recruited both groups within the same worksites and during the same recruitment period. We cannot rule out the fact that participants in the intervention group have influenced their colleagues belonging to the reference group.</p><p>The difference in follow-up dropout rates constitutes a fourth limitation. At follow-up, there was a higher dropout in the intervention group (27%) compared to the reference group (11%). The higher dropout specific in the intervention group may be the result of a lack of contact moments between post and follow-up measurement sessions. This notion is strengthened given that there was no between-group difference in dropout rate at post-intervention (9% and 2% dropout in the intervention and reference group, respectively). Besides the difference in follow-up dropout rates, we also found that dropouts had a higher BMI than non-dropouts. This finding is not uncommon in lifestyle interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>] and should be taken into consideration when targeting overweighed individuals. Accordingly, future PA behavioral interventions should develop and implement strategies to prevent insufficiently active, overweighed individuals from dropping out.</p><p>A fifth limitation relates to the fact that the study population consisted of predominantly female and highly educated participants. This self-selection may have compromised the generalizability of our findings to other workplaces.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The findings of the current study indicate that a 3-month individualized need-supportive PA counseling intervention delivered at the workplace elicited short- and long-term intervention effects on daily step count, self-reported weekend day sitting and psychological need satisfaction. Besides the short- and long-term intervention effects on need satisfaction, autonomy and competence satisfaction were found to mediate the long-term intervention effectiveness.</p><p>The relative few contact sessions (two face-to-face counseling sessions and three contacts by e-mail or telephone) and small-to-moderate effect sizes suggest a potential cost-effective PA intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. Future research should consider the cost-effectiveness of a comparable intervention and evaluate this type of worksite intervention in a randomized controlled setting with longer follow-up.
