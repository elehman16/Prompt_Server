Within traditional medicine, pomegranate fruit has long been used to increase fertility, however studies on the effect on spermatogenesis in humans have never been published. With this study we investigated whether oral intake of tablets containing standardised amounts of extract of pomegranate fruit and powder of greater galangal rhizome (Punalpin) would increase the total number of motile spermatozoa. The study was designed as a prospective, randomized, controlled, double-blinded trial. Enrolment was based on the mean total number of motile spermatozoa of two ejaculates. The participants delivered an ejaculate after 4&#x02013;8 days of tablet intake and two ejaculates just before they stopped taking the tablets. Seventy adult men with a semen quality not meeting the standards for commercial application at Nordic Cryobank, but without azoospermia, were included in the study. Participants were randomized to take tablets containing extract of pomegranate fruit (standardised with respect to punicalagin A+B, punicalin and ellagic acid) and freeze-dried rhizome of greater galangal (standardised with respect to 1&#x02032;S-1&#x02032;-acetoxychavicol acetate) or placebo on a daily basis for three months. Sixty-six participants completed the intervention (active treatment: n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;34; placebo: n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;32). After the intervention the total number of motile spermatozoa was increased in participants treated with plant extracts compared with the placebo group (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.026). After three months of active treatment, the average total number of motile sperm increased by 62% (from 23.4 to 37.8 millions), while for the placebo group, the number of motile sperm increased by 20%. Sperm morphology was not affected by the treatment. Our findings may help subfertile men to gain an improved amount of motile ejaculated sperm by taking tablets containing preparations of pomegranate fruit extract and rhizome of greater galangal.</p><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>

Only 23% of Danish men have optimal semen quality and 15% are at high risk of needing fertility treatment in order to biologically father a child <xref rid="pone.0108532-Jrgensen1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. It is evident that any improvement in poor quality semen brings about an increased chance for obtaining pregnancy, also with regard to assisted reproductive technology. Intracytoplasmic sperm injection is often the only alternative offered to couples, where the male suffers from poor semen quality. This makes randomised controlled trials of supplements, drugs or diet advices, aimed to improve semen quality, important in order to create other solutions helpful for males with poor semen quality.</p><p>Pomegranate (<italic>Punica granatum</italic>) and greater galangal (<italic>Alpinia galanga</italic>) belong to a limited group of well-known edible plants, which show promising effects <italic>in vivo</italic> on rodent sperm quality without causing undesirable side effects <xref rid="pone.0108532-Trk1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0108532-Qureshi1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. The pomegranate fruit consists of a leathery pericarp containing numerous seeds, each covered by a juicy, translucent aril. Both pericarp and aril juice contains hydrolysable tannins, with the pericarp being the far most concentrated source <xref rid="pone.0108532-Tzulker1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. In the pericarp, the ellagitannins punicalagin A and B predominates, while punicalins, which are partial hydrolysis products of punicalagins <xref rid="pone.0108532-Mayer1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, constitute a minor fraction. The ellagitannins are only found in trace amounts in the aril juice <xref rid="pone.0108532-Tzulker1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Instead, other hydrolysable tannins prevail in the juice together with another important group of polyphenols, the anthocyanins <xref rid="pone.0108532-Gil1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Ellagitannins and, to a lesser degree, anthocyanins possess pronounced antioxidative activity <italic>in vitro</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0108532-Tzulker1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Juice from <italic>P. granatum</italic> fruit has been shown to stimulate spermatogenesis, to increase sperm motility, and to decrease the percentage of abnormal sperm in rats after seven weeks of gavage <xref rid="pone.0108532-Trk1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. An increase in sperm motility and concentration together with a decrease in abnormal sperm rate was observed after 6 weeks of oral administration of pomegranate juice extract to rats <xref rid="pone.0108532-Mansour1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Further, oral administration of pomegranate pericarp extract has been shown effective in reversing induced spermatogenic disruption in rats <xref rid="pone.0108532-Leiva1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. The ginger-like rhizome of <italic>A. galanga</italic> contains a wide variety of semivolatile and volatile compounds, the dominating substances being a group of phenylpropanoids with 1&#x02032;S-1&#x02032;-acetoxychavicol acetate (ACA) as the most abundant. The phenylpropanoids have shown potent antioxidative activity <italic>in vitro</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0108532-Kubota1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, while rhizome extracts of <italic>A. galanga</italic> have shown anti-inflammatory effect <italic>in vivo</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0108532-Satish1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Additionally, extracts of the rhizome of <italic>A. galanga</italic> have been show to increase sperm counts and motility in mice <xref rid="pone.0108532-Qureshi1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> and to increase serum testosterone levels in rats <xref rid="pone.0108532-Islam1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.</p><p>In this study it was investigated whether oral consumption of tablets with a standardised content of <italic>P. granatum</italic> extract and <italic>A. galanga</italic> powder would increase the total number of motile spermatozoa (TMSC) and sperm morphology, defined by strict criteria, in adult men with reduced semen quality. Since this is the first published clinical study investigating the effects of <italic>P. granatum</italic> and <italic>A. galanga</italic> on human semen quality, we chose to focus on the most important (number and motility) <xref rid="pone.0108532-Ayala1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> and basic (morphology) semen parameters <xref rid="pone.0108532-World1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0108532.s001">Checklist S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0108532.s002">Protocol S1</xref>.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design</title><p>The hypothesis was formulated prior to the study, and the power was estimated with the assumptions that the difference between the study and placebo group would be 5 million TMSC and SD&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;2.3 million TMSC. If a significance level of 5% and a statistical power of 80% were given, at least 18 participants should be included in each group. However, due to the high level of uncertainty of the assumptions in this power estimation, nearly twice as many participants were enrolled.</p><p>The study was a prospective, randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blinded trial. The participants were randomised 1&#x02236;1 to daily treatment with tablets containing extract of pomegranate fruit (standardised with respect to punicalagin A+B, punicalin and ellagic acid) and freeze-dried rhizome of greater galangal (standardised with respect to 1&#x02032;S-1&#x02032;-acetoxychavicol acetate (ACA)) or placebo tablets, for 90 days. In addition to the two ejaculates delivered prior to intervention (baseline &#x0200a;=&#x0200a; mean of the two ejaculates), the participants delivered an ejaculate after 4&#x02013;8 days of tablet intake and two ejaculates at the end of the study. Upon termination of the study, the participants completed a questionnaire in order to determine the occurrence of any negative or positive side effects.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Study participants and semen collection</title><p>Participants were recruited over a one-year period by advertising in Nordic Cryobank (sperm bank) and local newspapers. Inclusion criteria were: Healthy adult men &#x02265;18 years of age with a semen quality not meeting the standards for commercial application at Nordic Cryobank (i.e.&#x0003e;200 mio. TMSC in raw semen). Potential sperm donors, who fulfilled the requirements, completed a questionnaire about former illness and medicine consumption to ensure that the reason for inferior semen quality was not due to obvious medical reasons, such as cryptorchidism or genital tract infection.</p><p>Enrolment was based on two ejaculates delivered by masturbation within a time span of 7&#x02013;14 days and with 3&#x02013;7 days of abstinence before each sample delivery. The ejaculates were kept at or above room temperature (max 30&#x000b0;C) and analysed within one hour from ejaculation. Participants with azoospermia were excluded from the study. Seventy participants were enrolled, but four chose to withdraw due to logistic difficulties.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Interventions</title><p>The daily active treatment consisted of 4 tablets with extract of <italic>P. granatum</italic> and 4 tablets with <italic>A. galanga</italic> (Punalpin, Nerthus ApS, Lejre, Denmark), two of each kind taken in the morning, and two of each kind in the evening. The placebo tablets were produced in two variations to visually match the two kinds of active treatment. Four of each kind of placebo tablets were taken daily, two of each kind in the morning and two of each kind in the evening. The participants of both groups received all the tablets at the beginning of the study in two separate containers. The daily active dose provided 1000 mg <italic>P. granatum</italic> extract and 764 mg <italic>A. galanga</italic> preparation, corresponding to 500&#x02013;1000 mL high quality pomegranate fruit juice (based on the amount of characteristic ellagitannins) and approximately 1 g fresh greater galangal rhizome (based on the amount of ACA). For <italic>P. granatum</italic> this corresponded to: 106 mg punicalagin A (27 mg/tablet), 278 mg punicalagin B (69 mg/tablet), 4,7 mg punicalin (1,2 mg/tablet) and 9,6 mg ellagic acid (2,4 mg/tablet). For A. <italic>galanga</italic>, this corresponded to: 16 mg ACA (3.9 mg/tablet).</p><p>Initial screening of a range of commercially available extracts of <italic>P. granatum</italic> and <italic>A. galanga</italic> for their content of characteristic bioactive compounds showed that most extracts of <italic>P. granatum</italic> had either (i) very low levels of punicalagin A and B, punicalin and ellagic acid or (ii) low levels of punicalagin A and B and punicalin, but high levels of ellagic acid, indicating that the former compounds had been degraded to ellagic acid. This is in accordance with the study of Zhang <italic>et al.</italic> (2009) <xref rid="pone.0108532-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> who screened 27 commercial extracts of <italic>P. granatum</italic> and concluded that only 5 reflected the typical tannin profile of <italic>P. granatum</italic> while five extracts had no detectable tannins or ellagic acid. Our screening showed that the ethanolic fruit (pomace) extract P40P (Polinat, Las Palmas, Spain) had a fingerprint profile of punicalagin A and B, punicalin and ellagic acid, which was very similar to that of high quality pomegranate juice (data not shown) and was therefore selected for the present trial. P40P has been standardised to contain at least 35% punicalagin A+B and at least 40% punicosides (the total amount of punicalagins, punicalin, ellagic acid glycosides and ellagic acid).</p><p>Our screening of a number of commercial extracts of <italic>A. galanga</italic> revealed that the content of ACA was either very low or not detectable (data not shown). Therefore, we developed the following method for preparing an extract of <italic>A. galanga</italic> with high levels of ACA combined with very low levels of microbial counts: Fresh rhizomes of <italic>A. galanga</italic> imported from Thailand were purchased (Europa Frugt ApS, Valby, Denmark). The rhizomes were stored at approximately 5&#x000b0;C during transport. Upon arrival the stems were removed and the rhizomes were split longitudinally and transferred to a &#x02212;24&#x000b0;C freezing chamber. After a few days of freezing the <italic>A. galanga</italic> rhizomes were freeze-dried. The water content in the rhizomes were 3&#x02013;5% following drying. The rhizomes were transferred to gas tight sealed bags (VMPET12/Adhesive/LLDPE100, total 114 &#x000b5;m, WJ Packaging solutions, Canada) in nitrogen atmosphere (0&#x02013;3% O<sub>2</sub>) for 14 days. Subsequently the foil bags with rhizomes were placed in a heating oven for 3 hours at 78&#x000b1;2&#x000b0;C in order to further decrease the number of microorganisms. Prior to incorporation in tablets, the dry rhizomes were grated on a standard Co-mill pulveriser.</p><p>Tablets were produced containing either 191 mg of the above-mentioned dried powder of <italic>A. galanga</italic> or 250 mg of <italic>P. granatum</italic> extract. The <italic>P. granatum</italic> tablets additionally contained sodium bicarbonate, silicon dioxide, microcrystalline cellulose, syloid AL1, magnesium stearate and, for coating, propylene glycol, titanium dioxide, talc, and pharmacoat 615.</p><p>The <italic>A. galanga</italic> tablets contained talc, microcrystalline cellulose, syloid AL1, magnesium stearate, plus coating as just described added shellac and copper complexes of chlorophylls for colouring purpose. The placebo tablets contained 461 mg microcrystalline cellulose, syloid AL 1 and magnesium stearate plus coating, and the placebo tablets matching the <italic>A. galanga</italic> tablets also added copper complexes of chlorophylls.</p><p>The levels of marker compounds in the tablets were measured 1, 5, 12 and 21 months after production in order to monitor any degradation.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Outcome</title><p>The primary outcome was change in semen quality during the 3 month long treatment period, from baseline to follow-up, expressed as the total (progressive and non-progressive) motile sperm count (TMSC).

The mixture was subjected to a sonication bath for 20 min. Approximately 1 mL of this solution was filtered through a HPLC filter (Whatman Puradisc 13 syringe filters (0.2 &#x000b5;m), Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) into GC-vials before GC-FID and GC-MS analysis, respectively. GC-FID analysis was performed on an Agilent 6890 GC series (Agilent Technologies, H&#x000f8;rsholm, Denmark) and a Thermo Scientific DSQ II Single Quadrupole GC/MS system (Thermo Scientific, CA, USA) was used for GC-MS analysis. Separations were performed on a ZB-Wax plus column (60 m&#x000d7;0.25 mm internal diameter (i.d.), df&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.25 &#x000b5;m liquid phase, Phenomenex Denmark, V&#x000e6;rl&#x000f8;se, Denmark) using the following oven temperature program: 80&#x000b0;C for 1 min, from 80&#x000b0;C to 220&#x000b0;C at 5&#x000b0;C/min, followed by a constant temperature at 220&#x000b0;C for 20 min. Helium was applied as carrier gas with a flow rate of 1.2 mL. The injection volume was 1 &#x000b5;L with a split ratio of 1&#x02236;50 (injector temperature 200&#x000b0;C). ACA was identified by GC-MS (70 eV) based by comparison of retention time (R<sub>t</sub>) and mass spectrum with an authentic standard of ACA (PhytoLab GmbH &#x00026; Co. KG, Vestenbergsgreuth, Germany) and quantified by GC-FID (FID operating at 300&#x000b0;C) based on a calibration curve of ACA covering the concentration range occurring in the samples. All analyses were performed in duplicates with a relative standard deviation of less than 1%.</p><p>For HPLC sample preparation, 15 tablets were ground in a mortar and 30 mg of the ground tablets were mixed with 20 mL distilled water in a 50 mL flask with screw cap. The mixture was subjected to a sonication bath for 20 min. The dissolved tablet sample was filtered through a HPLC filter (0.2 &#x000b5;m) before HPLC analysis. Analytical HPLC-DAD analysis was carried out on an Agilent 1200 Series analytical HPLC system (H&#x000f8;rsholm, Denmark) equipped with a DAD operating from 190 to 600 nm. Polyphenols were monitored at 258 nm, and UV spectra were recorded between 190 and 600 nm. Separations were performed on a Luna 3 &#x000b5;m C18(2) 100 &#x000c5;, LC end-capped column (150 mm&#x000d7;4.6 mm internal diameter, 3 &#x000b5;m particle size, Phenomenex Denmark, V&#x000e6;rl&#x000f8;se, Denmark). The mobile phases consisted of 0.2% phosphoric acid in water as solvent A and 100% acetonitrile as solvent B, and the polyphenols were separated using the following solvent gradient: 0 min (5% B), 7 min (30% B), 8 min (70% B), 13 min (70% B), 15 min (5% B), and 17 min (5% B). Solvents were degassed before use. The flow rate was 1.0 mL/min, the column temperature was 40&#x000b0;C, and the injection volume was 10 &#x000b5;L. Stock standard solutions of punicalagin A and B (ChromaDex, Boulder, CO, USA), punicalin (Stanford Chemicals, Irvine, CA, USA), and ellagic acid (Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany), respectively, were prepared in water:methanol (80&#x02236;20, v:v) at a concentration of 1 mg/mL. Water was used for further dilution of the stock standard solutions. The polyphenol standards were used for identification (R<sub>t</sub> on HPLC and UV spectra) and quantification (calibration curves covering the concentration range occurring in the samples). All analyses were performed in duplicates with a relative standard deviation of less than 5%.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Analysis of sperm motility</title><p>Number of motile sperm in each semen sample was determined using a Makler counting chamber (Sefi Medical Instruments Ltd., Haifa, Israel) by two laboratory technicians both blinded to the study.

Although numerous studies have addressed the question of whether oral intake of antioxidants is indeed beneficial for semen quality <xref rid="pone.0108532-Tremellen1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, several authors of recent studies and reviews conclude that more large well-designed studies are needed in this area. However, despite lack of consensus between studies and lack of evidence for improvement in the most important outcome parameter, pregnancy rate, the majority of studies find a positive effect of various antioxidants on semen quality, mainly measured by sperm concentration and motility <xref rid="pone.0108532-Lombardo1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0108532-Gharagozloo1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Recently, an oral supplement of various antioxidants was shown to decrease the number of immotile sperm and to significantly increase the TMSC in men undergoing fertility treatment <xref rid="pone.0108532-Wirleitner1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. In another study, daily intake of sesame was shown to increase sperm count and motility <xref rid="pone.0108532-Khani1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. In both these studies, the interval of semen analysis from baseline to follow-up was at least two months, leaving no information on whether the supplements had an effect on epididymal sperm. Nevertheless, both studies referred to the antioxidant effect as the major reason for sperm quality improvement. In the study on the effects of sesame on sperm quality, sperm morphology was also assessed, but in accordance with our present findings there was no improvement in sperm morphology after three months of taking the sesame supplement <xref rid="pone.0108532-Khani1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>.</p><p>Several studies have shown that oxidative stress in the seminal fluid, i.e., excess levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) compared with the antioxidant levels, causes decreased sperm quality via two mechanisms: 1) Some ROS act as free radicals and cause damage to the sperm cell membrane thereby decreasing sperm motility and 2) the free radicals may cause damage to the sperm DNA <xref rid="pone.0108532-Tremellen1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Both <italic>P. granatum</italic> and <italic>A. galanga</italic> contain significant levels of antioxidants that may fully or partly explain the effect observed in this study on sperm quality. The antioxidant activity of <italic>P. granatum</italic> might be due to the abundant polyphenols present in the fruit as their chemical structure indicates that they can act as direct and indirect antioxidants. The bioavailability of polyphenols is, however, of major concern when talking about the direct antioxidant effect of these compounds because the concentration in the systemic system is often too low to have any significant direct antioxidant effect <italic>in vivo</italic>. Therefore, the preventive effects of polyphenols against, e.g., oxidative stress are probably related to their ability to activate the endogenous antioxidant defence system; hence acting as indirect antioxidants. Polyphenols containing <italic>ortho</italic>-phenol groups as those found in pomegranate fruit can be metabolised by phase 2 enzymes to electrophilic <italic>ortho</italic>-quinones, which is a prerequisite for activating the endogenous antioxidant defence system <xref rid="pone.0108532-DinkovaKostova1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0108532-Birringer1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. The antioxidant properties of the most abundant polyphenols in <italic>P. granatum</italic> are therefore expected to be due to their indirect antioxidant activity.</p><p>Hence, the fact that the TMSC did not increase after approximately one week of tablet intake in the present study does not prove against an antioxidant effect of the combination of <italic>P. granatum</italic> fruit extract and <italic>A. galanga</italic> rhizome powder. It rather suggests a possible effect of indirect antioxidants. In addition, <italic>P. granatum</italic> polyphenols may also exert modulatory effects in cells through selective actions on different components of the intracellular signalling cascades such as hormones and regulatory proteins that are vital for cellular functions such as growth and proliferation <xref rid="pone.0108532-Crozier1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0108532-Satpathy1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. This may also explain the observed effects of the <italic>P. granatum</italic> fruit extract and <italic>A. galanga</italic> rhizome powder combination.</p><p>As for the polyphenols in <italic>P. granatum</italic>, the major bioactive constituent of <italic>A. galanga</italic>, the 1&#x02032;S-1&#x02032;-acetoxychavicol acetate (ACA), also acts as an indirect antioxidant, although the chemical structure is unrelated to the <italic>P. granatum</italic> polyphenols. ACA is also a strong electrophile <xref rid="pone.0108532-Miyauchi1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, which seems to explain many of the reported bioactivities of this natural product. ACA has been shown to enhance phase 2 enzyme activity and to regulate the glutathione metabolism by activating the endogenous antioxidant defence system <xref rid="pone.0108532-Nakamura1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0108532-Higashida1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref> essential for its antitumor and chemopreventive effects <xref rid="pone.0108532-Miyauchi1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0108532-Ando1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0108532-Ohnishi1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Conclusion and future studies</title><p>This study indicates that intake of tablets containing preparations of extract of <italic>P. granatum</italic> fruit pomace and the rhizome of <italic>A. galanga</italic> (Punalpin) may help men in gaining an improved amount of motile ejaculated sperm.</p><p>Running chemical analyses of the tablets confirmed the presence of several potentially bioactive compounds, e.g. antioxidants, however at present we do not know, which of these compounds may be responsible for the increase in TMSC.
