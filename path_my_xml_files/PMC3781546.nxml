Diabetes treatment must be both effective and efficient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). In 2011, diabetes affected at least 366 million people or 5% of the world&#x02019;s population (8% of adults) and was responsible for 4.6 million deaths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). The prevalence of diabetes is expected to increase to 552 million in 2030 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). In 2011, diabetes care consumed at least 465 billion USD, accounting for 11% of health care expenditures in adults 20&#x02013;79 years of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). The main cause of the high-cost burden of diabetes is its acute and chronic complications, leading to a 3&#x02013;13-fold increase in costs per patient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). The occurrence of complications is related to nonmodifiable risk factors such as age, sex, and socioeconomic status. It is also related to modifiable risk factors, such as BMI and waist circumference, as well as risk factors not directly related to diabetes, such as comorbidities including depression. HbA<sub>1c</sub> is widely monitored as a measure of the risk of complications and as a target for intervention. HbA<sub>1c</sub> may also be important in defining a more comprehensive risk-based approach to diabetes management.</p><p>We have previously explored patient-centered care as a treatment strategy for type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Earlier, we conducted a cluster-randomized, controlled clinical trial that compared patient-centered care versus professional-directed and usual care (control) in 13 hospitals (clusters). Patient-centered care had very acceptable incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) as compared with professional-directed and usual care. These findings stimulated additional studies of self-management promotion, which is presently regarded as an essential and potentially very cost-effective approach to diabetes management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>).</p><p>Unfortunately, most, if not all, studies focus on the average patient, whereas individual characteristics relate to the risk of developing complications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>), the effectiveness of treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>), and health care costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). More effective and efficient diabetes care might be achieved by focusing patient-centered strategies on patients with specific risk profiles. Such approaches have infrequently been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>).</p><p>Therefore, we analyzed data from our trial using individual patient data to compare patient-centered with usual care. We stratified patients by baseline HbA<sub>1c</sub> and measured HbA<sub>1c</sub> and costs at 1 year, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and health care costs over a lifetime. We tested the hypothesis that a policy of patient-centered care, provided to patients in higher baseline HbA<sub>1c</sub> strata, would result in significantly better outcomes and more efficient health care.</p><sec id="s1"><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><sec id="s2"><title>Population and intervention (see CONSORT flow diagram online)</title><p>We conducted a prospective cluster-randomized trial, aiming at 18 hospitals. Four did not participate and one dropped out for financial reasons. Eligible hospitals were situated across the Netherlands and met predefined eligibility criteria in terms of numbers of beds and diabetes specialist nurses. The 13 hospitals were representative of the 120 general hospitals in the Netherlands and delivered ambulatory secondary care. There was no systematic contamination due to geographical differences. The characteristics of the 13 hospitals that participated and the 5 that did not did not differ substantially. There was a small difference in mean HbA<sub>1c</sub> (SD) between participating and nonparticipating hospitals (7.8 [1.2] vs. 8.0 [1.4], respectively) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). In the 13 participating hospitals, internists recruited the first 150 patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes who attended a diabetes clinic, excluding patients who were pregnant or had a poor life expectancy due to other diseases. Enrollment took place between November 1999 and March 2000. Exclusion criteria included participation in another study or being an academic hospital as we sought to study real-life day-to-day clinical care using a low-impact observational approach. After several pilot studies and preintervention baseline patient measurements, each hospital was randomized (without restrictions) to one of three intervention arms, allocating patients with type 2 diabetes into patient-centered, professional-directed, and usual care arms (see CONSORT flow diagram in Supplementary Data online). Allocation was performed by a noninvolved person, a so-called third party, outside the research group, and allocation results were concealed from the investigators until the start of the intervention. The allocation ratio was 4:4:5. Internists and patients allocated to the intervention group were aware of the allocated arm. The unit of randomization equaled the unit of analysis and was depicted as a continuous (the percentage of people benefitting) rather than as a dichotomous (success or failure) outcome. For practical reasons, and as the outcome was nonsubjective, the study was not blinded. The study design was clustered since the intervention strategy could only be implemented by a provider team with a group of patients in a single hospital outpatient setting. Without clustering by hospital, serious contamination at the hospital, patient, and provider level would have taken place. Ex ante, we made no modifications to the trial design or protocol in response to changing circumstances or allocation results.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Baseline characteristics</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="3054tbl1"/></table-wrap><p>This article compares two trial arms (see CONSORT flow diagram online) of randomly assigned clusters, the patient-centered arm with <italic>n</italic> = 240 patients (<italic>n</italic> = 237 with available HbA<sub>1c</sub> data at baseline) and the usual care arm with 276 patients (<italic>n</italic> = 269 with available HbA<sub>1c</sub> data at baseline). Both subgroups are comparable with respect to baseline patient characteristics (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). In the patient-centered care clusters, patients were not only seen by their internal medicine doctors and diabetes team as in usual care but additionally received detailed diabetes passports based on national guidelines that aim to educate and record results of medical examinations in order to promote shared disease management. Educational meetings for patients were organized in all of the hospitals where the diabetes passports were introduced. Physicians, diabetes specialist nurses, and dietitians attended these meetings with an opinion leader and received personal feedback with benchmarks on baseline data, adherence to key guidelines, and the use of the diabetes passports. Barriers and facilitators were discussed. Internists received personal feedback on clinical performance after 6 months as well as on the use of the diabetes passports. Leaflets and waiting room posters were also distributed. Usual care consisted of visits every 3 months to a specialized nurse and/or internist according to national evidence-based guidelines (CBO Banda Heereveen 1998, ISBN 90-6910-217-X). The standard protocol was rechecked, re-explained, re-emphasized, and followed up in the hospitals involved.</p><p>Using individual patient data, we stratified all patients into three groups according to baseline HbA<sub>1c</sub> (&#x0003c;7% [53 mmol/mol], 7&#x02013;8.5%, &#x0003e;8.5% [69 mmol/mol]) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>) and examined the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of patient-centered care in each stratum. The analyses described in this article were not part of the original analyses of the cluster randomized control trial and were therefore performed as secondary analyses.</p><p>The institutional review board (Medical Ethics Committee of University Medical Center Nijmegen) and the Committee for Scientific Research with Human Subjects (CWOM 9810&#x02013;0208) approved of the study. All patients gave written informed consent. The trial has been assigned the ISRCTN number ISRCTN3581744 at the Commissie Mensgebonden Onderzoek (CMO), with the title The Diabetes Guidelines Implementation in Hospitals Study. The full protocol can be requested from the CMO and the authors; at the time, an online trial registry was not in place.</p><p>During and after the study, there were no departures from the initial study protocol. There were no changes to eligibility criteria, interventions, examinations, data collection, methods of analysis, and outcomes. The initial study had HbA<sub>1c</sub> as the primary outcome measure for the sample size calculations. A mean HbA<sub>1c</sub> of 7.9% (63 mmol/mol) was specified that could drop 0.5% (3.1 mmol/mol) after the intervention. &#x003b1; was set at 0.05 and &#x003b2; at 0.20. Sample sizes for cluster-randomized trials were inflated to adjust for clustering. The intracluster correlation coefficient was set at &#x003c1; = 0.01. Given a potential of four hospitals per arm and a 70% response rate, the sample size needed was 150 patients (with a single medical record) per arm. The power is further indicated by the confidence interval. Potential inconsistencies in laboratory outcomes in pre- and postmeasurements were checked by the Dutch Foundation for Quality Assessment in Clinical Laboratories, in which all hospitals participate. Calibration of HbA<sub>1c</sub> was performed according to the guidelines of the National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program. No interim analyses were warranted or performed. Using the health care perspective, our analyses of trial effect and cost include health-related outcomes and health care costs related to the individual patients for the 1-year duration of the trial and during a simulated patient lifetime. Individual patient outcome and cost data from the trial follow-up were entered into an existing national diabetes model multiple times. This model has been used and described in previous studies, including one that estimated the long-term costs of diabetes and cardiovascular complications and hospitalizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Health effects (HbA<sub>1c</sub>), costs, and cost-effectiveness over 1 year</title><p>The end points regarding the impact of stratification over 1 year were the effectiveness of HbA<sub>1c</sub> reduction, costs, and ICERs. The latter were obtained from nonparametric bootstrapping and estimated mean (95% CI). Each of these simulations used 1,000 bootstrap samples drawn from the original dataset containing the individual patient records. Direct costs per patient were estimated and standardized by multiplying each resource use component by the unit cost and summing the results at baseline and after 1 year for the main cost drivers: costs of medication (unit costs: insulin, &#x02013;497 USD; tablets, &#x02013;223 USD), costs of glucose monitoring (236 USD for glucose testing once every 6 weeks), and costs of implementation strategies (3.7 USD per patient) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Health gain, medical costs, and cost-effectiveness over a lifetime</title><p>The primary end points with respect to efficacy over a lifetime were effectiveness, QALYs (assessing the long-term complications and the excess cardiovascular morbidity and mortality associated with diabetes), as well as costs, based on the estimated events and prevalence of complications. These were estimated by extrapolating and bootstrapping individual patient data in a probabilistic cost-effectiveness analysis with 10,000 iterations using a per intervention arm validated probabilistic Markov diabetes model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>).

We adjusted for the natural increase in HbA<sub>1c</sub> over time, ageing of patients, and the age-related increase in complication risk, accounting for uncertainties by including distributions in values of input variables, including HbA<sub>1c</sub> at the end of the trial and mortality risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>).

This suggests that patient-centered care should focus on patients with a baseline HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x0003e;8.5% (69 mmol/mol), be considered for those with HbA<sub>1c</sub> = 7.0&#x02013;8.5% (53&#x02013;69 mmol/mol), and not be implemented in those with baseline HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x0003c;7% (53 mmol/mol).</p><p>This article transforms intuition into evidence and quantifies the benefits of targeting the patient-centered care intervention by baseline HbA<sub>1c</sub>. Exploring additional criteria for stratification, as well as additional interventions aimed at the high-risk patient groups, seems warranted.</p><p>Our study is among the first to stratify patients with type 2 diabetes according to baseline risk in order to optimize lifetime benefits and lower costs. Our results are consistent with the recent literature on cost-effectiveness of interventions in people at high risk for diabetes and stratified analyses in other diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). A recent Cochrane review suggests a benefit of individual education on glycemic control when compared with usual care in a subgroup of those with a baseline HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x0003e;8% (64 mmol/mol) in an at least 6-month follow-up (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). We extend these findings over a lifetime and show that such benefits persist.</p><p>Several limitations should be acknowledged. Further studies should replicate and refine these analyses and include other risk profiles to account for heterogeneity among patients. This would also provide a more comprehensive picture of the additional key risk factors impacting the development of complications. Also, further studies should include primary care settings since treatment of chronic diseases like type 2 diabetes tends to occur in primary care settings. In addition, longer follow-up will be needed. We assumed that the level of improvement seen after 1 year would be maintained over a lifetime (as shown in the UK Prospective Diabetes Study [UKPDS]). This is especially relevant for the stratum with HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x0003e;8.5% (69 mmol/mol). Another potential limitation could relate to the generalizability of our findings. Although it is likely that our findings apply to other European and North American hospital settings, since the prevalence, characteristics, treatment strategies, and costs of type 2 diabetes are similar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>), the intensity of care might vary. Finally, more complex models might be needed that include side effects and disutilities related to insulin and oral medication use and other health care costs (related to patient admissions, primary care, or specialist visits).</p><p>Further insight can be achieved by replication of the present approach in larger completed studies hypothesizing gradients or threshold levels below which patient-centered care is not cost-effective and above which it is cost saving. Moreover, a study using a priori stratification would provide valuable confirmatory evidence for the findings of our exploratory study. Conceptually, the terminology and emphasis of patient-centered care has evolved over the years. At the time of our study, it referred to care in which the patient through the use of self-monitoring was more involved in decision making than those enrolled in usual care. The current concept of patient-centered care is one where the patient plays a much more active role.</p><p>For now, our results have several implications. When faced with the question of whether intervention A is effective and cost-effective relative to intervention B, the answer may be &#x0201c;it depends&#x0201d; instead of an unequivocal &#x0201c;yes&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;no,&#x0201d; when referring to the average patient. Targeting treatments at specific risk groups may result in better outcomes and better use of resources. Targeting those with HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x0003e;8.5% (69 mmol/mol), those who are most in need, is preferable to targeting those who have little to gain. Especially in low- and middle-income countries, targeted implementation might reduce health care expenditures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>).</p><p>Future research should confirm our findings in primary care and investigate risk profiles other than HbA<sub>1c</sub>. These might include BMI or waist circumference or cardiovascular risk factors that predict cardiovascular events.</p><p>Targeting interventions to the highest risk population may allow resources to be better used, costs to be reduced, and negative side effects to be reduced by avoiding unnecessary use of medications. Focusing on HbA<sub>1c</sub> and examining a variety of HbA<sub>1c</sub> reduction strategies is valuable for patients, health care organizations, and the economy.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1" fn-type="supplementary-material"><p>This article contains Supplementary Data online at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc12-1865/-/DC1">http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc12-1865/-/DC1</ext-link>.</p></fn><fn id="fn2"><p>Clinical trial reg. no.
