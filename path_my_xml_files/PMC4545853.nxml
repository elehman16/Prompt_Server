Despite this, less than half of eligible children complete a Healthy Kids Check (HKC), a preschool preventative health assessment available since 2008. Using a rigorous theoretical process, the barriers that affected delivery and reduced general practitioner and practice nurse motivation to provide HKCs, were addressed. The resulting multifaceted intervention, aimed at increasing the proportion of children receiving evidence informed HKCs from general practice, was piloted to inform a future randomised controlled trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The intervention was piloted in a before and after study at three sites located southeast of Melbourne, between February and October 2014. The HKC-intervention involved: 1) Delivery of training modules that motivated reception and clinical staff by delivering key messages about local prevalence rates and the &#x0201c;Core Story of Child Development&#x0201d; 2) Practical advice to prepare clinics for specific HKC-examinations 3) Workflow advice regarding systems that included all staff in the HKC process, and 4) Provision of a &#x0201c;Community Resources Folder&#x0201d; that enabled decision making and referrals. A major component of the intervention incorporated the promotion of structured developmental screening by the practice team using Parents&#x02019; Evaluation of Developmental Status.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Twenty of 22 practitioners and practice managers agreed to join the study. Post-training questionnaires showed participants had developed their skills working with young children as a result of the training and all respondents believed they had successfully implemented standardised HKC services. Post intervention proportions of children completing HKCs significantly increased in two of the practices and quality improvements in HKC-processes were recorded across all three sites.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This pilot study confirmed the feasibility of delivering a multi-faceted intervention to increase HKCs from general practice and demonstrated that significant quality improvements could be made. Future studies need to extend the intervention to other states and research the health outcomes of HKCs.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Pilot study</kwd><kwd>Complex intervention</kwd><kwd>General practice</kwd><kwd>Preventive health care</kwd><kwd>Child health</kwd><kwd>Healthy Kids Check</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>In Australia, Child and Family Health Nurses (CFHNs) play a key role providing universal, government funded, preventive health to young children, administered at local government level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Despite this, services remain fragmented, the result of divergent policy frameworks established by the eight federated states and territories [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], so that less than 60&#x000a0;% of families complete a pre-school visit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In response to persisting child development and health issues, the Australian government introduced the Healthy Kids Check (HKC) into general practice, in 2008, and made a family tax benefit contingent on receipt of a pre-school check [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The HKC is a one-off health assessment, available to children (aged 3.5 to 5&#x000a0;years) completing pre-school vaccinations (with any GP or local government services) (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Parents can, therefore, choose not to receive CFHN services and may obtain a HKC from GPs in the private sector. Overall, less than half of eligible children complete a HKC, with wide variability across jurisdictions, from a low of approximately 22&#x000a0;% in Victoria (where CFH services are arguably the most developed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]), to a high of approximately 66&#x000a0;% in Queensland [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Our previous research found that HKC delivery is hampered by a combination of practitioner, environmental and system barriers that combine to reduce motivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The findings aligned with barriers of &#x02018;insufficient time&#x02019; and &#x02018;a lack of community resources&#x02019; uncovered in a survey of GPs in Victoria, prior to rollout of the HKC, when delivery of preventive healthcare during &#x02018;sick-child&#x02019; consultations was another principal concern [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Mandatory and non-mandatory components of the Healthy Kids Check</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Mandatory<sup>a</sup>

In each study the design of the intervention was informed by the barriers identified in previous research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] or a needs analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and incorporated training and facilitated referral pathways. In the United States (US), systematic reviews of paediatric primary preventive health interventions have also considered screening for lead poisoning, anaemia and tuberculosis, developmental problems, vision, hearing, and blood pressure. Interventions were generally multifaceted, combined education and training with audit and feedback, included environmental modifications (e.g. clinical decision making aids) and improving office support systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. These interventions suggest potential solutions relevant to the Australian context and to our intervention pilot targeting the HKC.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Aims</title><p>The study aims to test the feasibility of an evidence-based complex intervention designed to increase the proportion of children aged 3.5- 5&#x000a0;years (target age group) receiving HKCs. Secondary aims are to increase the proportion of eligible children having a body mass index (BMI) recorded and increase GP and Practice Nurse (PN) self-efficacy administering HKC services.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Overview</title><p>This was a 6&#x000a0;month pilot of a &#x0201c;whole-of-practice&#x0201d; intervention, delivered to three general practices. Quantitative methods, pre- and post-implementation, tested the feasibility and impact of the HKC-intervention on staff beliefs, attitudes and behaviours, and measured components of practice activity. The study was approved by Monash University Human Research Ethics Committee. Written informed consent was obtained from all study participants.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Setting and participants</title><p>Implementation of the intervention took place between February and October 2014 at sites located in the catchment of a single regional primary healthcare organisation (PHO), southeast of Melbourne. Practices served predominantly urban populations in a region experiencing rapid growth with pockets of high social disadvantage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and high levels of child developmental vulnerability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Practices were recruited via an advertisement placed in the electronic newsletter of the PHO (158 practices). The project nurse, who also worked to support vaccination services in the catchment, encouraged enrolment into the study. To be eligible, practices had to provide vaccination services to children and propose key personnel- a GP or PN &#x0201c;HKC-Champion&#x0201d; and a practice manager- to drive the intervention and liaise with clinical and office practice staff.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Design of the intervention</title><p>The intervention was constructed following the UK Medical Research Council guidance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] in an iterative process that applied a behaviour change model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The Behaviour Change Wheel, a tool for systematically designing and evaluating behaviour change interventions, mapped the barriers and facilitators uncovered in our qualitative exploratory work, to specific interventions that could be used to target those factors. Since multiple factors operated to impede the delivery of the HKC, a multi-faceted intervention was required. The intervention included: Education and skills training addressing lack of knowledge about specific components of the HKC and how to communicate sensitive findings to parents (e.g. child-overweight and developmental delay); attending to equipment and space requirements; using a team-based model of care to address time and staffing barriers; and provision of evidence based tools and pre-formulated pathways of care to overcome negative beliefs about the outcomes of HKCs. The intervention was determined following consultation with a stakeholder group.</p><p>A significant component of the HKC-intervention was the introduction of the Parents&#x02019; Evaluation of Developmental Status (PEDS) questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], a tool used to assess child development, validated and widely used by CFHN services in Australia. PEDS was selected because it elicits parent concerns, applies to children of preschool age and is completed, scored and interpreted in 2&#x02013;5 minutes, making it an ideal choice for general practice.</p><p>The HKC-intervention was divided into four areas of content:<list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>A.</label><p><italic>Three training modules</italic> that opened with &#x0201c;The Core Story of Child Development&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and information about local prevalence rates of child health problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] aimed at motivating participants.

The project nurse obtained consent, delivered questionnaires and the education and training modules (3 visits), assisted with equipment and process inventories (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>), extracted data (3 visits) and offered advice. She was supported by one of the researchers (KA), a general practitioner with expertise in preventive health of preschool children, whose role was to deliver peer-group clinical training (module 2).<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Inventory of Practice Equipment and Processes used for HKCs</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Quality indicator</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Office systems</td><td>Uses a recall or reminder system to invite or identify eligible children</td></tr><tr><td/><td>Has a process in place to deliver PEDS<sup>a</sup> to parent in waiting room</td></tr><tr><td/><td>Has a list of referral sources (e.g. paediatricians) accessible to all clinicians</td></tr><tr><td>Equipment</td><td>Balance-beam or electronic scales (measure to nearest 0.1&#x000a0;kg)</td></tr><tr><td/><td>Fixed or correctly placed tape stadiometer (measure to nearest mm)</td></tr><tr><td/><td>BMI calculator (age and gender specific)</td></tr><tr><td/><td>Visual acuity (VA) chart suitable for pre-school children</td></tr><tr><td/><td>VA chart correctly placed (according to chart-type, 3&#x000a0;m or 6&#x000a0;m)</td></tr><tr><td>Examination method</td><td>Uses standardised developmental screening tool (e.g. PEDS<sup>a</sup>) as part of HKC</td></tr><tr><td/><td>BMI calculation and interpretation</td></tr><tr><td/><td>Tests uni-ocular vision (patches or covers the eye adequately)</td></tr><tr><td/><td>Applies &#x0201c;Lift-the-Lip&#x0201d; tool correctly</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>
<sup>a</sup>PEDS&#x02009;=&#x02009;Parents&#x02019; Evaluation of Developmental Status</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p><p>The HKC procedure was as follows: On arrival, office staff handed a PEDS questionnaire to the parent, to complete in the waiting room. This was scored by the practice nurse at the outset of the HKC-consultation so that the HKC was tailored to parent concerns. Body Mass Index (BMI) was calculated and interpreted following accurate measurement of height and weight. Uni-ocular visual acuity was assessed, and corneal light reflection and cover tests examined for strabismus. Oral health was assessed using the &#x0201c;Lift the Lip&#x0201d; tool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Other mandatory components of the HKC were completed by direct questioning (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Where possible, parent concerns were addressed using parent tip-sheet resources. The business model proposed that each HKC, including PEDS interpretation, would be signed off by a GP, so that the parent could claim a Medicare rebate commensurate with time taken (and rebated more highly than the nurse-only HKC item). In the event that a developmental or health problem was discovered, practitioners could access additional resources provided in the electronic folder. A request was made for PEDS forms to be de-identified and returned to the research nurse to analyse concerns identified by parents.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Measurements</title><p>A significant component of measurement utilised the Pen Computer System Clinical Audit Tool (PCS CAT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. This tool has been widely implemented by PHOs to analyse practice population, Medicare and some clinical data. BMI is the only clinical output of the HKC recorded by the PCS CAT, but it is not exclusive to the HKC. Practitioners&#x02019; anthropometric measures, as part of routine child health care, would also be recorded by the PCS CAT. Practitioner questionnaires used 5-point Likert scales to assess beliefs and attitudes to prevention (11 questions) and self-efficacy (9 questions) across all age groups, including child health items about HKCs, developmental assessment and autism screening (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Questionnaires were tested for face validity. Training modules were also evaluated using brief questionnaires (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). Practice inventories, adapted from surveys used in US-based research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], recorded equipment and processes used by the practice during HKCs.<table-wrap id="Tab3"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Questionnaire and frequency distribution of responses</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th colspan="2">Questions asked of Clinicians (N&#x02009;=&#x02009;14)</th><th colspan="5">Before HKC- intervention</th><th colspan="5">After HKC-intervention</th></tr><tr><th colspan="2">For child preventive health:-</th><th rowspan="4">Strongly disagree</th><th rowspan="4">Disagree</th><th rowspan="4">No opinion</th><th rowspan="4">Agree</th><th rowspan="4">Strongly agree</th><th rowspan="4">Strongly disagree</th><th rowspan="4">Disagree</th><th rowspan="4">No opinion</th><th rowspan="4">Agree</th><th rowspan="4">Strongly agree</th></tr><tr><th colspan="2">Questions 1&#x02013;6&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02018;Beliefs&#x02019;</th></tr><tr><th colspan="2">Questions 7&#x02013;12&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02018;Self-efficacy&#x02019;</th></tr><tr><th colspan="2">(Adult preventive health items not included)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>I believe Early Intervention services are important in improving outcomes for children and families</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>3</td><td>11</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>3</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>I play a significant role in providing advice about vaccination</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>4</td><td>10</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>3</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Our practice plays a significant role in providing vaccination services</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>4</td><td>10</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>4</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>I think it is important to calculate a BMI for school aged children</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>9</td><td>4</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>9</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>I think it is important to calculate a BMI for children aged 2 to 5&#x000a0;years</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>3</td><td>6</td><td>4</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>4</td><td>6</td><td>

Our study confirmed the feasibility of delivering a multi-faceted intervention to increase HKCs in general practice. In the US multi-faceted preventive child health interventions have been assembled as combinations of single element interventions, often without a clear rational for their choice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Grimshaw et al. observed that an increase in dose of &#x0201c;component interventions&#x0201d; did not always lead to an increased response and proposed that multi-faceted interventions should be &#x0201c;built upon a careful assessment of barriers and a coherent theoretical base&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. In our study the elements that constituted the HKC-intervention were determined using a theoretically based behavioural change system. This pilot study demonstrated that the assembled package of intervention-components successfully incorporated solutions to the barriers identified in our primary research. Findings suggest that by upskilling the practice nurse and by taking a team approach, GPs were able to streamline processes, incorporate evidence-based preventive health care, standardise and improve quality and increase self-efficacy, delivering HKCs. The duration of the study was not long enough to determine if proportions of children completing HKCs in these practices ever attained the state-wide average of approximately 22&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. An aspect of the intervention that worked less well was the training module for clinicians. Despite a flexible approach, the research team noted that GP-attendance was frequently interrupted by clinical demands so that training was incomplete for approximately half of attendees. &#x02018;E-learning&#x02019; provides a flexible training method for clinicians [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] and has been successfully applied to paediatrics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], presenting a potential solution in future trials of the intervention.</p><p>A second problem related to difficulties collecting data. Software changes for practice C, in the year before the study, precluded collection of baseline data. In addition, practice A undertook &#x02018;database cleansing&#x02019; during the study, which produced an apparent large decline in total and age-eligible populations. General practices in Australia do not have fixed lists of patients, so that when practices decide to update patient databases they must determine which patients still &#x02018;actively attend&#x02019;. The commonly accepted definition of an &#x02018;active&#x02019; patient, &#x02018;attending three or more times in the past two years&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] differed from the less conservative definition employed in this study - &#x02018;any patient attending at least once in the last 12&#x000a0;months&#x02019;. This definition was decided upon as families access healthcare on behalf of their children from a variety of sources, and may not attend one practice on three occasions over 2&#x000a0;years. This may partially explain the extremely low proportions of children we recorded completing HKCs. In practice A, changes in the way patients were recorded over the course of the study may have artificially inflated the proportions of children documenting BMI and HKC improvements, although analysis at 3&#x000a0;months already showed improved HKC counts.</p><p>This study did not determine children&#x02019;s health outcomes, or the referrals made as a result of HKCs, an additional barrier that influenced practitioner motivation in our previous research. A record was made of how many times practitioners thought they had accessed resources to address the outcomes of HKCs, however. Both &#x02018;Parent tip sheets&#x02019; and &#x02018;Referral pathways&#x02019; were accessed, suggesting that a significant proportion of problems were managed in-house. Secondary screens were accessed by a total of five GPs but only one PN. This implies that within the HKC process there is a degree of role separation. GPs are more likely to assume responsibility for decision making when problems are identified within a HKC, a practice reinforced in our business model, PEDS interpretation and training.</p><p>This pilot project demonstrated significant changes in measures of HKC uptake and BMI. However, the before and after study design means that we cannot be certain that our intervention was the sole reason for the observed differences. Anecdotally, staff informed the project nurse that a software upgrade, installed midway through the project in all practices, automated and correctly categorised BMI for children undergoing same day readings of height and weight. This automated measure would have enabled PNs to interpret readings and could account for the improvements in proportions of children having BMI recorded outside of HKCs, during sick-child consultations. Discussions with HKC-Champions revealed that they were not calculating or interpreting BMI prior to the intervention, but did not elucidate whether other clinicians were doing so. Practitioners&#x02019; relative ambivalence towards measuring BMI for young children, which following intervention remained unchanged for some GPs, also suggests further education may be needed.</p><p>Results show that relatively large quality improvements were made across three different practice areas: office systems, equipment and examination techniques. The practice that started from the lowest base made the largest gains (practice C), but all practices improved across each domain.</p><sec id="Sec19"><title>Limitations</title><p>This intervention study employed a 3&#x000a0;month active intervention period with an additional 3&#x000a0;months of follow-up. It is not known if practices continued to deliver HKCs using this format following the study. It would be interesting to know, for example, if practices continued to acquire PEDS questionnaires or if systems can be maintained during staff turn-over. This study recorded equipment and processes but did not assess how effectively PNs conducted HKC-examinations. From the PEDS forms that were returned, it was estimated that a small proportion of children had concerns predictive for developmental delay. There was no way to determine if these problems were acted upon by the medical team or the parents. Future studies could be designed to address such issues.</p><p>This study was conducted in an area that serves large numbers of young families with pockets of high socioeconomic disadvantage and child developmental vulnerability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. It would, therefore, be important to test this intervention across diverse populations, allow longer follow-up periods and include control sites to avoid bias, before recommending full uptake.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Negative effects</title><p>It is possible that by concentrating on one area of preventive health care in general practice, another sector lost out. PNs&#x02019; responses noted diminished participation, or reduced confidence, in other aspects of preventive health. This appears to be a valid observation because it is unlikely that participants would recall their responses to pre-intervention questionnaires. In the US, different preventive services have been found to compete with each other for physicians&#x02019; time, as well as with acute care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] and caution has already been expressed about the opportunity costs of preventive services in Australian general practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Lessons learned and steps towards a cluster randomised controlled trial</title><p>A cluster randomised (phase III) trial would provide further evidence of the effect size of the intervention and would test generalisability to other populations. Recruitment methods (through PHOs) will be extended to practice-based research networks already affiliated with the research team. It would be important to test the intervention in another Australian jurisdiction because Victoria&#x02019;s CFN services operate differently to other states and may impact on GP service delivery, with a control arm to increase the strength of the study (usual care, including HKCs conducted without the practice based intervention).</p><p>This pilot study demonstrated that the intervention was acceptable and feasible, and confirmed the selection of outcome measures (an increase in the proportion of eligible children receiving HKCs and having BMI recorded, and significant quality improvements to practice processes and equipment). Data collection methods will extend over 12&#x000a0;months and the commonly accepted term for &#x0201c;active&#x0201d; patients will be adopted to maintain consistency within the data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Paper-based surveys of practitioners will test GP and PN self-reported knowledge and self-efficacy (adapted from another preventive health study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]) and health care utilisation following HKC will be captured (from government Medicare insurance services) to obtain important data regarding health outcomes. Arising from the pilot study was a recommendation to develop a web based module to streamline delivery of components of the training.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec22" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Healthy Kids Checks have the potential to identify disabilities, health and behavioural concerns at a significant juncture for children and their families. This pilot study provides the first indications that it is possible to increase preventive healthcare for young children by increasing numbers of HKCs. A cluster randomised controlled trial would provide more definitive evidence for a multifaceted intervention, particularly if study sites were located across different states, and included a mix of practices. It would need to incorporate an evaluation of other aspects of preventive health, given that possible negative effects were detected in this study and it could be improved by incorporating research into the clinical outcomes of HKCs.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>BMI</term><def><p>Body mass index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CFHN</term><def><p>Child and family health nurses</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GP</term><def><p>General practitioner</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HKC</term><def><p>Healthy Kids Check</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PCS CAT</term><def><p>Pen Computer System Clinical Audit Tool</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PEDS</term><def><p>Parents&#x02019; Evaluation of Developmental Status</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PHO</term><def><p>Primary healthcare organisation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PN</term><def><p>Practice nurse</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>US</term><def><p>United States</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>DM conceived and co-supervised the study with BB.
