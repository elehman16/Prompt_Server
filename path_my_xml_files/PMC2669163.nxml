All vaccinations were administered intramuscularly on a 0-, 1-, 2-month schedule. All volunteers experienced transient injection site erythema, swelling and pain. Two weeks post-third vaccination, anti-AMA-1 Geometric Mean Antibody Concentrations (GMCs) with 95&#x00025; Confidence Intervals (CIs) were high: low dose AMA-1/AS01B 196 &#x000b5;g/mL (103&#x02013;371 &#x000b5;g/mL), full dose AMA-1/AS01B 279 &#x000b5;g/mL (210&#x02013;369 &#x000b5;g/mL) and full dose AMA-1/AS02A 216 &#x000b5;g/mL (169&#x02013;276 &#x000b5;g/mL) with no significant difference among the 3 groups. The three vaccine formulations elicited equivalent functional antibody responses, as measured by growth inhibition assay (GIA), against homologous but not against heterologous (FVO) parasites as well as demonstrable interferon-gamma (IFN-&#x003b3;) responses. To assess efficacy, volunteers were challenged with <italic>P. falciparum</italic>-infected mosquitoes, and all became parasitemic, with no significant difference in the prepatent period by either light microscopy or quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). However, a small but significant reduction of parasitemia in the AMA-1/AS02A group was seen with a statistical model employing qPCR measurements.</p></sec><sec><title>Significance</title><p>All three vaccine formulations were found to be safe and highly immunogenic. These immune responses did not translate into significant vaccine efficacy in malaria-na&#x000ef;ve adults employing a primary sporozoite challenge model, but encouragingly, estimation of parasite growth rates from qPCR data may suggest a partial biological effect of the vaccine. Further evaluation of the immunogenicity and efficacy of the AMA-1/AS02A formulation is ongoing in a malaria-experienced pediatric population in Mali.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>

The populations most affected by malaria are children less than five years of age and primigravidae <xref rid="pone.0005254-Duffy1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> living in malaria endemic areas, and malaria-na&#x000ef;ve individuals traveling to endemic areas. An effective malaria vaccine, in addition to other available preventive measures, is critical to mitigating the effects of this disease in these vulnerable populations.</p><p>A malaria vaccine able to prevent infections as well as control blood stage growth will likely require pre-erythrocytic and erythrocytic stage components that are able to elicit anti-parasitic humoral and cell-mediated immune responses <xref rid="pone.0005254-Moorthy1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Apical membrane antigen-1 (AMA-1) is an 83-kDa precursor protein localized in the micronemes at the apical end of the merozoite, the erythrocyte-invading stage of the parasite <xref rid="pone.0005254-Healer1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. This precursor is proteolytically cleaved to form a 66-kDa protein which then translocates from micronemes to the surface of the merozoite <xref rid="pone.0005254-Howell1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> and as such is thought to mediate merozoite reorientation to the erythrocyte <xref rid="pone.0005254-Mitchell1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. AMA-1 has also been found on the surface of sporozoites and on hepatic merozoites <xref rid="pone.0005254-Silvie1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>; thus, this &#x0201c;blood stage&#x0201d; antigen may be a target for protective immune responses against both the invading sporozoite and liver stage of the parasite.</p><p>Several studies have shown that anti-AMA-1 antibodies may play a role in protective immunity in adults living in malaria-endemic areas, and while these studies did demonstrate cross-reactivity to heterologous alleles, the degree to which these antibodies reacted varied <xref rid="pone.0005254-Hodder1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0005254-Polley1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Other studies with T-cells from naturally-exposed subjects have reported proliferation in response to peptides derived from AMA-1 <xref rid="pone.0005254-Udhayakumar1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0005254-Lal1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Preclinical studies in mice have demonstrated protection (survival with reduced parasitemia) against the rodent parasite <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> by active immunization with homologous recombinant AMA-1 protein formulated with potent adjuvants, as well as by passive transfer of immunoglobulin from vaccinated rabbits <xref rid="pone.0005254-Anders1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Additionally, active immunization of rhesus monkeys with <italic>P. knowlesi</italic> AMA-1 adjuvanted in saponin resulted in some animals demonstrating a delayed prepatent period when challenged with <italic>P. knowlesi</italic> schizonts <xref rid="pone.0005254-Deans1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. In <italic>Aotus</italic> monkeys immunized with <italic>P. falciparum</italic> recombinant AMA-1 in complete Freund's adjuvant, significant delays in parasitemia after homologous blood stage challenge were seen as compared to monkeys immunized with a similarly adjuvanted control malarial antigen <xref rid="pone.0005254-Stowers1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. T-cell responses to AMA-1 were detected in na&#x000ef;ve adult volunteers immunized with irradiated <italic>P. falciparum</italic> sporozoites <xref rid="pone.0005254-Krzych1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, suggesting that AMA-1 may be able to elicit cellular host immune responses to act against pre-erythrocytic stages of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infection.</p><p>Two Phase 1 dose-escalation adult vaccine trials have been completed, one at WRAIR and one in Mali, evaluating FMP2.1, an AMA-1 recombinant protein vaccine based on the 3D7 allele, formulated with the GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) proprietary Adjuvant System, AS02A <xref rid="pone.0005254-Polhemus1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0005254-Thera1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Both studies demonstrated the vaccine to be well-tolerated and immunogenic. Recent preclinical data suggests another GSK Adjuvant System, AS01B, may be more potent than AS02A, which may translate into improved efficacy of vaccines adjuvanted with this System <xref rid="pone.0005254-Mettens1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0005254-Stewart1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. The current Phase 1/2a study was the first to compare the safety and immunogenicity of an AMA-1-based vaccine in both AS01B and AS02A Adjuvant Systems, and the first to assess the efficacy of such a vaccine in malaria-na&#x000ef;ve adults using a homologous primary sporozoite challenge model <xref rid="pone.0005254-Chulay1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, thus contributing key information to the development process of a multi-component malaria vaccine <xref rid="pone.0005254-Heppner1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Further adding to such a process, the ongoing Phase 1b and 2b FMP2.1/AS02A pediatric vaccine studies in Mali, while with a single adjuvant and single AMA-1allele, will provide valuable information regarding the mechanisms and cross-reactivity of the immune response to <italic>P. falciparum</italic> in an endemic pediatric population.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Participants</title><p>The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0005254.s002">Checklist S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0005254.s001">Protocol S1</xref>. This study was conducted from September 2006 through April 2007 at the Clinical Trials Center of the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR), Silver Spring, Maryland. Healthy malaria-na&#x000ef;ve adults aged 18&#x02013;50 years were recruited by non-coercive means in the metropolitan Washington DC area using inclusion and exclusion criteria described previously <xref rid="pone.0005254-Polhemus1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Ethics</title><p>The protocol was reviewed and approved by the WRAIR Human Use Review Committee, the United States Army Medical Research and Materiel Command Human Subjects Review Board, as well as the Western Institutional Review Board, representing the study partner PATH Malaria Vaccine Initiative (MVI). Investigators described the protocol to potential volunteers face to face, and informed consent was obtained by the use of a written IRB-approved consent form, signed and dated by the volunteer and the investigator who conducted the informed consent discussion. This study was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki as well as principles of Good Clinical Practices under the United States Food and Drug Administration Investigational New Drug (IND) application BB-13089.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Interventions</title><p>The WRAIR recombinant AMA-1 vaccine antigen termed FMP2.1 was produced in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, Tuner&#x02122; strain (Novagen, Madison, WI) under current good manufacturing practices (cGMP) at the WRAIR Pilot Bioproduction Facility and bottled as a highly purified and lyophilized recombinant protein. The protein consists of 449 amino acids representing the majority of the ectodomain (amino acids 83&#x02013;531) of the 3D7 variant of AMA-1 with N- and C-terminal His-tags. The method of AMA-1 recombinant protein production and purification has been described previously <xref rid="pone.0005254-Dutta1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, and FMP2.1 differs from the method described only in the <italic>E. coli</italic> strain used for production. FMP2.1 stability assays and potency tests in mice were carried out according to International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines and confirmed the vaccine antigen was stable and potent from date of manufacture through preparation of this manuscript. The two proprietary Adjuvant Systems used in this study were produced by GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals (GSK), Rixensart, Belgium and have been described and evaluated in multiple vaccine products <xref rid="pone.0005254-Garon1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. AS01B is a liposome-based Adjuvant System such that the 0.5 mL final dose contains 50 &#x000b5;g 3-deacylated-monophosphoryl lipid A (3-D-MPL), a TLR4 ligand derived from <italic>Salmonella minnesota</italic> and 50 &#x000b5;g of QS21, a highly purified saponin extract from the bark of the South American tree <italic>Quillaja saponaria</italic>, while AS02A is based on an oil-in-water emulsion with the same amounts of 3-D-MPL and QS-21. The lyophilized FMP2.1 antigen, Lot #1046, was packaged in single dose vials of approximately 60 &#x000b5;g. For full dose vaccine administration, the lyophilized contents were mixed with the prepackaged Adjuvant Systems AS02A or AS01B, resulting in an estimated final dose of 50 &#x000b5;g AMA-1 in 0.5 mL of Adjuvant System. The 10 &#x000b5;g dose was prepared by mixing five vials of AS01B with one vial of FMP2.1 antigen and withdrawing 0.5 mL for sterile injection. The adjuvant and antigen were stored at 2&#x02013;8&#x000b0; Celsius. On vaccination days, the vials were placed on wet ice no longer than 4 hours, and the vaccine formulated immediately prior to injection. The vaccine constituents have undergone extensive stability testing and have been show to be stable for up to 24 hours at room temperature. For clarity, the FMP2.1 vaccine antigen herein will be referred to as AMA-1 in this publication.</p><p>This was a first-in-human study of AMA-1/AS01B; therefore, a 3-week staggered dosing schedule of this formulation was incorporated into the study design. In the open-label phase of the study, 5 volunteers received 10 &#x000b5;g AMA-1 in 0.5 mL of AS01B (referred to as the low dose AMA-1/AS01B group) administered intramuscularly in the non-dominant arm. A Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) reviewed the safety data accumulated during the four days following the first immunization and recommended commencing immunizations with the higher dose of AMA-1. Thirty volunteers were assigned in a double-blind, randomized fashion to receive either 50 &#x000b5;g of AMA-1 in 0.5 mL of AS01B (referred to as the full dose AMA-1/AS01B group) or 50 &#x000b5;g AMA-1 in 0.5 mL of AS02A (referred to as the full dose AMA-1/AS02A group). A total of three immunizations were given at one-month intervals, all administered intramuscularly in alternate arms. The blinding code was broken after completion of the efficacy phase.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Objectives</title><p>The primary objective of this trial was to assess the safety and reactogenicity of candidate malaria vaccines FMP2.1/AS01B and FMP2.1/AS02A when administered intramuscularly on a 0-, 1-, and 2-month (0-, 28- and 56-days) immunization schedule to malaria-na&#x000ef;ve adult volunteers living in the United States. Secondary objectives were to assess the magnitude of humoral immune responses induced by the candidate malaria vaccines, the functionality of these anti-FMP2.1 antibodies to inhibit the growth of asexual parasites and to assess the efficacy of the vaccine candidates against sporozoite challenge with <italic>P. falciparum</italic>.

Solicited symptoms included local adverse events (pain, erythema and swelling) and systemic adverse events (fever, nausea, headache, malaise, myalgia, fatigue, and arthralgia). All symptoms were graded on a scale to indicate degree of functional impairment (Grade 0: no impairment, Grade 1: easily tolerated, Grade 2: interferes with daily activity, Grade 3: prevents daily activity) except for injection site erythema and swelling, which were graded as a physical measurement taken at the greatest diameter of involvement (Grade 0: 0 mm, Grade 1: &#x02265;1&#x02013;&#x02264;20 mm, Grade 2: &#x0003e;20&#x02013;&#x02264;50 mm, Grade 3: &#x02265; 50 mm), and fever, which was graded on the following scale of oral temperature: Grade 0: &#x02264;37.5&#x000b0;C, Grade 1: &#x0003e;37.5&#x02013;&#x02264;38&#x000b0;C, Grade 2: &#x0003e;38&#x02013;&#x02264;39&#x000b0;C, Grade 3: &#x0003e;39&#x000b0;C.

Immunogenicity endpoints included anti-AMA-1 antibody titers as determined by Enzyme-Linked Immunoassay (ELISA), as well as functionality of anti-AMA-1 antibodies versus blood stage <italic>P. falciparum</italic> parasites as measured by standardized homologous (3D7 allele) and heterologous (FVO allele) growth inhibition assay (GIA).</p><sec id="s2e1"><title>Enzyme-Linked Immunoassay</title><p>Serum for anti-AMA-1 antibody determination was collected from each volunteer at Day 0, 14, 28, 42, 56, 70, 93, 114 and 156 and frozen at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C or below until tested as described previously <xref rid="pone.0005254-Polhemus1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. The AMA-1 plate antigen was prepared from the same bulk FMP2.1 vaccine antigen lot as the test article. ELISA titers, initially defined as the serum dilution yielding an optical density of 1.0 in a standardized assay, were converted to &#x000b5;g/ml concentration values. As was done for a previous ELISA <xref rid="pone.0005254-Yoon1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, commercially obtainable human IgG was utilized to develop an IgG-quantitation sandwich ELISA. Using this ELISA, the concentration of anti-AMA-1 antibody was determined for a single control serum sample.

Parasitized RBC (pRBC) cultures of both the 3D7 allele (homologous) and FVO allele (heterologous) at the early schizont stage were set up with pre-immune and immune sera at various concentrations at a 0.3&#x00025; parasitemia and 1&#x00025; hematocrit. Assay plates were sealed in bags containing 2.5&#x00025; CO<sub>2</sub>, 2.5&#x00025; O<sub>2</sub>, 90&#x00025; N<sub>2</sub> and incubated for 40 or 48 hours (cycle time of 3D7 and FVO parasites respectively). Cultures were then harvested by transferring 50 &#x000b5;l/well into phosphate buffered saline (PBS)-containing C-bottom plates and washed by spinning plates for 10 minutes at 10,000 g. Once completed, plates were frozen at &#x02212;30&#x000b0;C until analysis. To measure the amount of pLDH activity, a substrate buffer containing 0.1 M Tris HCl, 50 mM Sodium-L-lactate, 0.255 Triton-X, 10 mg NBT, 10 &#x000b5;g/ml 3-Acetylpyridine, 10 U/ml diaphorase from <italic>Clostridium klyiveri</italic> (all reagents were obtained from Sigma, St. Louis, MO) was added to the plates. Colorimetric measurement at 650 nm was done after 30 minutes of reaction time using the SpectraMax Plus 384 spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Pre-vaccination samples were run in parallel with the post vaccination samples, and calculation of growth inhibition was determined by using the formula: &#x00025; inhibition&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;[1&#x02212;[(OD immune serum&#x02212;OD RBC)/(OD pre-immune serum&#x02212;OD RBC)]]&#x000d7;100. Volunteers demonstrating &#x02265;20&#x00025; activity were considered responders, a reproducible cut-off value calculated based on mean inhibition of pre-immune sera&#x0002b;2 standard deviations. This cut-off value is the threshold for serum antibody-specific inhibition over the determined assay background levels (which vary between individuals) and can be caused by nutritional differences and handling artifacts of the sera <xref rid="pone.0005254-BergmannLeitner1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>.</p><p>GIAs were also performed in parallel at the GIA Reference Center at the National Institutes of Health by Dr. Carole Long.

Approximately two weeks after completion of all three immunizations (Day 70), volunteers from the high dose vaccine groups underwent homologous sporozoite challenge. Six healthy, malaria-naive adults aged 18 to 50 years were also enrolled as non-immunized infectivity controls.

Volunteers were monitored closely with daily visits and blood smears starting five days after challenge. Two hundred high-powered fields were examined on each blood film to detect patent parasitemia. This number was increased to 1000 fields if the volunteer became symptomatic, and in the case of persistent symptoms, additional fresh blood smears were prepared and read at 6- to 8-hour intervals. Once a volunteer was found to be parasitemic, a directly observed oral regimen of chloroquine was administered, and three consecutive negative daily blood smears were taken to ensure parasite clearance. Thereafter, weekly blood smears were prepared over the next 4-week period.

An erythematous, papular, slightly pruritic rash appeared intermittently over both deltoid areas, (corresponding to the two previous injection sites) during a 2-week period. There were no other associated local or systemic symptoms, and no therapeutic medications were required or administered. Hematologic and biochemical safety laboratory tests performed at the time were normal, and a biopsy of the site by a dermatologist revealed non-specific, chronic inflammation.

There was no difference in frequency or pattern of local adverse events among the three vaccine groups; although it did appear that the volunteers administered the full dose AMA-1/AS01B experienced slightly more systemic adverse events. For all three groups, there was an increase in frequency and intensity of adverse events with successive immunizations, yet the adverse events did not contribute to volunteer attrition as evidenced by completion of 103 of 105 scheduled vaccinations in 35 subjects. The frequency of adverse events described here is greater (for all three groups) than that described in recent trial of AMA-1/AS02A <xref rid="pone.0005254-Polhemus1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, and RTS,S in AS02A <xref rid="pone.0005254-Kester1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0005254-Kester2" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0005254-Kester3" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> or AS01B (personal communication, K. Kester) in malaria-na&#x000ef;ve adults at WRAIR; however, Grade 3 swelling, accompanied by little or no pain, similar to that seen in this study, was consistently reported in Malian adults <xref rid="pone.0005254-Thera1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> and children vaccinated with AMA-1/AS02A (personal communication C. Plowe). The reason for the increased local and systemic reactogenicity in this study is unclear but may be due to an intrinsic immunologic property of adjuvanted recombinant AMA-1. It is likely not due to endotoxin or residual bacterial host contaminant given the strict cGMP standards of AMA-1 and Adjuvant Systems manufacture. A recent Phase 1a study of <italic>Pichia pastoris</italic>-expressed AMA1 formulated in AS02A also had elevated frequency of mild to moderate pain, erythema and systemic adverse events reported <xref rid="pone.0005254-Roestenberg1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>.</p><p>The unexpected adverse event seen in one volunteer was considered related to the vaccine given its consistent localization over both injection sites. Based on the timing of rash onset, this reaction could have represented either a Type IV hypersensitivity reaction or possibly antigen-antibody complex formation without accompanying systemic symptoms of serum sickness <xref rid="pone.0005254-Meth1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. When evaluated, the anti-AMA-1 antibody levels and IFN-&#x003b3; ELISPOT responses in this individual were not markedly elevated or depressed as compared to other volunteers in the study.</p><p>Immunization with all three vaccine formulations produced very high antibody titers in the majority of volunteers, with no statistically significant difference in GMCs among vaccine groups. Our findings are consistent with preclinical data that malarial recombinant protein antigens elicit equivalent (or greater) antibodies when formulated with AS01B versus AS02A <xref rid="pone.0005254-Mettens1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0005254-Stewart1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> and Phase 1a vaccine studies in which antibody titers did not differ by the dose of AMA-1 formulated in AS02A <xref rid="pone.0005254-Polhemus1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0005254-Roestenberg1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. The third immunization did provide a boost to falling antibody titers, although the peak level measured was not significantly higher than the peak achieved post-second immunization, a finding also seen in the recent Phase 1a study of AMA-1/AS02A at WRAIR <xref rid="pone.0005254-Polhemus1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. This finding raises the question of whether an effective immunization regimen can be limited to two immunizations, or alternatively, how the time interval between second and third immunization could be optimized.</p><p>The growth inhibition of homologous 3D7 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> parasites was the highest yet reported for any immune serum or purified antibody GIA assessed in Phase 1a trials of blood stage malaria vaccines <xref rid="pone.0005254-Polhemus1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0005254-Roestenberg1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0005254-Druilhe1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0005254-Ockenhouse1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Although the vaccine did induce a humoral response demonstrating <italic>in vitro</italic> GIA activity, the absence of protective efficacy suggests that GIA may not serve as an accurate correlate of protection. In addition, the inhibitory responses induced by this allele of AMA-1 were highly strain-specific, yielding negligible inhibitory activity against heterologous FVO parasites similar to findings observed in other studies, both preclinical <xref rid="pone.0005254-Hodder1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> and clinical <xref rid="pone.0005254-Polhemus1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0005254-Malkin1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>.</p><p>All three vaccine candidates induced cellular responses as measured by IFN-&#x003b3; production. Interestingly, the volunteers receiving the 10 &#x000b5;g dose of AMA-1/AS01B had significantly higher responses to recombinant protein antigen than the volunteers receiving the 50 &#x000b5;g dose of AMA-1 in either Adjuvant System. This phenomenon of a greater T-cell response with a reduced antigen dose (as compared to full dose) but constant amount of adjuvant was also seen in a recent trial of Liver Stage Antigen-1 (LSA-1) (<italic>manuscript in press</italic>, J. Cummings) as well as in the Phase 1b study of AMA-1/AS02A in Malian adults (<italic>manuscript in revision,</italic> K. Lyke). It has been reported in Phase 2a challenge trials of RTS,S/AS02A <xref rid="pone.0005254-Kester2" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0005254-Sun1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, RTS,S/AS01B (personal communication, K.

However, this association has yet to be demonstrated in a malaria-experienced population. In addition there may be a cellular versus humoral tradeoff: in a recent trial in Malian adults, there was a trend towards greater antibody responses in subjects who received 50 &#x000b5;g AMA-1 formulated in AS02A as compared to 25 &#x000b5;g AMA-1/AS02A <xref rid="pone.0005254-Thera1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.</p><p>This was the first clinical trial of any AMA-1-based vaccine using the rigorous sporozoite challenge model in order to assess efficacy. The challenge model traditionally used to assess efficacy of pre-erythrocytic vaccine candidates is robust: at WRAIR, a 100&#x00025; infection rate has been obtained in the last 100 infectivity control volunteers fed upon by 5 <italic>Anopheline</italic> mosquitoes which were each highly infected with <italic>P. falciparum</italic> sporozoites. In addition, the clinical protocol under which the subjects are challenged requires malaria treatment without delay upon diagnosis of parasitemia by light microscopy, thus precluding subsequent direct observation of any parasitemia-limiting effects or abrogation of clinical manifestations that may be induced by a blood stage vaccine. Under these stringent conditions, there was no prevention of parasitemia or delay in the onset of parasitemia by light microscopy. A sensitive, quantitative PCR analysis also did not reveal any statistically significant delay in the time to parasitemia in vaccinees versus infectivity controls.</p><p>We conducted exploratory post hoc analyses to detect more subtle signs of a vaccine effect that we hypothesized could be reflected by a reduction or impairment of released hepatic merozoites and/or a reduction in parasite growth rate in the blood stage. Analysis showed that the first peak (representing the first wave of RBC invasion and/or the number of infected hepatocytes per volunteer) in the AMA-1/AS02A vaccinees was about 7 times lower compared to the control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005254-g006">figure 6</xref>). AMA-1/AS01B showed a mean reduction of about 50&#x00025;, but this was not significant. Unfortunately, due to the limited number of qPCR data points restricted by the once daily measurements, the power of the statistical model is reduced. The inhibitory antibodies induced by AMA-1/AS02A may act at 2 different levels: reduction of sporozoite invasion into the hepatocytes as observed <italic>in-vitro</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0005254-Silvie1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> and/or a reduction of the first wave of liver merozoites invading new red blood cells. The estimated mean reduction of 17&#x00025; in growth rate is too small to effectively reduce parasite multiplication. It has been estimated that <italic>in vivo</italic> growth inhibition needs to be at least 70&#x00025; to realize a decrease in parasitemia <xref rid="pone.0005254-Hermsen2" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>.</p><p>With the current challenge model and need to treat individuals upon first detection of parasitemia, it is not possible to ascertain the potential benefit or duration of this observed reduction in parasite burden. Additional post hoc analyses comparing vaccinees with prepatent periods revealed no correlation with antibody titer by ELISA, growth inhibition by GIA activity, or a difference in their IFN-&#x003b3; production by ELISPOT.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Generalizability</title><p>While the three vaccine candidates induced high concentrations of anti-AMA-1 antibodies which exhibited functional activity, albeit only against a homologous allele, it remains unclear if and at what level a monovalent 3D7-based AMA-1 vaccine will stimulate cross-reactive antibodies in malaria-experienced populations. The mean percent inhibition by GIA seen in Malian adults vaccinated with AMA-1/AS02A was greater against both 3D7 and FVO parasites than control vaccinees <xref rid="pone.0005254-Thera1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Nonetheless, a successful AMA-1-based vaccination strategy may need to include more than one AMA-1 allele to be effective in populations continually exposed to malaria infection <xref rid="pone.0005254-Dutta2" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. Studies of AMA-1 diversity over three years in Bandiagara, Mali are finding extreme diversity, with no single haplotype having a prevalence of more than 4&#x00025;. The 3D7 allele represents one of the most common AMA-1 haplotypes, and no parasites carry the full FVO haplotype in this setting (S. Takala, personal communication). Testing of AMA-1/AS02A in a pediatric Phase 2b, placebo-controlled trial in Bandiagara, Mali, an epidemiologic setting of substantial AMA-1 allelic diversity, is currently ongoing (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov">www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link> NCT00460525). In addition to the primary efficacy endpoint of clinical malaria, planned ancillary analyses will explore both parasitologic and allele-specific effects, thus evaluating the potential for a 3D7 AMA-1-based vaccine to induce a cross-protective immune response in a malaria-experienced population, as well as the possibility that ongoing natural exposure will boost heterologous allele-specific responses.</p><p>Our AMA-1-based malaria vaccine development strategy requires that two sequential milestones be accomplished prior to incorporation of one or more AMA-1 antigens into a multi-stage, multi-component vaccine <xref rid="pone.0005254-Heppner1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. First, an AMA-1 vaccine must confer significant clinical benefit in either a Phase 2a malaria challenge or in an endemic population. Second, the AMA-1 vaccine must be sufficiently active against diverse AMA-1 alleles such that the risk of allelic escape is very low. In anticipation of the potential requirement for inclusion of additional AMA-1 alleles in a multi-antigen vaccine, we have produced GMP AMA-1 representing the FVO allele and anticipate potentially combining the two FVO and 3D7 antigens in a vaccine. Allelic exchange experiments have recently defined specific clusters of polymorphic amino acid residues involved in antigenic escape in vitro <xref rid="pone.0005254-Dutta2" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, and studies of the within-host dynamics of blood stage antigens offer another strategy for identifying specific residues associated with allele-specific clinical immunity <xref rid="pone.0005254-Takala1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. Current research efforts at WRAIR seek to identify a consensus AMA-1 molecule/chimera that would elicit a broad immunity active against multiple <italic>P. falciparum</italic> AMA-1 phenotypes <xref rid="pone.0005254-Dutta2" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Overall Evidence</title><p>Since AMA-1 is expressed on pre-erythrocytic and erythrocytic stages of the parasite, it is a promising vaccine antigen to induce malarial protection by targeting both the humoral and cell-mediated arms of the immune system. Both types of immune responses have been demonstrated in this study, in three other vaccine trials with AMA-1/AS02A <xref rid="pone.0005254-Polhemus1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0005254-Thera1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0005254-Roestenberg1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref> as well as an AMA-1 protein antigen formulated in alum <xref rid="pone.0005254-Malkin1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref> and Montanide ISA 720 <xref rid="pone.0005254-Roestenberg1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. This study was the first to test the efficacy of AMA-1; subjected to a stringent test of efficacy that required treatment at time of proven patency, no vaccine formulation prevented infection or delayed patency, but one formulation, AMA-1/AS02A, did suggest a significant reduction in parasite burden as determined by PCR analysis. Current field trials now underway in Bandiagara, Mali should provide additional data to potentially determine if the immunogenicity results seen will translate into significant clinical effect in a population living in a malaria endemic area with a diverse parasite population.</p><p>That AMA-1 continues to be thought of as a promising vaccine antigen is reflected in its recent testing in an adenovector-based platform (personal communication Thomas Richie) and in virosomes <xref rid="pone.0005254-Genton1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. With the new goal of malaria eradication set forth by World Health Organization and the upcoming large scale pediatric Phase 3 study of RTS,S in subSaharan Africa, an effective second generation malaria vaccine is critical. Based on the present trial's evidence of strong immunogenicity of AMA-1/AS01B and AS02A and the encouraging suggestion of biological effect, we believe AMA-1 remains a viable vaccine candidate. Future studies will help elucidate whether modification or addition of allelic forms and/or choice of delivery platform may sufficiently enhance its immunogenicity and efficacy to protect the most vulnerable populations.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0005254.s001"><label>Protocol S1</label><caption><p>Trial protocol.
