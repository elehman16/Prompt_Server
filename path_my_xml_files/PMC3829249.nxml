The proposal of the research was reviewed by Otolaryngology&#x02013;Head and Neck surgery Research Center and approved by Ethics Committee of Research Office of Guilan University of Medical Sciences.</p><p>Participants were recruited from all referred patients with the complaint of tinnitus after explaining research processes for them and obtaining written informed consent. After taking a thorough medical history and performing a complete ear-nose-throat physical examination, a total of 57 patients with persistent non-pulsatile tinnitus lasting for at least 6 months and without any positive history of thyroid disorders, rheumatologic disorders, acute and chronic otitis media, and exposure to excessive or loud noise were enrolled in the study. All of the patients who had unilateral tinnitus and/or sensory-neural hearing loss and/or signs or symptoms of central nervous system involvement underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).</p><p>Audiometric evaluation and laboratory tests (liver function tests, fasting blood sugar, complete blood count, blood urea nitrogen, blood creatinine, and serum sodium level) were performed before enrollment and were repeated 3 weeks after initiating the medications. The patients were notified to refer to the hospital as soon as possible if encountering fever, sore throat, skin rash, unusual bleeding or bruisability during trial course.</p><p>Patients were allocated to three groups using random blocks and received carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, and placebo in each group using a double blind manner. Considering the confidence coefficient of 95%, study power of 80% and calculation of 10% drop out, the sample size was estimated to be 19 subjects in each study group.</p><p>The patients in the first group were prescribed a course of carbamazepine 300 mg/day (before sleep time) for one week, followed by 600 mg/day till 12<sup>th</sup> week. Treatment in the second group was initiated with 450 mg/day oxcarbazepine for one week, followed by 900 mg/day till 12<sup>th</sup> week. The placebos were individually enclosed in the same shape tablets and were given in the same manner. In all three groups at the end of the treatment, drugs were tapered during a 2 weeks course.</p><p>Before initiating the treatments, the severity of tinnitus and its impacts on quality of life were evaluated by visual analogue scale (VAS) and tinnitus severity index (TSI) and these were repeated at the end of the 8<sup>th</sup> and 12<sup>th</sup> weeks of study. By VAS, the patients determined the grade of their subjective perception from severity of tinnitus on a scaled bar in which number one introduced none or minimally severe tinnitus and number 10 maximum imaginable severity of tinnitus.</p><p>TSI was calculated according to a 12-item questionnaire about tinnitus impacts on patients&#x02019; concentration, sleep and quality of life.

Two patients abandoned the treatment because of skin allergic reactions, one to carbamazepine and another one to oxcarbazepine, and 4 patients refused completion of treatment course (one from the carbamazepine group, one from the oxcarbazepine group and two patients from the placebo group). No any other side effect was seen during trial course, and no significant change in serum sodium level and liver function profile was seen in the initial 3-week course of treatment with carbamazepine or oxcarbazepine.</p><p>From 51 participants who completed the trial course (28 men and 23 women) with mean age of51.9 &#x000b1; 10.2 years, 18 subjects were in the carbamazepine group, 17 in the oxcarbazepine group and 16 in the placebo group. Nineteen cases had bilateral tinnitus, while 17 and 15 cases had unilateral tinnitus with more severity in right and left sides, respectively. Our patients mostly suffered from whistling, chirp or continuous roaring tinnitus subtypes and none of the patients suffered from a tinnitus with a staccato quality similar to a type-writer tapping, popcorn popping or Morse code signal. The study groups were adjusted for age, sex, and tinnitus quality and severity during analysis. None of the cases had conductive hearing loss, and the mean (&#x000b1;SD) hearing level (according to pure tone audiometric thresholds in 250 Hertz to 8 kilohertz) was calculated as 24.9 &#x000b1; 11.7 dB.</p><p>At the end of the treatment and based on VAS, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine and placebo decreased tinnitus severity in 62.5%, 61.5%, and 38.5% of the cases, respectively.

We also used TSI in addition to VAS that was used in other studies such as Shiley et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0008">8</xref></sup> and Sanchez et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0015">15</xref></sup> studies, to consider the effects of interventions on the patients&#x02019; quality of life.</p><p>In our study, among those participants who treated with carbamazepine, 56.2% obtained more than 20% relief of tinnitus severity according to VAS, but 46.2% of participants who received oxcarbazepine and only 38.5% of those in placebo group obtained more than 20% relief of tinnitus severity according to the same score without statistically significant association. Considering more than 3 units reduction in TSI scale, carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine significantly reduced tinnitus severity in 61.1% and 58.8% of participants, respectively. Moreover, placebo significantly suppressed tinnitus severity in 50% of participants. Although carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine did not have any statistical superiority over each other in suppressing tinnitus severity, it seems that carbamazepine is clinically more effective than oxcarbazine and especially than placebo.</p><p>In Sanchez et al. study,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0015">15</xref></sup> tinnitus intensity was suppressed in 50% of participants with carbamazepine, but the amount of reduction was not mentioned. In Mardini's study, participants suffering from typewriter tinnitus had an outstanding response to carbamazepine therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0016">16</xref></sup> In Kong et al. trial, efficacy of carbamazepine combined with flunarizine for treating tinnitus did not have any superiority to the control group who were managed by a combination of flunarizine and vitamin B6.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0017">17</xref></sup> In Witsell et al. trial, the difference of tinnitus loudness improvement rate between the experimental group (managed by gabapentin) and control group was not statistically significant.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0018">18</xref></sup> In another study, 1800&#x02013;2400 mg/day of gabapentin showed a paramount efficacy in controlling tinnitus after acoustic trauma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0019">19</xref></sup>
</p><p>In our study, the reduction of tinnitus severity in carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine groups during the first eight weeks of treatment was significantly more prominent compared with the period of time between the 8<sup>th</sup> and 12<sup>th</sup> week. This may be due to psychodynamics of tinnitus per se, or may be due to pharmacodynamic characteristics of the drugs. On the other hand, in order to achieve better results, perhaps we should increase the drug dosage after 8 weeks of treatment.</p><p>Tinnitus is a vague topic in otology and neurotology with many unsolved questions around it. One of these ambiguities is a large placebo effect that we observed in the treatment course of these patients, a phenomenon that is observed in many other clinical situations, especially in analgesia. Obviously, placebo factors have neurobiological underpinnings and actual effects on the brain and body, and the demonstration of the involvement of placebo mechanisms in clinical trials and routine clinical practice have interesting considerations for clinicians and researchers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0020">20</xref></sup>
</p><p>For achieving better results, we suggest doing the study with more participants in each group and also with incremental dosages of carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine after 8 weeks. Dividing tinnitus according to accompanying disorders (psychological disorders, presbycusis, acoustic trauma, underlying medical diseases) also can help in finding better strategies in tinnitus treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="S0005"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine are not significantly more effective than placebo in decreasing tinnitus severity.
