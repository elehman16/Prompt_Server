It is a fully human monoclonal antireceptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand antibody, which inhibits the activity of osteoclasts, resulting in an antiresorptive effect with a significant increase in bone mineral density. The FREEDOM (Fracture Reduction Evaluation of Denosumab in Osteoporosis every 6 Months) trial, comparing denosumab with no treatment in 7868 women with postmenopausal osteoporosis, showed an important reduction of fracture risk at hip, vertebral, and nonvertebral sites in the treated group, while no statistically significant difference in the incidence of adverse events was detected between denosumab and placebo groups. The specific action of denosumab directed against a key regulator of osteoclasts makes it a valuable tool in preventing the occurrence of skeletal events caused by bone destruction in patients with advanced malignancies. The drug was approved for postmenopausal osteoporosis in women at increased risk of fracture and for the treatment of bone loss associated with androgen deprivation therapy in men with prostate cancer.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>osteoporosis</kwd><kwd>denosumab</kwd><kwd>targeted therapy</kwd><kwd>BMD</kwd><kwd>antibody</kwd><kwd>RANK-L</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>The aim of osteoporosis treatment is to reduce as far as possible the risk of bone fracture. Osteoporosis, the most common metabolic bone disease, is characterized by low bone mineral density (BMD) and microarchitectural deterioration of bone tissue with a consequent increase in the susceptibility to fragility fractures. It has become an increasingly important public health problem due to the rapidly aging population. Currently, every third postmenopausal woman and every fifth man older than 50 years suffer from osteoporosis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-tcrm-8-253">1</xref></p><p>It should be important to identify the possible pathological mechanisms underlying bone fragility, especially in populations at risk such as the elderly and postmenopausal women. Bone strength, ie, resistance to fracture, depends not only on bone mass, but also on its spatial distribution and the intrinsic properties of the materials that constitute the bone.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-tcrm-8-253">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-tcrm-8-253">2</xref></p><p>Data from the National Osteoporosis Risk Assessment study revealed that only 6.4% of postmenopausal women with an osteoporotic fracture had T-score (the standard deviation difference between the patient&#x02019;s BMD and the mean BMD of a female young adult reference population) of less than &#x02212;2.5 (World Health Organization definition of osteoporosis) in the year preceding the fracture.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-tcrm-8-253">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-tcrm-8-253">4</xref></p><p>More than one-half (52%) of the women with fractures were osteopenic (T-score &#x02212;2.5 to &#x02212;1)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-tcrm-8-253">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-tcrm-8-253">4</xref> and, similarly, the increase in BMD achieved through the treatments for osteoporosis seemed to account for only part of the reduction of fracture risk observed.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-tcrm-8-253">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-tcrm-8-253">5</xref></p><p>Knowledge of the molecular bases of bone metabolism would be essential to formulate drugs that act not only on BMD but also on bone quality, especially in order to reduce fracture risk. Moreover, as described below, prescription of the therapy for osteoporosis, which must be specific to the individual patient, should be the result of the evaluation of multiple factors, such as age, sex, severity of osteoporosis, bone turnover markers (bone formation or resorption), patient compliance, allergies to medications, and contraindications or side effects of drugs.</p><p>Behind the choice of the most appropriate therapy, is the concept of bone as a dynamic tissue, which has the ability to adapt its shape and size in response to mechanical loads through modeling process, and to be constantly renewed by remodeling phenomenon.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-tcrm-8-253">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-tcrm-8-253">6</xref> Remodeling process allows the skeleton to maintain mechanical integrity through constant osteoclastic resorption of damaged bone followed by osteoblast-mediated deposition and mineralization of new matrix.</p><p>Antiosteoporosis drugs can be classified on the basis of their action on bone remodeling.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-tcrm-8-253">7</xref> Antiresorptive drugs (such as bisphosphonates, raloxifene &#x02013; a selective estrogen receptor modulator, and denosumab) decrease bone remodeling and reduce fractures by preserving skeletal microarchitecture and moderately increasing bone mass.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-tcrm-8-253">1</xref> Anabolic drugs, such as teriparatide or parathyroid hormone (PTH) 1&#x02013;84, on the other hand, reduce fractures by enhancing remodeling. In addition to increasing BMD, they appear to repair bone microarchitecture and improve bone geometry.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-tcrm-8-253">1</xref> Strontium ranelate, available for osteoporosis in Europe, decouples the two processes, inhibiting bone resorption and stimulating bone formation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-tcrm-8-253">1</xref> The evidence for this suggested mechanism of action of strontium ranelate has been largely acquired from in vitro and animal studies, where doses 30 times higher than those appropriate for men were used.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-tcrm-8-253">8</xref> However, bone anabolic effect has not been demonstrated in animals treated with doses of strontium ranelate comparable to the marketed dose,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-tcrm-8-253">9</xref> nor in human paired bone biopsies by clinical studies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-tcrm-8-253">1</xref></p><p>A large body of scientific evidence derives from randomized controlled trials concerning the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis. Three different aminobisphosphonates (alendronate, risedronate, and zoledronate), teriparatide, strontium ranelate, and hormone replacement therapy &#x02013; which is no longer recommended for the prevention or treatment of osteoporosis &#x02013; were shown to be effective against both vertebral and nonvertebral fractures. Evidence of efficacy against vertebral fractures is available for ibandronate (an aminobisphosphonate), raloxifene, and PTH 1&#x02013;84.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-tcrm-8-253">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-tcrm-8-253">10</xref>
<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-tcrm-8-253">Table 1</xref> shows the site of action and effect on BMD and bone turnover of the most commonly used antiosteoporosis drugs.</p><p>In women with osteoporosis, each 1% improvement in spine BMD (measured by dual X-ray absorptiometry) is expected to reduce vertebral fracture risk by about 4%. However, randomized trials of antiresorptive agents show that 1%&#x02013;6% improvements in spine BMD reduce vertebral fracture risk by 35%&#x02013;50%. Less than 20% of the decreased spine fracture risk produced by alendronate or raloxifene can be explained by improvement in spine BMD. The discrepancy is even greater during the first year or two of treatment when 1%&#x02013;4% improvements in BMD are associated with 65%&#x02013;68% decreases in spine fracture risk. Bisphosphonates continue to increase BMD but the reduction in fracture risk wanes to 20%&#x02013;45%. Dual X-ray absorptiometry underestimates the change in bone density of spinal trabecular bone, which might explain part of the discrepancy between expected and observed reductions in spine fracture risk. Even more accurate measurements of BMD would not explain the rapid onset and later waning of effect despite gradually increasing BMD.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-tcrm-8-253">11</xref></p><p>The effect of drugs on nonspine fracture risk is more complex and cannot be predicted from changes in dual X-ray absorptiometry BMD. Long-term use (&#x0003e;10 years) of estrogen, for example, has been associated with &#x0003e;50% reduction in risk of hip and wrist fracture, which could not be explained by improvements in BMD, and increased section modulus versus nonusers with a net increase in predicted femoral neck strength despite losing about 0.4% per year in femoral neck BMD.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-tcrm-8-253">12</xref> PTH reduces spine fracture risk and this effect is more completely explained by improvement in spine BMD. This suggests that sustaining increased BMD produced by PTH may maintain long-term reduction in fracture risk.</p><p>The choice of the most appropriate therapy for individual patients should be based on the level of turnover rate indicated by biochemical markers, therefore preferring an anticatabolic drug in the case of high bone turnover postmenopausal woman and an anabolic or decoupling drug in an old patient with low turnover indices or a very low spinal and/or hip BMD. Importantly, patients&#x02019; compliance with medical therapy should be considered when choosing drugs with a certain frequency of administration.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-tcrm-8-253">1</xref></p><p>Alendronate, risedronate, and ibandronate were marketed with administration schedules that increasingly simplified oral therapy from once daily to weekly and then to monthly. A third-generation bisphosphonate, zoledronate, is provided in the form of a brief intravenous infusion administered yearly. The therapeutic plan for PTH involves daily subcutaneous administration performed at the same time for a maximum period of 24 consecutive months overall. Denosumab, the latest one on the market, requires a subcutaneous injection every 6 months.</p><p>Moreover, osteoporosis type (postmenopausal, senile, or secondary to pathologies or to the use of drugs), potential side effects, allergies, drug-specific contraindications, and the cost of treatment should be considered.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-tcrm-8-253">1</xref></p></sec><sec><title>The different drug classes: mechanisms of action</title><sec><title>Bisphosphonates</title><p>Bisphosphonates are antiresorptive agents which act via the inhibition of osteoclasts, leading to reduced bone turnover, increased bone mass, and improved mineralization.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-tcrm-8-253">13</xref></p><p>Bisphosphonates are chemically stable analogues of inorganic pyrophosphate; publications of their biological effects began in 1969.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-tcrm-8-253">14</xref> Studies on the role of inorganic pyrophosphate as the body&#x02019;s natural &#x0201c;water softener&#x0201d; in the control of soft tissue and skeletal mineralization led to the need to find inhibitors of calcification that would resist hydrolysis by alkaline phosphatase.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-tcrm-8-253">14</xref> The observation that inorganic pyrophosphate and bisphosphonates could not only retard the growth but also the dissolution of hydroxyapatite crystals prompted studies on their ability to inhibit bone resorption.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-tcrm-8-253">14</xref> Although inorganic pyrophosphate was unable to do this, bisphosphonates turned out to be remarkably effective inhibitors of bone resorption in both in vitro and in vivo experimental systems, and eventually in humans. As more potent bisphosphonates were synthesized and studied, it became apparent that physicochemical effects were insufficient to explain their biological effects and that cellular actions must be involved. Despite many attempts, it was not until the 1990s that their biochemical actions were elucidated. Selectively taken up and adsorbed to mineral surfaces in bone, bisphosphonates are internalized by the bone-resorbing osteoclasts and interfere with specific biochemical processes.</p><p>Bisphosphonates can be classified into at least two groups with different molecular modes of action. The simpler nonnitrogen-containing bisphosphonates (such as etidronate and clodronate) can be metabolically incorporated into non-hydrolysable analogues of adenosine triphosphate, which interfere with adenosine triphosphate-dependent intracellular pathways.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-tcrm-8-253">14</xref> The more potent nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates (including pamidronate, alendronate, risedronate, ibandronate, and zoledronate) are not metabolized in this way but inhibit key enzymes of the mevalonate/cholesterol biosynthetic pathway, such as farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase. They therefore interfere with geranylgeranylation (attachment of the lipid to regulatory proteins) and with the biosynthesis of isoprenoid compounds (notably farnesol and geranylgeraniol) that are required for posttranslational prenylation of small guanosine triphosphate-binding proteins (which are also guanosine triphosphatases), essential intracellular messengers, thus causing osteoclast inactivation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-tcrm-8-253">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-tcrm-8-253">14</xref> Loss of geranylgeranylation leads to osteoclast apoptosis,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-tcrm-8-253">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-tcrm-8-253">16</xref> disruption of the actin cytoskeleton, and altered membrane trafficking.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-tcrm-8-253">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-tcrm-8-253">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-tcrm-8-253">19</xref> This mechanism is responsible for nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate suppression of osteoclastic bone resorption and reduction of bone turnover, which leads to fracture prevention.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-tcrm-8-253">13</xref></p><p>Because of the appearance in humans of gastrointestinal adverse events after oral administration of nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-tcrm-8-253">20</xref> the effects of oral bisphosphonates were examined in special studies in animals. Suprapharmacologic doses of alendronate administered orally to rats have been reported to induce gastric and esophageal erosions and ulcerations, as well as delay healing of indomethacin-induced gastric erosions. These effects were not attributable to changes in gastric acid secretion or prostaglandin synthesis, but are thought to be due to a topical irritant effect. Similar effects were reported with etidronate, risedronate, and tiludronate when given at pharmacologically equivalent doses.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-tcrm-8-253">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-tcrm-8-253">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-tcrm-8-253">23</xref></p><p>Accumulation of the upstream metabolite, isopentenyl pyrophosphate, as a result of inhibition of farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase may be responsible for immunomodulatory effects on gamma delta T cells, and can also lead to production of another adenosine triphosphate metabolite called ApppI, which has intracellular actions.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-tcrm-8-253">14</xref></p><p>Bisphosphonates are established as the treatments of choice for various diseases of excessive bone resorption, including Paget&#x02019;s disease of bone, skeletal complications of malignancy, and primarily osteoporosis.</p><p>Recently, it has been suggested that in addition to inhibiting osteoclasts, bisphosphonates (specifically alendronate) may also promote osteoblast proliferation and maturation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-tcrm-8-253">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-tcrm-8-253">24</xref> The evidence base for bisphosphonates in the prevention of fracture in postmenopausal women is well established.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-tcrm-8-253">4</xref> Treatment with alendronate 10 mg/day resulted in statistically significant reductions in vertebral, nonvertebral, hip, and wrist fractures in patients with prior osteoporotic fracture or low BMD.

Anabolic effects of PTH on bone have been demonstrated in animals and humans by numerous measurement techniques including BMD and bone histomorphometry.

In recent randomized controlled clinical trials of intermittent PTH treatment, PTH decreased incidence of vertebral and nonvertebral fractures in postmenopausal women. Thus, PTH shows strong potential as therapy for osteoporosis. However, two-dimensional and three-dimensional structural analysis of advanced osteopenia in animals has shown that there is a critical limit of trabecular connectivity and bone strength below which PTH cannot completely reverse the condition. Given that PTH treatment fails to completely restore trabecular connectivity and bone strength in animals with advanced osteopenia, early treatment of osteoporosis appears important and efficacious for preventing fractures caused by decreased trabecular connectivity.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48-tcrm-8-253">48</xref></p><p>The beneficial effect of introducing a treatment with antiresorptives after a treatment course with teriparatide or PTH has been demonstrated and is supported by a good rationale. Teriparatide increases bone mass but, at the same time, the new bone is less mineralized. Treatment with antiresorptives after teriparatide prevents accelerated osteoclastic resorption of the new bone tissue built during teriparatide therapy, increases mineralization, and rapidly lowers cortical porosity; this leads to further increases in BMD. The cost of teriparatide treatment is considerably higher than that of antiresorptives. For this reason, its use is indicated for patients with severe osteoporosis; in Italy, for example, teriparatide is fully reimbursed in patients with a new vertebral or hip fracture while on chronic treatment with antiresorptives or in patients never treated with antiresorptives with three or more vertebral or hip fractures.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-tcrm-8-253">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49-tcrm-8-253">49</xref> Contrary to bisphosphonates, the effect of which persists for many months after drug withdrawal,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50-tcrm-8-253">50</xref> the protective action of teriparatide on BMD vanishes with time in both genders but not up to the baseline values.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51-tcrm-8-253">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52-tcrm-8-253">52</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Bazedoxifene</title><p>Bazedoxifene is a novel third-generation selective estrogen receptor modulator, a molecule developed to act as estrogen receptor agonists in some tissues (eg, bone) and as estrogen receptor antagonists in others, such as breast and endometrium, in order to reduce the risk of breast and endometrial cancers that would be induced by hormone replacement therapy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53-tcrm-8-253">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54-tcrm-8-253">54</xref></p><p>Two large Phase III clinical trials<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54-tcrm-8-253">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55-tcrm-8-253">55</xref> showed that bazedoxifene, as well as raloxifene, increased BMD, decreased levels of bone turnover markers, and significantly reduced the risk of new vertebral fractures in postmenopausal women compared with placebo.

Human monoclonal antibody to RANK, denosumab 60 mg given subcutaneously every six months has shown to increase BMD and reduce bone turnover and fracture risk in all the fragile sites. It is simple to administer and well tolerated, with a safety profile generally similar to placebo, except for a slightly higher incidence of cellulitis and exanthema.</p><p>Approved by the Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis in women at high risk of fracture and for the bone loss associated with androgen deprivation therapy in men with prostate cancer, denosumab may be particularly useful in clinical practice for the treatment of patients who have failed or are intolerant to other available osteoporosis therapy, eg, patients with gastrointestinal contraindications, side effects with oral bisphosphonates, or malabsorption.</p><p>Denosumab has also shown promising skeletal effects in the treatment of cancer and rheumatoid arthritis.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1-tcrm-8-253"><p><bold>Disclosure</bold></p><p>The authors have no relevant affiliations or financial involvement with any organization or entity with a financial interest in or financial conflict with the subject matter or materials discussed in the manuscript.

Serious skin infections, as well as infections of the abdomen, urinary tract, and ear, were more frequent in patients treated with denosumab.<break/>Endocarditis was also reported more frequently in denosumab-treated subjects. The incidence of opportunistic infections was balanced and the overall incidence of infections was similar between the treatment groups. Patients should be advised to seek prompt medical attention if they develop signs or symptoms of severe infection, including cellulitis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b76-tcrm-8-253">76</xref> Patients on concomitant immunosuppressant agents or with impaired immune systems may be at increased risk for serious infections.</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Dermatologic adverse reactions</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Epidermal and dermal adverse events (eg, dermatitis, eczema, and rashes) occurred at a significantly higher rate in the denosumab group compared to the placebo group.

An oral exam should be performed by the prescriber prior to initiation of denosumab. A dental examination with appropriate preventive dentistry should be considered prior to treatment in patients with risk factors for osteonecrosis of the jaw. Good oral hygiene practices should be maintained during treatment with denosumab.<break/>For patients requiring invasive dental procedures, clinical judgment should guide the management plan of each patient. Patients who are suspected of having or who develop osteonecrosis of the jaw should receive care by a dentist or an oral surgeon. Extensive dental surgery to treat osteonecrosis of the jaw may exacerbate the condition. Discontinuation of denosumab should be considered based on individual benefit&#x02013;risk assessment.</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Suppression of bone turnover</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Denosumab resulted in significant suppression of bone remodeling as evidenced by markers of bone turnover and bone histomorphometry. The significance of these findings and the effect of long-term treatment are unknown.
