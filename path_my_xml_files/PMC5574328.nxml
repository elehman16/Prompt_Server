exercises program on functional performance (single legged hop test as functional
performance test and Kujala score for functional activities). [Subjects and Methods]
Thirty patients with patellofemoral pain syndrome were randomly assigned into two equal
groups. Group (A) consisted of 15 patients undergoing hip strengthening exercises for four
weeks then measuring all variables followed by additional four weeks of knee exercises
program then measuring all variables again. Group (B): consisted of 15 patients undergoing
knee exercises program for four weeks then measuring all variables followed by additional
four weeks of hip strengthening exercises then measuring all variables. Functional
abilities and knee muscles performance were assessed using Kujala questionnaire and single
legged hop test respectively pre and after the completion of the first 4 weeks then after
8 weeks for both groups. [Results] Significantly increase in Kujala questionnaire in group
A compared with group B was observed. While, there were significant increase in single
legged hop performance test in group B compared with group A. [Conclusion] Starting with
hip exercises improve the performance of subjects more than functional activities while
starting with knee exercises improve the functional activities of subjects more than
performance.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Patellofemoral pain syndrome</kwd><kwd>Single legged hop test</kwd><kwd>Hip and knee exercises</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome (PFPS) is a term for different pathologies or anatomical
variations from the normal resulting into a kind of anterior knee pain<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. It is additionally a typical complaint in athletes and
overall communities particularly in which repetitive lower limb loading is experienced. It
is more predominant in female than in male with higher incidence rates in physically dynamic
young adult more prominent than 25%<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. PFPS
was referred to by such term as anterior knee pain, patellofemoral dysfunction, patellar
subluxation or patellar compression syndrome<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Despite the fact that the etiology of PFPS was clearly uncovered, repetitive loading of
patellofemoral joint can bring on damage to the retropatellar cartilage and subchondral
bone<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Strength imbalance in extensor
mechanism can result in patellofemoral pain by stimulating nociceptive fibers in synovium
and retinaculum<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. It has been accused
that, patellofemoral joint reaction forces increased in conditions like running,
stair-climbing and diving, slant climbing and plummeting, or sitting at flexion points at
least 90&#x000b0;, and force a lot of weight on patellofemoral joint, subsequently bringing on an
increase in pain complaints in patients<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. One of the most commonly accepted causes of
PFPS was abnormal tracking of the patella within the femoral trochlea. Potential
contributing factors that have been studied included vastus medialis obliquus insufficiency,
and decreased flexibility of soft tissues around the knee<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. A few speculations for the inception of nontraumatic progressive
onset of PFPS were (1) neuromuscular imbalance of both; vastus medialis obliquusand the
vastuslateralis muscles; (2) shortening of the lateral knee retinaculum, hamstrings,
iliotibial band, and gastrocnemius; and (3) increased pronation of the subtalar joint<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Research findings suggested that without direct injury, the etiology of PFPS is
multifactorial. Components related mainly to disorders at the level of the patellofemoral
joint<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>, and other variables distal to
the knee have additionally been accused to the patellofemoral malalignment and pain<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Other proximal components including hip muscle weakness have been
suspected to increase patellofemoral malalignment and the advancement of PFPS signs and
symptoms<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Hip musculature assumes an important part in controlling
transverse-plane and frontal-plane movements of the femur<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Strong evidence was accounted for the decrease in hip external
rotation, abduction, and extension strength and moderate evidence for the decrease in
flexion and internal rotation strength; however no confirmation for reduction in hip
adduction quality in instances of PFPS contrasted with sound controls<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Treatment of PFPS is varying and controversial. It is
generally agreed that PFPS should be managed initially by conservative rather than surgical
means<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, no single intervention
has been demonstrated to be the most effective. Conservative treatment included taping,
strengthening of the quadriceps muscle, flexibility training, biofeedback, manual therapy to
the lower quarter, and fitting of foot orthoses<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. When treating patients
with PFPS demonstrating lack of control of hip adduction and internal rotation during
weight-bearing activities, special considerations were assumed to optimize hip muscles
function to control these motions<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Rehabilitation programs focusing on knee strengthening exercises in addition to hip
flexors, abductors, and external rotators strengthening were related to successful treatment
as defined by at least 15% pain reduction on a pain through visual analogue scale<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. So the aim of this work was to
investigate the carryover effect of hip and knee exercises program on functional performance
(hopping performance test and Kujala score) in PFPS, in addition to the difference between
either starting with hip exercises then ending by knee exercises or starting with knee
exercises and ending by hip exercises on hopping performance test and Kujala score in
patients with PFPS.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Thirty patients with unilateral PFPS aged between of 18&#x02013;35 years signed an informed consent
to participate voluntarily in the study. After a brief orientation session about the nature
of the study and the tasks to be accomplished, they were randomly assigned into two equal
groups by a blinded and an independent research assistant who opened sealed envelopes that
contained a computer generated randomization card. Patients were considered eligible to
participate in the study if they had anterior or retropatellar knee pain aggravated by at
least two of the following activities, (1) prolonged sitting; (2) stair climbing; (3)
squatting; (4) running; (5) kneeling; and (6) hopping/jumping<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup> Participants chosen were also suffering from insidious knee pain not
related to a traumatic incident, and persisted for at least 6 weeks. Patients were excluded
if they have history of meniscal or ligamentous involvement, patellar subluxation or
dislocation, knee or hip joints arthritis, fixed flat foot, and previous surgery in the
lower extremity. Patients with conditions which might affect muscle strength such as
diabetes mellitus or rheumatoid arthritis were also excluded from the study.</p><p>The study was designed as a crossover trial and patients were assigned into either group A
or group B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Sample is randomized into two different treatments (A and B)</p><p>Group A receives hip exercises during the first period of the study; group B receives

started by strengthening hip exercises (hip abductors and lateral rotators) for 4 weeks then
measuring all variables followed by knee strengthening exercises program using open kinetic
chain exercises program (terminal knee extension and straight leg raisings) and stretching
exercises for tight lower extremity soft tissues (quadriceps, hamstring, iliotibial band,

performance using Kujala questionnaire and single-legged hop test respectively pre and after
the completion of the first 4 weeks then after 8 weeks for both groups</p><p>The participant&#x02019;s functional status was assessed using Kujala questionnaire for
patellofemoral joint pain<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. It is a
13-items knee specific self-report questionnaire, it documents response to 6 activities
thought to be associated specifically with anterior knee pain syndrome (walking, running,
jumping, climbing, stairs, squatting, and sitting for prolonged periods with knees bent), as
well as symptoms such as limp, inability to bear weight through the affected limb, swelling,
abnormal patellar movement, muscle atrophy, pain and limitation of knee flexion. The maximum
total score of this assessment tool is 100, with higher scores indicating greater levels of
function with lower levels of pain. This scale was considered as having high test-retest
reliability, moderate responsiveness, and adequate validity<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Single-legged hop tests are performance-based measures used to assess the combination of
muscle strength, neuromuscular control, confidence in the limb, and the ability to tolerate
loads related to sports-specific activities<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. These tests are commonly used to quantify knee performance in
patients after reconstruction surgeries<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Patients performed 4 single-legged hop tests: the single hop for distance (single hop),
crossover hop for distance (crossover hop), triple hop for distance (triple hop), and
6-meter timed hop (6-m timed hop)<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>.
These 4 tests have demonstrated good test-retest reliability in normal, young adults and in
patients after ACL reconstruction<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
single hop for distance was performed with the patient standing on the leg to be tested,
hopping as far as possible, and landing on the same leg. The total distance hopped forward
was recorded. The single hop was considered successful if the landing was stable. To be
considered a valid trial, the landing was insisted to be on 1 limb, under complete control
of the patient. If the patient landed with early touchdown of the contralateral limb, had
loss of balance, touched the wall, or had additional hops after landing, the hop was
repeated. Patients were instructed to begin with the painful leg, with their tip toe behind
a marked starting line. The hop distance was measured to the nearest centimeter from the
starting line to the patient&#x02019;s heel with a standard tape measure. All single-legged hop
tests were conducted by physical therapists that had undergone detailed training in the test
procedures. The test was repeated three times and the average was taken as the result for
more accuracy.</p><p>Each patient in both groups received 12 sessions (3 sessions per week for 4 weeks) of hip
strengthening exercises in group (A) and knee program exercises for group (B). Each
strengthening exercise was performed for three sets of 10 repetitions with 3 seconds rest
between repetitions and 1 minute rest after each set. Each patient was trained at 60% of 10
repetitions maximum which is the amount of weight that was lifted and lowered through
available range of motion exactly 10 times<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup>. To determine the 10 repetition maximum, the therapist selected a
specific amount of resistance and document how many repetitions can be completed through the
full range before the participants reported to fatigue. A new 10 repetition maximum was
established at the end of each week of training<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Hip strengthening exercises for hip abductors and external rotators were performed while
lying on the non affected side, the patient was asked to bend the knee of the non affected
side and extend the affected knee, while the therapist stabilized the pelvis. A sandbag was
wrapped just proximal to the lateral malleolus and the patient was asked to raise his limb
in abduction, hold for 6 seconds count, then lowering his limb slowly through 6 seconds and
return to starting position and relax<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Hip external rotation strengthening exercise were performed as follows: The patient was
sitting at the edge of the bed with the hip and knee joints flexed to 90 degree, and his
hand behind him for support while the therapist was stabilizing the patient&#x02019;s thigh. Sandbag
was wrapped just proximal to lateral malleolus, then the patient was asked to rotate the leg
inward toward the non affected side, hold for 6 seconds count, then return to starting
position slowly through 6 seconds and relax<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Regarding the Knee exercises program<bold>:</bold> The exercise protocol included
strengthening and stretching exercises<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><sup>)</sup>. Strengthening exercises program included
straight leg raisings exercise. In this exercise, the patient laid supine with the knee in
zero degree of flexion and the uninvolved leg was resting on the plinth with 90&#x000b0; of flexion
for stability. Sandbag was wrapped just proximal to the ankle joint, the patient was asked
to contract the quadriceps and lift the involved leg up to the level of uninvolved knee as
much as possible then hold for 6 seconds count, and finally return to starting position
slowly through 6 seconds and relax<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Terminal knee extension exercises <bold>(</bold>short arc movements from 15&#x000b0; of knee
flexion to terminal extension): While the patient lying supine with both knees fully
extended, the therapist placed a rolled up towel under the involved knee. Sandbag was
wrapped just proximal to the ankle joint. The patient was asked to lift the involved foot up
by straightening the knee as far as possible (still supported by the roll) and hold for 6
seconds count, then return to starting position slowly through 6 seconds and relax<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Stretching exercises program (for quadriceps, hamstring, iliotibial band and
gastrocnemius)<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><sup>)</sup>: For hamstring stretching exercise, the patient laid supine, with
the knee fully extended. The patient&#x02019;s leg was supported over the therapist&#x02019;s arm or
shoulder. The therapist stabilized the patient&#x02019;s opposite extremity along the anterior
aspect of the thigh by a belt. This position was maintained for 30 sec then released with 3
times repetition and rest for 10 seconds between each repetition.</p><p>Quadriceps stretching exercise: The patient laid side lying on the nonaffected limb, the
therapist stood behind the patient while grasping the flexed knee, and the pelvis was
stabilized by the other therapist&#x02019;s hand. The therapist pulled the limb backward, and held
this position for 30 seconds then released with 3 times repetition and rest for 10 seconds
between each repetition<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the same position, the Iliotibial band stretching was
done.The therapist stabilized the pelvis by one hand and the other hand adducted the
upper-most limb cross the other limb. For all stretching exercises, the stretch position was
maintained for 30 seconds and repeated 3 times with a rest period of 10 seconds between each
two repititions<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Gastrocnemius stretching exercise: patient supine lying position, the therapist stood at
the affected side with one hand fixing the leg and the other hand cupping the patient heel.
The therapist applied a stretch force by his hand, and maintained this position for 30
seconds then releaseed with 3 times repetition and rest for 10 seconds between each
repetition<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Data analysis was performed using (SPSS, Inc. Chicago, IL, USA) program version 20 for
Windows. The sample size (30 patients) was calculated to yield an 80% power and &#x003b1;=0.05.
Prior to final analysis, data were screened for normality assumption and presence of extreme
scores. This exploration was done as a pre-requisite for parametric calculation of the
analysis of differences and of relationship measures. 2 &#x000d7; 2 Mixed design MANOVA was used to
compare the tested variables of interest at different tested groups and training

isolated hip abductors and external rotators strengthening exercises for group A and knee
strengthening and stretching exercises for group B for four weeks then crossing over the
treatment for another 4 weeks where group A received knee strengthening and stretching
exercises and group B received isolated hip abductors and external rotators strengthening
exercises on performance and functional activity (hopping test and Kujala questionnaire) of
PFPS patients. The results of this crossover trial revealed that the group A showed marked
improvement in hopping test while group B had higher percent of improvement in Kujala
questionnaire at the first 4 weeks. On the other hand, group A had higher percent of
improvement in Kujala questionnaire compared with group B that showed higher percent of
improvement in hopping test at the second 4 weeks. Such results can implicate that hip
strengthening exercises could potentially be the main responsible for improving hopping test
at both groups while knee exercises program could be the main responsible for improving
Kujala questionnaire. Additionally, the carry over effect showed significant increase in
Kujala questionnaire in group A compared with group B. While, there were significant
increase in hopping test in group B compared with group A.</p><p>This carry over effect reflected that starting with hip strengthening exercise before knee
exercises program improved functional activity (Kujala questionnaire) more than starting
with knee exercises program; while starting with knee exercises program before hip
strengthening exercise improved hooping test (performance test) more than starting with hip
strengthening exercise.</p><p>Based on the obtained results, it is thought that the muscles that directly influence the
hip have also an effect on the knee. Specifically, the abductor and lateral rotators that
might help control forces applied to the knee joint, and help control femoral medial
rotation and adduction during dynamic daily activities<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><sup>)</sup>. The hip external rotator and abductor muscles contribute to pelvic
stability and leg alignment by eccentrically controlling femoral internal rotation and
influencing the hip adduction during weight bearing activities<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref><sup>)</sup>. It is hypothesized that weakness of these muscles may
increase the medial femoral rotation and valgus knee movement. These deviations may alter
the abduction/adduction moment at the hip or might lead to an increase in the Q angle, which
may subsequently alter tracking of the patella, increase compressive forces on the
patellofemoral joint, and ultimately lead to knee pain<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In this means, strengthening these muscles might have reversed this effect and reduced pain
at knee level and might contributed to improve in functional activity. These findings are
compatible with Long-Rossi and Salsich<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref><sup>)</sup>
who reported that pain during unilateral squat explained 22% of the variance in function,
suggesting that the level of pain a person has during weight-bearing task influences
functional status since the Kujala questionnaire includes questions about pain and its
impact on tasks such as stair climbing, running, jumping and squatting. However, the fact
that only 22% of the variance in function was explained by pain suggests that factors other
than pain might have an impact on function.</p><p>Additionally, Long-Rossi and Salsich<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref><sup>)</sup>
revealed that hip lateral rotator muscle strength explained an additional 14% of the
variance in Kujala score, beyond the variance already explained by pain. The authors
concluded that pain during unilateral squat and hip lateral rotator muscle strength
contributed to functional status in females with PFP, suggesting that rehabilitation
strategies aimed at improving pain and increasing hip lateral rotator strength may improve
functional outcomes in females suffering from this common pain condition. Previous studies
have also reported strong correlation between restoration of quadriceps strength and
improvement in pain and functional outcome<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Mascal et al.<xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref><sup>)</sup> were the first to
demonstrate that an exercise program addressing hip and trunk strength was effective in
decreasing pain, improving hip kinematics, and restoring function in 2 patients with PFP.
Subsequent studies by Tyler et al.<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>
demonstrated that exercise programs incorporating hip strengthening resulted in improved
pain and functional outcomes in females with PFP. On the other hand, Dolak and
colleagues<xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that 4 weeks of
isolated hip strengthening prior to the initiation of 4 weeks of weight-bearing exercise
reduced self-reported symptoms earlier than when 4 weeks of quadriceps strengthening were
performed prior to the same weight-bearing program. In the same track, Khayambashi et
al.<xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref><sup>)</sup> concluded that a program of
isolated hip abductor and external rotator strengthening was effective in improving pain and
health status in females with PFP.</p><p>On the basis of our results, it can be deduced that strengthening of hip abductor and
lateral rotator muscles might play an important role in patellofemoral treatment. One
limitation of this study was that it did not include a controlled follow-up period, so no
conclusions can be drawn regarding long-term benefits of such treatment intervention.
Another issue is that this study had some sort of construct under representation as the
program of treatment was performed in non-weight bearing position while all dependent
variables were measured in weight bearing status implicating that potential future. So that
future studies should focus on weight bearing strengthening exercises for both hip and knee
muscles rather than non-weight bearing exercises. Also, future studies might need to
incorporate multiple measures of muscle performance and functional tasks such as concentric
or eccentric muscle force, torque or power, or time to peak torque are more closely related
outcome measures related function.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Ng</surname><given-names>GY</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>AQ</given-names></name><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>CK</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Biofeedback exercise improved the EMG activity ratio of
