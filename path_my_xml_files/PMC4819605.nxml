We compared the effect of two educational interventions on ADR of these screening centre leaders and all endoscopists working at their centres.</p><p>The study was conducted in four phases: (i) preintervention phase, (ii) intervention phase, (iii) early postintervention phase and (iv) late postintervention phase. In the preintervention phase (1 January 2011 to 31 December 2011), colonoscopy quality indicators were extracted from the NCRCSP database. Centre leaders were unaware of the study during this phase. At the start of the intervention phase, screening centre leaders were randomly assigned to either a designated educational intervention (&#x02018;Train-Colonoscopy-Leaders course&#x02019; (TCL)) or to routine audit and feedback. Both interventions started on 1 June 2012 and the TCL phase was completed by 30 August 2012. Quality indicators were measured in the early postintervention phase (1 June 2012 to 31 December 2012; leaders were aware of being closely monitored) and in the late postintervention phase (1 January 2013 to 31 December 2013; leaders were unaware of being closely monitored) using the same method.</p><p>The study was approved by the Research Ethical Committee of the Maria Sklodowska-Curie Memorial Cancer Centre and Institute of Oncology, Warsaw, Poland (#17/2012).

All these endpoints were subsequently measured for the late postintervention phase compared with the preintervention phase. CIR was defined as the proportion of colonoscopies in which the endoscope tip reached proximal to the ileocaecal valve and the entire caecum was visualised.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Non-polypoid lesions were defined as lesions 5&#x02005;mm or larger which were depressed, completely flat or elevated less than 2.5&#x02005;mm.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Study colonoscopists</title><p>All screening centre leaders who performed at least 30 NCRCSP screening colonoscopies in 2011 and achieved an ADR lower than 25% were eligible for the study (40 out of 93 centres in the NCRCSP) unless they discontinued participating in the NCRCSP in 2012.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Randomisation and masking</title><p>In May 2012, eligible screening centre leaders were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to the TCL group or the feedback group. Randomisation lists were computer-generated and stratified by screening centre leader baseline ADR category (&#x0003c;11%, 11%&#x02013;14.9%, 15%&#x02013;19.9%, 20.0%&#x02013;24.9%).<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Participating screening centre leaders were informed that they were participating in a trial testing two different training programmes dedicated for trainers but were not informed about trial aims and endpoints. All other colonoscopists were not informed about the study but were aware of being monitored as a routine part of the NCRCSP. In the year 2013 (late postintervention phase), all colonoscopists (including screening centre leaders) were aware only of being monitored as a routine part of the NCRCSP.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Feedback group</title><p>Screening centre leaders randomised to the feedback group received (by email and surface mail) feedback on their individual preintervention screening colonoscopy quality indicators along with aggregated results for the entire screening centre. The individual results were presented in a table to enable comparison with anonymised results of all endoscopists who performed at least 30 colonoscopies within the NCRCSP (see online supplementary appendix 1). In addition, a link to a webpage containing data on individual and overall colonoscopy quality indicators from the last 4&#x02005;years of the NCRCSP was provided. The email feedback was provided also after early postintervention phase.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>TCLs group</title><p>Screening centre leaders randomised to the TCL group were invited to participate in a TCL course consisting of three phases: (i) pretraining assessment, (ii) hands-on training and (iii) post-training evaluation and feedback (see online supplementary appendix 2). The underlying hypothesis of the training intervention was to train the leaders on how to teach high quality colonoscopy and thereby to facilitate self-development and disseminate high standards of care.</p><p>The pretraining assessment phase involved a 2-h visit held in June and July 2012 at each screening centre. It used an environmental assessment checklist to find reasons for suboptimal performance. After the pretraining visit, local endoscopy nurses observed 10 consecutive colonoscopies performed by the screening centre leader to assess patient discomfort (using a 100&#x02005;mm visual analogue scale) and withdrawal technique.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Local endoscopy nurses were trained to assess withdrawal technique and discomfort by the study team. Prior to starting the hands-on training phase, the TCL trainers were subject to a 2-day intensive training course by UK trainers (JA, RV) providing them with techniques used in skills improvement, training the trainer and leadership training programmes developed in the UK. During these 2&#x02005;days, the focus was on using techniques known to change professional practice.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> The hands-on training phase consisted of two half-a-day courses at the NCRCSP coordinating centre. The hands-on training course included at least one session for each participating screening centre leader playing the role of a trainee (performing colonoscopy) and at least one as a trainer (supervising colonoscopy), observed by the other course participants (by video streaming). The TCL trainers from the Institute of Oncology facilitated discussion on the training episode among all participants. The schedule of each course was modified to address issues identified in the pretraining assessment. Six to seven screening colonoscopy leaders were trained during each training session (held between July and August 2012).</p><p>The post-training evaluation encompassed evaluation of the screening centre leaders&#x02019; colonoscopy performance (extracted from the database) during the first 30 procedures following the hands-on training course, and a further nurse assessment of 10 consecutive colonoscopies identical to that done in the pretraining phase. Finally, all leaders in the TCL group received feedback on individual performance along with aggregated results for the entire screening centre and access to the same webpage as leaders in the control group. The email feedback was provided also after early postintervention phase. According to protocol of the study, we had not planned to assess whether leaders extended training to other colleagues within the screening centre. Upon reviewers&#x02019; request, we have performed a brief telephone survey among leaders asking whether they have extended training to their colleagues.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Power estimates and statistical analyses</title><p>We considered an absolute ADR improvement of 3% in the screening centre leaders randomised to the TCL group compared with 1.5% in those randomised to the feedback group<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> as clinically meaningful to detect. A sample size of 34 screening centre leaders provided 80% power to detect a mean difference in ADR improvement of 1.5% with an estimated SD of 1.5% and a two-sided significance level (&#x003b1;) of 0.05. We planned to include 40 leader colonoscopists to take account of compliance with the study.</p><p>For the primary endpoint, we used a generalised linear mixed effects model with random colonoscopists and colonoscopists&#x02019; specific study phase effects, and fixed effects for the study group, phase, study group by phase interaction, and patient age and sex.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> A generalised linear mixed effects model allows analysing changes in colonoscopists&#x02019; performance over time treating them as a random sample from wider population and incorporating the possible correlation among outputs of participants examined by the same colonoscopists. The model allowed expressing the change in ADR at the participant level using ORs with corresponding 95% CIs. The OR for the interaction term reflects an excess in the OR of adenoma detection during the postintervention phases versus the preintervention phase in the TCL compared with the feedback group. Similar models were fitted for the secondary endpoints, including all the analyses comparing late postintervention phase and preintervention phase. Continuous variables (withdrawal technique scores, withdrawal time and patient pain scores) were checked for normality and compared using appropriate parametric or non-parametric tests. A p value of &#x0003c;0.05 was considered statistically significant. All reported p values are two-sided and not adjusted for multiple testing. The analyses were performed using Stata Statistical Software V.12 (Stata Corporation, College Station, Texas, USA).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><p>Of the 40 screening centre leaders enrolled and randomised in a 1:1 ratio, one in each group was excluded due to consent withdrawal or lack of participation in the NCRCSP in 2012. Furthermore, in 2013, one screening centre leader in each group left the centre.

The training of screening centre leaders in teaching high quality colonoscopy resulted in sustained change of their own practice and the performance of the centre as a whole.</p><p>Our training course represents a novel concept, aiming at multifaceted change in endoscopists&#x02019; skills and behaviours. The training was targeted at screening centre leaders with the aim of ensuring they appreciated the importance of high standards and providing them with a variety of techniques to train their teams on how to meet these standards. The training did focus on teaching high quality colonoscopy, withdrawal technique and non-polypoid lesion recognition, and on barriers for improvements in ADR at individual centres including aspects of organisation, workforce, communication, training and quality control. Our training course used techniques drawn from skills improvement, training the trainer and leadership courses developed in the UK. This methodology is based on key principles of adult learning and changing professional practice.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></p><p>Our primary study focus was leader's performance. We demonstrated that the TCL course resulted in a significant and sustained leader's ADR improvement; thereby, we confirmed that one of the best ways to learn is by teaching.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></p><p>The robust design of our study allowed us also to investigate the effect of training at the screening centre level. Indeed, in the late postintervention phase, we observed significant improvement in the ADR and non-polypoid lesion detection rate at the screening centre level. It was unrealistic to expect this to be evident in the early postintervention phase as it takes time to deliver the training to other endoscopists in screening centres. Our large-scale nationwide study results extend those of a recent single centre study showing ADR improvement with a short educational intervention.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></p><p>Proximal colorectal adenomas and non-polypoid lesions may play an important role in the development of interval CRCs.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>
<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Our study is the first to demonstrate significant improvement in proximal ADR and non-polypoid lesion detection rate following quality improvement intervention. These results are in line with the primary goals of the training curriculum: emphasis on detection of subtle, non-polypoid lesions and visualisation of the proximal colon.</p><p>Endoscopist specialty and type of facility in which colonoscopy was performed have been associated with the risk of interval CRC.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> In our study, ADR improvement was observed across all endoscopist specialties, colonoscopy experience and types of screening facilities (see online supplementary table S3). In contrast, in previous studies on quality improvement through educational intervention, only gastroenterologists from academic institutions were included.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></p><p>The underlying hypothesis of our educational interventions was that the improvement in the detection of adenomas translates into reduced interval CRC rates. A recent large-scale study suggests that each 1% increase in ADR may result in a 3% decrease in the risk of interval cancer.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> We intend to follow our study cohort to investigate if improvement in ADR translates into reduced interval CRC rates.</p><p>Our study has some limitations. First, the cost-effectiveness of the training intervention is unknown. However, assuming that the relative risk of interval CRC among endoscopists with high and low ADR is comparable or greater than that observed for gastroenterologist and non-gastroenterologist endoscopists,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>
<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> it is likely that training to improve ADR will be as cost-effective as shifting screening colonoscopies from non-gastroenterologist endoscopists to gastroenterologist endoscopists.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Second, total colonoscopy and withdrawal time were not routinely measured in our study. Thus, impact of the study interventions on procedure times is unknown. However, short term assessments, done by endoscopy nurses before and after intervention, suggest that observed improvement in ADR in the TCL group was most likely due to improved withdrawal technique rather than longer withdrawal time. This observation is in line with results of a previous study which showed that compared with withdrawal time, withdrawal technique might better differentiate between endoscopists with varying ADRs.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Third, continuous, more frequent feedback of colonoscopy quality might be more effective than annual feedback. We decided to give feedback annually because of the sample size required to give a sufficiently precise estimate of ADR.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Fourth, screening centre leaders were aware of being monitored under the study conditions. This might have affected their postintervention colonoscopy performance (the so-called Hawthorne effect<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Indeed, it is likely that some Hawthorne effect occurred in our study because in the late postintervention phase, colonoscopy performance of screening centre leaders declined slightly compared with the early postintervention phase. However, a Hawthorne effect had likely relatively small impact on our study results. Furthermore, this study included screening centre leaders with ADRs below 25%. It is uncertain if our results are applicable to leaders of endoscopy units outside screening setting and endoscopists with ADRs higher than 25%. Fifth, two screening centre leaders in each study group were lost to follow-up in the late postintervention phase, and thus the analyses for this period were not purely on an intention to treat basis. However, in the analyses we included all the data from screenees who underwent examination by endoscopists who performed screening examinations in the postintervention phase and did not withdraw their consent to participate in the trial, regardless of whether the training was complete or not (one screening centre leader did not participate in the pretraining and the post-training assessment but was included in the analyses). Moreover, in the late postintervention phase, we analysed all the centres that continued the screening programme, despite two leaders leaving their centres.</p><p>In summary, participation in a short, dedicated training intervention for screening centre leaders resulted in a greater improvement in ADR than audit and feedback of individual colonoscopy quality indicators. The observed quality improvement among leading colonoscopists and its dissemination on the entire screening centres support its widespread implementation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Web appendix</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="gutjnl-2014-307503-s1.pdf" orientation="portrait" id="d36e1426" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was initiated and/or supported by representatives of the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Quality Improvement Committee, the Polish Society of Gastroenterology Quality Section and the UK Joint Advisory Group on Gastrointestinal Endoscopy.
