We hypothesize that the nicotinic acid derivative acipimox, an NAD<sup>+</sup> precursor, would directly affect mitochondrial function independent of reductions in nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA) concentrations. In a multicenter randomized crossover trial, 21 patients with type 2 diabetes (age 57.7 &#x000b1; 1.1 years, BMI 33.4 &#x000b1; 0.8 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) received either placebo or acipimox 250 mg three times daily dosage for 2 weeks. Acipimox treatment increased plasma NEFA levels (759 &#x000b1; 44 vs. 1,135 &#x000b1; 97 &#x003bc;mol/L for placebo vs. acipimox, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01) owing to a previously described rebound effect. As a result, skeletal muscle lipid content increased and insulin sensitivity decreased. Despite the elevated plasma NEFA levels, ex vivo mitochondrial respiration in skeletal muscle increased. Subsequently, we showed that acipimox treatment resulted in a robust elevation in expression of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial gene sets and a mitonuclear protein imbalance, which may indicate activation of the mitochondrial unfolded protein response. Further studies in C2C12 myotubes confirmed a direct effect of acipimox on NAD<sup>+</sup> levels, mitonuclear protein imbalance, and mitochondrial oxidative capacity. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to demonstrate that NAD<sup>+</sup> boosters can also directly affect skeletal muscle mitochondrial function in humans.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Acipimox is a nicotinic acid analog used to treat hyperlipidemia (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Besides its effects on cholesterol and triglyceride levels, acipimox treatment acutely decreases plasma nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA) concentrations by 46&#x02013;57%, which may lower ectopic fat accumulation in type 2 diabetes (T2D) (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) and thereby improve whole-body insulin sensitivity (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Furthermore, elevated plasma NEFA concentrations have been shown to deteriorate mitochondrial function (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), and lowering plasma NEFA levels may, therefore, restore mitochondrial function. The latter is important because several features of muscle mitochondrial function can be impaired in patients with T2D and may be related to insulin sensitivity (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Indeed, some studies showed sustained beneficial effects of acipimox treatment on plasma NEFA and insulin sensitivity (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). A major shortcoming of these studies, however, is that the last dose of acipimox was given on the morning of the test days, making it impossible to separate sustained effects from the acute effect of the last acipimox dose given. Indeed, even after treatment with acipimox four times daily for several weeks, a rebound increase in plasma NEFA levels can be observed (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Next to this rebound effect, acipimox is known to induce flushing in a large number of patients (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), which will limit the clinical relevance of acipimox for the treatment of insulin resistance and mitochondrial dysfunction and an urge for the development of alternative treatments to improve mitochondrial oxidative capacity. In that respect, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD<sup>+</sup>) precursors, such as nicotinamide riboside (NR) (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) or nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), have been reported to improve oxidative metabolism in animal models. NR or NMN supplementation in mice resulted in elevated NAD<sup>+</sup> levels, sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) activation, and beneficial adaptation in mitochondrial gene expression profiles (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Longer-term NR or NMN supplementation in mice fed a high-fat diet additionally improved mitochondrial function and metabolic health (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Furthermore, NR did not activate the GPR109A receptor, which is responsible for the flushing observed with acipimox treatment (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>).</p><p>So far, NR and NMN have not been tested for efficacy or safety in human clinical trials or for effects on mitochondrial metabolism. However, besides the known effects of acipimox on lipolysis, acipimox is also an NAD<sup>+</sup> precursor. Because both NR/NMN and acipimox are NAD<sup>+</sup> precursors and acipimox is already available for clinical use in humans, we examined the potential for such NAD<sup>+</sup> precursors in improving mitochondrial function in humans. To this end, in this proof-of-concept study, we treated T2D patients with acipimox for 2 weeks and examined the sustained effects on mitochondrial metabolism in detail. To rule out the acute lipid-lowering effects of the last dose of acipimox, patients underwent measurements after an overnight fast, omitting acipimox in the morning.</p><p>We found that despite an anticipated rebound effect on plasma NEFA levels, acipimox has pronounced effects in vivo, ex vivo, and in cell culture experiments on mitochondrial function comparable to the effects of other NAD<sup>+</sup> precursors, such as NR and NMM, as found in animals. These results suggest a strong potential for novel, safe NAD<sup>+</sup> precursors to boost mitochondrial function in humans.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Research Design and Methods</title><p>In the present multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial, 21 patients with T2D were included (10 from the Maastricht University Medical Center and 11 from the German Diabetes Center in D&#x000fc;sseldorf) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). All T2D patients were treated with placebo (celluose mycrocrystal PH 102) and acipimox (250 mg three times daily) for 2 weeks each in random order. Between interventions, a 4-week washout period was maintained. During both 2-week intervention periods, patients were asked to stop their oral glucose-lowering medication. At the end of both 2-week periods, patients were provided with a standardized meal the day before the clamp test. Patients were also advised to refrain from physical exercise 3 days before the test days.

After completion of the permeabilization protocol, muscle fibers were transferred into ice-cold mitochondrial respiration buffer (MiR05; OROBOROS Instruments). Subsequently, mitochondrial function ex vivo was determined by measuring oxygen consumption polarographically using a two-chamber Oxygraph (OROBOROS Instruments). Oxygen consumption, or oxygen flux, reflects the first derivative of the oxygen concentration (nmol/mL) in the respiration chambers (pmol/s/mg) corrected for muscle tissue wet weight (2&#x02013;5 mg). To evaluate mitochondrial oxidative capacity, different substrate protocols were applied.

Unbiased GSEA showed a robust and significant enrichment for energy metabolism in acipimox-treated patients. In particular, acipimox treatment resulted in a highly significant enrichment of genes involved in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and electron transport chain (ETC), suggesting a specific effect of acipimox on mitochondrial metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4<italic>A</italic></xref>). In fact, of all predefined gene sets, only those directly related to mitochondrial metabolism were significantly enriched (familywise error rate, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). However, no predefined gene sets specifically address NAD<sup>+</sup> metabolism, so we examined a custom-designed gene set comprising genes known to be induced upon treatment with other compounds that boost cellular NAD<sup>+</sup> content, such as NR (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) and Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>).

This imbalance will lead to the induction of the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPR<sup>mt</sup>), an adaptive and hermetic signaling pathway that ultimately repairs and improves mitochondrial function and metabolic health in animal models ranging from the nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> to the mouse (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). In a subset of subjects, we examined the presence of mitonuclear protein imbalance and UPR<sup>mt</sup>. Acipimox treatment tended to increase the ratio of MTCO1 (an mtDNA-encoded ETC protein) and SDHA (an nDNA&#x02013;encoded ETC component) protein content (MTCO1/SDHA 0.26 &#x000b1; 0.19 vs. 0.75 &#x000b1; 0.30 for placebo vs. acipimox treatment, <italic>P</italic> = 0.07) and increased protein content of the mitochondrial chaperone HSP60, which is induced during UPR<sup>mt</sup> (0.54 &#x000b1; 0.36 vs. 1.14 &#x000b1; 0.15 for placebo vs. acipimox, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4<italic>D</italic></xref>). To further investigate whether acipimox has a direct effect on muscle mitonuclear protein imbalance, we used differentiated C2C12 cells incubated with acipimox or an empty vehicle. First, we confirmed that acipimox is able to increase NAD<sup>+</sup> levels in muscle cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5<italic>A</italic></xref>). Next, 24-h incubation of C2C12 cells with 10 mmol/L acipimox increased HSP60 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5<italic>B</italic></xref>) and the MTCO1/SDHA ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5<italic>C</italic></xref>).

FCCP-driven maximal state U respiration was increased upon acipimox, mimicking the results observed in the muscle biopsy specimens obtained from the T2D participants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5<italic>D</italic></xref>). Together, the data obtained in C2C12 cells strengthen the concept that acipimox, as an NAD<sup>+</sup> precursor, has direct effects on skeletal muscle mitochondrial respiration and metabolism independent of plasma NEFA levels.</p><fig id="F5" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Effect of acipimox on mitochondrial function in C2C12 cells. <italic>A</italic>: NAD<sup>+</sup> levels after 3 h of acipimox 10 mmol/L incubation in myotubes (<italic>n</italic> = 6). <italic>B</italic>: Evaluation of ATP5A, Uqcrc2, MTCO1, SDHA, and HSP60 protein levels in C2C12 cells 24 h after acipimox 10 mmol/L incubation.

Despite this rebound effect, acipimox still improved mitochondrial oxidative capacity and specifically activated a set of mitochondrial genes that overlaps with the gene sets induced by NAD<sup>+</sup> boosters, such as NR, NMN, and PARP inhibitors (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>), in animal studies. These changes were accompanied by a significant mitonuclear protein imbalance and the activation of the UPR<sup>mt</sup> in human muscle biopsy specimens and in cultured myotubes. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to demonstrate that as in animals treated with NAD<sup>+</sup> boosters (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>), UPR<sup>mt</sup> is present in humans. These data hence show that NAD<sup>+</sup> precursors activate mitochondrial metabolism in humans using similar signaling pathways as elucidated in a variety of model organisms from worms to mice. Furthermore, the present data urge testing of new NAD<sup>+</sup> precursors in human clinical trials that are devoid of the side effects observed after sustained acipimox treatment, such as flushing and a rebound rise in NEFA levels.</p><p>The observation of elevated NEFA levels and impaired insulin action contrasts some other studies that showed a long-term reduction of plasma NEFA concentrations by acipimox (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Two major differences exist between these studies and the present study. First, we administered acipimox three times a day (i.e., after every meal) according to clinical and medicinal guidelines, whereas other studies used a dosage of four times a day. Second, in all the previous studies, the last dose of acipimox was given on the test day just before blood sampling and experimental testing, which may obscure the sustained effects of acipimox and result in acute effects of a morning dose. Of note, it has been shown that acipimox treatment can lead to a rebound effect, with plasma NEFA rising in the morning, even with a dosage of four times a day (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Thus, it was shown that the administration of acipimox resulted in a sustained daytime rise in plasma NEFA, but did not change plasma NEFA concentrations over a 24-h period (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). This compensatory free fatty acid rise may be necessary to maintain energy production, which is interesting because mainly nocturnal concentrations of plasma NEFAs are elevated in T2D patients (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>), with insulin resistance being more pronounced in the morning than in the afternoon (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). Hence, the increase in plasma NEFA concentrations upon acipimox is most likely a reflection of a nocturnal rebound effect, which was more pronounced in the present study because we did not administer acipimox in the morning of the experimental test days. Thus, it is likely that previous reports on the effect of acipimox on plasma NEFA concentrations and insulin sensitivity actually reflect the remnant effect of the last dose taken rather than the prolonged treatment. Of note, the reduction in insulin sensitivity upon acipimox treatment in the present study was completely accounted for by a reduction in insulin-stimulated NOGD, whereas insulin-stimulated glucose oxidation was not affected by the elevated plasma NEFA levels with acipimox treatment, suggesting that acipimox prevented the decline in oxidative capacity normally observed with high NEFA levels.</p><p>In that respect, the rebound rise in plasma NEFA provides a model to study the direct effects of acipimox on mitochondrial function, independent of reduced plasma NEFA levels. We and others have previously shown that acute elevation of plasma NEFA may actually decrease mitochondrial biogenesis and function (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). In concert with a direct effect of the NAD<sup>+</sup> precursor acipimox on mitochondrial function, we observed that in humans, acipimox increased ex vivo mitochondrial oxidative capacity and ATP production despite the potential deleterious elevated plasma NEFA concentrations. A direct effect of acipimox on muscle mitochondrial oxidative capacity and ATP production was confirmed in C2C12 myotubes. Acipimox is a nicotinic acid analog and, thereby, can increase intracellular NAD<sup>+</sup> concentrations in skeletal muscle. Reports have shown that stimulation of the NAD<sup>+</sup> biosynthesis pathway through NR or NMN has beneficial effects on mitochondrial function (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Indeed, in C2C12 myotubes, acipimox had a direct effect on enhancing NAD<sup>+</sup> levels. Using an unbiased microarray approach, we also observed that acipimox had clear and significant effects on mitochondrial gene expression in skeletal muscle biopsy specimens from T2D participants. Most striking was the observation that acipimox induced a gene expression signature that was similar to that we observed previously when animals were treated long term with the NAD<sup>+</sup> boosters, such as NR (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) and PARP inhibitors (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Furthermore, we show that 2 weeks of acipimox treatment induced a mitonuclear protein imbalance both in cell culture and in ex vivo analysis, which is indicative of an activation of the UPR<sup>mt</sup>, a pathway that we recently showed to be involved in mediating the beneficial effects of NAD<sup>+</sup> on metabolic health (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, the present results show for the first time in humans that an NAD<sup>+</sup> precursor like acipimox activates mitochondrial metabolism in human skeletal muscle and induces a mitonuclear protein imbalance and UPR<sup>mt</sup>. This beneficial impact of acipimox on mitochondrial metabolism is all the more striking because it occurs despite the negative effects of acipimox on plasma NEFA levels and insulin sensitivity. These findings suggest that although acipimox itself may not be a suitable candidate, new NAD<sup>+</sup> precursors devoid of such side effects, such as NR and NMN, may potentially act as mitochondrial boosters. Human clinical trials with such agents are urgently needed given that interventions targeting mitochondrial function, such as caloric restriction (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>), exercise (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>), and resveratrol (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>), have been shown to be effective in improving metabolic health.</p><p>In conclusion, a 2-week intervention with clinical dosages of acipimox led to a rebound rise in plasma NEFA concentration, which negatively affected insulin sensitivity. Regardless of this negative effect, skeletal muscle mitochondrial oxidative capacity and ATP production improved, most likely through alterations in NAD<sup>+</sup> levels and activation of mitochondrial metabolism and the UPR<sup>mt</sup>. Future research is needed to investigate the safety and efficacy of NAD<sup>+</sup> precursors to boost mitochondrial function and improve metabolic health in human subjects, such as T2D patients.</p></sec>
