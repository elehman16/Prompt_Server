Analgesics have some side effects and there are individual differences in their effects, so non-pharmacological methods may attract some attention.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>Cold application is a non-pharmacological pain-relieving method. It has been utilized for years.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Regarding the activity of inflammatory enzymes rises with increasing temperatures.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Ice is believed to help control pain by inducing local anesthesia around the treatment area. Investigators have also shown that it decreases edema, cellular metabolism, and local blood flow.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] The main beneficial effect of cold during recovery is the cold-related vasoconstriction that may limit vessel permeability and thus inflammatory processes, reducing muscle pain.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Based upon this framework, also, based on laboratory and clinical studies, cold decreases the nerve conduction velocity and increases the pain threshold.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Several studies have shown a decrease in peripheral blood flow caused by different methods of application of cold.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] The reasons put forward to explain this decrease in blood flow are vasoconstriction caused by the sympathetic nervous system reflex and the affinity caused by the cold of the postjunctional alpha-2 receptors of the vessel walls. The result of the two factors referred to above is a reduction in the activity of the noradrenaline enzymatic metabolites, an increase in blood viscosity, the activation of the platelet aggregates that release 5HT and thromboxane A2.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</p><p>Relaxation is another non-pharmacological technique in pain management keeping in mind that anxiety can cause pain and pain also can cause anxiety.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Relaxation is defined as the absence of physical, mental, emotional tension, and can assist in the management of pain both physiologically and psychologically. Physiologically, relaxation leads to a reduction in or reversal of the sympathetic response to pain leading to a decrease in oxygen consumption, blood pressure, heart rate, and respiration. Psychologically, distraction is a built-in component of relaxation and impacts pain management by decreasing the cognitive awareness of pain.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>Considering the importance of pain management as the highest nursing priority, there is no consensus about controlling pain following CTR.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] While the usual way to pain management is prescription of analgesics but research has showed that despite of using analgesics and anesthetics, CTR is still painful.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] In addition, pharmacological methods are costly and may leads to complications.</p><p>There have been few studies about the effectiveness of cold application and relaxation, which achieved contradictory results. In addition, there is no research about comparing these methods on pain owing to CTR. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the effectiveness of relaxation and cold therapy on the patient's pain severity after CTR. Based on aim of study the following research questions considered:</p><p>Is relaxation would be effective in pain reducation after CTR preoperative bypass surgery?</p><p>Is cold therapy would be effective in pain reducation after CTR preoperative bypass surgery?</p><p>Which method works better in pain reduction (cold therapy-relaxation)?</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Approval for the study obtained from the relevant ethics committee at the University of Mazandaran, Sari, Iran. Before the beginning of the study, written informed consent was obtained from each patient.</p><p>This randomized, observer-blind, prospective experimental study was conducted during February-March 2013 in the Mazandaran Heart Center. The subjects include 80 patients underwent open heart surgery. The sample size was determined based on a similar study[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] with a 0.99% confidence coefficient. Based on mean and standard deviation of pain intensity immediately after CTR in experimental and control groups, respectively, 3.85 &#x000b1; 1.75, and 5.6 &#x000b1; 1.94, the sample size was calculated 30 in each group (intervention and control) that according to effect size of 1.33 the samples increased to 40 in each group.</p><p>Data collection tools included a demographic questionnaire and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) to evaluate pain. VAS comprised a 100-mm baseline that is indicative a continuum with the ends marked &#x0201c;0 = no pain&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;100 = unbearable pain&#x0201d;.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] Reliability and validity of this scale is approved internationally.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] Various researches have used this scale to rate pain severity in patients underwent CABG surgery.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</p><p>Inclusion criteria included: Willingness to participate, upper 18-years old, full consciousness, ability to understand visual analog pain scale, first-time experience with CABG and chest tube, BMI less than 30 kg/m<sup>2<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> and having two chest tubes for 24 hours at least (one mediastinal tube and one left pleural). Exclusion criteria included unwillingness to participate, oversensitivity to cold, received mechanical ventilation support, visual or auditory defects, received opioid analgesic during less than 4 hours before intervention and drug dependency.</p><p>On the first day after operation, the researcher offered some explanation about the procedure to patients eligible to participate in study. Patients randomly were assigned to groups by Rand between function in Excel software (this function used to generate random numbers). As the participants in the study had two chest tubes, the act of assignment in intervention groups was done twice (one assignment for each tube). The case group was divided to seven bulks comprising 6 cases and within each bulk 6 cards were divided to 1-2 then randomly selected (three indicated by cod[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] for left pleural cold therapy- mediastinal relaxation and three cod number[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] considered for left pleural relaxation- mediastinal cold therapy). So each chest tube of patient assigned in one group and finally patients were divided randomly in the groups of cold therapy, relaxation, or control.</p><p>After the first assignment, the subjects were taught to rate the pain intensity by using VAS and got enough information about CTR procedure. In addition, we presented some information about cold application and relaxation for experimental groups that was repeated just before the CTR process.</p><p>All above procedures are supervised by a physician. For every group subjects&#x02019; all tight clothes were loosened, they were placed in semi-fowler position and a pillow was set below their head and knees in order to ensure their comfort. The usual intervention, as used for the control group, was nothing more than acetaminophen pills each 6 hours. All subjects received the intervention. In cold therapy group, cooling gel packs with 0&#x000b0;C temperature (made in Iranian Bespar Javidan Ghostar company) was used to reduce the body temperature around the chest tube during undressing. The bandage was removed from chest area and body temperature measured and recorded by an infrared thermometer at the same time by non-contact infrared thermometers UNI-T 912 (Hong Kong) then three cooling packs (8 &#x000d7; 10 cm) twisted in gauze was placed around the tube so that it would locate in the center. The packs would remain in their position, after 10 minutes till the temperature reached 13&#x000b0;C.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] At this moment, all packs were removed and the tube was exit according to the usual method. The temperature was recorded immediately and 15 minutes after extubation. According to the evidence, effectiveness of cooling treatments sustains around 30 minutes.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] There is no other evidence to confirm the effectiveness time duration for relaxation. Therefore, 1 hour after cooling therapy and extubation-related tube, the next tube extubated while patients exposed to relaxation technique. In the relaxation group, patients were encouraged to breathe calmly and deeply. In this exercise, they should inhale calm and deep through their nose and exhale calm through semi-closed lips, all with closed eyes for 15 minutes.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] The tube was removed after 5 minutes of exercising.</p><p>In control group, the tubes of the first patient were removed randomly with 1-hour intervals. Then the procedure was repeated for all patients in the control group as routine. The chest tubes in all groups were removed by the same nurse and procedure lasted on 1-2 minutes. The pain intensity was recorded by a nurse who trained to record VAS and was blind to the conducted different CTR procedure. The pain severity was recorded in three phases (before, immediately, and 15 minutes after CTR).</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>SPSS version 20 was used to analyse the recorded data. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize demographic characteristics of study participants. The analysis included all randomized participants for whom data were available (N = 90). To assess comparability of the study groups at baseline on sociodemographic and pain levels, we used t-test (for continued and ordinal variables) and Chi-square (for categorical variables). To compare the two study groups on the outcome and process measures overtime we fit multiple marginal linear regression analysis. Since the self-reported pain was measured repeatedly overtime (before intervention, immediately after removing and after 15 minutes), the generalized estimating equations method for longitudinal data was applied to adjust the standard errors of the regression coefficient estimates. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) employed to adjust for possible correlation over the assessment time points by controlling for baseline values of the dependent variable examined. The independent variables considered in the regression analysis were delivered treatments in two groups. A <italic>P</italic> value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>Results</title><p>The subjects&#x02019; mean old age was 58.11 &#x000b1; 9.53 (control group 58.48 &#x000b1; 9.78 and experimental group was 57.75 &#x000b1; 9.38).

According to our findings, pain severity of cold application group at phase 3 (15 minutes after extubing) was lower than the control group. This is also consistent with Mazloum and Demir's results. The results similarity could be due to full covering of ice packs into the tubes nearby areas. Sauls, on the other hand, reported the cold application as a not very efficient method to relieve pain at just after and 15 minutes later phases.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] The shape of ice packs, cold therapy duration (10 minutes), or sample size could account for these differences.</p><p>Cold gel packs used in our study were flexible so that they cover around tubes easily and lead to effective cooling around the tissue. Research showed that physiological effects of cold therapy appear when it continues for 20 minutes or temperature tube surrounding skin decreases to 13&#x000b0;C or less.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] Our results showed that pain severity in phase two (just immediatly after CTR) was considerably lower in relaxation group than control group. It is consistent with Friesner <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] In another study the relaxation method was not recognized as an effective way to reduce CTR-related pain.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Apparently these contradictory results could be explained with shorter breathing exercise before CTR, and smaller sample size in Houston's work.</p><p>We found no significant difference between relaxation and control groups in phase 3 (15 min after extubation) regarding pain severity. This result is not consistent with Friesner's findings.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] It may be due to continuing relaxation exercise after CTR in his work. We did not find any significant difference between relaxation and cold application groups at phase 3. We could not find any published studies about relaxation or cold application effects on CTR induced pain after coronary artery bypass graft surgery, but there were some studies using these techniques to decrease pain after other surgeries such as muscular pain syndrome with delayed onset,[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] labor pain,[<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and blood injection for thalassemia patients.[<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] The overall results indicate a beneficial outcome to pain and pain management.</p><p>Our results indicate a relatively equal effect of cold therapy and relaxation on CTR-related pain after coronary artery bypass grafting. As the relaxation requires any expense, it could be a preferred technique for managing pain in CTR patients.</p><p>This study was done on a relatively small sample, so the findings could not be generalized without caution. Repeating these findings with a bigger sample size and for the other patients experiencing any king of chest tubes could be useful in order to a comprehensive conclusion. Comparing the other nonpharmacological ways of controlling pain could also develop our knowledge and may propose some cheaper and more effective ways of pain management.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>This paper is a result of a dissertation submitted to award master degree on critical care nursing.
