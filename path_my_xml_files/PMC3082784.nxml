Regional anaesthesia is mostly preferred for CS and it is advantageous in the early postoperative period due to residual analgesia. On the other hand, general anaesthesia is also used, which necessitates intramuscular or intravenous analgesics, including opioid drugs. Opioid drugs are effective in reducing postcaesarean pain but side effects such as nausea, vomiting and sedation limit their use.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT1">1</xref></p><p>Childbirth is an emotion-filled event and the mother needs to bond with her newborn as early as possible. Any intervention that leads to improvement in pain relief is worthy of investigation.

Exclusion criteria were as follow: preeclampsia, eclampsia, renal, hepatic or cardiac disorders, a history of allergy to the study drugs, a history of chronic pain and chronic analgesic usage or any infection on the nerve block area.</p><p>Patients were premedicated with 150 mg ranitidine or 20 mg famotidine orally the night before and thirty minutes prior to induction of anaesthesia, the patient received 30 ml of sodium citrate 0.3 mol.L <sup>&#x02212;1</sup>orally. Standard monitoring including ECG, pulse- oximetry and non- invasive blood pressure were applied to each patient in the operating room. Uterine displacement was achieved by tilting the operating table to the left. After insertion of a wide-bore intravenous (iv) canule, the patient&#x02019;s fluid defisit was calculated to be replaced over 3 hours with lactated Ringer&#x02019;s solution and maintenance fluid was calculated according to patients&#x02019; weight. Following 5 minute of pre-oxygenation, rapid sequence of induction was performed with thiopental 4 mg kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and 1 mg kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> rocuronium intravenously. Cricoid pressure was performed from loss of consciousness to confirmation of tracheal cuffed tube position. After tracheal intubation, the patients&#x02019; lungs were ventilated with desflurane 3% and nitrous oxide 50% in oxygen, maintaining endtidal carbon dioxide (ETCO<sub>2</sub>) between 30 and 35 mmHg. Fentanyl iv 1 &#x003bc;g kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> was administered for intraoperative analgesia after the clamping of the umblical cord.</p><p>Patients were randomly allocated into two equal groups after induction of general anaesthesia with a closed envelope technique. After antagonization of the neuromuscular block with iv neostigmine 0.04 mg kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and 0.02 mg kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> atropine, before extubation, II-IH nerve block was performed in group I (II-IH block) and patients received a sham block with saline at the corresponding puncture site in group II (sham block). The study solutions were prepared by one of the researchers who was not involved in the study. All blocks were performed by the same author in the study who was blinded to the used drugs, using the technique described by Bell et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT8">8</xref> Approximately 2 cm medial and superior point of the anterior superior iliac spine was marked. A 22G needle was advanced to the skin and after piercing the external oblique fascia, one sixth of 10 ml of 5% ropivacaine (Naropin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, AstraZeneca AB, S&#x000f6;dertalje, Sweden) was injected after a negative aspiration test. Then the needle was advanced until the loss of resistance was felt between internal oblique muscle and transverse muscle. Another one sixth of the local anaesthetic solution was injected. The needle was withdrawn and this procedure was repeated by changing the needle to medially and then laterally at angles of 15&#x000b0; at the same horizontal plane in a fanlike pattern. The same procedure was performed on the contralateral side and a total volume of 20 ml of local anaesthetic was administered for both sites of injection. Sham block with same amount of saline was performed using the technique described by Bell et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT8">8</xref> in the sham block group.</p><p>At the end of the operation the trachea was extubated and all patients were transferred to the post- anaesthesia care unit (PACU). At the PACU, pain and its intensity was assessed by an anaesthesiologist unaware of the group assignment when patients have been conscious and have communicated verbally. All patients received intravenous tramadol via patient controlled analgesia (PCA) pump for postoperative analgesia at the PACU. PCA device was set to deliver a 50 mg loading dose of tramadol with a bolus dose of 25 mg and a lock out time of 15 minutes and 4 hour limit of 300 mg. Pain was assessed at rest and with movement (turning from side to side) by using visual analogue scale (VAS) ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 cm (intolerable pain) at the PACU in 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 16, 20, 24 hours postoperatively. Patients who had a VAS of 3 or more in spite of iv- tramadol PCA (throughout the study period) received 0.5 mg kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> iv meperidin as a rescue analgesia. At the same time intervals; heart rate, blood pressure and respiratory rate were assesed. Adverse events such as nausea and vomiting and sedation were also recorded at the same time intervals. Nausea was defined as an unpleasant feeling associated with inclination to vomit, and vomiting was defined as the forceful ejection of gastric contents through the mouth. Retching was also recorded as vomiting. Patients who had nausea and vomiting received iv 10 mg metoclopramide. Sedation was assessed using a 4- point scale (0 = fully awake, 1 = awake but drowsy, 2 = sleeping, but arousable by light thouch or speech, 3 = sleeping, not arousable).</p><p>At the end of the study, total tramadol consumption and rescue analgesia requirements were also recorded.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title/><sec id="sec3-1"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Primary end point of the study was to evaluate 30% decrease in analgesic consumption between the two groups at estimated time intervals postoperatively. A sample size of at least 25 patients per group was required to detect this difference with a power of 90% at the 5% significance level. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software (Statistical Package for Social Sciences) for Windows, version 11.5. Data are presented as mean and standard deviation. Means were compared by using Student&#x02019;s t or Mann Whitney U tests, where appropriate. Chi- square or Fisher&#x02019;s Exact tests were used for categorical comparisons.

Sensory innervation of L1-L2 dermatoms is accomplished by ilioinguinal and iliohypogastric nerves.

An explanation may be the inhibition of the body&#x02019;s adaptive responses to that pain caused by central or peripheral nerve blocks placed after the onset of a painful stimulus. As a result, when the local anaesthetic effects wane, the returning, unmodulated pain, is more severe than when the patient had received no anaesthetic intervention.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT11">11</xref> In contrast to hypothesis explained above, Bell et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT8">8</xref> reported significantly reduced amount of iv morphine use by the ilioinguinal-iliohypogastric nerve block (performed after wound closure) in patients during the 24 hour following caesarean delivery. In the present study concordant results with Bell et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT8">8</xref> were obtained; patients who received II-IH nerve block after surgical intervention revealed lower pain scores than control group. Also consumption of tramadol of the patients with the II-IH block were found to be apparently low for the first postoperative day.</p><p>Ilioinguinal and iliohypogastric nerve block had been performed with ropivacaine in numerous studies.

That&#x02019;s because the present study focused only on the efficacy of II-IH block performed after surgery and it was not prefered to perform II-IH nerve block before caesarean delivery because of the difficult manipulation of the block in the area of the gravid uterus. Another reason was to avoid prolongation of time between anaesthesia induction and uterus incision and effect on fetus. Further, obvious differences in the VAS scores at all estimated time intervals between the II-IH block group and sham block group could not be obtained. Especially at admission to PACU, it was expected that the VAS scores in II-IH block group to be lower than in sham block group but this was not observed. It is believed that this may be due to the early assessment of pain and the block needed much time to work. Also, lack of assesment of pain in shorter duration of time intervals at PACU may have contributed to the minimal differences between groups in VAS scores at the early period. For further time intervals, adequate analgesia, that is provided by the PCA pump and rescue analgesic medication in the sham block group, may explain the lack of significant differences in VAS scores throughout the study period.</p><p>The analgesic effects of weak opioids are reported to be equivalent to potent opioids when used intravenously for PCA with less side effects.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT19">19</xref> Tramadol has been used extensively in the adult surgical population and is known to be safer regarding respiratory depression.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT20">20</xref> But side effects such as nausea and vomiting are common in clinical application due to the opioid agonist effect of tramadol.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT21">21</xref> Although tramadol use was found to be higher in sham block group, no statistically difference was detected in postoperative nausea and vomiting in this study. This may be because of the small sample size but it is considered that this might be because of the application of intravenous tramadol via PCA device instead of intermittent high bolus doses for postoperative analgesia.</p><p>Pharmacokinetically, breast milk is supposed to be a separate compartment into which the drug is excreted- mainly by passive diffusion. It is estimated that 0.1% of the administered dose of tramadol passes into breast milk.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT22">22</xref> At the end of the present study total tramadol consumption was found to be 331 &#x000b1; 82 mg in the II-IH block group, and 622 &#x000b1; 107 mg kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> in the sham block group. It was examined that in the early postoperative hours the tramadol usage in II-IH group was very lower than the sham group. This significantly reflects the efficacy of II-IH nerve block especially on early postoperative pain.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-4"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The application of II-IH nerve block is considered to be advantageous after CS operations regarding the unwanted effects of analgesics that passes into breast milk in newborns. By this technique, the dose of tramadol passing into breast milk is lessened as total systemic analgesic dose is reduced.</p><p>In the present study it was observed that II-IH nerve block, performed after CS operations under general anaesthesia, increased the quality of pain control in the postoperative period and apparently decreased the consumption of tramadol. Therefore it is advocated that II-IH nerve block, performed after the operation, is a preferrable technique for the pain control after CS.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interests</bold></p><p>Authors have no conflict of interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; Contributions</bold></p><p>MS, AC, HYU ad HB carried out the design and coordinated the study.
