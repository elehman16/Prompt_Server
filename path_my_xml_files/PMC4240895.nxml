Although a number of evidence-based treatments for BPD are currently available, they are not widely disseminated; furthermore, there is a need for more research concerning their efficacy and cost-effectiveness. Such knowledge promises to lead to more efficient use of resources, which will facilitate the effective dissemination of these costly treatments. This study focuses on the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of Mentalization-Based Treatment (MBT), a manualized treatment for patients with BPD. Studies to date have either investigated MBT in a day hospitalization setting (MBT-DH) or MBT offered in an intensive outpatient setting (MBT-IOP). No trial has compared the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of these MBT programmes. As both interventions differ considerably in terms of intensity of treatment, and thus potentially in terms of efficacy and cost-effectiveness, there is a need for comparative trials. This study therefore sets out to investigate the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of MBT-DH versus MBT-IOP in patients with BPD. A secondary aim is to investigate the association between baseline measures and outcome, which might improve treatment selection and thus optimize efficacy and cost-effectiveness.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>A multicentre randomized controlled trial comparing MBT-DH versus MBT-IOP in severe BPD patients. Patients are screened for BPD using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis II Personality Disorders, and are assessed before randomization, at the start of treatment and 6, 12, 18, 24, 30 and 36&#x000a0;months after the start of treatment. Patients who refuse to participate will be offered care as usual in the same treatment centre. The primary outcome measure is symptom severity as measured by the Brief Symptom Inventory. Secondary outcome measures include parasuicidal behaviour, depression, substance use, social, interpersonal, and personality functioning, attachment, mentalizing capacities, and quality of life. All analyses will be conducted based on the intention-to-treat principle. Cost-effectiveness will be calculated based on costs per quality-adjusted life-year.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This multisite randomized trial will provide data to refine criteria for treatment selection for severe BPD patients and promises to optimize (cost-)effectiveness of the treatment of BPD patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.trialregister.nl/trialreg/admin/rctview.asp?TC=2292">NTR2292</ext-link>.

The inability to mentalize, particularly in emotional interactions, is considered to be one of the key problems in BPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Mentalizing refers to &#x0201c;the mental process by which an individual implicitly and explicitly interprets the actions of himself and others as meaningful on the basis of intentional mental states such as personal desires, needs, feelings, beliefs, and reasons&#x0201d; ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], p21). Patients with BPD typically suffer from severe impairments in this capacity, resulting in emotional instability, impulsive behaviour, and vulnerability in interpersonal and social interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Severe BPD patients almost invariably show high psychiatric comorbidity, particularly depression, anxiety or eating disorders, substance abuse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], various other personality disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and high levels of acting-out (e.g., suicidality) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. BPD is also associated with seriously impaired quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] and a high economic burden of disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Lifetime risk for completed suicide associated with BPD is up to 10% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Together, these findings emphasize the need for the development and dissemination of effective treatments for this severe disorder.</p><p>Psychotherapy is considered to be the treatment of choice for BPD patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Several guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] recommend outpatient psychotherapy such as Transference Focused Psychotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], Dialectical Behaviour Therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], Schema-Focused Therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], and Mentalization-Based Treatment (MBT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] for BPD.</p><p>This study focuses on MBT. MBT, which was developed by Bateman and Fonagy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] in the United Kingdom, is a promising evidence-based treatment that has its roots in attachment theory. The aim of MBT is to help patients develop an increasingly robust mentalizing process within everyday interpersonal interactions. A day hospital MBT (MBT-DH) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] and an intensive outpatient MBT (MBT-IOP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] programme have been developed and empirically evaluated. Although the programmes are similar in length (18&#x000a0;months, consisting of a 12&#x000a0;month treatment and 6&#x000a0;months maintenance phase), they differ markedly in intensity, particularly with regard to the role of group therapy. The treatment phase of MBT-DH consists of a five days per week day hospital treatment that comprises daily group psychotherapy, weekly individual psychotherapy, individual crisis management from a mentalizing perspective, art therapy twice a week, mentalizing cognitive therapy, and writing therapy. MBT-IOP consists of group psychotherapy once a week, weekly individual psychotherapy, and individual crisis management from a mentalizing perspective.</p><p>Both treatment programmes have been empirically evaluated in randomized controlled trials (RCTs), but none of these trials has directly compared MBT-IOP and MBT-DH. In a first trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], 38 BPD patients were randomized to either MBT-DH or treatment as usual (TAU). TAU consisted of standard treatment offered in the UK in general psychiatric services and consisted of (a) regular psychiatric review with a senior psychiatrist when necessary (on average twice a month), (b) inpatient admission when necessary, with discharge to nonpsychoanalytic psychiatric partial hospitalization focusing on problem solving, followed by (c) outpatient and community follow-up as standard aftercare [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Results after 18&#x000a0;months showed that MBT-DH was superior to TAU on all major outcome variables; that is, depressive symptoms, suicide attempts and self-harm, number of inpatient days, and social and interpersonal functioning. These results were maintained during an additional 18-month follow-up period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. At 5-year follow-up after discharge, the MBT-DH group showed further improvements on suicidality, diagnostic status, service use, use of medication, global functioning scores above 60 (Global Assessment of Functional Scale; GAF) and vocational status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. For example, whereas 74% of the patients in the TAU condition made at least one suicide attempt, only 23% in the MBT-DH group did so. At the end of the follow-up period, 13% of the MBT-DH patients met diagnostic criteria for BPD, compared with 87% of the TAU group. This trial also yielded data concerning health costs. Before treatment, the total health-related costs for the MBT-DH group ($44,947) and the TAU group ($52,563) were comparable; after 18&#x000a0;months of treatment, costs were reduced to $27,303 in MBT-DH and $30,976 in TAU. During the 18-month follow-up, costs further diminished sharply in the MBT group. At 18-month follow-up, the total health-related costs in the MBT-DH group were one-fifth of costs for patients in the TAU condition ($3,183 for MBT-DH versus $15,490 for TAU) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. However, this study did not include a formal cost-effectiveness analysis.</p><p>Two other studies provide further support for the efficacy of MBT-DH. An RCT in Denmark investigated the efficacy of MBT-DH compared with a less intensive manualized supportive group therapy combined with psychoeducation and medication treatment in patients diagnosed with BPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. In total, 58 patients were randomly allocated to MBT-DH and 27 patients to the specialist combined treatment. Results showed that both MBT-DH and the less intensive supportive group therapy led to significant improvements on a variety of psychological and interpersonal measures, e.g., general functioning, depression, social functioning and number of diagnostic criteria for BPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], with moderate to large effect sizes (<italic>d</italic> = 0.5 to 2.1). MBT-DH was superior only on therapist-rated GAF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] after two years of treatment. No follow-up or cost-effectiveness data are yet available from this trial. A naturalistic effectiveness study in the Netherlands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] investigated the effectiveness of 18-month, manualized MBT-DH in 45 patients with severe BPD and high comorbidity in terms of Axis I and Axis II disorders. Results showed significant improvements in symptomatic distress, social and interpersonal functioning, and personality pathology and functioning; with moderate to large effect sizes (<italic>d</italic> = 0.7 to 1.7). In addition, the Netherlands study showed that care consumption reduced significantly during and after treatment. However, the lack of a control group limits the ability to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of MBT-DH.</p><p>Finally, with regard to MBT-IOP, an RCT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] showed that this less intensive treatment programme was more effective than structured clinical management in an RCT with 134 BPD patients. Substantial improvements were observed in both treatment conditions across all outcome variables. However, the MBT-IOP group showed a steeper decline on both self-reported and clinically significant problems, including suicide attempts and hospitalization. Cost analyses were not included in this trial.</p><p>As noted, a &#x02018;head to head&#x02019; cost-effectiveness trial directly comparing MBT-IOP with MBT-DH has not yet been conducted. An indirect comparison between MBT-DH and MBT-IOP based on the UK trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] is hampered by pretreatment patient differences; with the patients in the MBT-DH trial evidencing substantially higher levels of symptomatic distress, depression and interpersonal problems (between-group difference <italic>d</italic> = 0.7 to 0.8). This stresses the need for a comparative trial that also compares the cost-effectiveness of MBT-DH and MBT-IOP, particularly as MBT-DH may be approximately twice as expensive as MBT-IOP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p><p>A further reason why a direct comparison trial is currently indicated relates to the current shift in psychotherapy research from the identification of effective treatments to the search for variables that might predict treatment response, with the hope of better matching patients to specific treatments (i.e., to identify &#x0201c;what works for whom&#x0201d;) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Various patient characteristics have been proposed and studied as predictors of treatment outcome with MBT. Furthermore, changes in mentalizing capacities and attachment have been proposed as mechanisms of change in MBT. Little is known, however, about predictors of treatment and mechanisms of change in the treatment of BPD patients, and with MBT in particular. Bateman and Fonagy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] found pretreatment severity, defined in terms of the number of personality disorders, to be a possible indicator for more favorable treatment outcomes in specialist treatment. No study to date has investigated purported mechanisms of change in MBT. The current trial therefore aims to identify potential predictors of response in both treatments with the aim to facilitate treatment selection and optimize (cost)-effectiveness. Furthermore, it aims to investigate mechanisms of change in both treatment programmes.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Research aims and hypotheses</title><p>The primary aim of the present study is to investigate the efficacy of MBT-DH in comparison to MBT-IOP. The primary outcome measure is symptom severity as measured by the Brief Symptom Inventory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Secondary outcome measures include parasuicidal behaviour, depression, substance use, social, interpersonal and personality functioning, attachment, mentalizing capacities, and quality of life. We expect that patients in both MBT-DH and MBT-IOP will improve, but that MBT-DH will outperform MBT-IOP because of its higher dosage.</p><p>A secondary aim is to investigate the cost-effectiveness of both treatments based on costs per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). We expect that the greater benefits of MBT-DH will not outweigh the lower costs of MBT-IOP. Therefore, we expect MBT-IOP to be more cost-effective than MBT-DH.</p><p>Third, we aim to explore the role of pretreatment variables in predicting treatment outcome in both interventions, with the aim to optimize treatment selection and thus (cost-)effectiveness.</p><p>Finally, this study aims to investigate whether MBT is associated with changes in mentalizing capacities and attachment and whether such changes predict treatment outcome.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Design</title><p>This study is a multisite RCT comparing the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of MBT-DH versus MBT-IOP in the treatment of BPD (see Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

NPI, GGZinGeest, and De Viersprong location Bergen op Zoom all agreed to provide two MBT-DH and two MBT-IOP groups. De Viersprong location Amsterdam and Lentis both agreed to provide one MBT-DH group and one MBT-IOP group. Before the actual start of the study, one of the participating centres (GGZinGeest) could no longer offer MBT-DH because of a reorganization of its clinical services, and accordingly withdrew from participating in the study. Due to implementation problems, NPI reduced its capacity to one MBT-IOP group and one MBT-DH group. De Viersprong location Amsterdam, however, has been able to expand its capacity to two MBT-DH groups and two MBT-IOP groups. Overall, NPI, De Viersprong (locations Bergen op Zoom and Amsterdam) and Lentis will provide a total of 6 MBT-DH and 6 MBT-IOP groups. The recruitment of patients began in January 2012 and ended in June 2014.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Ethics</title><p>The Medical Ethical Committee of Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, the Netherlands, has approved this study, registered under NL38571.078.12.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Participants and eligibility criteria</title><p>The target group consists of adult patients (18+) with BPD, consecutively referred for treatment by general practitioners, mental health care institutions, private practices and general hospitals.</p><sec id="Sec7"><title>Inclusion criteria for MBT treatment and for this study</title><p>Inclusion criteria are (a) a BPD diagnosis as assessed using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis II Personality Disorders (SCID-II) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], (b) 18&#x000a0;years or older, (c) adequate mastery of the Dutch language and (d) travel time to the MBT setting less than 1&#x000a0;hour.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Exclusion criteria for this study</title><p>Exclusion criteria for MBT are kept to a minimum because the treatment aims to reach a broad population of BPD patients. In this study, only patients with (a) a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorders, chronic psychotic disorder or organic brain disorder that interferes significantly with the ability to mentalize; (b) intellectual impairment (IQ &#x0003c;80 as measured by the Wechsler Adult Intelligent Scale&#x02013;III) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]; or (c) a diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder in combination with a history of severe physical violence are excluded. In addition, patients who have had a stable job for a period of at least 2&#x000a0;years for a minimum of 15&#x000a0;hours a week, and/or are caregivers with main responsibility for children under 4&#x000a0;years of age, are allowed to participate in the randomized study at their own choice. Because of ethical reasons (i.e. randomization to MBT-DH cannot be combined with a job or being the main carer for children because of the fixed time commitment involved), these patients were not seen as refusers, and were given the option to enter MBT-IOP directly.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Procedure</title><p>All patients referred to one of the mental health care centres are invited for a standard intake interview, which includes standardized assessment by means of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I disorders (SCID-I) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] and SCID-II [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. All patients eligible for MBT treatment (with a BPD diagnosis and aged &#x02265;18&#x000a0;years) are given both written and verbal information about the study. Eligible patients are given 1&#x000a0;week to consider participation in the trial. Patients who are willing to participate in the study are asked to sign an informed consent sheet and complete the baseline assessment. Next, they are randomized to either MBT-DH or MBT-IOP by an independent researcher using a computerized 1:1 algorithm. Patients are informed about their treatment allocation and placed on a waiting list. One week prior to start of the main treatment phase, and subsequently at 6-months intervals up to 36&#x000a0;months after the start of treatment, patients complete an assessment battery as described below. Patients who are excluded from the trial on the basis of exclusion criteria, or who refuse to participate in the trial, are ideally assigned to an alternative evidence-based treatment. Excluded and refusing patients are asked to complete the baseline assessment only, for which they sign a separate informed consent form. At 18 and 36&#x000a0;months, the SCID-I and SCID-II are re-administered by MSc-level psychologists. Extensive efforts are being made to collect data at the follow-up time points by means of an outreaching approach towards patients: patients are contacted by telephone, e-mail and letters (with reminders as necessary) to motivate them to attend assessments, and home visits are made if necessary.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Treatments</title><p>MBT was developed by Fonagy and Bateman in the United Kingdom [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. The term <italic>mentalizing</italic> refers to the ability to attend to mental states in ourselves and in others as we attempt to understand our own actions and the actions of others on the basis of intentional mental states. The aim of MBT as a therapy is to help patients develop an increasingly robust mentalizing process within the context of interpersonal interactions. Treatment begins with MBT-I, an introductory phase with psychoeducational elements. This is followed by a combination of individual and group therapy.</p><p>MBT works through continuously helping the patient to maintain or re-establish a mentalizing process while simultaneously stimulating the attachment system by balancing the level of optimal arousal. With a main focus on current rather than past experience, patients are encouraged to explore the mental states of themselves and others, to become curious about alternative perspectives, to find out more about how they think and feel about themselves and how this influences their behaviour, and how distortions in understanding themselves and others lead to problems in interpersonal functioning. The exploration and identification of emotions within multiple contexts, particularly interpersonal contexts, promotes the development of secondary representations to primary affective experiences. This enhances affect regulation and the development of a coherent sense of self. These elements form key components of mentalizing capacity. In this manner, the work in therapy addresses BPD patients' difficulties with affect, impulse regulation and interpersonal functioning. Destructive behaviour, which from an MBT perspective is understood as an attempt to maintain a sense of stability and manage incomprehensible feelings in the absence of a mentalizing capacity, is reduced as a consequence of the development of this capacity.

Specifically, therapists are asked to reflect on whether their interventions have enhanced mentalizing which interventions have not achieved this, and what alternative interventions might have been more successful.

The CTQ is administered only at the start of treatment (T1). The CTQ is a retrospective, self-report questionnaire that measures five categories of childhood trauma experience, including emotional, physical and sexual abuse as well as emotional and physical neglect. Each subscale is measured in 5 items rated on a 5-point Likert scale: (1) never true, (2) rarely true, (3) sometimes true, (4) often true, and (5) very often true. Each subscale score ranges from 5 (no history of abuse or neglect) to 25 (very extreme history of abuse and neglect). Cutoff scores are defined for none (or minimal) to low, low to moderate, moderate to severe and severe to extreme exposure. Moderate to severe cutoff scores were used to classify subjects as positive for a history of childhood trauma in a specific category. Cutoff scores are 13 or higher for emotional abuse, 10 or higher for physical abuse, 8 or higher for sexual abuse, 15 or higher for emotional neglect, and 10 or higher for physical neglect.

Moreover, in order to be able to compare effects between different interventions in health care, effects should be expressed in generic terms. We will therefore use QALYs and will express the cost-effectiveness of each intervention and the ratio between these cost-effectiveness estimates as cost per QALY.

One way of achieving this would be to use a Markov model to explore the long-term cost-effectiveness of the intervention under study.

Because in this trial the primary outcome measures, such as the BSI, are continuous measures, it will not be possible to create an unambiguous definition of health states to model disease progression. Using heterogeneous health states may be controversial, as it means that a wide range of patients may be clustered in one health state. In order to explore the cost-effectiveness of the interventions using a Markov model in our study, we will therefore define health states on the basis of a cut-off score on one of the outcome measures such as the BSI, in order to create discrete health stages. We will extend the cost-effectiveness model results after the duration of the trial using different assumptions based on, for example, the literature.

Second, this promises to be the first study that entails a state-of-the-art cost-effectiveness component for both MBT-DH and MBT-IOP. Given considerable differences in treatment intensity, and thus costs of the two treatment programmes, the results of this study promise to inform decisions not only concerning treatment referral, but also with regard to maximizing the use of health care resources in a climate of decreasing health expenditure. Another important goal of the final aim of the study, which focuses on predictors of change, is to provide information that will contribute to the optimization of treatment effects and health care resources. For instance, it may well be that both treatments have equal effectiveness and differ only in terms of cost. If this were the case, health care resources should be devoted to the less costly variant (probably MBT-IOP, due to its lower intensity). However, even if it is found that both treatments differ only in terms of their costs, there may still be a subgroup of patients that may need the more intensive intervention, MBT-DH, to derive benefit. In this scenario, MBT-DH would still be indicated as a cost-effective treatment in a subgroup of patients, and it would be crucially important to identify the features of this subgroup, to enable this intervention to be offered specifically to the patients who need this more intensive treatment format. Therefore, this study also aims to identify potential predictors of response to both MBT-IOP and MBT-DH, with the aim of facilitating treatment selection.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-list><def-item><term>APA</term><def><p>American Psychiatric Association</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BDI-I</term><def><p>Beck depression inventory</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BPD</term><def><p>Borderline personality disorder</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BSI</term><def><p>Brief symptom inventory</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CTQ</term><def><p>Childhood trauma questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ECR</term><def><p>Experiences in close relationships</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GAF</term><def><p>Global assessment of functioning</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GSI</term><def><p>Global severity index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICER</term><def><p>Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IIP-64</term><def><p>Inventory of interpersonal problems</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MATE</term><def><p>Measurements in the addictions for triage and evaluation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MBT</term><def><p>Mentalization-based treatment</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MBT-DH</term><def><p>Day hospital mentalization-based treatment</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MBT-I</term><def><p>Introductory course to mentalization-based treatment</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MBT-IOP</term><def><p>Intensive outpatient mentalization-based treatment</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PAI-BOR</term><def><p>Personality assessment inventory-borderline</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>QALY</term><def><p>Quality-adjusted life-year</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RCT</term><def><p>Randomized controlled trial</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RFQ</term><def><p>Reflective functioning questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RMET</term><def><p>Reading the mind in the eyes test</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SCID-I</term><def><p>Structured clinical interview for DSM-IV axis I personality disorders</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SCID-II</term><def><p>Structured clinical interview for DSM-IV axis II personality disorders</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SIPP-118</term><def><p>Severity indices of personality problems</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SSHI</term><def><p>Suicide and self-harm inventory</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TAU</term><def><p>Treatment as usual</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TiC-P</term><def><p>Trimbos and Institute for Medical technology assessment questionnaire on costs associated with psychiatric illness</p></def></def-item></def-list></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>EMPL drafted the first version of the manuscript and maintained the lead in the writing process.
