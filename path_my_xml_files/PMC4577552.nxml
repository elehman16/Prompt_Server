Using a rat model of acute kidney injury, subcapsular injection of placebo and rapamycin monodisperse microspheres (monospheres) was compared to subcutaneous injection, mimicking systemic administration.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We did not find any adverse effects related to the delivery method. Irrespective of the injection site, a similar low dose of rapamycin was present in the circulation. However, only local intrarenal delivery of rapamycin from monospheres led to decreased macrophage infiltration and a significantly lower amount of myofibroblasts in the kidney, where systemic administration did not.

Inadequate treatment of the inflammatory phase after AKI leads to an excessive wound healing response, resulting in the deposition of large amounts of collagen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>). This fibrotic response occurring after insufficient recovery from AKI will lead to end stage renal disease and finally to kidney failure. In this final stage patients require renal replacement therapy, such as dialysis or kidney transplantation, which is costly and in the long term insufficient. For that reason, a solution should be sought in an early intervention during the inflammatory phase, in order to prevent fibrosis. To investigate whether this is possible we used an AKI rat model to see whether we can control the hostile microenvironment of the kidney. Although rats and humans differ in their response toward AKI we hypothesize that controlling the microenvironment after damage can lead to a better outcome.</p><p>Current treatments after AKI are based on slowing down or controlling the conditions that eventually may lead to chronic kidney disease, and include medication to decrease blood pressure and / or cholesterol, to reduce swelling or to treat anemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>). After transplantation, oral medication needs to be taken in order to prevent rejection or inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>). These treatments are not focused on treating the damage caused in the kidney by ischemic stress or other factors. This means that, even when the cause of kidney disease is being treated, the process of kidney disease may be ongoing.</p><p>Site-specific release of therapeutic compounds by means of an injectable drug delivery vehicle allows for optimal therapeutic effect at the site of interest, while minimizing systemic loss and undesirable side effects of the drug in the rest of the body, as reviewed by Kumar <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>). Biodegradable microspheres (MSP) are interesting vehicles for this type of drug delivery due to their capacity to release drugs controllably with respect to duration and dosage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>). Previously we have examined the use of differently sized MSP, and hypothesized that monodisperse MSP (mMSP) of 30&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m diameter would be best suited for drug delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>). This technique also seems promising in the treatment of AKI, since mMSP can be injected subcapsularly, leading to local release directly into the kidney. We propose to deliver existing drugs against kidney disease, since these drugs are often difficult to dose, requiring frequent blood monitoring and dose adjustments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>) to reduce or prevent adverse effects. A more gradual release of drug released locally from mMSP may prevent high blood levels and thus prevent side-effects.</p><p>Rapamycin has been shown to reduce inflammation in kidney injury models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>). Based on these findings we now hypothesized that subcapsular delivery of rapamycin, using mMSP can modulate the renal microenvironment in an AKI model (ischemia/reperfusion injury, IRI) in rats.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Preparation of Placebo and Rapamycin-Loaded Monospheres</title><p>MSP were prepared using SynBiosys 20[PDLA-PEG1000]-80[PLLA], a multiblock copolymer consisting of 20% <italic>w/w</italic> of poly(DL-lactide)-PEG1000-poly(DL-lactide) with a molecular weight of 2000&#x000a0;g/mol and 80% <italic>w/w</italic> of poly(L-lactide) with a molecular weight of 4000&#x000a0;g/mol (InnoCore Pharmaceuticals, Groningen, The Netherlands).</p><p>Monodisperse MSP (monospheres, mMSP) were prepared by a membrane emulsification-based solvent extraction/evaporation process using an Iris-20 microsieve membrane with uniformly sized pores of 20&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m (Nanomi BV, Oldenzaal, The Netherlands).</p><p>For placebo (drug-free) mMSP approximately 3.0&#x000a0;g of 20[PDLA-PEG1500]-80[PLLA] polymer was dissolved in 9&#x000a0;mL dichloromethane (DCM, p.a. stabilized with EtOH, Across, Geel, Belgium) as to obtain a 20% <italic>w/w</italic> solution and filtered through a 0.2&#x000a0;mm PTFE filter.

The mMSP successfully released rapamycin in a time-dependent manner into the circulation and into the kidney. Both the subcutaneous as well as the subcapsular administration route resulted in very low systemic levels of rapamycin, with similar <italic>in vivo</italic> release patterns, suggesting that drug release from these mMSP is not altered by the injection site. Furthermore, the effects seen in the kidney were not due to prolonged exposure to low systemic drug levels, but specifically caused by the local depot, since the subcutaneous delivery route did not result in major alterations in kidney recovery after IRI. Injection at either site led to systemic rapamycin concentrations below therapeutic levels, which are approximately 5&#x02013;8&#x000a0;ng/ml in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>) and approximately 10&#x000a0;ng/ml in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>). Using identical doses of rapamycin, effects in the kidney were significantly more pronounced when the drug was delivered subcapsularly, than when it was delivered subcutaneously.</p><p>Notably, we still found detectable levels of rapamycin in blood 14&#x000a0;days after implantation of mMSP, although previous <italic>in vitro</italic> studies using similar mMSP indicated that all rapamycin would be released within 7&#x000a0;days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>). Since the reported half-life of rapamycin in rats is approximately 31&#x000a0;h (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>), the sustained blood levels are unlikely to be caused by circulating rapamycin. Therefore, other factors related to the release of rapamycin <italic>in vivo</italic> may be responsible for the presence of rapamycin up to at least 14&#x000a0;days after implantation of the mMSP. Falke <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>) also reported <italic>in vivo</italic> plasma levels of rapamycin 7&#x000a0;days after subcapsular implantation of mMSP to be below 2&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/L. At this time-point, using a different method, we found a rapamycin concentration in blood of 1.5&#x02013;2&#x000a0;nM (corresponding to 1.4&#x02013;1.8&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/L) which shows the levels in our study to be in accordance with previously published results.</p><p>A recent study also showed beneficial effects of subcapsular delivery of rapamycin in a unilateral ureteral obstruction model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>), which causes renal fibrosis. This study also found a significant decrease in side-effects after subcapsular administration, since they found a loss of bodyweight only in their control group, where we found no systemic side effects connected to either the rapamycin subcutaneous or subcapsular treatment. However, in the previous study subcapsular delivery was compared to daily i.p. injections of rapamycin, whereas our study used subcutaneous depots as a control, ensuring comparison of continuous delivery and avoiding peaks in blood rapamycin levels.</p><p>The method itself, consisting of the injection of mMSP underneath the kidney capsule (between capsule and cortex) has been refined compared to current subcapsular injections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>) and did not induce cortical damage at the site of implantation, or affect kidney function. Notably, in contrast to this earlier study, we performed implantation of mMSP in kidneys which also underwent IRI, showing that the procedure is safe in damaged kidneys as well.</p><p>Our results show that local subcapsular drug delivery of rapamycin in a model of IRI results in reduced macrophage and myofibroblast numbers. The question arises whether this decrease is due to reduced infiltration or reduced proliferation of macrophages. Although rapamycin has anti-proliferative effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>), Ki-67 staining within our experimental groups revealed no differences in cell proliferation in the kidney between any of the experimental groups. This suggests that local rapamycin delivery directly decreases macrophage influx or recruitment into the kidney, rather than inhibiting local proliferation. The decrease in myofibroblasts may be a secondary effect to the decrease in macrophages. It has been demonstrated that macrophages can produce highly fibrogenic growth factors such as transforming growth factor-&#x003b2; and platelet derived growth factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>). A decrease in the amount of macrophages could thus lead to a decrease in the cytokines that induce activation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts.</p><p>We hypothesized that an early intervention in the acute phase of the kidney injury would provide us with a valuable tool to inhibit the progression towards kidney fibrosis. In this study we succeeded in decreasing the inflammatory response, and we successfully reduced the amount of myofibroblasts in the kidney, which are considered to be the main collagen producing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>). However, this therapeutic effect did not result in decreased interstitial collagen deposition, but in an increase in collagen type I. A previous study reported that rapamycin may delay recovery after IRI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>), showing that normalization of GFR and proliferation of tubular epithelium occurred at a later time-point, but this study did not address collagen deposition. Possibly in the present study the delay in recovery is reflected in higher collagen levels in rapamycin-treated kidneys compared to those treated with placebo. In this respect, it may be notable that all rapamycin-treated groups showed a slight increase in blood creatinin levels, although this increase was only significant in rats implanted with mMSP subcutaneously, which did not show a significant increase in collagen. Macrophage and myofibroblast presence were determined based on expression of ED-1 and &#x003b1;-SMA respectively. These cell-type markers are conceivably more transient than collagen, once it is deposited. The discrepancy between high collagen levels and decreased &#x003b1;-SMA positive myofibroblasts may therefore also be explained if &#x003b1;-SMA myofibroblasts have decreased already, while collagen has not been cleared yet. Since matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are normally mostly produced by macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>), and macrophages were also decreased by rapamycin treatment in our study, it is possible that the deposited collagen was not cleared due to a lack of MMPs. However, an increased deposition of collagen by other cell types than myofibroblasts cannot be excluded based on our findings.</p><p>Rapamycin has previously been shown to directly induce autophagy in a variety of cell types in the kidney (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>). Autophagy is known as a cell survival process during starvation. However, whether this process is beneficial in the IRI model is currently under debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>). We used LC-3, a component of autophagosomes, as a marker for the induction of autophagy. We indeed observed a dramatic increase in autophagy in rats treated locally with rapamycin compared to systemic delivery. The increase in autophagy, regardless of its role in AKI, gives additional evidence for strong local inhibition of mTOR signaling after subcapsular delivery of rapamycin, suggesting higher local levels of rapamycin than those which were achieved after systemic delivery.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The main goal of this study was to investigate whether local delivery of rapamycin using subcapsular injection of mMSP would be superior compared to systemic delivery. Based on our results we conclude that subcapsular implantation of mMSP itself does not induce adverse effects. Furthermore, rapamycin was effectively released from the mMSP and increased drug effects were seen after local delivery compared to systemic delivery from a subcutaneous mMSP depot. Thus injection of drug-containing monospheres underneath the renal capsule is a safe and useful method to increase drug effectivity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec19"><supplementary-material id="Fig7" content-type="local-data"><media id="MO7" xlink:href="11095_2015_1700_Fig7_ESM.gif"><label>Figure 1S</label><caption><p>Effects of low-dose rapamycin after subcapsular delivery of rapamycin or placebo.
