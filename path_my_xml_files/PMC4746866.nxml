Base on this data, CVD is the most dangerous and fatal disease. As coronary artery disease (CAD) accounts for a high percentage of CVD, early diagnosis and treatment will lead to fewer complications and deaths.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] There are some experiments and diagnostic methods that are essential for the timely detection of heart diseases. One of the most common and important diagnostic methods is coronary angiography. This procedure is the gold standard for CAD diagnosis.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] After angiography, vascular complications (such as bleeding, hematoma, and distal emboli due to trauma caused in the artery wall) are the most common complications of catheterization. One of the measures of care taken to reduce these complications is taking complete or relative rest for 10 h or 24 h without moving the legs.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Although it is accepted by a majority of specialists, unsuitable position and excessive immobility in the bed after angiography cause patients to experience pain in their lower back. Lunden <italic>et al</italic>. conducted a qualitative study and assessed the patient's responses after angiography; finally, they realized that the pain is frequently reported following cardiac catheterization.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Pain is an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience that is created by an annoying stimulation of sensory nerve terminals.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Some studies indicate that intramuscular pressure in the lumbar muscles has a direct relation to their positions. Rest in an unchanged position for a long period of time leads to increased tissue pressure and decreased blood supply in the bedridden patient.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] In a parallel manner, activation of the sympathetic system and catecholamine release due to pain cause to increases blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate, and decreases respiratory volume (with a greater impact on tidal volume) and finally myocardial infarction.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>Thus, given the possibility of cardiovascular system involvement in the patient who undergoes angiography, the necessity of prevention and control of pain is very important; there is no scientific support for any current method,[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Therefore, changing the exhaustion intervention trial (EXIT) treatment method after angiography (which includes complete rest on the back and an unchanging position for a long period of time) and finding an optimal angle of bed to decrease the patient's backache and his/her dissatisfaction could lead to faster improvement and also decrease his/her period of hospitalization. The purpose of our investigation was to determine a suitable position for the patient during complete bed rest and for relieving his/her pain without increasing the probable coronary complications according to some vital signals that confirmed the best position.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>The present study was a clinical trial that was started in June 2013 and completed in December 2013. The sample of this study included all the patients who took to recourse to the angiography center of Imam Ali Hospital in Bojnurd, North Khorasan, Iran for whom nonemergency angiography was performed through the femoral artery based on specified indexes of angiography. The participants were randomly divided into five groups after considering the inclusion and exclusion criteria and obtaining the patients&#x02019; consents (which were approved by the ethics committee of the university). The first group was placed routinely in the supine position, quite straight and the head was not placed at any angle. In the second group, all the patients were placed in bed at a 15&#x000b0; upward angle; in the third group, all the patients were placed in bed at a 30&#x000b0; upward angle; in the fourth group, all the patients were placed in bed at a 45&#x000b0; upward angle; and in the fifth group, all the patients were placed in bed at a 60&#x000b0; upward angle. The mean of all mentioned angles is lumbosacral that performed for all patients. It was mentioned that the patients were in a supine position on bed and remained in the same position till the end. The sample study was determined 85 by considering means space and hypothesis of the same study (4) and mean deviations S<sub>1</sub> = 1.67 and S<sub>2</sub> = 1.22 and means X<sub>1</sub> = 2.32 and X<sub>2</sub> = 5.78 that in each group, was placed 17 persons. The method of block randomization was used. The exclusion criteria for this study included active bleeding caused by the cutter in the entrance area, existing coagulation disorders, relative time of thromboplastin more than 45 s, chronic back pain history, need for cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) during angiography, existing chest pain with new changes of electrocardiogram (ECG), using warfarin or antipain before the procedure, systolic blood pressure of more than 180 mmHg or diastolic pressure more than 100 mmHg, motion artifact, and consciousness that the patient could not cooperate for change in position. In all the groups, sand bag was placed on the bandage after angiography. Angiocatheter size 16 (gray) [Haryana, India] was used to access the right femoral artery for cauterization. It used the same contrast agent (VISIPAQUE injection 270 mg/20 mL) in a different volume. The cutter was the same in all the patients and it was Judkins series right, left, and pigtail that was used at 3.5, 4, 5, and 6 mm curvatures; also, the guide wire was used in 0.035 and 0.038 cm diameters. The duration of angiography was recorded from the entrance of the cutter into the femoral artery to its exit with a time variation of &#x000b1;30 s. In all the patients, vital signals were measured 30 min after completing the process that; the vital signs included blood pressure, percent of blood oxygen saturation, heart rate, respiratory rate, and temperature. The Timpani thermometer (Ontario L4Z. V4, Canada) was used for body temperature. The measurement of temperature was carried on only through one ear (right ear) for all of the patients. The other vital signals were measured by a monitoring device. The Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) was used to determine the pain intensity. This scale is a 10-cm horizontal line that is numbered from 0 to 10 (number 0 shows lack of pain and number 10 shows the severest possible pain). The patients were asked to determine the rate of the pain according to the line and numbers. The validity and reliability of this instrument has been evaluated in a similar study.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] The demographic variables included were age, gender, height, and weight.

The results showed a significant correlation between pain levels at different angles. The minimum pain was obtained at an angle of 45&#x000b0; and also vital signals such as heart rate, systolic blood pressure, and respiratory rate were significantly changed at different angles. It showed linear changes between pain and systolic blood pressure, respiratory rate and heart rate changes; also, a dramatic reduction was seen in these parameters at an angle of 45&#x000b0;. This study showed that 45&#x000b0; angle was the best position for the bed in order to reduce the patient's pain after the procedure based on his/her vital signals.</p><p>This finding indicates that the patient's recovery after coronary angiography in a flat position causes the experiencing of severe pain. Notably, after the procedure all patients remained in a fixed position of predetermined randomization till the end. Hence, time &#x02014; a likely cause of reducing the level of pain in various situations during successive survey &#x02014; in this study was under control. Another strong point of this study was the assessment of vital signals to confirm hemodynamic changes, which are related to the patient's pain. In various researches, the effect of changed position was investigated as a pain-reducing factor.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] In these studies, it was shown that change in position caused a significant reduction in pain intensity at different times after the procedure. Also, no significant difference was seen in the blood pressure and heart rate among the participants. This finding was not consistent with our results. However, the study by Adaryani <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] showed that blood pressure and heart rate in the control group were dramatically higher than the intervention group 6-8 h after catheterization. Increase in the pain level leads to increases in blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] This finding confirms the effect of catecholamine releasing and its positive impact on the quality of pain such as inotropic, chronotropic, and dromotropic effects on the heart rate and respiratory rate. Systolic blood pressure subsequently increased. In the present study, the most changing was happened between systolic blood pressure and pain. In our study, nonadherence pain increased by increasing the angle of the bed; as flat angle increased to 45&#x000b0;, the heart rate and breathing rate increased but at position of 45&#x000b0;, the vital signals showed significant change (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). They were decreased along with of pain intensity. Also, at 60&#x000b0; angle, it was found that the vital signals, which confirmed the increasing levels of pain severity increased significantly (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). These findings did not match with the results of similar studies.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] In the aforementioned study, no association found between a bed angle of 0&#x000b0; and 30&#x000b0; and then 45&#x000b0;, also, no relation was shown between decreasing of pain base on hemodynamic signals. After the procedure, the position was changed from supine to left or right lateral so as to reduce or alleviate pain and it was bed rest that likely caused the sandbag to move and then bleeding at the catheter (catheter entrance).[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Providing an optimal position without creating risks for patients for the relieving of pain will increase patient satisfaction and reduce risks in the catheterization procedure. This study had some limitations such as a variable pain threshold among patients, probability variable race in the population study, and the fact that any stage of this study was not blinded. Other studies would be helpful to resolve the limitations of this study so as to obtain better guidelines for managing a patient's pain and discomfort after cardiac catheterization.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Change in the patient's bed angles after coronary angiography was associated with relief of pain. Our study showed that the optimal angle for patients was 45&#x000b0; bed angle and confidence about this result comes from observing the vital signals. So, it is advisable that postangiography nurses plan the application of this optimal position in order to relieve pain in patients after coronary angiography.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Declaration of patient consent</title><p>The authors certify that they have obtained all appropriate patient consent forms.
