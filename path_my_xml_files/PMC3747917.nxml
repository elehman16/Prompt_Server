Basal insulin was initiated at 10 units/day and titrated weekly to an FPG target of &#x0003c;5 mmol/L (&#x0003c;90 mg/dL) according to mean prebreakfast self-measured blood glucose values from the preceding 3 days.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS</title><p>By 26 weeks, IDeg reduced HbA<sub>1c</sub> by 1.30% and was not inferior to IGlar.

Moreover, approximately 90% of those with T2DM in the U.S. are overweight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>), and obese patients often are less sensitive to exogenous insulin and therefore require higher doses to maintain good glycemic control. Globally, approximately 30% of patients with T2DM who use basal insulin require &#x0003e;60 units daily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). The use of a highly concentrated formulation of regular insulin, U-500 regular insulin (Humulin R U-500; Eli Lilly and Company, Indianapolis, IN), was originally developed to address high insulin requirements. The frequency of use of U-500 regular insulin increased dramatically by &#x0003e;70% in the U.S. between 2007 and 2008 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>), corresponding to the escalating number of people with T2DM and obesity.</p><p>Currently marketed insulin pen devices only allow the administration of a maximum of 80 units per injection, and administration of larger volumes of insulin has typically required the use of a vial and syringe or the addition of a second injection. Very large doses of insulin delivered as a single injection with a syringe may be painful and cause discomfort at the site of injection, and it can be physically challenging to deliver such a large volume smoothly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Together, these limitations highlight the need for an insulin formulation with a higher concentration that allows administration of higher doses of insulin in a single injection.</p><p>Insulin degludec (IDeg) is an ultra&#x02013;long-acting basal insulin that is in clinical development. On subcutaneous injection, IDeg forms soluble multihexamers that slowly dissociate into monomers to produce a flat and consistent insulin action profile, with a duration of action &#x0003e;42 h (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). To meet the need for higher insulin doses in patients who use prefilled pen devices, a more concentrated 200 units/mL formulation of IDeg was developed at the same time as the 100 units/mL preparation. IDeg 200 units/mL is bioequivalent to IDeg 100 units/mL and demonstrates a similar glucose-lowering effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Clinical trials comparing IDeg 100 units/mL with insulin glargine (IGlar) at 100 units/mL have demonstrated that IDeg 100 units/mL provides glycemic efficacy similar to that of IGlar, with lower rates of hypoglycemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>).</p><p>IDeg 200 units/mL contains the same number of units of insulin in half the volume compared with IDeg 100 units/mL and, when administered in the new FlexTouch pen device, can deliver as much as 160 units of insulin in a single injection. There is no dose correction or calculation necessary, because the FlexTouch pen internally corrects for the 200 units/mL concentration. Thus only the injected volume of a given dose of insulin differs between the 200 units/mL pen device and other devices. This eliminates any potential dose confusion when changing between currently available 100 units/mL basal insulin products and the possibility of mistakenly interchanging IDeg 100 units/mL and 200 units/mL insulin pens (on their approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration).</p><p>The purpose of this study was to compare efficacy and safety between IDeg 200 units/mL and IGlar, both administered once daily in combination with metformin with or without a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, in insulin-na&#x000ef;ve patients with T2DM requiring an intensification of treatment.</p><sec id="s1"><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><sec id="s2"><title>Trial design</title><p>This phase 3a, 26-week, randomized, controlled, open-label, multinational, treat-to-target, noninferiority trial compared efficacy and safety between IDeg 200 units/mL and IGlar, both administered once daily in combination with metformin with or without a DPP-4 inhibitor in insulin-na&#x000ef;ve participants with T2DM previously treated with oral antidiabetic drugs, who qualified for intensification of treatment. The trial was open-label because of the lack of availability of appropriate placebo-containing injection devices. The trial was conducted between 1 March and 26 November 2010 at 106 sites in 8 countries (Canada, France, Ireland, the Russian Federation, South Africa, Ukraine, the U.K., and the U.S.).</p><p>The study was completed in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Conference on Harmonization Good Clinical Practice Guidelines; institutional review boards reviewed and approved the protocol for each study site; and all patients provided written, informed consent before participation in the trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>).

Insulin treatments were injected subcutaneously in the thigh, upper arm, or abdomen. The starting dose for each insulin was 10 units and, during the treatment period, the dose was systematically titrated using a treat-to-target approach striving for a prebreakfast self-measured blood glucose (SMBG) level of &#x0003c;5 mmol/L (&#x0003c;90 mg/dL). Both IDeg 200 units/mL and IGlar were titrated once weekly (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc12-2329/-/DC1">Supplementary Table 1</ext-link>) according to the average of three preceding prebreakfast SMBG levels and other available data (e.g., symptoms of hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia, previous responses to dose adjustments, and any additional nonmandatory blood glucose measurements). The treatment period was 26 weeks, and doses were individually titrated in an effort to achieve a specific target of &#x0003c;5 mmol/L (&#x0003c;90 mg/dL) with both treatments. After the 26-week treatment period, participants switched their basal insulin treatment to the intermediate-acting NPH insulin for 1 week to wash out the investigational exogenous insulins and minimize interference with insulin antibody measurements.</p><p>The safety committee from the sponsor performed ongoing blinded safety surveillance. Titration of insulin doses was monitored by the outside company Quintiles (Singapore, U.S., and Switzerland) and reviewed by the sponsor&#x02019;s titration committee. Cardiovascular events were adjudicated and assessed by an independent external event adjudication committee.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Primary and secondary end points</title><p>The primary end point for this study was change in HbA<sub>1c</sub> from baseline after 26 weeks of treatment. Secondary confirmatory end points tested were number of treatment-emergent confirmed hypoglycemic episodes, change from baseline in central laboratory&#x02013;measured fasting plasma glucose (FPG), within-subject variability as measured by coefficient of variation, and frequency of participants achieving HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x0003c;7% (&#x0003c;53 mmol/mol) without confirmed hypoglycemic episodes.

The safety assessments included adverse events (AEs), hypoglycemic episodes, insulin dose, body weight, physical examination, vital signs, fundoscopy, electrocardiogram, and laboratory tests (including antibodies). Confirmed hypoglycemic episodes were defined as episodes of SMBG of &#x0003c;3.1 mmol/L (&#x0003c;56 mg/dL) or severe episodes requiring assistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>).

Type I error was controlled by adopting a hierarchical (fixed-sequence) testing procedure for selected end points, including change in HbA<sub>1c</sub>, number of confirmed hypoglycemic episodes, change in FPG, within-subject variability in prebreakfast blood glucose, and responders without hypoglycemic episodes. Noninferiority was confirmed if the upper limit of the 95% CI for the treatment difference was &#x02264;0.4%. Sample size was determined on the basis of the primary objective with a <italic>t </italic>statistic under the assumption of a one-sided <italic>t</italic> test of size 2.5%, a zero mean treatment difference, and a 1.3% SD for HbA<sub>1c</sub>.</p><p>Treatment difference in change from baseline in HbA<sub>1c</sub> after 26 weeks was analyzed with an ANOVA model with treatment, antidiabetic therapy at screening, sex, and region (Europe, North America, or South Africa) as fixed factors and age and baseline HbA<sub>1c</sub> as covariates. Treatment differences in FPG, Health-Related Quality of Life (Short Form 36) score, body weight, and insulin dose (log transformed) at the end of trial were analyzed by means of ANOVA with treatment, antidiabetic therapy at screening, sex, and region as fixed factors and age and relevant baseline values as covariates. A mixed-effects model was fitted to the 9-point SMBG profile data, which included treatment, time, interaction between treatment and time, antidiabetic therapy at screening, sex, and region as fixed factors; age as covariate; and subject as a random factor. Logarithm-transformed SMBG prebreakfast values were analyzed as repeated measures in a linear mixed model with treatment, antidiabetic therapy at screening, sex, and region as fixed factors; age as covariate; and subject as random factor. The model assumed independent within- and between-subject errors, with variances depending on treatment. The within-subject coefficient of variation was derived from the estimated within-subject variability (&#x003c3;<sup>2</sup>) as square root (exp(&#x003c3;<sup>2</sup>) &#x02013; 1). Responder (HbA<sub>1c</sub>) analysis was based on a logistic regression model using treatment, antidiabetic therapy at screening, sex, and region as fixed factors and age and baseline HbA<sub>1c</sub> as covariates. The number of treatment-emergent confirmed hypoglycemic episodes was analyzed according to a negative binomial regression model including treatment, antidiabetic therapy at screening, sex, and region as fixed factors and age as covariate. A similar model was used for post hoc analysis of treatment-emergent confirmed hypoglycemic episodes in participants requiring &#x02265;60 and &#x02265;80 units of insulin by the end of the trial; however, nocturnal confirmed hypoglycemic episodes for participants requiring &#x02265;80 units by the end of trial were analyzed by mean of a Poisson model with only treatment as a fixed factor.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s7"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s8"><title>Participant characteristics</title><p>A total of 697 candidates were screened for this study: 237 were excluded by screening, and the remaining 460 participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to the IDeg 200 units/mL and IGlar treatment groups.

Moreover, findings from this and other IDeg phase 3 trials demonstrate that systematic weekly insulin dose adjustments are a safe method for patients to achieve glycemic targets. Because of the use of the low-volume preparation, participants in the IDeg 200 units/mL treatment group received their required insulin dose with smaller injection volumes, and participants in the IDeg 200 units/mL group who required &#x0003e;80 units of basal insulin per day (approximately 20%, the same in both groups) were able to administer the full dose in a single injection, rather than the two injections needed by participants in the IGlar group.</p><p>The similar HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels achieved in this study, reflective of the treat-to-target study design, allow a comparison of potential differences in the safety profile of these two basal insulins. Treatment with both insulins demonstrated a total absence of severe hypoglycemic episodes and a particularly low number of confirmed and nocturnal confirmed hypoglycemic episodes when used in a structured, treat-to-target titration designed to reach a fasting glucose target &#x0003c;5 mmol/L (&#x0003c;90 mg/dL). Hypoglycemia is a significant barrier to good glycemic control in T1DM; however, it is infrequently emphasized in the T2DM population, possibly because of the lower relative risk of occurrence in this population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). The impact that hypoglycemia can have on a patient&#x02019;s health is twofold, including the neurologic and cardiovascular impairments it can cause as well as compromising the ability to achieve good glycemic control, thereby placing patients at risk for future complications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Moreover, costs to the patient, including loss of work productivity, direct and indirect medical expenses, and extended periods of hospitalization, can be costly for both the patient and the health care system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Given these hypoglycemia-related consequences, any reduction of hypoglycemia would arguably have beneficial implications for the overall quality of life for patients and the economic and resource burden on the health care system.</p><p>Despite the recognized advantages of prefilled insulin pen devices (including superior dosing accuracy, improved patient adherence, and greater ease of use compared with the vial and syringe), the use of pen devices in the U.S. remains low (approximately 15%), perhaps in part limited by the need to inject larger doses than currently possible with prefilled devices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). IDeg 200 units/mL was developed to address the high insulin requirements of the growing population of patients with T2DM who require higher insulin doses than permitted in a single injection with currently available pens. Furthermore, this formulation offers the added benefit relative to other available insulins of administering a larger dose in a smaller volume. This is likely to be particularly beneficial for insulin-resistant patients who require large insulin doses that cannot be administered by a single injection because of the limited maximum volume delivery (60&#x02013;80 units) of currently available pen devices.</p><p>Many patients with T2DM who require insulin do not adequately titrate their insulin dose, which may be due in part to a fear or risk of hypoglycemia and can lead to suboptimal glycemic control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Quality-of-life concerns may also result in patients omitting or skipping insulin injections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Likewise, administration of large injection volumes that result in a large subcutaneous depot may be painful, which also could contribute to poor patient adherence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). IDeg 200 units/mL may help to overcome some of these barriers in patients with T2DM, particularly those who require a high insulin dose, by offering a well-tolerated, effective insulin in a convenient pen device that permits insulin dosage to be delivered in a smaller volume than with other currently available pen devices. Additionally, the unique features of the FlexTouch Pen for IDeg 200 units/mL ensure that the dose dialed and shown in the dose counter of the pen is the delivered dose.</p><p>The limitations of the trial should be considered when interpreting the results. First, this study was not conducted in a double-blind fashion. Open-label trial designs pose an underlying risk for greater caution with adjustment of doses for the new drug (in this case IDeg 200 units/mL) and can impose bias in patient-reported outcomes. Second, the duration of the study (26 weeks) may be regarded as a limitation of the trial, especially in comparison with other 52-week insulin trials. From this and other trials of longer duration, however, it is evident that HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels stabilize by 26 weeks, thus allowing a relevant estimate of treatment effect. The results from this trial comparing IDeg 200 units/mL with IGlar are consistent with results from the previously published 52-week phase 3 (BEGIN) trials comparing IDeg 200 units/mL with IGlar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). The shorter duration of 26 weeks may, however, have led to an underestimation of the potential benefits of IDeg 200 units/mL, because as T2DM progresses more patients are likely to require larger doses of insulin. Third, although IDeg 200 units/mL resulted in a statistically significantly greater FPG reduction than did IGlar after 26 weeks of treatment as measured in the central laboratory, this was not seen in the SMBG data. This difference probably reflects a higher degree of accuracy from the central laboratory compared with the individual self-reported fingerstick test results seen in the SMBG data. Moreover, the weekly titrations were based on the mean of the preceding 3 days&#x02019; SMBG values, recorded by a handheld home monitoring meter and measured prebreakfast (and thus often early in the morning), whereas the target FPG was based on a single central laboratory value taken at the clinic. Overall, about a third of the patients achieved the fasting glucose target, although the algorithm appeared to be adhered to as evaluated by the concordance between the prescribed dose and the dose recommended by the algorithm. Finally, the timing of the daily dose of basal insulin was not recorded unless there was a hypoglycemic event associated with treatment administration, so the potential effects of differences in daily dose timing of IDeg 200 units/mL and IGlar on hypoglycemia cannot be evaluated.</p><p>Treatment with IDeg 200 units/mL resulted in similar HbA<sub>1c</sub> reductions as IGlar, with significantly better FPG reductions and a low rate of hypoglycemia. The 200 units/mL formulation of IDeg offers the potential dual benefit of administering insulin doses in a lower volume and administering as much as 160 units in a single injection with the FlexTouch Pen. IDeg 200 units/mL addresses an unmet need for patients with T2DM, particularly those who require high doses of basal insulin, and has the potential to improve treatment compliance and health outcomes.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><p>Clinical trial reg. no.
