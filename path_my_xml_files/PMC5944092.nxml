These patients not only have reduced functional independence, quality of life and long-term survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], moreover, the treatment of postsurgical complications is extremely expensive. In the US the average extra cost for treating a patient developing one or more complication is approximately US$18,000 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Therefore, reduction of postsurgical complications with fewer days in&#x000a0;an&#x000a0;intensive care unit, fewer days on organ support, reduction of resource utilization and reduction of hospital stay would reduce costs also for the health care system. Inadequate supply of oxygen is one of the major factors leading to postoperative organ dysfunction and complications. Oxygen supply is mainly determined by cardiac output rather than blood pressure, which, however, has been the primary hemodynamic target during surgery for decades and still is. In this context hemodynamic goal-directed therapy, focusing on an optimization of fluid status and cardiac output, is believed to have the ability to reduce postoperative complications. Since methods like thermodilution, arterial pulse-contour analysis or esophageal Doppler allow routine measurement of cardiac output, several single-center studies have brought up the first evidence that perioperative, algorithm-driven optimization of cardiac output can reduce postoperative complications and improve outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Also meta-analyses have demonstrated a reduction of morbidity in patients undergoing high-risk surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. However, comparability of those studies is limited due to inhomogeneity in population and therapeutic approaches. Moreover, in most published trials so far, hemodynamic goals had been predefined independently from the individual need of the single patient and further generalized to an entire study population, i.e., either dedicated values of stroke volume or cardiac output, or a standardized maximization of stroke volume by volume loading were used for all patients.</p><p id="Par19">The focus in previous studies was put on implementation of fixed values of hemodynamic parameters, disregarding the single patient&#x02019;s individual cardiovascular capacities, especially the individual range of cardiac output.</p><p id="Par20">The hypothesis of the planned clinical trial is that perioperative hemodynamic optimization based on the novel approach of individualization of hemodynamic therapy can reduce postoperative morbidity and mortality.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Justification of the study</title><p id="Par21">The present study aims to evaluate the impact of perioperative, algorithm-driven, hemodynamic therapy based on individualized fluid status and individualized cardiac output optimization on postoperative moderate and severe complications and mortality. The study is justified by the high rate of postoperative complications as a major determinant for the reduction of quality of life for the affected patients and high costs for the health system which may be reduced by individualized, perioperative hemodynamic therapy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par22">This is a prospective, multi-center, international, randomized controlled clinical trial in 380 patients scheduled for major abdominal surgery in six European centers having a large number of patients eligible for study inclusion (see <xref rid="Sec30" ref-type="sec">Appendix</xref>).

In Europe, overall mortality after surgery has been reported to be up to 4% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and after high-risk surgery or in high-risk patients it has to be assumed to be even higher. Morbidity or postoperative complications, which are potentially triggered by inadequate oxygen supply to the peripheral organs, have to be seen as the primary cause for reduction of quality of life and the immense health care costs ensuing. Every percentage point reduction of postoperative complications could save approximately 180 million to US$270 million [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In a recent multi-center trial the achievement of adequate preoperative oxygen delivery was associated with a lower postoperative morbidity compared to the standard of care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. In this context a various number of meta-analyses evaluating the impact of hemodynamic goal-directed therapy, and thereby optimizing oxygen supply, have already demonstrated reduction of morbidity in patients undergoing high-risk surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. However, meta-analyses are frequently limited in their statement due to inhomogeneity in population and therapeutic approaches. In published trials, stroke volume or cardiac output have been predefined, standardized and generalized to a total cohort of patients not taking into account the single patient&#x02019;s individual cardiovascular needs and capacities. In the largest randomized multi-center study on goal-directed therapy published so far, the focus of the intervention protocol was maximization of stroke volume by repetitive fluid administration without using functional parameters of preload supplemented by a fixed dose of inotropes. In this trial the focus was put on maximizing stroke volume. However, this large multi-center trial did not significantly reduce the composite primary endpoint of morbidity and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. In contrast to this approach, in the iPEGASUS trial, the protocol is not targeting a maximized stroke volume. In the iPEGASUS trial, individual CI assessment is primarily based on PPV-guided volume status optimization followed by defining the achieved CI as &#x0201c;individually optimized CI&#x0201d; under optimized volume status conditions. This &#x0201c;individually optimized CI&#x0201d; is used as the CI target during the total perioperative period and volume and inotrope application is only performed when this &#x0201c;individually optimized CI&#x0201d; is not reached.</p><p id="Par50">The hypothesis of the planned clinical trial is that perioperative hemodynamic optimization, based on the novel approach of individualization of hemodynamic therapy, can reduce postoperative morbidity and also mortality. A previous study focusing on a PPV-guided CI individualization and, in contrast to iPEGASUS, using PPV-based volume loading, even when the individualized CI&#x000a0;was reached, demonstrated a reduction in postoperative complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. However, this finding is now evaluated in a larger randomized controlled, multi-center study using a modified intervention protocol. Thus, in the proposed study, hemodynamic therapy is tailored individually to each patient, based on optimization of fluid status by the functional parameter&#x000a0;PPV and based on this individually titrated goal of CI. Individualization of therapy is a key factor for successful treatment, especially when reduction of morbidity and mortality is targeted. Therefore, the iPEGASUS trial further develops the concept of hemodynamic goal-directed therapy to individually set goals and is designed to assess its impact on mortality and morbidity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par51">Recruitment started in August 2017 and is anticipated to be completed by the end of 2018.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><sec id="Sec31"><title>Additional files</title><p>
