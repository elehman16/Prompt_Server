Affecting 10&#x02013;15% of the population <xref rid="pone.0107430-Davis1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref> it represents a major healthcare burden <xref rid="pone.0107430-ElShunnar1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> yet its underlying mechanisms are not well understood, and there is no uniformly effective treatment. Hearing loss is typically comorbid with tinnitus suggesting the tinnitus percept is a direct consequence of maladaptive neuroplastic responses to hearing loss <xref rid="pone.0107430-Moller1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Current models of tinnitus generation therefore focus on the potential consequences of hearing loss on neuronal activity within the central auditory system <xref rid="pone.0107430-Eggermont1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0107430-Schaette1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, although neuronal structures or networks responsible for tinnitus that are independent of those for hearing loss are yet to be convincingly determined <xref rid="pone.0107430-Elgoyhen1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0107430-Melcher1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p><p>The different models of tinnitus generation provide various potential regimes for novel tinnitus intervention. One current mainstay in tinnitus management is the provision of passive sound stimulation to mask the tinnitus sound <xref rid="pone.0107430-Hoare1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0107430-Tyler1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. However, active forms of sound enrichment such as Frequency Discrimination Training (FDT) are more recently proposed as interventions to <italic>interrupt</italic> tinnitus generation and maintenance in a targeted way, rather than just mask it <xref rid="pone.0107430-Hoare2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Early studies of FDT for tinnitus have all based their hypotheses on a cortical reorganization model of tinnitus typically citing the seminal work of Recanzone et al. <xref rid="pone.0107430-Recanzone1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, where perceptual learning through <italic>active</italic> listening appeared key to functional reorganisation of the auditory cortex <xref rid="pone.0107430-Flor1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0107430-Herraiz2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. A more recent animal study from Engineer et al. <xref rid="pone.0107430-Engineer1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, again suggested that passive sound exposure alone was not sufficient. They reported neuroplastic and behavioural changes associated with noise-induced hearing loss were reversed through passive sound stimuli when paired with electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve. Whilst sound stimulates the auditory cortex, vagal nerve stimulation is claimed to promote neuromodulator release akin to that generated by the use of behavioural reward to reinforce behavioural or neurophysiological change due to learning <xref rid="pone.0107430-Clark1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0107430-David1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>.</p><p>We recently reviewed studies of auditory training for tinnitus concluding the need for good quality trials to reliably estimate its potential as a therapy <xref rid="pone.0107430-Hoare2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> and have since published our own investigation of the effects of FDT in adults with tinnitus <xref rid="pone.0107430-Hoare3" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. In this study we compared training at hearing loss frequencies to training at normal hearing frequencies. Whilst overall we saw a clinically significant improvement in tinnitus handicap after training, this effect was independent of whether training stimuli were in the region of hearing or hearing loss. We therefore concluded that training at <italic>any</italic> frequencies could equally result in some generic improvement in tinnitus self-report and hypothesised the improvement to be cognitive, by reducing deficits in attention for example, rather than physiological.</p><p>Discrepant between animal studies and human studies of FDT for tinnitus however is the use of reward. Human studies of FDT for tinnitus have thus far derived training from <italic>n</italic>-alternative forced-choice paradigms conventionally used to determine psychophysical threshold for discrimination <xref rid="pone.0107430-Fu1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0107430-Sweetow1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. As such, reinforcement of experience with reward was not considered. Participants were simply required to &#x02018;react&#x02019; to the stimulus presentation rather than &#x02018;interact&#x02019; with the training programme. Participants presumably took part because of the potential for improvement in their tinnitus (extrinsic motivation). It may be that more interactive forms of FDT that incorporate elements of gameplay such as decision making, strategy development, competition, which are intrinsically (top-down) motivating would make training more rewarding and yield significant further benefit for patients <xref rid="pone.0107430-Amitay1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. In the health domain, computer-assisted educational health interventions are shown to be more effective when they support basic patient needs such as the desire for greater autonomy <xref rid="pone.0107430-Williams1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Furthermore it is proposed that future intervention-focused studies evaluating the influence of video games on health should account for the need for satisfaction provided by these games <xref rid="pone.0107430-Przybylski1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. In the case of FDT for tinnitus, where the &#x02018;material&#x02019; used is typically short pips of pure tones, we perhaps need to meet baser needs such as measurable enjoyment and engagement with the game for maximum therapeutic benefit to be realised. For the current study therefore we developed two training platforms where the core listening task involved FDT but we systematically introduced gaming elements. These elements were expected to provide intrinsic motivation through challenge (use of point scoring, target scores), control (opportunity for developing personal game strategy), fantasy (integration of the training task and the perceived objective of the game), and curiosity, that would motivate and reward participants <xref rid="pone.0107430-Malone1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>.</p><p>We hypothesised that interactive games would prove more intrinsically motivating, and lead to greater improvement in self-reported tinnitus handicap than in previous studies, and to improvement in cognitive performance. Two main questions are addressed in this study; (1) can we use gameplay to make FDT intrinsically motivating, and (2) does FDT delivered in a gaming format have significant therapeutic benefit over training delivered in a reactive task-only format?</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>This work is reported according to the CONSORT statement for randomized trials of non-pharmacological treatments <xref rid="pone.0107430-Boutron1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0107430.s001">Checklist S1</xref>).

Participants were adults with chronic subjective tinnitus who had a &#x02265;20 dB hearing loss on at least one test frequency (0.125, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11.25, 12.5, 14 kHz) in at least one ear, and were not currently receiving any therapy or other intervention that could impact their hearing or tinnitus. Participants with hearing loss &#x02265;40 dB at all test frequencies were excluded as not being able to sufficiently hear the training stimuli. The screening assessment included a case history, the Beck Anxiety Index and Beck Depression Index <xref rid="pone.0107430-Beck1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref> and the Hyperacusis Questionnaire <xref rid="pone.0107430-Khalfa1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Participants with clinically significant scores on any of these questionnaires were excluded as requiring clinical intervention.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Sample size</title><p>In our previous study <xref rid="pone.0107430-Hoare3" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> it was estimated that 14 participants per group would be required to detect a statistical difference in mean THQ score change between two groups. Baseline tinnitus handicap was different between groups in our previous study however, suggesting that a larger sample size would be more appropriate. We therefore aimed to recruit 20 participants to each group which according to Cohen <xref rid="pone.0107430-Cohen1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0107430-Cohen2" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref> would generally be required for significance in a one-sided test at alpha 0.05 and a power of 0.8. A one-sided test was considered appropriate as we had a directional prediction of benefit for all three groups.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Allocation of Participants to Training Groups</title><p>Participants were randomized using a minimization protocol <xref rid="pone.0107430-Altman1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref> to ensure groups were balanced with respect to (i) severity of tinnitus; THQ score; &#x0003c;600, 600&#x02013;1200, &#x0003e;1200, (ii) age; 18&#x02013;49, 50&#x02013;69, 70+, and (iii) gender. A number of steps ensured blinding of the outcome assessment. First, the minimization was performed by an independent researcher who was not otherwise involved in the study. Second, assessment of tinnitus was carried out by a researcher who did not know which group the participant was allocated to. Third, the researcher who programmed the laptops and instructed the participants was kept unaware of any changes in the participant's tinnitus throughout the study. Participants were not blinded but received the same generic information about the purpose of the study and were required not to discuss their tinnitus or gameplay experience where it would compromise study blinding of outcome assessment. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0107430-g001">Figure 1</xref> shows the flow of participants through the study, exclusions, and dropout.</p><fig id="pone-0107430-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0107430.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Trial flow chart.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0107430.g001"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Audiometry</title><p>Pure-tone audiometry was conducted in a sound-proofed booth using the Siemens Unity 2 system and Sennheiser HAD 200 headphones.

They were observed in real training situations, and provided feedback on the usability and playability of each game. Participants were observed playing each game and completed a semi structured interview afterwards to discuss what they liked and disliked about each game. This was an iterative process to ensure consistency in how the games responded to the actions of the participant, check the clarity and consistency of information on game status, game instructions, and other visual information, and to implement changes to overcome or remove aspects of either game that were disliked. STAR2 software was not modified for the current study.</p><sec id="s2g1"><title>STAR2</title><p>
<italic>STAR</italic> was developed at MRC Institute of Hearing Research as a platform for assessing frequency discrimination thresholds in children <xref rid="pone.0107430-Barry1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Training comprised a reactive task presented in a three-interval, three-alternate forced choice (3I-3AFC) &#x02018;oddball&#x02019; discrimination paradigm, delivered as a continuous block of trials. For a given individual, the &#x02018;trained&#x02019; fundamental frequency (the standard) was fixed throughout, and the target (the oddball) differed by percentage (Hz) above the fundamental frequency of the standard. An adaptive staircase procedure targeted performance at 79%. <italic>STAR2</italic> was a modified version of this test software for use in adults. Cartoon characters and backdrops were replaced with changing nature scene backdrops and picture images of a loudspeaker. <italic>STAR2</italic> indicates whether a trial has been successful or not immediately following the trial using different sound cues, but no other feedback or scoring system is provided. Training comprised a single level only so each new training session started at the same fundamental frequency difference between standard and oddball.</p></sec><sec id="s2g2"><title>
<italic>Treasure Hunter</italic>
</title><p>
<italic>Treasure Hunter</italic> was developed by co-author NVL. Training comprised of an interactive three interval task where the participant aims to progress through levels of the game by collecting sufficient reward points. Game play (selection, activation, and execution of frequency discrimination task) was participant induced. Participants had to move a mining cart left or right on the screen to &#x02018;blast out&#x02019; gold nuggets buried in the ground, whilst avoiding coal nuggets. Gold nuggets had different levels of reward and nuggets buried deeper had greater reward. Coal nuggets had zero value. The &#x02018;trained&#x02019; fundamental frequency was fixed throughout and the target always differed by a percentage (Hz) above the fundamental frequency of the standard; higher frequencies always corresponded to the presence of buried gold. The game had no time constraints, so participants could take a strategic approach to deciding which direction to move and when to select what they thought was a target. Rewards were earned by correctly identifying targets where the tone presented in the second interval was above the &#x02018;trained&#x02019; fundamental frequency (i.e. presence of gold underneath). Participants were given a target value of reward to collect in order to progress to the next level of difficulty. Difficulty was increased in successive levels by reducing the percentage fundamental frequency difference that indicates reward. Feedback and scores were displayed after each level was attempted. Each new training session started at the level achieved in the previous session.</p></sec><sec id="s2g3"><title>
<italic>Submarine</italic>
</title><p>
<italic>Submarine</italic> was developed by co-author MSh. Training comprised an interactive two-interval task where the participant aims to progress through levels of the game by identifying hidden exits in the sea-wall. In contrast to <italic>Treasure Hunter</italic>, in this instance part of the game play was system induced because the submarine continuously travelled a horizontal path across the screen from left to right. Tones were presented as repeated pairs comprising a &#x02018;sonar pulse&#x02019; from the submarine (set as the &#x02018;trained&#x02019; fundamental frequency) followed by a response tone from a hidden gap to the right of the screen, such that the vertical point on the screen at which the tones were of identical frequency indicated the target (gap). The participant's task was to navigate the submarine up or down, raising or lowering the fundamental frequency of the second interval tone accordingly, to the point on the screen where the two tones were identical. This allowed the submarine to pass through the gap in the wall. Participants were given four &#x02018;lives&#x02019; and had to pass through five gateways to progress to the next level of difficulty. Difficulty was increased on successive levels by reducing the possible percentage fundamental frequency difference between the two tones. Feedback and scores were displayed after each level was attempted. Each new training session started at the level achieved in the previous session.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Assessment of intrinsic motivation &#x02013; interview and thematic analysis</title><p>Participant experiences of FDT using each game were evaluated qualitatively using the methods described in Benedek and Miner <xref rid="pone.0107430-Benedek1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. In the first instance, participants viewed a set of 118 product reaction cards depicting positive, negative, and neutral descriptor words (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0107430.s003">Table S1</xref>). Participants selected all words they considered applicable to their experience of the training. They were then asked to select five words from all those selected that were most relevant, and to elaborate on their word choice in an interview that centred on these five words. Interviews were recorded and transcribed, and coded using a thematic analysis approach <xref rid="pone.0107430-Boyatzis1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0107430-Joffe1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>.

In addition to rating tinnitus loudness on a visual analogue scale (VAS) participants matched loudness by adjusting the level of a range of sound clips (centre frequencies 0.5&#x02013;12 kHz) until each was judged to be the same as their tinnitus level. We took the loudness measure as the matched value at a single-frequency corresponding to little or no hearing loss (typically 0.5 or 1 kHz) and distant from the dominant tinnitus pitch. A profile of the individual tinnitus spectrum was generated by asking participants to rate the likeness of 11 sounds (centre frequencies 0.5&#x02013;12 kHz) to the pitch of their tinnitus, using a 100-point scale. The dominant tinnitus pitch is defined as that frequency in the spectrum which had the highest likeness rating.

As the result was contrary to our hypothesis further analyses were conducted to investigate whether there had been any relationship between baseline tinnitus severity and performance on the attention tasks. No correlation was found between baseline tinnitus severity and either sustained or divided attention (<italic>r</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.04, <italic>p</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.764 and <italic>r</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.033, <italic>p</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.8, respectively). Partial correlation to factor in differences in audiometric threshold had no effect on the relationship (<italic>r</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;&#x02212;0.12, <italic>p</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.93 for sustained attention and <italic>r</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;&#x02212;0.13, <italic>p</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.92 for divided attention). However, audiometric threshold did correlate significantly with sustained attention (<italic>r</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.27, <italic>p</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.037), and approached significance for divided attention (<italic>r</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.244, <italic>p</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.061). So whilst there was no evidence that different levels of tinnitus severity impact on attention, at baseline, better audiometric threshold was associated with better performance on these tests. Hence, we speculate that hearing loss negatively impacts cognitive performance.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study addresses two questions. First, can gameplay make FDT more rewarding and intrinsically motivating? Second, would elements of intrinsic motivation that are inherent in game-play usefully increase the benefit a person with tinnitus gets from doing FDT (reduce tinnitus handicap, improve cognitive performance)?</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Intrinsic motivation in FDT</title><p>We conducted a qualitative evaluation to understand and compare intrinsic motivations to perform FDT where the FD task is delivered as a simple reactive task (as used in psychophysical testing), or where the FD task is integrated with progressing through levels of a computer game. Analysis of semi-structured interview data clearly showed that greater intrinsic motivation was associated with the gameplay on <italic>Treasure Hunter</italic> and particularly on <italic>Submarine</italic>, than with the simpler reactive task-based training of <italic>STAR2</italic>. Most participants reported a preference for FDT on <italic>Treasure Hunter</italic> and <italic>Submarine</italic>. Despite differences in motivation and game preference, compliance with prescribed training was similar across all groups. The intrinsic motivations identified were in any case insufficient to promote high compliance. We conclude that, whereas intrinsic motivation through gameplay may promote enjoyment and compliance with interventions in other health or educational domains (e.g. <xref rid="pone.0107430-Nilsson1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0107430-Papastergiou1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>, in the case of this population (people with tinnitus) and this intervention (FDT), it promotes enjoyment but has no effect on compliance.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Effects of training on tinnitus</title><p>Our previous work showed that the benefit derived from FDT in terms of a small reduction in tinnitus handicap was independent of the training frequency chosen and not related to a change in tinnitus quality <xref rid="pone.0107430-Hoare3" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Here again we find a small effect of FDT on our primary measure of tinnitus handicap, but within groups, mean THQ score only changes by up to 69 points (&#x0223c;7% of baseline) after training (T1) and there was no difference between groups.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Effects of training on measures of attention</title><p>We also took the opportunity here to test the effect of FDT on attention in a tinnitus population. A number of studies point to deficits in cognitive processes such as attention and working memory in people with tinnitus, and for more cognitively demanding tasks in particular <xref rid="pone.0107430-Hallam1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0107430-Stevens1" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>. So, if FDT does improve attention then it may be useful for tinnitus. Training may reduce the amount of attention given over to the tinnitus sound and thereby increase the attentional capacity available to better perform everyday activities. Indeed, redirecting attention through movement therapy has already been applied clinically within a multi-therapy approach to tinnitus management <xref rid="pone.0107430-Cima1" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>.</p><p>Detrimental effects of tinnitus on measures of attention have previously been demonstrated in sub-populations of people with clinically significant tinnitus. Physiological effects were demonstrated by Delb et al. <xref rid="pone.0107430-Delb1" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref> who showed that tinnitus distress level impacts on the attention effects on event-related potentials (N100, phase locking), concluding that attention resources are &#x02018;captured&#x02019; by tinnitus in people with higher distress levels. Rossiter et al. <xref rid="pone.0107430-Rossiter1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref> showed there were slower reaction times on a dual task in people with moderately bothersome tinnitus compared to non-tinnitus controls. In a follow-up study Stevens et al. <xref rid="pone.0107430-Stevens1" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref> observed slower reaction times in people with severe tinnitus in both a Stroop paradigm and a divided attention task; higher self-reported tinnitus handicap was associated with slower reaction times. Hallam et al. <xref rid="pone.0107430-Hallam1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref> also found that people with tinnitus show slower reaction times in a dual task condition compared to no tinnitus controls.</p><p>Here we observed no significant effect of FDT on the performance of a sustained or divided attention task. Furthermore, our results suggest that whereas the degree of hearing loss might determine performance on tasks of attention, there is no indication the degree of tinnitus handicap affects how well they perform these tasks. This is particularly contrary to the findings of Stevens et al. <xref rid="pone.0107430-Stevens1" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref> who compared a small sample of tinnitus participants (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;11 compared to 60 here) to a non-tinnitus control group. Stevens et al. <xref rid="pone.0107430-Stevens1" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref> only included the degree of hearing loss at high frequencies (the average audiometric threshold for 4,6,8 kHz) in their analysis of covariance, rather than loss at the lower frequencies more relevant to speech and music perception (up to 2 kHz).</p><p>These secondary observations point to future work to fully understand the degree to which tinnitus and hearing loss contribute to performance on cognitive tasks.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Limitations of this study</title><p>As with many studies of FDT for tinnitus, one limiting factor is the short training period prescribed and completed. The overall effect on THQ score in this study fell short of that reported in our previous study <xref rid="pone.0107430-Hoare3" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. At our primary endpoint (after 4 weeks training) compliance was &#x0223c;20% less than that observed in our previous study. We can speculate that this was related to factors such as (1) a longer intervention period in the current study (6 weeks compared to 4 weeks), (2) a much larger team on the current study with less continuity of the relationship between assessor and participant, or (3) ceiling effects in the previous study. Greater compliance here may have given an equal or greater effect on THQ score to that seen previously but even with identifiable extrinsic and intrinsic motivators, compliance looks likely to remain an issue for this particular intervention and participant group.</p><p>Another potential limitation, in terms of our results on the effects of attention, is that the outcome measure we chose (TEA) may not appropriately capture the changes in attentional processing that may occur as a result of FDT. A single measure of sustained attention for example may be insufficient to support or refute a main effect <xref rid="pone.0107430-Shipstead1" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Future directions</title><p>Perhaps the more challenging indications to emerge from this study are those relating the performance on attention tasks to the degree of hearing loss, and not tinnitus severity. Previous studies might suggest that cognitive training should be explored as a plausible therapeutic avenue. Indeed, psychotherapeutic approaches to tinnitus management already include elements termed attention training <xref rid="pone.0107430-Delb2" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref> or attention redirection <xref rid="pone.0107430-Cima1" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>. Computer-based approaches to training attention, if sufficiently intrinsically motivating, may serve as an alternative self-help tool for people with tinnitus. However there is clearly first a need to explore the true impact of tinnitus on cognitive resources. The limited participant numbers and lack of control for hearing loss across previous studies on the topic mean further studies are needed to disambiguate the effect of tinnitus on cognitive performance from the effects of hearing loss or other factors. Are there subsets of tinnitus patients who show particular deficits on attention demanding tasks? If so then this may be a route for targeted management.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>FDT for tinnitus has now been the topic of eight published studies which taken together suggest it has a reproducible but small effect on tinnitus handicap more likely to be due to a change in cognitive representations (e.g. emotional reaction) rather than a physiological change in the auditory system (e.g. hearing) <xref rid="pone.0107430-Hoare2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>
<xref rid="pone.0107430-Hoare3" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. For most people, delivering FDT in a way that uses standard game-play approaches to intrinsically motivate the &#x02018;player&#x02019; is preferred to a simple task-based training regime but this does not in itself lead to compliance or to additional improvements in self-reported tinnitus severity. The results of this study, taken in context with the limited existing literature, suggest that cognitive deficits experienced by people with tinnitus can be improved through training, if training incorporates the right intrinsically motivating elements and engages the user. It remains to be investigated whether such improvements can lead to clinically important improvements in tinnitus handicap.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0107430.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>
