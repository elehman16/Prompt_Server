Lumbar disc disease is an important cause of low backache so much so that people have perceptions that all low backaches are due to disc prolapse.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] According to one study, almost 80% of people in modern industrial society will experience back pain at some time in their life. It is common in women who have had several pregnancies.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] The usual symptoms of back disorders are pain, stiffness and deformity in the back, and pain paresthesia or weakness in the lower limbs.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Minorities with low back pain (LBP) receive less patient education.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Back injury is the leading and most expensive cause of workers' compensation claims.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Back pain is one of the most common complaints seen in physician's offices. A survey done by the CDC in 2010 reported that back symptoms were the primary reason for 1.3% of office visits in the United States, and spinal disorders were responsible for 3.1% of diagnoses in outpatient clinics.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] A 2012 systematic review by Hoy <italic>et al</italic>. estimated that the global point prevalence of activity-limiting LBP lasting more than a day was 12% and 1 month was 23%.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] The etiology of back pain is not fully researched and understood; however, the psychological, psychosocial/occupational, and physical factors are considered as strong causative factors.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>Medical expenditures for LBP in minorities are 30% lower than for Whites' back surgery.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Patient satisfaction with the effectiveness of conventional LBP treatment is relatively low.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Spinal pain is a condition for which often - complementary therapies are being used.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Despite the ubiquity of back pain, it is one of the conditions that modern medicine does not treat well, partly due to imprecision of diagnosis and relative ineffectiveness of most conventional treatments. Although yoga may have the potential to ameliorate both chronic and acute pain in general, the mechanisms by which this is affected remain hypothetical.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Nevertheless, today, yoga is quite commonly used as complementary treatment for spinal pain.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] There are many muscles in the low back including larger powerful muscles such as iliopsoas and erector spinae, as well as smaller muscles such as multifidi, semispinalis, and rotators. These muscles along with the external and internal oblique and rectus and transverse abdominis are responsible for the stability of the spine as well as the spine's basic movements. It is important for these muscles to be not only strong but also flexible. If these muscles are weak or deconditioned, they cannot efficiently stabilize the spine, leading to instability and injury. Muscular imbalances in strength and tone exert uneven forces on their bony or facial attachments, contributing to poor body mechanics, injury and pain. There is positive evidence of yoga therapy for the treatment and management of chronic low back pain. Thus, there is a substantial need for research to identify more helpful therapies. The art and science of yoga have infinite possibilities for providing answers to most health problems, troubling modern humankind. However, we often misunderstand this science and want it to be a miracle pill. A pill that we take only once and want all the problems to vanish into thin air. Yoga is a holistic science and must be learned and practiced with a holistic view.</p><p>Reviews and meta-analyses[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and practice guidelines from the American Pain Society and the American College of Physicians[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] support yoga as an evidence-based treatment for LBP with at least moderate benefit. However, no studies to date have compared yoga's effectiveness to physical therapy (PT), the most commonly nonpharmacologic reimbursable treatment that physicians recommend.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>A total of 200 patients with lumbar spondylitis from OPD of neurosurgery were recruited for the study [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>].

An evaluation of yoga's impact on the gunas and self-ideal disparity found significant correlations between self and ideal self for the yoga group but not for the control.</p><p>A study on Hatha yoga practice and body mass index (BMI) and reduced medication use in women over 45 years by Moliver <italic>et al</italic>. performed bivariate correlations and multiple linear regressions to analyze the relationship of current hours per week, total lifetime hours, and total calendar years to BMI for yoga practitioner. Bivariate analyses showed a significant inverse relationship between extent of yoga experience and BMI. In the regression analysis, the relationship remained significant between total lifetime hours of yoga and BMI (<italic>P</italic> = 0.01) and between current hours of yoga per week and BMI (<italic>P</italic> = 0.04), after accounting for hours of weekly nonyogic exercise and refined and processed food consumption.[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="sec2-11"><title>Summary of evidence</title><p>One of the primary causes of back pain is muscle tension;[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] more people are now work stressed and have mechanical stiffness that primarily affect not only the spine but also the hips and shoulders. Regular yoga workup stretches the muscle and loosens them, which were previously tense.[<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] Yoga directly helps people where back pain is directly related poor posture. The findings showed there was a significant reduction in pain intensity in the long-term yoga practice group. The authors reasoned that yoga might enhance both the toning of muscles and releasing of muscle tension. Relaxation responses, therefore, could reduce stress-related muscle tension and modify neurobiological pain perception. The authors also suggested that as yoga practitioners develop increasing awareness of muscle use and joint position, they could better change habitual posture patterns in daily life.</p><p>Yoga is often recommended as an evidence-based additional therapy intervention for back and neck pain.
