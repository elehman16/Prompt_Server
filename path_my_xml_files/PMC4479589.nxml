As the population ages, the elderly experience a loss in strength, sensorimotor processing, increased reaction times, and reduced vision[<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Loss of visual function (e.g., visual acuity, visual fields) due to common age-related disease, such as macular degeneration, glaucoma, and cataracts, reportedly doubles the risk of falls[<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and is significantly associated with fall-related injuries leading to decreased mobility, independence and quality of life[<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In a recent prospective, observational study, over half of new patients seen in the low vision rehabilitation service (n = 564; median age = 77) reported having a fall, and of those, 39% reported that the fall was vision related[<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>The postural control system consists of the musculoskeletal, sensory, and central nervous systems working together to maintain postural stability[<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. To avoid falls, the central nervous system continuously monitors feedback from the active sensory systems to generate corrective musculoskeletal responses that regulate postural control[<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Specifically, sensory input is derived from three different sources that operate synergistically: somatosensory (e.g., proprioception), vestibular (e.g., changes in head position), and the visual system (e.g., optic flow, visual fields)[<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Thus, individuals with uncorrectable vision loss have a damaged visual input stream, contributing to postural instability[<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Research into the role of each sensory system under experimental or pathological conditions during standing balance has led to a greater understanding of how the remaining sensory inputs can adjust when one system is impaired[<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Individuals with a compromised visual contribution to balance are even more unstable in conditions when the somatosensory system is also perturbed[<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], e.g., when walking on thick carpet with thick-soled shoes or on a sandy beach. Similar instability patterns have been observed for cases in which vision and vestibular systems are impaired[<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>An important property of the postural control system is its ability to &#x0201c;down-weight&#x0201d; poor sensory cues and &#x0201c;up-weight&#x0201d; more reliable cues, also known as sensory reweighting[<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The ability to reweight sensory inputs might suggest that VI individuals could make better use of the remaining sensory inputs upon losing vision, but this may not happen without specific training[<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Targeted balance training may significantly improve postural stability by strengthening or &#x0201c;up-weighting&#x0201d; the remaining sensory systems[<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. For example, training that stimulates the use of postural control strategies, such as the ankle and hip adjustments, can subsequently stimulate the somatosensory and vestibular systems[<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p><p>Real-world falls are difficult to measure, therefore, center of pressure (COP) has been used as a surrogate marker for postural stability in standing balance[<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], especially since it is correlated with sensorimotor deficits[<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. COP component measures quantify the displacement of upright balance around the center of mass through the distribution of total force applied to the supporting surface[<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Using a clinically validated balance protocol and a force platform[<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] one can derive measures of absolute COP and easily quantify the relative visual, somatosensory and vestibular contributions to balance by artificially removing one or more conditions and calculating stability indices[<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. When postural stability (i.e. quiet standing) is perturbed due to unexpected environmental changes, a proportionate increase in COP magnitude is observed, therefore, a reduction in absolute COP displacement would imply greater postural stability[<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. For example, COP displacement is augmented during walking or during changes in sensory input[<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]; similarly, when measured at baseline, VI individuals show greater COP displacement when compared to normally sighted individuals[<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Normally sighted individuals show less &#x0201c;movement&#x0201d;, thus, greater postural stability. Therefore, COP minimization as an indicator of greater stability and reduced fall risk is often cited in the literature[<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p><p>On the other hand, multiple studies have suggested that minimization of COP parameters may not be the best indicator of better stability, in particular for clinical populations. For example, COP can be reduced in clinical populations at risk for falls such as Parkinson&#x02019;s patients, lower leg amputees and ACL-deficient individuals, compared to healthy, normal adults[<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. In addition, absolute COP and relative sensory contribution to balance can be increased after significant balance training, such as Tai Chi and other forms of exercise[<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. As long as balance is maintained safely within the individual&#x02019;s base of support and sensorimotor feedback is augmented in order to compensate for sensory deficiencies via corrective strategies, the increase in stability recorded as greater COP displacement, is then considered an indicator of COP stabilization[<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Therefore, COP minimization may not apply to systems that are inherently unstable (e.g., musculoskeletal disorders, elderly)[<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. While the mechanism for COP changes after training is not clear, it is possible that individuals develop corrective strategies to down-weight unreliable and up-weight reliable information[<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. For example, increased flexibility in the ankle joint may provide meaningful proprioceptive feedback to generate adaptive motor responses for improved posture[<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>].</p><p>Yoga, a popular wellness activity, is a strong candidate for therapeutic intervention since it provides an integrated, multisensory approach that can engage the use of compensatory sensory inputs. For example, emphasizing firm foot placement while maintaining balance may activate the somatosensory system, thereby generating proprioceptive learning. An increase in proprioceptive joint sense in the elbow has been observed for congenitally blind children after one month of yoga training[<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Safely executing movement in standing or semi-inverted postures activates the vestibular system[<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. One study investigated highly trained yoga practitioners and found them more reliant on internal vestibular and proprioceptive signals than external visual cues in a multisensory integration perceptual task[<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. In another study, yoga participants were more able to retain balance on a vertical force platform in an eyes-closed condition compared to controls, indicating more effective use of proprioceptive cues[<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Balance improved substantially in a separate study using a timed, one-legged balance test after yoga training in healthy, younger adults[<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] and in normally sighted, older population[<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Yoga has been used in clinical settings to improve balance and posture for patients with osteoporosis[<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Studies have suggested that yoga may work by strengthening muscular endurance, proprioceptive awareness and by cultivating better breath control, which may facilitate steadiness and awareness in balance[<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Thus, targeted training, such as yoga, may significantly improve postural stability by strengthening the remaining sensory systems in our VI population.</p><p>The Ashtanga-based Yoga Therapy (AYT) is a highly modified Ashtanga yoga sequence developed specifically for the VI population by the author (PEJ)[<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Ashtanga is a system of yoga taught by Sri K. Pattabi Jois in Mysore, India. It is an integrated system of <italic>asanas</italic> (postures), <italic>vinyasa</italic> (movement), and <italic>ujjayi</italic> (victorious breath). Importantly, Ashtanga emphasizes the use of core locks called <italic>bandhas</italic>, prominently located at the root of the spine and lower abdomen comprising the pelvic area. Learning to engage these areas through standing and hip opening postures with coordinated movement may strengthen muscle and increase flexibility. Thus, the AYT sequence of postures was selected to promote balance with a focus on strength, hip opening (e.g., adduction, abduction) and ankle flexibility (e.g., dorsiflexion)[<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. While the sequence of <italic>asanas</italic> remains the same each session, each <italic>asana</italic> is modified to suit the individual&#x02019;s needs, and can be completed regardless of age, fitness, or level of experience. The feasibility of the AYT was evaluated in a previous pilot study and found to be suitable for a VI population since poses can be easily articulated verbally[<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. In the previous pilot study, three participants who completed the timed one-leg stand (OLS) developed an increase in static balance; however, changes in sensory contributions after AYT have yet to be evaluated.</p><p>The objective of the present study was to examine the influence of an 8-week AYT program on COP for VI individuals compared to a waitlist control. We introduce the novel use of a cost-friendly, readily accessible Wii Balance Board (WBB; Nintendo, Tokyo, Japan), an accessory to the popular Wii Fit video gaming system, as a standalone posturography device to quantify COP during static balance conditions[<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Specifically, we evaluated the results in the context of a COP stabilization or minimization framework. We hypothesized that COP displacement may increase, reflecting subtle adjustments in muscle control to achieve greater stability after AYT, in support of stabilization. We further hypothesized that AYT will develop the relative contributions of somatosensory and vestibular systems to postural stability.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec008"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec009"><title>Trial Design and Ethics Statement</title><p>We conducted a randomized, waitlist-controlled pilot study with VI individuals from the Maryland, Virginia, and Washington D.C. area. The study protocol (Protocol # NA_00039032) was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, followed the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki and is registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/">NCT01366677</ext-link>) .The approved protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information; see <xref rid="pone.0129646.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Protocol</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0129646.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 CONSORT Checklist</xref>. Initial screening was conducted over the phone. Due to transportation limitations, all assessments were conducted at the Lions Vision Center or the studio locations (a benefit of using the WBB). All participants provided written informed consent. After baseline assessments were completed, participants were randomized to either an 8-week AYT program or waitlist control group. Randomization to group assignment was conducted by the study PI using the random number generator in MATLAB (Mathworks, Inc.). A research assistant assigned unidentifiable subject IDs (i.e. #1&#x02013;21) to subjects after enrollment. Numbers (i.e. #1&#x02013;21) were randomly ordered in MATLAB and assigned to the randomly ordered anonymous subject IDs. Subject IDs that were paired with even numbers were assigned to the intervention and those paired with odd numbers were assigned to the waitlist control. Masking participants to the yoga intervention was not possible. After the initial AYT group completed the program and assessments were collected, the waitlist groups were invited to participate in the AYT program at no cost. To make the study more accessible to VI participants, the AYT program was conducted at studio locations in the Washington DC metro area, and participants were reimbursed for public transportation if needed. The multiple locations also allowed us to facilitate teacher-student interaction with smaller class sizes. Treatment fidelity was ensured as described below.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Deviations from study protocol</title><p>The trial protocol was written in a general format to address several research questions. An exploratory study [<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] was conducted previously to determine feasibility of the AYT and details preliminary findings, which informed the current study. The study presented here evaluates the hypotheses that absolute COP and the relative contribution of remaining sensory inputs to postural stability increases after an 8-week AYT program.

COP was measured for each mCTSIB condition. The participant&#x02019;s bare feet were placed on the WBB so that the inner edges of both feet were one-foot length (their own) apart, in four sensory conditions increasing in difficulty. The distance between the inner edges of the feet was divided in half and the subject was aligned accordingly with the halfway mark on the center of the WBB for all conditions during baseline and post-AYT. The feet position provides a wider base of support for our visually impaired study population in order to help promote safety in the foam condition and was chosen based on previous literature involving elderly patients with vision loss[<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].

The conditions were: standing on a firm surface with eyes open (Firm-EO); standing on a firm surface with eyes closed (Firm-EC); standing on an unstable (3&#x0201d; thick[<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]) surface with eyes open (Foam-EO; <xref rid="pone.0129646.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>); and standing on an unstable surface with eyes closed (Foam-EC). Thus, conditions with eyes closed disrupted the visual system, whereas conditions on Foam disrupted the somatosensory system. It is important to note that the VI participants in this study had varying degrees of remaining vision that could contribute to, or interfere with, posture stabilization; therefore, comparing the eyes open and closed conditions allowed us to determine visual dependency[<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The conditions within the balance tests were randomly ordered in both sessions. Prior to each condition, participants had a 30-second familiarization period to reduce learning effects. Participants performed each condition for 3 successive trials of up to 30 seconds each, with a one-minute rest period in between. MTV was calculated from COP data and was averaged across 3 trials. In order to minimize the influence of the vestibular system, participants were instructed to maintain a neutral head position, and when possible, to binocularly fixate on a black &#x0201c;X&#x0201d; taped on a white wall at eye level 35 inches in front of them while keeping their arms crossed over the chest.

Our sample is comprised of participants in age ranging from 27&#x02013;85 (median age = 59). If we re-characterize our sample regardless of original group assignment (i.e. AYT or waitlist) into two new groups separated using the median age of 59 as a cut-off (subjects &#x0003c; 60 years old, n = 9, and subjects &#x02265;60 years old, n = 8), we can conduct an independent samples t-test between groups on the baseline value for the most difficult condition where we might see the most differences in postural stability, Foam EC. We found no significant difference between age groups (t(15) = -1.43, p = 0.17), suggesting the groups were equivalent at baseline regardless of age or postural stability.</p><table-wrap

One participant opted out after two yoga classes due to dissatisfaction with the yoga program and expressed a preference for private yoga lessons. Another participant developed pain in her legs due to pre-existing peripheral neuropathy that was not reported during screening, which was an exclusion criterion. Two participants in the waitlist group were excluded from the final analysis; one due to newly developed health issues unrelated to the program and another due to time constraints and health prohibiting evaluation at study completion during the post-AYT assessment period.

In a future study, investigators may be interested in using an Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) to determine post-intervention effects between-groups, while controlling for baseline or some other covariate of interest (e.g., age). Between-group comparisons for the post-intervention measures control for non-specific effects (e.g., social interactions, placebo) that are difficult to manage in within-group comparisons. Here, we estimate an effect size based on the mean difference between the post-AYT measures in the absolute COP Foam EC condition divided by the pooled standard deviation. In an analysis of covariance (with baseline as the covariate) to detect an effect size of 0.45 for the post-intervention difference between treatment and control, participation by 41 participants achieves 80% power at the 0.05 alpha level. Anticipating a 20% dropout rate, one may enroll 50 participants total.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec036"><title>Discussion</title><p>The goal of this study was to determine the effect of AYT on COP and on the sensory contributions to postural stability in VI participants. Sensory integration of movement information from visual, somatosensory and vestibular systems contributes to postural stability[<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. After vision loss, re-weighting of the remaining sensory inputs is important for generating new postural strategies to maintain upright balance[<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Following the 8-week AYT program, this study found a significant increase in the MTV for the Foam<sub>EO</sub> and Foam<sub>EC</sub> conditions in which both somatosensory and visual systems were disrupted. Correspondingly, the relative contributions of the somatosensory (SI<sub>EO</sub>, SI<sub>EC</sub>) and vestibular systems (SI<sub>V</sub>) in our treatment group increased. As hypothesized for this VI population, vision did not play a significant role in postural stability, as indicated by non-significant changes in either MTV or SIs. Moreover, the waitlist control group showed no significant changes in any outcomes. Additionally, we determined that differences in the age range in our study population were not a factor in the results observed.</p><p>To our knowledge, this is the first time sensory input to postural stability has been evaluated as an objective outcome before and after yoga training in an aging, VI population. In an earlier review of yoga for balance in a healthy population[<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>], only one of 15 studies measured COP in a dynamic standing task, which suggests that measures of postural stability are underutilized. COP measures are objective and may be more sensitive to changes in postural stability in a clinical population, and less influenced by placebo effects, than self-reported outcome measures[<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. Despite the small sample size in the current study, the results showed a strong effect in the AYT group but not the control group, consistent across variables. In addition, the novel use of the WBB as a standalone posturography device introduces a possible cost-effective, portable alternative for measuring postural stability. Using COP and the mCTSIB protocol, the contribution of each sensory input in a clinical population can be evaluated, in order to devise tailored rehabilitation programs in the future.</p><p>The results of the present study support posture COP stabilization rather than a minimization hypothesis, which strongly suggests that AYT training could engage self-correcting mechanisms for postural control, such as up-weighting proprioceptive feedback, as well as increasing lower body strength and flexibility, which can potentially reduce fall risk. COP stabilization suggests that the greater COP displacement observed in this study represents greater integration of the remaining sensory systems to activate appropriate muscle responses used to control postural stability. This conclusion is further strengthened by the significant improvements in flexibility observed with the CSRT, consistent with the findings of Wayne et al.[<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Increased lower body flexibility is important for normal gait patterns during walking. The increase in lower body strength suggested by the 30s Chair Stand and OLS results further supports this claim. While the OLS does not provide information about sensory inputs, the ability to stand on a single leg is an important predictor of falls[<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. In addition, the biomechanical demands of certain poses, such as tree pose (<xref rid="pone.0129646.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>), have been shown to match balance potential[<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>].</p><fig id="pone.0129646.g003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0129646.g003</object-id><label>Fig 3</label><caption><title>Visually impaired students performing tree pose.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0129646.g003"/></fig><p>Furthermore and perhaps more compelling evidence in support of the stabilization hypothesis comes from a comparison of the post-AYT SI measures from our VI group to baseline SIs collected from normally-sighted, young adults (See <xref rid="pone.0129646.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Appendix</xref>). The data set for the normally-sighted individuals has been published elsewhere[<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] as part of a separate study to establish reliability of the WBB and therefore, we calculated the SI from the normal data for the purp ose of comparison with the SI for VI in the current paper. Comparing baseline SI from normally sighted individuals to post-AYT VI using independent samples t-tests indicate no difference between groups (SI<sub>EC</sub>: t(28) = 0.51, p = 0.62, SI<sub>VE</sub>: t(28) = -1.37, p = 0.18), suggesting that after AYT training the VI group approached the normally-sighted baseline (Figure A in <xref rid="pone.0129646.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Appendix</xref>). These findings are consistent with those of Tsang et. al.[<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] who found, in a cross-sectional study, that the vestibular contribution achieved by elderly Tai Chi practitioners was similar to that of young adult subjects rather than that of elderly non-Tai Chi practitioners, suggesting that despite age differences sensory re-weighting is amenable to training. We did find a significant difference between normal and VI for SI<sub>EO</sub>; however, this is to be expected as the normally-sighted group had full use of visual sensory information in EO conditions. The somatosensory contribution in the VI group is significantly greater than in the normal group, suggesting a greater use of somatosensory information. Although absolute COP values are greater than for healthy, normals in cross-sectional analyses, as evidenced by several notable studies supporting the COP minimization hypothesis[<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], COP measures may in fact reflect different postural strategies depending on the population[<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The relative contributions of sensory systems after training may reflect these differences more clearly.</p><p>Wolf and colleagues[<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] administered a 15-week Tai Chi program to healthy elderly adults (&#x0003e; 70 years of age) and found an increase in COP in somatosensory conditions with both EO and EC. This was reported as a negative effect compared to a group receiving computerized balance training. It was noted that the Tai Chi group reduced fear of falling outcomes while the balance group did not. Wolf et al.[<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] raised the possibility that training resulting in greater COP could lead to improved strategies for maintaining a wider base of support and improved confidence. Tai Chi practice, similar to yoga, involves shifting one&#x02019;s weight between double and single stance, body rotation and awareness of alignment[<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>], such that maintaining balance displacement within the limits of stability and/or base of support is constantly challenged[<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. More recently, Wayne et. al.[<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] compared a group of Tai Chi experts (average age 63 years, with 25 years of experience) to a group of Tai Chi na&#x000ef;ve participants (average age 65) in a cross-sectional study of community dwelling healthy adults and reported a trend towards higher MTV in the expert group. The na&#x000ef;ve participants were then randomized to usual care or 6-months of Tai Chi. After training in Tai Chi, the na&#x000ef;ve participants developed increased MTV and had values similar to the Tai Chi experts, which is in concordance with the findings in VI adults after AYT reported here. Gyllensten found that Tai Chi practitioners had better stability limits and body awareness compared to younger control subjects[<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. Increased limits of stability and engagement in controlled movements with improved balance control were reported in a group of Parkinson&#x02019;s patients after Tai Chi[<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], again supporting the plausibility of increased COP as a balance strategy for certain populations. Greater COP displacement has been has been reported to provide proprioceptive feedback in an elderly population[<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], specifically feedback from the ankle joint, which could compensate for visual deficits. Furthermore, maintaining balance by sensory reweighting of somatosensory or vestibular systems may involve better use of hip or ankle postural control strategies[<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p><p>The AYT was used to engage unimpaired sensory systems, i.e. somatosensory and vestibular, in order to compensate for vision loss in a safe environment that may have the added benefit of staving off conditions associated with age-related decline (e.g., deconditioning of motor and perceptual processes). Notably, it has been suggested that programs emphasizing multisensory training to improve balance may be more effective than programs emphasizing single sensory or modality training[<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The practice of yoga may improve the quality of the sensory information for VI persons by targeted engagement of compensatory systems. Yoga, in general, may be desirable choice for the aging VI populations because classes are widely available, movements are low-impact, and poses can be modified to suit the individual although it would be desirable to train more yoga instructors on adaptations necessary to work with VI individuals. Yoga has also been shown to have a low rate of side effects, low risk of injury and no known interactions with prescription medications[<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. Finally, a review of 12 studies (8 RCTs) that directly compared yoga to exercise found that yoga was equal to or significantly better as judged by health-related outcomes such as improved quality of life and reduced stress, in both healthy and clinical populations[<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref084" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>].</p><sec id="sec037"><title>Limitations</title><p>We used COP as a surrogate marker for falls. Without a prospective study measuring falls as an outcome, it is difficult to draw any conclusions about reduced fall risk. In the future, a prospective study with a longer-term yoga program and follow-up is warranted. Measuring static posturography in this study has granted us an understanding for multisensory integration and training unimpaired systems, however, measuring dynamic posturography in the future may be more relevant to determining anticipatory (e.g., obstacle avoidance) or compensatory (e.g., stumble recovery) postural adjustments after unpredictable perturbations during walking. Falls are a result of several intrinsic and extrinsic risk factors; and it will require a multifactorial approach to identify and manage those risks. Furthermore, in this study somatosensory and vestibular contributions to balance were inferred from COP data. In the future, it would be important to directly measure these contributions.</p><p>Limits of stability (LOS) were not measured in this study. LOS can be defined as when the center of gravity falls outside the base of support leading to an increase risk of falls[<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>] and is usually measured using the Functional Reach Test[<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. COP stabilization may imply an increase in the LOS. Alternatively, it is also possible that LOS could increase with COP minimization when different conditions are met the by the population of interest. Whether LOS is correlated with changes in COP is an empirical question. At least one study has claimed that there was a low correlation (r = 0.38) between the functional reach test and displacement of center of pressure in healthy, elderly people ages 60&#x02013;85[<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref086" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>].</p><p>Unlike a lab grade force platform, the Wii balance board only measures force in the vertical direction and is not able to detect the contribution of shear forces. Several studies have demonstrated that the Wii balance board has excellent reliability and validity when compared to a force plate[<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>], including our own reliability study in a visually impaired and normal population[<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. We don&#x02019;t expect that the displacement in our study would exceed the displacement one might expect in a dynamic task or single leg stand. We expect the effect of the shear forces on the COP to be minimal in the double-leg quiet stance. There is also evidence that the shear measurements may not be reliable in studies of postural responses among aging individuals[<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. Since the WBB was not designed to measure shear, we are not able to account for it in this study however, there is research supporting vertical COP as sufficient to detect balance impairments among a diverse population[<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p><p>Despite specific criteria to minimize heterogeneity in our VI population, there are likely to be individual differences. For example, visual function can vary according to severity, duration, and type of disease and may limit the interpretation of results, as we were unable to perform subgroup analyses given the small sample size in the current study. There is evidence that vision loss may accelerate the effects of postural instability during a wide age range[<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and considering the pilot nature of this study, we did not exclude participants based on age. However, the heterogeneity of VI participants in our trial may more accurately represent clinical situations, reflecting generalizability. The clinical significance of these results may not be immediately apparent without a long-term prospective study to measure falls and sustainability of effects. Qualitative data that was collected in the current study, to be presented elsewhere, may be more informative about potential clinically relevant outcomes. Due to the small sample size the present trial was not sufficiently powered to detect changes between the two groups for the outcomes after AYT; therefore a larger scale trial is warranted to explore those differences. Sampling bias occurs when there are systematic differences between groups being compared. In order to minimize the possibility of bias, we randomized the group assignment and further checked for statistical differences at baseline, of which we found none. Since this was an exploratory study, we did not correct for multiple statistical comparisons for the several tests included.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec038"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We conclude that greater MTV COP displacement observed post-AYT supports a COP stabilization hypothesis in a VI population. AYT training may activate better use of the remaining somatosensory and vestibular inputs to postural stability. This may be a meaningful and necessary self-correcting strategy for postural stability for a VI population at risk for falls. Knowing the relative sensory inputs to postural stability may help us understand the contribution of each system under different conditions. Multisensory training of the visual, vestibular or somatosensory systems has shown to significantly improve stability[<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129646.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].
