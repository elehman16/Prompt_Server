trunk-hip activation and pelvic tilt motion during standing in children with spastic
diplegia and compared the improvement of pelvic tilt between the modified trunk-hip
strengthening exercise and conventional exercise. [Subjects and Methods] Ten ambulant
children with spastic diplegia were randomized to the modified trunk-hip strengthening
exercise (<italic>n</italic> = 5) or conventional exercise (<italic>n</italic> = 5) group.
The intervention consisted of a 6-week modified trunk-hip strengthening exercise 3 times
per week. The children were tested for trunk-hip muscles activation and pelvic tilt motion
during standing by surface electromyography and an inclinometer before and after the
intervention. [Results] The anterior pelvic tilt angle and activation of the extensor
spinae, rectus femoris, and semitendinosus during standing decreased significantly in the
modified exercise group. The activation of extensor spinae differed significantly between
groups. [Conclusion] Compared to the conventional exercise, the modified exercise was more
effective for trunk-hip activation improvement and anterior pelvic tilt motion decrease
during standing in children with spastic diplegia. We suggest clinicians use an
individually tailored modified trunk-hip strengthening exercise for strengthening the
weakest muscle groups in children with standing ability problems.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Trunk-hip strengthening</kwd><kwd>Pelvic tilt</kwd><kwd>Cerebral palsy</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Cerebral palsy (CP) is a chronic neurologic disorder caused by a static lesion in the
immature brain and is characterized by deficits in movements and postural control. Because
of various muscle function impairments such as weakness, spasticity, incoordination, and
reduced selective motor control, many children with CP have difficulties with activities
such as propelling their wheelchairs, walking independently, negotiating steps on uneven
terrain and running<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. An important
treatment goal of therapeutic interventions for children with CP is to improve their ability
to walk or perform other functional activities. Most interventions aiming to improve
movement abilities in children with CP focus on muscle strength or skeletal alignment which
is only a secondary impairment<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Strength
training used to be avoided in children with CP because it could lead to increased
spasticity and reduced range of motion<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, systematic reviews provide
reasonable and sufficient evidences that muscle strength training improves functional motor
activity as well as strength in children with CP without adversely affecting spasticity or
range of motion<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>However, in recent years, rehabilitation interventions have focused on promoting muscle
strength<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Several studies provide
evidences supporting the benefits of strengthening programs in children with CP<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Damiano et al. found that children with
CP exhibit significantly improved quadriceps and knee extensor strength as a result of
muscle strength training. They also observed an improved gait pattern in children with CP,
such as decreased knee flexion during the stance phase and increased stride length during
gait<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, Eagleton et al.
report that a 6-week strengthening program in adolescents with CP increased distance walked
in 3 minutes, gait velocity, step length, and cadence<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The deviation of pelvic alignment in the standing position is a common problem in children
with CP. Such children retain an anterior pelvic tilt due to the contracture of the
iliopsoas muscle as well as weakness in the trunk flexors and hip extensors. Problems
associated with anterior pelvic tilt include femoral antetorsion and medial shift of the
patella to the sagittal plane bisection of the knee joint. Therefore, a major goal of
movement training is reciprocal control of the pelvis by improving interplay among the
abdominal obliques, rectus abdominalis, quadrates lumborum and lumbar extensor muscles<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>On the basis of previous studies, we hypothesized that strengthening the trunk and hip
muscles increases the muscle activation of the trunk and hips, and decreases the exaggerated
anterior pelvic tilt during quiet standing in children with spastic diplegia. Accordingly,
we designed modified trunk-hip strengthening exercises based on the core strength exercise
for adults and tailored to children<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.
The muscle activation patterns of the four exercises used in this study were analyzed from
the electromyography signal, which have been reported previously<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus, this
study evaluated the effects of trunk-hip strengthening exercise on trunk-hip activation and
pelvic tilt motion during standing in children with spastic diplegia and compared the
modified trunk-hip strengthening exercise with the conventional exercise with respect to the
improvement of pelvic tilt.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Ten ambulatory children with spastic diplegia were recruited from Bobath Children&#x02019;s

physiotherapy for 15 minutes and conventional trunk-hip strengthening exercise for 15

lower extremity lift. Meanwhile, the modified trunk-hip strengthening exercise group
received routine physiotherapy for 15 minutes and modified trunk-hip strengthening exercise
for 15 minutes. The newly designed exercise consisted of modified unilateral bridge exercise
and modified prone bridge exercise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Schematics and descriptions of the conventional (1, 2) and modified (3, 4) trunk-hip strengthening exercises</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jpts-27-1337-g001"/></fig>).</p><p>To measure the participants&#x02019; muscle activation, bipolar surface EMG (WEMG-8, LAXTHA, South
Korea) data from 5 muscles (listed below) were used. Before attaching the electrodes, the
skin was carefully shaved, rubbed, and cleaned with alcohol. The 5 sites on the dominant
side were as follows: (1) the rectus abdominis (RA) muscle at the level of the anterior
superior iliac spine, 1&#x02013;2&#x02005;cm lateral to the midline; (2) the erector spinae (ES) muscles,
1&#x02013;2 finger widths lateral from the L1 spinous process; (3) the gluteus maximus (GM) muscle,
50% of the distance from sacral vertebrae to the greater trochanter at the greatest
prominence of the middle buttocks parallel to a line from the posterior superior iliac spine
to the middle posterior thigh; (4) the rectus femoris (RF) muscle, 50% of the distance from
the anterior superior iliac spine to the superior patella; and (5) the semitendinosus (ST)
muscle, 50% of the distance from the ischial tuberosity to the medial tibial epicondyle. The
reference electrode was placed on the pectoralis major muscle. The EMG signals were
preamplified, filtered (input impedance, 10<sup>12</sup> &#x003a9;; common mode rejection ratio, 110
dB; bandpass digital filter, 50&#x02013;300&#x02005;Hz) and sampled at 1,024&#x02005;Hz. The raw EMG data were
converted into root mean square data using TeleScan version 3.3 (LAXTHA, Daejeon, South
Korea).</p><p>Pelvic tilt angle was evaluated by using a Dualer IQ inclinometer (JTECH Medical, Midvale,
USA). The primary sensor was placed on T12 and the secondary sensor was placed over the
sacral midpoint in the sagittal plane; we recorded the angle with the participant standing
in the neutral position, with knees straight, and weight equally on both feet.</p><p>Data analysis was performed using SPSS 19.0 (SPSS Ins., Chicago, USA). The level of
significance was set at p &#x0003c; 0.05. Data are expressed as mean &#x000b1; standard deviation. The
Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to analyze the differences in EMG data and pelvic tilt
motion before and after the intervention. The significance of differences between the
conventional and modified groups was evaluated by the Mann-Whitney U-test (<xref rid="tbl_002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title>Changes in pelvic tilt angle and muscle activation over 6 weeks</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="3" align="center" valign="middle" colspan="1">Variables</th><th colspan="3" valign="middle" align="center" rowspan="1">Conventional strengthening group</th><th colspan="3" valign="middle" align="center" rowspan="1">Modified strengthening group</th></tr><tr><th colspan="3" rowspan="1"><hr/></th><th colspan="3" rowspan="1"><hr/></th></tr><tr><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pre</th><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Post</th><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Change</th><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pre</th><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Post</th><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Change</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Angle (&#x000b0;)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">24.2 &#x000b1; 5.8</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">19.0 &#x000b1; 7.2</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02013;5.2 &#x000b1; 3.9</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">26.8 &#x000b1; 5.5</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">18.8 &#x000b1; 3.5<sup>*</sup></td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02013;8.0 &#x000b1; 4.0</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">RA</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5.8 &#x000b1; 1.4</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6.1 &#x000b1; 3.4</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.3 &#x000b1; 2.5</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7.9 &#x000b1; 3.7</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.9 &#x000b1; 1.6</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02013;3.0 &#x000b1; 3.6</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">ES</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">13.6 &#x000b1; 8.1</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">13.9 &#x000b1; 6.9</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.2 &#x000b1; 8.0</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">25.0 &#x000b1; 15.1</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">15.0 &#x000b1; 7.8<sup>*</sup></td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02013;10.0 &#x000b1; 7.7<sup>*</sup></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">GM</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7.3 &#x000b1; 5.8</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7.8 &#x000b1; 7.5</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.5 &#x000b1; 2.5</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.2 &#x000b1; 1.4</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.6 &#x000b1; 2.3</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.4 &#x000b1; 1.9</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">RF</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">15.6 &#x000b1; 8.5</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">12.9 &#x000b1; 6.4</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02013;2.7 &#x000b1; 4.6</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7.8 &#x000b1; 4.3</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5.3 &#x000b1; 3.6<sup>*</sup></td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02013;2.5 &#x000b1; 1.4</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">ST</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">15.0 &#x000b1; 10.3</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7. 7 &#x000b1; 1.5</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02013;7.1 &#x000b1; 11.3</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">31.9 &#x000b1; 18.0</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">15.7 &#x000b1; 5.0<sup>*</sup></td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02013;16.2 &#x000b1; 15.0</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Data are mean &#x000b1; SD. <sup>*</sup> p &#x0003c; 0.05.

muscle activation and pelvic tilt motion during standing in children with spastic diplegia
and compared the modified trunk-hip strengthening exercise with conventional exercise with
respect to the improvement of pelvic tilt. The results show that pelvic anterior tilt during
standing decreased after 6-week interventions in both the modified and conventional exercise
groups, but only the modified exercise group decreased significantly.</p><p>Pelvic position during activities performed in a closed kinematic chain depends on the
integrity of the osteoligamental system, the adequate interaction between muscles and
fascia, appropriate neuromuscular control, and anatomically remote factors such as the
alignment of the lower-limbs joints<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>.
In particular, anterior pelvic tilt is performed by active force-coupling between the hip
flexors and low-back extensors. In contrast, children with CP exhibit passive anterior
pelvic tilt owing to contracture of the iliopsoas muscle and weakness of the trunk flexors
and hip extensors<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, pelvic
tilt exercises for children with CP should enhance the strength of these muscles, especially
the force-coupling generation between the trunk flexors (i.e., RA and obliquus externus
abdominis) and hip extensors (i.e., GM and hamstrings)<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. The significant decrease in pelvic anterior tilt during standing
after the 6-week intervention could be due to increased activation of the hip extensors and
diminished activation of the hip flexors. The EMG results showed significant decreases in
the activations of the ES, RF, and ST muscles and a significant increase in GM activation in
the modified exercise group. Therefore, the modified trunk-hip strengthening exercise
appeared diminish excessive the hip flexor activation and increase hip extensor activation,
albeit in a limited manner.</p><p>Decreased ES activation is another reason for the significant change in pelvic tilt in the
modified exercise group. This result is consistent with previous studies showing lower ES
activation after a modified trunk-hip strengthening exercise (i.e., modified unilateral
bridging and modified prone bridging) compared to conventional exercise (i.e., bridging and
modified crawling position)<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. It is
hypothesized that anterior pelvic tilt is linearly associated with a force-coupling between
the hip flexors and low-back extensor muscles. The present results suggest the modified
trunk-hip strengthening exercise would produce a greater improvement in pelvic tilt motion
during standing with diminished activation of the hip flexors and back extensors as well as
increased activation of the hip extensors and trunk flexors.</p><p>In general, the contraction of &#x0201c;antigravity&#x0201d; muscles is primarily responsible for
maintaining the body in an upright position both in both static and dynamic postures. The
hip, knee, trunk, and neck extensors are considered major antigravity muscles. Other related
muscles include the neck flexors and lateral benders, trunk flexors and lateral benders, hip
abductors and adductors, and ankle pronators and supinators<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, the present results indicate our exercise program is
effective for strengthening the muscles required for standing.</p><p>Even highly functional children with spastic CP are likely to have considerable weakness in
their involved extremities compared to age-related peers, with the degree of weakness
increasing with the level of neurologic involvement. Such weakness limits functional
performance in children with CP but can be improved through training. In addition,
therapists should be more proactively involved in the prevention of secondary impairments as
well as the promotion of wellness and fitness in their patients. Strength and endurance
training are important components of fitness, and may improve health throughout life and
increase participation in recreational, social, and occupational activities in children and
adults with CP<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. Several recent studies
of a more specific group of children with reported standing ability problems suggest more
individually tailored exercises could be improved by emphasizing the training of the weakest
muscle groups<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. On the basis of the present results, the modified trunk-hip
strengthening exercise could be used for specific muscles or muscle groups to improve the
standing posture of children with CP.</p><p>This study has several limitations that should be discussed. One limitation is the short
intervention period for the strength training program. Six weeks is reported to be the
minimum time required to observe increases in the strength of adults. However, Eagleton et
al.<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup> suggest a similar or greater period
is required for children or adolescents with CP. Another limitation of the present study is
its small sample size. Finally, the participants were from a specific region around Bobath
Children&#x02019;s Hospital in South Korea.</p><p>In conclusion, our modified trunk-hip strengthening exercise is more effective for
improving trunk-hip activation and decreasing anterior pelvic tilt motion during standing in
children with spastic diplegia than the conventional trunk-hip strengthening exercise.
Therefore, we suggest using individually tailored modified trunk-hip strengthening exercise
programs like the one described herein to strengthen the weakest muscle groups of children
with reported standing ability problems.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This research was supported by a research grant from Catholic University of Daegu in
