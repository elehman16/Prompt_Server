However, there is currently no confirmed standard treatment for cancer-related fatigue, and thus, many patients who suffer cancer-related fatigue seek complementary and alternative medicines such as moxibustion. Moxibustion is one of the most popular therapies in traditional Korean medicine used to manage fatigue. Recent studies have also demonstrated that moxibustion is effective for treating chronic fatigue. However, there is insufficient evidence supporting the effect of moxibustion against cancer-related fatigue. The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of moxibustion treatment for cancer-related fatigue.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p id="Par2">A multi-center, three-armed parallel, randomized controlled trial will be conducted. Ninety-six patients with cancer-related fatigue will be recruited from three clinical research centers. They will be randomly allocated to one of three groups in a 1:1:1 ratio. The moxibustion group will receive moxibustion treatment at CV8, CV12, LI4 and ST36. The sham moxibustion group will receive sham moxibustion at non-acupoints. Both the moxibustion and sham moxibustion groups will receive 30-min treatments twice a week for 8&#x000a0;weeks. The usual care group will not receive moxibustion treatment. All participants will be educated via a brochure on how to manage cancer-related fatigue in daily life. The outcome measurements will be evaluated at baseline, week 5, week 9, and week 13 by assessors who are blinded to the group allocation. The primary outcome measure will be the mean change in the average scores of the Brief Fatigue Inventory before and after treatments between groups. The secondary outcome measures will be the mean difference in changes from baseline of the Brief Fatigue Inventory, functional assessments of cancer therapy-fatigue, European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire C-30 scores, and Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores between groups. Safety will be assessed by monitoring adverse events at each visit.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">The results of this study will provide evidence to confirm whether moxibustion can be used as a therapeutic option for treating cancer-related fatigue.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par4">Clinical Research Information Service <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://cris.nih.go.kr/cris/en/search/search_result_st01.jsp?seq=6863">KCT0002170</ext-link>.

Cancer-related fatigue is one of the most common symptoms that cancer patients experience [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and is among the most prominent residual or persistent symptoms of cancer survivors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Cancer-related fatigue often occurs during the cancer treatment period, although it may occur independent of treatment and sometimes continues to persist even after the end of treatment or the complete remission of cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par33">Cancer-related fatigue reduces the level of energy and decreases the QOL of cancer patients, negatively affecting the return-to-work rate of cancer survivors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. It also seriously damages the QOL of the families in addition to cancer patients in terms of physical, social, economic, psychological and spiritual aspects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. However, it is not a fatal condition that directly threatens the survival of cancer patients. Therefore, it is recognized to be relatively less important than other critical issues regarding cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Moreover, the definition of cancer-related fatigue is completely dependent on the subjective sense of tiredness felt by the patient, and therefore, it is easy to overlook when the patient does not actively report the symptom [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par34">The mechanism of cancer-related fatigue has been reported to be associated with cytokine production or mediators of inflammatory responses of cancer and/or cancer treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In particular, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha signaling seems to be closely related to cancer-related fatigue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In addition to inflammation and latent viral reactivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], other various factors such as oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], changes in the neuroendocrine system including dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, autonomic nervous system disorders including central vagal stimulation, serotonin dysregulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], and changes in muscle and ATP metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], have been reported to be involved in cancer-related fatigue. However, the mechanism of cancer-related fatigue has not yet been fully elucidated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par35">There are various known risk factors related to cancer-related fatigue, including the stage of cancer, the specific type of cancer (breast, colon, liver) and diabetes, high body mass index, genetic factor, psychological and biobehavioral factors such as the level of fatigue before cancer treatment, depression, sleep disturbances, physical activity and physical deconditioning, negative expectation, etc. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The cancer itself, various cancer treatments, and accompanying diseases such as anemia, cachexia, etc., also appear to be related to cancer-related fatigue, but the degree of their contributions and how such risk factors interact remain unclear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. To date, the cause of cancer-related fatigue has not been explicitly identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par36">The first step in managing cancer-related fatigue is determining the possible causes of fatigue and correcting them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. However, as previously discussed, a variety of factors are involved and contribute to cancer-related fatigue, and therefore, it is very difficult to identify specific causes and to completely eliminate fatigue among cancer patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. There is currently no standard therapy for treating cancer-related fatigue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p id="Par37">For pharmacologic therapy to mitigate cancer-related fatigue, antidepressants and psychostimulants such as methylphenidate, modafinil, and bupropion and steroids such as dexamethasone have been proposed and studied, but the results of clinical trials are inconsistent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. According to a recent meta-analysis, methylphenidate was significantly better than placebo, while the effect of modafinil was similar to that of placebo, although further studies are needed to confirm this conclusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Considering that the clinical effects of these drugs are unclear and the risk of adverse drug reactions are of high concern, especially for long-term use, no specific drug is currently recommended as a primary therapeutic option for cancer-related fatigue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p id="Par38">Despite the lack of a standard therapy for cancer-related fatigue, the high number of patients who suffer from cancer-related fatigue has created a demand for complementary alternative medicine (CAM). A systematic review reported that CAM utilization rates among cancer patients range from 11 to 95% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. According to a survey targeting breast cancer survivors in the United States, one third of patients used CAM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Another survey conducted among South Korean cancer patients reported that more than half of respondents used CAM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p id="Par39">Moxibustion is one of the most commonly used treatments in traditional medicine in East Asia including Korea. It has been used to prevent and treat various diseases by warming the body and promoting the energy of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Moxibustion is particularly good at supplementing energy (<italic>qi</italic>), and thus, it has been often applied to patients who experience fatigue or similar conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Modern scientific studies also have shown that moxibustion is effective in alleviating chronic fatigue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], and some parts of its mechanism have been reported to be related to activation of the vagus nerve [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], reduction of oxidative damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], improvement of inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], regulation of the HPA axis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], and upregulation of hippocampal progranulin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par40">Lee et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] showed the possibility of using moxibustion to treat cancer-related fatigue through a systematic review and meta-analysis of related literature. However, all the studies included in this review were reported and conducted only in China, and most of the studies had high risk of bias. The details of moxibustion treatment used in each study were not described based on the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) or on the Standards for Reporting Interventions in Clinical Trials of Acupuncture (STRICTA), and most of the studies did not report of adverse events (AEs) and drop-outs. Thus, Lee et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] concluded that a well-designed clinical trial with better reporting quality is warranted to draw any conclusion regarding the effect of moxibustion for treatment of cancer-related fatigue. Recently, Mao et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] demonstrated that their newly devised method of infrared laser moxibustion was more effective in reducing the level of fatigue than sham moxibustion. However, infrared laser moxibustion is not yet commonly used in Korea. More evidence is needed to confirm the effectiveness and safety of moxibustion against cancer-related fatigue.</p><p id="Par41">Therefore, we designed this randomized controlled trial to compare the clinical responses of moxibustion, sham moxibustion, and usual care interventions in patients with cancer-related fatigue.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Design</title><p id="Par42">This is a multi-center, three-armed parallel, randomized controlled trial.

Although the prevalence of cancer-related fatigue varies among studies, it is generally reported that approximately 60 to 100% of cancer survivors experience cancer-related fatigue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Cancer-related fatigue lowers the QOL of the family of the patient in addition to the cancer patient and can become a socially obvious burden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Although a variety of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic therapies for treating cancer-related fatigue have been evaluated in the clinical trials, no treatments have been confirmed as valid and safe for long-term use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Therefore, it is important to confirm whether moxibustion, one of the oldest but most popular therapies in traditional East Asian medicine, including Korean medicine, is a viable therapeutic option for the management of cancer-related fatigue.</p><p id="Par108">The moxibustion treatment regimen was established based on the findings of the relative studies that were previously published. Although there were few studies with good quality evaluating the effect of moxibustion for the patients with cancer-related fatigue, a recent publication by Mao et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. using infrared laser moxibustion was helpful. Mao et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. reported that the moxibustion reduced the BFI score during the 4-week treatment period, however, it tended to stagnate at follow-up session at week 8. Another study by Mao et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] targeting the breast cancer patients with psychological distress including cancer-related fatigue was also reliable even though its intervention was electroacupuncture, not moxibustion. According to this study, the BFI score decreased during the 8-week of treatment period, and then the improvement trend was stopped 4&#x000a0;weeks after the completion of the treatment. Therefore, we expect to see how the BFI will change during and after the 8-week treatment period.</p><p id="Par109">It is known that the placebo effect has a high proportion in the palliative care for the cancer survivors with cancer-related fatigue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. It varies by 27&#x02013;60% depending on the studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Besides, the sham control interventions of traditional medicine such as moxibustion or acupuncture are not reported to be physiologically inert [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Considering the clinical characteristics of the cancer-related fatigue which is sensitive to the placebo response and the unique nature of the sham moxibustion, we cannot rule out the possibility that the difference between the effects of real moxibustion and sham moxibustion will not be statistically significant even though the moxibustion treatment is actually effective because of the placebo effect. This is why we designed a 3-arm parallel study of the usual care group as well as the sham control group.</p><p id="Par110">There are some limitations to this study. First, the outcome measures do not include objective indicators for assessing the level of fatigue. Because fatigue itself is defined as the subjective feeling of the patient, there is currently no way to objectively evaluate it. Some studies have reported that various biomarkers, such as TNF-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-6, IL-2, CRP, etc., are associated with cancer-related fatigue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], although the results of these studies are not consistent in regarding this issue. Therefore, there is currently no confirmed biomarker that represents the level of cancer-related fatigue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. When definitive biomarkers are discovered in the future, additional clinical trials will need to consider them. Nevertheless, the use of questionnaires to regarding the level of the subjective feelings of fatigue of the subjects is the most widely used method to assess or quantify fatigue as objectively as possible in the field, and we adopted the BFI and FACT-F according to this gold-standard.</p><p id="Par111">Second, there is a limitation pertaining to incomplete blinding. We used moxibustion devices that appeared to be identical in the moxibustion and sham moxibustion groups in an attempt to achieve patient blinding between these two groups. However, it is not possible to blind the participants in the usual care group that do not receive moxibustion treatment. Thus, there could be a concern that this incomplete blinding of participants in the usual care group may introduce bias into the results regarding the outcome measures based on the subjective symptoms that the patients feel.</p><p id="Par112">However, Atkinson et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>] recently showed that there is no clear evidence that the patient blinding is a source of bias in the patient-reported outcome (PRO) or at least that the bias significantly affects the results of the PRO. They insisted that, in clinical trials of therapies for cancer patients, the use of PRO, which is essential for directly assessing the risks, benefits, and value of the therapies to cancer patients, should be promoted regardless of patient blinding because there is no other means that provides information by completely capturing the patient&#x02019;s experience related to the treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Based on such expert opinions, we will adopt a three-armed parallel design, including a usual care group in addition to a sham control group, in this trial even though the primary outcome measure is highly dependent on the patients&#x02019; subjectivity.</p><p id="Par113">There is another limitation in terms of patient blinding. The moxibustion delivered to the sham group is designed to not deliver complete warmth to the site of application; therefore, the patients of this group may notice that the treatment is not real moxibustion because it is not sufficiently hot. To prevent this possibility, only patients who have never received moxibustion treatment should be recruited for inclusion. However, this inclusion criterion could significantly lower the recruitment rate. Thus, we decided to register patients regardless of their past experience using moxibustion treatment. To further mitigate this limitation, the real and sham moxibustion devices used in the study will have the same appearance. In addition, the patients will be allowed observe the procedures that the practitioner carries out while operating the moxibustion devices: In case of IM, the participants of both groups will see the smoke and smell the odor from the burning mugwort moxa cone after the practitioner ignites it; and in case of EM, the participants will see the practitioner turn on the EM, which will begin to blink. Finally, we will perform a blinding test to confirm whether patient blinding had been successfully achieved in these two groups.</p><p id="Par114">There are a variety of types in cancer, although patients with cancer-related fatigue will be allowed to participate in this study regardless of cancer type. Some researchers have suggested that patients with cancer at specific sites may be more vulnerable to cancer-related fatigue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], although it has not been clearly investigated how specific types of cancer develop or affect fatigue. Therefore, we will comprehensively recruit patients regardless of cancer type in this study. However, if the results of this study or future studies by experts in the field demonstrate more promising clues regarding the relationship between specific cancer types and cancer-related fatigue, a new clinical trial targeting only patients with limited types of cancer should be designed.</p><p id="Par115">Cancer-related fatigue is a symptom that patients can experience before cancer diagnosis, during cancer progression, during cancer treatment, after cancer treatment, or even after cancer remission. However, &#x02018;during cancer treatment&#x02019; and &#x02018;immediately after cancer treatment&#x02019; are known time periods during which cancer-related fatigue is most common and most prominent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. It has also been reported that the type of cancer treatment such as chemotherapy or radiotherapy can contribute in different ways to cancer-related fatigue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. The regimen of the treatment, for example, the type of drugs or the dose of radiation, might differentially affect fatigue. However, considering the practical feasibility of the clinical trial, we decided to exclude those who are currently undergoing active treatment for cancer or scheduled to receive cancer treatment in the near future. Therefore, the results of this study will not shed light on the effect of moxibustion at the peak of cancer-related fatigue.</p><p id="Par116">One of the distinct features of this study is that the participants will be categorized based on patterns as cold or hot and as deficiency or excess. In traditional medicine, pattern identification is a way to categorize a patient according to the signs and symptoms of several patterns, and doctors can determine how to treat the patient based on the identified patterns. Moxibustion is a widely used intervention in traditional Korean medicine and is often chosen as a better option, especially for patients categorized by cold or deficiency patterns. For this reason, we will adopt the questionnaire for cold-hot and deficiency-excess pattern categorization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. We will conduct subgroup analyses according to the identified patterns to determine whether moxibustion is more effective in cold-type patients than in hot-type patients and whether it improves the symptoms of deficiency-type patients better than excess-type patients. We will also determine whether such patterns are similar or different between the sham moxibustion group and the usual care group. We believe that such an analysis is a meaningful scientific exploration for investigating the clinical and practical value of the concept in traditional Korean medical theory, and the results of this study will help to identify patients who are best suited for moxibustion and related therapies.</p><p id="Par117">Another characteristic of this study is that it assesses not only fatigue but other biobehavioral factors, such as QOL and cognitive function. A previous study reported that cancer-related fatigue negatively influences the QOL and cognitive function of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. Thus, we seek to comprehensively evaluate the effect of moxibustion on various aspects of daily life that patients with cancer-related fatigue experience.</p><p id="Par118">A variety of factors are known to influence the cancer-related fatigue as well as cancer treatment and cancer itself [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In this study, the patients with prominent risk factors that are known to contribute to cancer-related fatigue will be screened out to eliminate confounding factors and to focus on cancer-related fatigue. Thus, the eligibility criteria include the exclusion of patients who have current severe inflammation or anemia, clinically significant insomnia, moderate or higher levels of emotional disturbances such as anxiety or depression, and definite cancer pain. The attempt to select purely tired cancer patients with minimal other pathological causes of fatigue is a strength of this study, although as a result, the results of this study cannot be applied to patients with cancer-related fatigue combined with these conditions. Therefore, these results as they apply to patients with multiple conditions need to be further examined in future studies.</p><sec id="Sec28"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par119">The trial is currently recruiting participants.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec29"><p>
