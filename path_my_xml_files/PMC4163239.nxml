<bold><italic>Objective:</italic></bold> To determine the effectiveness of kayaking exercises in the management of axial rigidity, improve bed mobility by improving trunk rotation in Parkinson&#x02019;s patients.</p><p>
<bold><italic>Methods:</italic></bold> Experimental randomized controlled trail conducted at Physiotherapy department of IPM&#x00026;R, DUHS and neurology Outpatient Department of Civil Hospital Karachi. Sample size of 48 was calculated with the use of openEpi. After baseline assessment 24 participants were assigned to each Kayaking exercise and general mobility exercise groups. Both groups received treatment for 75 minutes, 6 days a week for 4 weeks. Pre and post treatment measurements were determined by goniometer that assessed the cervical and thoracolumbar rotations whereas bed mobility was assessed by Modified Parkinson&#x02019;s Activity Scale (MPAS). </p><p>
<bold><italic>Results: </italic></bold>In Kayaking group mean cervical spine left rotation increased from 32.95<underline>+</underline> 9.66 to 47.25 <underline>+</underline> 10.58, right side cervical spine rotation increased from 34.00 <underline>+ </underline>10.32 to 47.58 <underline>+</underline> 11.96, left side thoracolumbar rotation increased from 23.67 <underline>+</underline> 4.70 to 28.16 <underline>+</underline> 3.44, right side thoracolumbar rotation increased from 20.79 <underline>+</underline> 5.34 to 26.45 <underline>+</underline> 4.62. In control group mean cervical spine left rotation increased from 34.66<underline>+</underline> 9.26 to 43.08 <underline>+</underline> 8.70, right side cervical spine rotation increased from 35.37 <underline>+ </underline>9.77 to 43.83 <underline>+</underline> 9.59 , left side thoracolumbar rotation increased from 23.70 <underline>+</underline> 4.77 to 26.87 <underline>+</underline> 3.73, right side thoracicolumbar rotation increased from 21.16 <underline>+</underline> 5.29 to 24.95 <underline>+</underline> 4.53 (P value &#x0003c;0.001).. Bed mobility on MPAS scale also showed significant improvements (P value &#x0003c;0.001).</p><p>
<bold><italic>Conclusion:</italic></bold> Both Kayaking and general exercises resulted in significant improvements after 4 weeks of treatment.

Patients were selected from OPD of neurology Civil Hospital Karachi. Both males and females&#x02019; age 35-65 years who were diagnosed with idiopathic Parkinson&#x02019;s disease stage 1-3 on Hoehn &#x00026; Yahr scale and had no associated medical condition were included. Patients with dementia, Alzheimer disease, stroke and other movement disorders like parkinsonian plus syndromes were excluded. The study was conducted between May 2011 and December 2011 after approval from institutional review board (IRB) of Dow University of Health Sciences. Sample size of 48 individuals, 24 each group, was selected, with &#x003b1; = 10% and power = 90%.</p><p>Forty eight subjects&#x02019; fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were included to participate in the study. After taken written consent purposive sampling technique was used to assign subjects into two groups. Group &#x02018;A&#x02019; was experimental group and included kayaking exercises consisting of big, flowing, multi segmental movements of whole body and involves rotatory movements of trunk. Group &#x02018;B&#x02019; included strengthening exercises of the upper limbs, lower limbs and core stabilizers. Both groups started their sessions with breathing exercises and warm ups which were proceeded by stretching exercises of neck, arms, legs and trunk. All the exercises were demonstrated to the patients by the physical therapist and were performed under the supervision of the physical therapist. Therapy duration was of four weeks, numbers of sessions were 24 and each session was of 75 minutes, 6 days per week. Pre and post treatment evaluation of bed mobility and axial rigidity was measured using the modified Parkinson&#x02019;s activity scale (MPAS). MPAS is a comprehensive practical test for gait and transfers (including rolling over in bed). The test is a valid and reliable instrument for patients with PD and gives relevant information for the diagnostic and therapeutic processes. It is scored from 0 to 4. <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table-I</xref>.

Bed mobility with cover and without cover also significantly improved in both treatment groups (P-value &#x0003c; 0.001) measured with modified Parkinson&#x02019;s activity scale (MPAS).</p><p>To the best of our knowledge this was the first study looked at the effectiveness of kayaking exercises over general mobility exercises in improving the axial rigidity and bed mobility in Parkinson&#x02019;s patients in Pakistan.</p><p>According to Hoehn and Yahr scale axial rigidity manifests its symptoms in the 1.5 stage of the disease (stage 1.5 &#x02013;stage 3 of Hoehn and Yahr scale represents early to mid-stage of the disease). Work of Schenkman also support that spinal range of motions are affected in early stage of the disease and showing better results if involved in exercises in this stage.<sup><xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup><sup>,</sup><xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> On the basis of previous researches of Schenkman <italic>et al.,</italic><sup><xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> this study included patients from 1.5 to 3 Hoehn and Yahr stage of PD because these stages are characterized by axial involvement without loss of balance and showed significant improvements in both groups. The results of this study also found kayaking and other general mobility exercises are successful in early stages of the disease.</p><p>In Axial rigidity spinal movements mostly impaired are extension and rotation and patients tends to adapt a flexed posture that reduce their functional movements and impairs sleep.<sup><xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Therefore this study was focused on the rotations of cervical and thoracolumbar spine. Serrao <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> and Roberto <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> studied flexion, extension and lateral flexion movements and reported improvement in extension and lateral flexion but no improvement was reported in rotation. King and Horak<sup><xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> devised a sensory motor agility program for Parkinson&#x02019;s patients and suggested kayaking to be helpful in improving axial rigidity. Thus the effects of kayaking exercises were studied in improving axial rigidity and bed mobility along with general mobility exercises which were designed by Canadian society of Parkinson&#x02019;s disease. As far as author&#x02019;s knowledge is concerned, there is little data published on the effects of kayaking exercises on axial rigidity in improving bed mobility. However many patients do exercise kayaking as leisure activity in western countries<sup><xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> but not in Pakistan. According to the results of our study trunk flexibility can be improved by kayaking exercises which supports the findings of Schenkman and his colleagues.<sup><xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup><sup>,</sup><xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>,</sup><sup><xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup></p><p>Recently, Schenkman and colleagues<sup><xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> found that flexibility, balance and functional exercises were more beneficial in improving overall functional ability. Our study did not include the overall functional ability but just focused on the bed mobility which is one of the functional problems faced by PD patients and showed positive results. The improvement in rotations and MPAS scores in current study are in concurrence to the findings of<sup><xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> that early rehabilitation in PD patients benefits the PD sufferers. Participants of the control group also showed equally good response to the general exercises as kayaking group participants, which might be due to the reason that majority of these participants, before entering the research were actively involved in general Parkinson&#x02019;s rehabilitation program. Whereas kayaking group participants were all new to any post Parkinson&#x02019;s rehab program. However, participants of kayaking exercises showed better improvements in ranges and on MPAS as compared to the general mobility exercises. The&#x000a0;difference in results between Kayaking group and control group might be due to the reason that kayaking movements include alternate limb girdle movement that diminishes the reciprocal movements and facilitates rhythmic movements which are lost or minimized due to basal ganglia defect.<sup><xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Although, in this study, no subjective outcome measure was used, but people in kayaking group reported functional improvements in terms of various movements e.g. 2-3 patients reported less resistance while performing their prayers like sajda and rukoo, or in overhead activities. Since axial rigidity not only affects trunk rotations but also have great impact on girdle limb association.<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></p><p>In this study, degree of rotation at cervical spine and thoracolumbar spine were measured and modified Parkinson&#x02019;s activity scales were selected as outcome measures. Although studies related to spinal range of motion used functional axial rotation test (FAR) or twister, <sup><xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> but none of the method was feasible in our scenario. Therefore universal goniometer was used for measuring cervical and thoracolumbar degree of rotation and Modified Parkinson&#x02019;s activity scale was used to assess bed mobility. MPAS was used as it proved to be a better instrument as it measures the details of every movement. It showed good concurrent validity (0.64) and (0.79) with UPDRS III and VAS global functioning respectively.<sup><xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup></p><p>There were 24 patients in each group with 3 females and 21 males which is similar to the fact that PD is more prevalent in males than females.<sup><xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> About 62.12% of participants&#x02019; were in Hoehn and Yahr stage 1.5 supporting the view that axial involvement exist in early stage of the disease.<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> All of them belong to the age group from 40 to 70 years (37.50%); of them majority of patients lie in the age group of 50 to 70 years which is similar to the findings of other studies that PD is more prevalent in old age.<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> It is also evident in young age group as in this study approximately 25% participants belonged to young age group. Although, the inclusion criteria of this study limit the age from 35 to 65 years but, when participants were assessed for the study not a single patient was found in the age of 35. However, during screening there were patients who belong to this age group but they did not have axial rigidity or impaired bed mobility. In the same manner patients with age 70 were enrolled in this study as their severity of disease was lying in mild to moderate range at Hoehn and Yahr scale with impaired bed mobility. In current study, duration of disease among the participants was found to be 1 to 2 years and 3 to 4 years also supporting the Hoehn and Yahr stage which suggests axial involvement begins in early to mid-early stage of disease.<sup><xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup></p><p>All patients in this study were on medications as prescribed by the doctor, majority of them were on combination of drugs. Different people were on different combinations and we were unable to homogenize the medication among all as it may have negative impact on their health status. However, there were patients in both groups who were not taking medicines as their doctor did not prescribe any and told them that they were not in need of medicine right now, but they were having difficulty in overhead activities and rolling. They reported better improvement to the treatment supporting the view that exercises helps in improving dopamine functioning.<sup><xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p><p>
<bold><italic>Limitations of the study: </italic></bold>The assessor of the study was not blind and the participants in control group were actively involved in a supervised exercise group before entering the research which could have impact on results. All participants were on different medicines and it was a short duration study without long term follow up.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>In conclusion, both Kayaking and general exercises resulted in significant improvements in cervical spine and thoracolumbar spine left and right side rotation range of motion and bed mobility after 4 weeks of treatment. However, Kayaking exercises were slightly more clinically beneficial than general exercises. Further research is required to explore this further. </p></sec><sec><title>Authors Contribution:</title><p>
