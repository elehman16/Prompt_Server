If no specific measures are taken to prevent this hemodynamic response, the HR can increase from 26% to 66% depending on the method of induction and the SBP can increase from 36% to 45%.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>Myocardial ischemia might occur during the induction-intubation sequence in patients with coronary artery disease. Intraoperative ischemia has been associated with a high rate of perioperative myocardial infarction.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Interventions like direct laryngoscopy involving severe sympathetic stimuli, prevention of tachycardia, hypertension and elevated total oxygen consumption due to sympathetic activity may prove beneficial in patients with limited cardiac reserve.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>Various studies have reviewed the effect of lignocaine to blunt the sympathoadrenal pressure response. Lev and Rosen in their study reviewed the use of prophylactic lignocaine as a preintubation medication.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] A dose of 1.5 mg/kg intravenously 3 min prior to intubation was employed and was found to be optimal for attenuation of the sympathoadrenal pressure response to laryngoscopy and intubation without any overt harmful effects. We also administered lignocaine 1.5 mg/kg 3 min before intubation in our study and observed a general decline in HR, SBP, and DBP as is represented by the interpretation of Graphs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">9</xref>. The decrease in HR and blood pressure in our study might also be attributed to the use of anesthetic agents such as opioids (fentanyl) and inhalational agents.</p><p>Wilson <italic>et al</italic>. in their study stated that IV lignocaine is beneficial in preventing the hemodynamic changes to laryngoscopy and intubation.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Their results are reiterated by our study too in which we have described similar results. We noted the maximal decline of HR to be at 3 min after intubation [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Graph 1</xref>], while the maximal decline in SBP and DBP is observed at 5 min postintubation [Graphs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">9</xref>]. However this decline of HR and blood pressure can possibly be attributed to the combined effects of fentanyl and inhalational agents administered during the maintenance of anesthesia. From our statistical analysis we also infer from [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>] that though there is a general decline in HR after administration of lignocaine, but at the time interval corresponding to 1 min postintubation, we observed an increase in HR. This shows that the pressure response was incompletely abolished by lignocaine.</p><p>Malde and Sarode in their study concluded that on comparison of lignocaine in a dose of 1.5 mg/kg and fentanyl 2 &#x003bc;g/kg for suppression of hemodynamic response to endotracheal intubation, fentanyl was found to be relatively superior.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Lignocaine attenuated the rise in blood pressure while fentanyl prevented it totally. The rise persisted for 3 min in the lignocaine but 10 min in the control group. The fentanyl group also showed a significant decrease in SBP after administration, which came back to normal at 1-3 min following intubation. In our study we found that lignocaine sufficiently attenuated the above mentioned hemodynamic response, but this attenuation was not complete and a spike in SBP was observed 1 min postintubation [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Graph 5</xref>]. We also we noticed 2 spikes at 1 min and 3 min intervals postintubation in the DBP recordings [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Graph 9</xref>] which are in concordance with the above study. In our study we also did not encounter any side-effects like hypotension or bradycardia when lignocaine at a dose of 1.5 mg/kg was employed.</p><p>Recent studies however, have questioned lignocaine's efficacy. In studies by Singh <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] van den Berg <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and Kindler <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] IV lignocaine 1.5 mg/kg was ineffective in controlling the acute hemodynamic response following laryngoscopy and intubation. In a study conducted by Pathak <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] it was shown that lignocaine 1.5 mg/kg was ineffective in blunting responses during laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation when compared with two different doses of alfentanil (15 &#x003bc;g/kg and 30 &#x003bc;g/kg). However in our study, we used fentanyl universally in all the three groups. From the interpretation of the results of our study we concluded that lignocaine attenuated but did not completely abolish the pressure response to laryngoscopy and intubation.</p><p>Alpha two adrenergic agonists decrease sympathetic tone and their preoperative use has been shown to blunt the hemodynamic responses to laryngoscopy and intubation.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] They also reduce the need for anesthetics and therefore can be used as an adjunct to general anesthesia.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] Dexmedetomidine is a highly selective and specific alpha two adrenergic agonist. Therefore, it is increasingly being used as an agent to attenuate the pressure response.</p><p>Sagiroglu <italic>et al</italic>. concluded that the overall control of hemodynamic responses to tracheal intubation were better with dexmedetomidine 1 &#x003bc;g/kg as compared to dexmedetomidine 0.5 &#x003bc;g/kg.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] In our study we also compared similar doses of dexmedetomidine with lignocaine and we concluded that 1 &#x003bc;g/kg of dexmedetomidine significantly reduced the increase in HR associated with laryngoscopy and intubation when compared to 0.5 &#x003bc;g/kg of dexmedetomidine. We also infer that both doses of dexmedetomidine brought upon a greater decline in HR when individually compared with lignocaine. This is represented in Graphs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">4</xref>.</p><p>In the study conducted by Sagiroglu <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] the results of SBP, DBP and mean arterial pressure were significantly lower in the group given dexmedetomidine 1 &#x003bc;g/kg than the group given dexmedetomidine 0.5 &#x003bc;g/kg at 1 min after intubation. This is in agreement with our study results as represented in Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T9">9</xref>, which show a statistically significant decline in systolic and DBPs in the group administered dexmedetomidine 1 &#x003bc;g/kg. We also observed a general decline in the systolic and DBPs in both the groups administered dexmedetomidine (0.5 &#x003bc;g/kg and 1 &#x003bc;g/kg) when compared to the pressures on arrival in the OT which were considered as baseline [Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T9">9</xref>]. On comparing all the three groups, we concluded that dexmedetomidine 1 &#x003bc;g/kg brought upon a maximal reduction in systolic and DBPs at 1, 3 and 5 min post intubation [Graphs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">11</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">12</xref>]. However among dexmedetomidine 0.5 &#x003bc;g/kg and lignocaine, we noticed a greater decline in both systolic and DBP in the lignocaine group as compared to dexmedetomidine 0.5 &#x003bc;g/kg group at 1, 3 and 5 min after intubation [Graphs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">11</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">12</xref>].</p><fig id="F14" position="float"><label>Graph 12</label><caption><p>Comparison of systolic blood pressure of the three groups at different time instances</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AER-9-5-g026"/></fig><p>Laha <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] in their study compared dexmedetomidine 1 &#x003bc;g/kg with control and concluded that dexmedetomidine effectively blunted the hemodynamic responses during laryngoscopy, and reduced anesthetic requirements. Our study also denotes similar findings and also provides comparison between two different doses of dexmedetomidine. From our study, we adequately establish that dexmedetomidine 1 &#x003bc;g/kg was comparatively superior to dexmedetomidine 0.5 &#x003bc;g/kg for attenuation of the pressure response to laryngoscopy and intubation.</p><p>Dexmedetomidine is finding its way into every segment of anesthesia practice and its safety and efficacy as an agent to attenuate the pressure response has been reasonably well established.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>We conclude that dexmedetomidine in a dose of 1 &#x003bc;g/kg over 10 min before induction of anesthesia effectively attenuates the hemodynamic response to laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation. Dexmedetomidine administered in a dose of 0.5 &#x003bc;g/kg over 10 min before induction of anesthesia was effective in blunting the tachycardic response to intubation but incompletely attenuated the increase in systolic and DBP. Further, lignocaine in a dose of 1.5 mg/kg given 3 min before laryngoscopy and intubation was more effective than dexmedetomidine 0.5 &#x003bc;g/kg in attenuating the increase in systolic and DBP at 3 min and 5 min after endotracheal intubation.</p><p>Dexmedetomidine 1 &#x003bc;g/kg was more effective than dexmedetomidine 0.5 &#x003bc;g/kg in attenuating the pressure response completely without any side effect. Dexmedetomidine 1 &#x003bc;g/kg has proved to maintain hemodynamic stability associated with intubation and hence may prove beneficial for cardiac patients where the stress response to laryngoscopy and intubation is highly undesirable.</p><p>In summary dexmedetomidine, a highly selective &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> adrenoreceptor agonist has many desirable clinical benefits that encourage its use in the perioperative period.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None
