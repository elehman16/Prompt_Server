Currently the use of episiotomy should be restricted and physicians are encouraged to use their clinical judgment to decide when the procedure is necessary. There is no clinical evidence corroborating any indication of episiotomy, so until the present moment it is not yet known whether episiotomy is indeed necessary in any context of obstetric practice.</p></sec><sec><title>Objectives</title><p>To compare maternal and perinatal outcomes in women undergoing a protocol of not performing episiotomy versus selective episiotomy.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>An open label randomized clinical trial will be conducted including laboring women with term pregnancy, maximum dilation of 8&#x000a0;cm, live fetus in cephalic vertex presentation. Women with bleeding disorders of pregnancy, indication for caesarean section and those without capacity to consent and without legal guardians will be excluded. Primary outcomes will be frequency of episiotomy, delivery duration, frequency of spontaneous lacerations and perineal trauma, frequency of instrumental delivery, postpartum blood loss, need for perineal suturing, number of sutures, Apgar scores at one and five minutes, need for neonatal resuscitation and pH in cord blood. As secondary outcomes frequency complications of perineal suturing, postpartum perineal pain, maternal satisfaction, neonatal morbidity and admission newborn in NICU will be assessed. Women will be invited to participate and those who agree will sign the consent form and will be then assigned to a protocol of not conducting episiotomy (experimental group) or to a group that episiotomy is performed selectively according to the judgment of the provider of care delivery (control Group). The present study was approved by IMIP&#x02019;s Research Ethics Committee.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>Clinical Trials Register under the number and was registered in ClinicalTrials.gov under the number <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT02178111">NCT02178111</ext-link>.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Episiotomy</kwd><kwd>Vaginal delivery</kwd><kwd>Perineum</kwd><kwd>Randomized controlled trial</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Despite all available evidence corroborating the selective use of episiotomy and the recommendation of NOT to perform routine episiotomies, questions remain about what are the real indications to perform episiotomy in modern obstetrical practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) guidelines state that &#x0201c;the best available data do not support the liberal or routine use of episiotomy. However, there is a role for episiotomy for maternal or fetal indications such as avoiding severe maternal lacerations or to facilitate difficult births&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The World Health Organization recommends an episiotomy rate of 10% as &#x0201c;a good goal to pursue&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], based on the data obtained in the English randomized controlled trial published in 1984 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>In the Cochrane systematic review, a question arises: What would actually be the indications of episiotomy? Some situations are placed such as preterm delivery, breech delivery, macrosomia, shoulder dystocia, instrumental deliveries (forceps or vacuum extraction), non-reassuring fetal heart rate and rigid perineum or threat of severe perineal rupture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. However, these situations have been questioned as an indication of episiotomy and clearly this issue needs to be further studied in randomized clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. While it is clear that routine episiotomy should be avoided, there is no solid evidence corroborating ANY indication of episiotomy. The benefits of the use of episiotomy in these selected conditions remain controversial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Recently, it has been suggested that episiotomy should never be performed. An original recommendation for performing episiotomy was famously summarized by Scott (2005) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]: &#x0201c;Don&#x02019;t just do something, sit there!&#x0201d;. In a study including 168,077 singleton vaginal deliveries in the Soroka University Medical Center, Israel (2012), mediolateral episiotomy was found to be an independent risk factor for 3rd or 4th degree perineal tears, even in critical conditions such as shoulder dystocia, instrumental deliveries, occiput-posterior position, fetal macrosomia, and non-reassuring fetal heart rate. The rates of episiotomy in this Hospital declined from more 30% in 90&#x02019;s to less than 5% in 2010 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>With a protocol of not conducting combined with episiotomy perineal protection strategies, Amorim et al. found an intact perineum rate around 60% and only 23% of pregnant women in need of sutures that have not undergone episiotomy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. However, this was a non-controlled study with an isolated sample and the authors suggest the need for randomized clinical trials comparing a policy of not conducting episiotomy with the policy of selective episiotomy.</p><p>Reviewing the Medline, Lilacs/SciELO, EMBASE, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library databases using the keywords &#x0201c;episiotomy&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;vaginal delivery&#x0201d; in Portuguese, English and Spanish, with filters &#x0201c;randomized clinical trial&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;systematic review&#x0201d;, no clinical trial or clinical trial protocol addressing the non-performance of episiotomy care for vaginal delivery was found.</p><p>Thus, the present study will be conducted in order to compare maternal and perinatal outcomes in women undergoing a protocol of not conducting episiotomy vs. selective episiotomy.</p><sec><title>Objectives and hypothesis</title><p>The overall objective is to compare a protocol of not conducting episiotomy vs. selective episiotomy in a randomized clinical trial.

This list of randomization will be provided by the statistician to researcher who will be responsible for preparing the envelopes containing instructions regarding which group the patient is allocated to (A: Intervention=&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;not to use episiotomy or B: Control=&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;selective episiotomy). This procedure will be followed in order to guarantee the concealment of allocation of patients in both arms. Patients and medical staff will not be blind to the intervention condition, but the researcher and the statistician performing the analysis will be blinded to the meaning of the letters A or B to which participants will be allocated.</p><p>During the observation period the birth attendants will conduct delivery of baby and placenta according to routine practice, except for the instruction about the use of episiotomy. Birth attendants will collect, using special plastic bags, blood loss after delivery and the amount will be registered. Blood from the cord will be collected to perform pH analysis, and suture of any lacerations that may occur will be performed according to their clinical judgment. After 24&#x000a0;hours of delivery, women will be interviewed and perineal pain will be evaluated using a visual pain scale and women&#x02019;s satisfaction will also be assessed.

The procedure was introduced in Obstetrics with no evidence of its claimed beneficial effects for both mothers and their neonates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>Despite consistent evidence against its indiscriminate realization (Cochrane), in some places episiotomy is still routinely performed and the most recent study published in Brazil demonstrated a rate of 54% in our country [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. More than five times higher than the maximum rate recommended by the World Health Organization, this rate implies that a lot of health professionals (especially doctors, because in current obstetric model in Brazil the deliveries are attended mostly by doctors) continue to systematically perform this procedure.</p><p>Moreover, routine episiotomy is now considered to be a form of obstetric violence, especially when performed without an informed consent. A relatively new term, &#x0201c;obstetric violence&#x0201d; describes a situation in which any form of labor is considered pathological, when a woman is automatically transformed into a patient and routine medical and pharmacological procedures are conducted without allowing her to make decisions regarding her own body [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>In this context, it is important to define whether episiotomy is really needed in any situation and what are their true indications. This study may help to clarify this point bringing evidence about potential benefits and possible risks of never performing an episiotomy, something that has already been claimed by the women&#x02019;s movement.</p><p>In addition to this significant scientific contribution it also addresses issues of reproductive rights and may bring important contribution in terms of health care costs. According to Belizan et al. a saving between US$ 6.50 and 12.50 was estimated every vaginal birth without episiotomy in the public sector (a figure including only costs of suture materials). They estimated in their original work a saving for Brazil ranging from US$ 15 to 30 million [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>IMIP: Instituto de Medicina Integral Prof. Fernando Figueira; WHO: World Health Organization; NICU: Neonatal intensive care unit; ACOG: American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists; NNH: Number needed to harm; NNT: Number needed to treat; CONEP: National Committee for Ethics in Research of the Brazilian Ministry of Health; CNPq: National Counsel of Technological and Scientific Development.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>The first version of this protocol was drafted by MA and LK.
