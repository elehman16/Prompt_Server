It affects 0.1% of the population, it is estimated that approximately 15 to 25% of the population will have hives at some point in their lives.<sup>2</sup> About 80% of UC patients are diagnosed as idiopathic chronic urticaria and that no cause is identified, 3 experiencing deterioration in their quality of life affecting your work, social relationships, schemes requiring multiple medications and doses higher than usual. This study proposes Omalizumab (anti-IgE humanized antibody) as a treatment for Refractory Chronic Urticaria (RCU)</p></sec><sec><title>Object</title><p>Demonstrate Omalizumab's effectiveness in the treatment of Refractory Chronic Urticaria.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A clinical study, was carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of the Omalizumab's treatment on RCU diagnosed patient, including male and female patients ages 12 to 50 diagnosed with RCU, with Scorad higher tan 30 points. We made a questionnaire to know about the patient's family background, skin symptoms beginning, administration of drugs such sistemic steroids, inmunosupresors, calceurine inhibitors, presence of inmunotherapy and age of start. Omalizumab was administered on doses according patient's weight and IgE levels, bimonthly or monthly according to treatment guides. Severeness level was calculated with scorad every 1 month, with IgE seric level measurement and life quality questionnaire.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>5 patients diagnosed with RCU were included in the group of Omalizumab and 5 patients in the control group (placebo). All patients were female. A gradual decrease on the life quality score and in Score, with a significant P under 0.05 was observed on all patients treated with omalizumab compared with patient in the group with placebo.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Treatment with Omalizumab progressively decreases the severeness level on RCU, with a significant improvement on the patient's life quality.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front></article>
