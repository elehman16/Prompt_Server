It is
overexpressed in the majority of breast tumours, making it a
potential target for immune therapy. The objectives of the
present study were to evaluate the anti-tumour activity and
tolerance of repeated administration of TG1031 (an attenuated
recombinant vaccinia virus containing sequences coding for human
MUC1 and the immune stimulatory cytokine IL-2) in patients with
MUC1-positive metastatic  breast cancer. This was an open-label,
randomised study comparing two dose levels, 5 &#x000d7; 10E6
and 5 &#x000d7; 10E7&#x02009;pfu, with 14 patients in each arm.
The treatment was administered intramuscularly every 3 weeks for
the first 4 doses and every 6 weeks thereafter, until
progression. Two patients had a partial tumour regression
(&#x0003e; 50&#x00025;), and 15 patients had stable disease as their best
overall response until at least the 5th injection. Partial
regression lasted for 11 months in one patient and for 12 months
in the second patient who then underwent surgical resection of
her hepatic metastases. The most frequent adverse events included
inflammation at injection site: 7 patients, itching or pain at
injection site: 5 patients, and moderate fever: 6 patients. One
responding patient developed antinuclear, anti-DNA, and increased
anti-TPO antibodies after the fifth injection, and which resolved
at the end of treatment. The treatment regimes were well
tolerated with a low toxicity profile. Although clinical efficacy
remains limited, this study demonstrates the potential use of
MUC1-based immune therapy in breast cancer.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Reversal of tolerance and induction of antitumour activity has
been shown following immunisation with fusions of dendritic and
MUC1-positive carcinoma cells [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], and MUC1-positive CTL's
have been detected following successful immunotherapy in renal
cancer patients following administration of fused dendritic and
renal cancer cells [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Mucins are large (&#x0003e; 200&#x02009;kd)
glycoproteins with a high carbohydrate content (50&#x02013;90&#x00025; by
weight). They are expressed by a variety of normal and malignant
epithelial cells. MUC1 has a small transmembrane and
intracellular tail and consists essentially of a large number
(30&#x02013;100) of repeated segments in tandem of 20 amino acids. The
peptide core is densely coated with oligosaccharides, conferring
a rigid rod-like structure which can extend several hundred
nanometers from the apical cell surface into the lumen of ducts
and glands. The biological function of MUC1 is thought to
lubricate and protect glandular ducts, but knockout mice, lacking
MUC1, had no alteration in their development and in their
glandular morphology [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Mucins are attractive tumour
antigens as they are overexpressed (10&#x02013;40 fold) in a variety of
cancers, making them useful targets for antibodies and cellular
immunity. Cancer-associated MUC1 is incompletely glycosylated and
as a result exposes internal sugar units and naked peptide
sequences which are cryptic in the normal mucin molecule. MUC1
glycoprotein is often found in circulation in late-stage breast
and lung cancer and used as a tumour marker (CA15.3) in the
follow-up of breast cancer patients. Patients with high
circulating MUC1 (CA153) serum levels have advanced cancer and
are frequently in a state of T-cell unresponsiveness or anergy
[<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Although it had been suggested in the past that MUC1
caused T-cell unresponsiveness, a direct immunosuppressive role
for MUC1 was excluded in more recent analyses [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>The complete human MUC1 gene containing only 5 tandem repeats
which had been inserted into a vaccinia virus vector, together
with the gene coding for human interleukin 2, has been tested in
a prior phase I study. A significant T-cell proliferative response
against MUC1 following vaccination was observed in 1 of 9
advanced metastatic breast cancer patients. The stimulation index
rose from 7 to 14 following a second injection. In addition,
evidence of MUC1-specific CTL activity induced by VV-MUC1-IL-2
was seen. The present study was designed to expand on these
earlier findings in metastatic breast cancer patients vaccinated
after only one line of systemic treatment. Our objectives were to
evaluate signs of clinical efficacy and tolerance of repeated
injections as well as to assess the cellular and humoral response
to MUC1 given at two different dose levels.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>PATIENTS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Patients</title><p>We intended to enrol 28 patients into the study, 14 in each
treatment group. The study was approved by each country's
regulatory authorities and by the local ethical committees. The
inclusion criteria were histologically proven MUC1-positive breast
cancer, progressive and measurable metastatic disease following
no more than one line of systemic treatment, WHO performance
index 0&#x02013;1, and total lymphocyte counts greater than
0.75 &#x000d7; 10E9/L.
Principal exclusion criteria were recent
viral infection, positive serology for HIV, major organ
dysfunction, concomitant corticosteroid treatment, evidence of
immunological compromise such as eczema or atopic dermatitis, and
central nervous system metastasis. MUC1 antigen expression by the
tumour was evaluated by immunohistochemistry using antibody H23
[<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] on paraffin-embedded sections. In France, the
immunological status of each patient was evaluated by a
Pasteur-M&#x000e9;rieux multitest to recall antigens. Additional
evaluations included antibodies to DNA and levels of serum
amylase, <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>2-microglobulin, C-reactive protein, total
immunoglobulin levels, and CD4 : CD8  counts.</p></sec><sec><title>Preclinical toxicology</title><p>The human MUC1 and IL-2 cDNA were inserted in a head-to-head
orientation under the control of the p7.5 promoter located
at 5&#x02032; of each sequence. This block was inserted into
the vaccinia virus (Copenhagen strain) genome. Previous results
[<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] demonstrated an attenuation of the viral virulence by
both the inactivation of the viral TK as well as by the
production of IL-2. Intracranial injection of this construct into
nude mice was nontoxic, whereas injection of the parent strain
was lethal in all instances (Bizouarne et al [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]).
Transgenic mice expressing human MUC1 under the control of the
human MUC1 promoter have been constructed and found to express
MUC1 strongly and consistently in the cells lining the stomach.
These mice had been used to assess, both histologically and
macroscopically, any signs of autoimmunity induced by
immunisation with VV-MUC1-IL-2 (VVTG-5058, the active viral
ingredient of TG1031). No histological evidence of inflammatory
cell infiltrate into normal tissues expressing MUC1 was observed,
nor was there any gross evidence of autoimmune disease over a
period of two months observation. Immunisation of these mice with
MUC1 resulted in an anti-MUC1 antibody response which was
dramatically lower than that seen in immunised nontransgenic
mice, demonstrating a degree of tolerance to MUC1 at the level of
antibody production. Nonetheless, MUC1-specific cytotoxic T
lymphocyte precursor cells (CTL-pc) could be detected in both
transgenic and nontransgenic mice following immunisation with
VVTG-5058 [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Production of IL-2 by VVTG-5058-infected cells was measured both
in vitro and in vivo. BHK-21 (baby hamster kidney) cells were
infected with VVTG-5058 and the culture supernatant assessed for
IL-2 both by ELISA and by bioactivity using the cell line CTLL-2.
After 24-hour culture, the infected cells secretion of IL-2
ranging from 675&#x02009;ng/ml to 1117&#x02009;ng/ml and was equivalent to
biologically active IL-2 ranging from 1283 to 8340&#x02009;IU/ml.
Control supernatants from cells infected with the negative
control wild-type virus contained no detectable IL-2. Production
of IL-2 in vivo was assessed by injecting DBA/2 mice
intramuscularly with VVTG-5058 and assessing IL-2 in the serum at
later time points. Only at the 24-hour time point was IL-2
detectable at 50&#x02009;pg/ml and it was thereafter undetectable.
Viral dose was assessed by plaque forming activity on BHK cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Patient monitoring</title><p>Informed consent was obtained from each patient. Patients
remained in a hospital room with a confinement compatible
  with  HSE B2 specifications
[<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Patients were monitored in this confined room
following each administration: for 24 hours after the first
injection and for 2 hours after subsequent injections. In France,
patients remained in this unit for 2&#x02009;days on each occasion
and until blood samples and nasopharyngeal swabs, taken on the
day following the injection, were reported negative by PCR
analysis. Vaccination with 0.5&#x02009;ml of TG1031 (doses of
5 &#x000d7; 10E6 or 5 &#x000d7; 10E7&#x02009;pfu) was done
intramuscularly in the deltoid muscle.</p></sec><sec><title>Viral monitoring (subgroup analysis)</title><p>Samples were assessed for the presence of infectious vaccinia
virus by PCR analysis at Texcell laboratories,
Institut Pasteur, Paris. Special care was taken to
prevent viral dissemination prior to and during transport. Swabs
taken from the nose and throat, as well as samples of blood, were
analysed prior to vaccination at day 0 and daily during the
hospitalisation period. The detection limit was 2&#x02013;9&#x02009;pfu/ml
in wet and 150&#x02009;pfu/ml in dry samples. PCR analysis of virus
was done with two pairs of primers designed to amplify either a
1.2&#x02212;&#x02009;kbp portion of a region of MUC1 with vaccinia flanking
sequences or a second smaller region (740&#x02009;bp) within MUC1.</p></sec><sec><title>Vaccinia- and MUC1-specific serology</title><p>MUC1-specific IgG and IgM antibody levels were detected by ELISA

5 days. Cell proliferation is measured by the incorporation of
<sup>3</sup>H-thyminidine into the cellular DNA.
Phytohemagglutinin (PHA), a mitogen which stimulates
all T cells by cross-linking several cell surface glycoproteins
by virtue of their sugar side chains, was used as a control.
Another positive control mitogen, the anti-CD3 monoclonal
antibody UCHT1, also was used.</p></sec><sec><title>Cytokine production (subgroup analysis)</title><p>Five hundred microlitre of the patients' plasma (lithium heparin)

Minneapolis, Minn, USA)  in duplicate samples
and in the same assay testing for VEGF, M-CSF, TNF-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>1 as

higher dose group (5 &#x000d7; 10E7&#x02009;pfu). The patients'
mean age was 56.3 years (ranging from 33 to 76 years), and the
mean ECOG performance status at baseline 0.2 (ranging from 0 to

metastatic sites (4 patients 5 &#x000d7; 10E6&#x02009;pfu, 1
patient 5 &#x000d7; 10E7&#x02009;pfu). All patients had received
previous therapy for their metastatic breast cancer, including
antioestrogens (24 patients), Goserelin (1), aromatase inhibitors
(10), anthracyclines [<italic>alone (8)  or in combination
with (FEC/FAC) (9)</italic>], Taxotere/Taxol (8), 5FU-based
chemotherapy (8), MMM (2), and Navelbine (4). One patient
(patient 106, 5 &#x000d7; 10E7&#x02009;pfu group) had received prior immunotherapy.

patients; 5 &#x000d7; 10E7&#x02009;pfu group: 13 patients). The
most frequently reported adverse events were general disorders

(5 &#x000d7; 10E6&#x02009;pfu group: 8 patients and

material and methods. All viral tests were consistently negative.</p></sec><sec><title>Biological results</title><sec><title>T-cell proliferation assays</title><sec><title>Cellular immune response to the vector</title><p>Cellular immune responses were measured by culturing patients'
PBMCs together with one of a panel of several antigens and
mitogens. For all patients, the PBMCs responded normally to UCHT1,
an anti-CD3 antibody. PPD from the tuberculin bacillus was used as
a positive control antigen. Most Europeans have been immunised
with tuberculin during their lifetime and most patients' PBMCs
responded normally to PPD, with some variation throughout the
study. Reactivity to UV-inactivated VV particles was equally
assessed. Despite the fact that most, if not all patients, had
received smallpox vaccinations during their lifetime, PBMCs from
only one patient (patient 106) showed T-cell proliferation to VV
at baseline. PBMCs from most, but not all patients, proliferated
in response to culture with  VV at the second and
subsequent injection time points. There was a significant
variability in the condition of the cells and their ability to
proliferate in response to antigen. Negative controls were either
no antigen at all or MUC1 tandem repeat peptide from the murine
MUC1 sequence, which has little or no cross-reactivity with human
MUC1.</p></sec><sec><title>Cellular immune response to MUC1</title><p>None of the PBMCs from patients in this study showed any
significant T-cell proliferation in response to
a 24-amino acid polypeptide corresponding to one MUC1
variable-number tandem repeat sequence. Nevertheless, PBMCs from
patients 207 and 208, for example, at some time points were able
to respond to both PPD and VV antigens without evidence of
proliferation in response to the MUC1 antigen by the
same PBMCs. The interpretation, therefore, is that there was no
evident systemic T-cell response to the tandem repeat (TAPPA 24)
peptide of MUC1 by PBMCs from the patients in this study as
detected by this method.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Vaccinia-and MUC1-specific antibodies</title><sec><title>Antibody responses to the vector (vaccinia virus)</title><p>Most patients showed evidence of preexisting antibody immunity to
vaccinia virus. All patients showed increased anti-VV titres
after vaccination, with the exception of patient 202 who had a
comparatively high VV-specific IgG titre in her pre-inclusion
plasma sample, which did not change throughout the course of
TG1031 vaccinations, of which she received six. This suggests
that the patient had received a smallpox vaccination, but failed
to generate a recall response to TG1031. The most pronounced rise
in titre occurred in those patients receiving the highest dose.</p></sec><sec><title>Antibody responses to MUC1</title><p>The analysis of MUC1-specific antibody titres was performed
according to a published method [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. There was no
significant antibody response to MUC1 upon immunotherapy with
TG1031, and levels of antibody did not exceed levels found in some
cancer patients. There were few notable fluctuations:
MUC1-specific IgG levels in plasma from patient 104 dropped to
50&#x00025; of pretreatment levels at cycles 4 and 5 then
increased to levels slightly higher than baseline in subsequent
samples. This was not thought to be related to levels of complex
formation with circulating MUC1, since CA-15.3 levels increased
only slightly in this patient and remained within the normal
range. A similar phenomenon had been observed in one patient in
the VV-MUC1-IL-2 phase I clinical trial. Small increases of IgG
MUC1-specific antibody titres were detected in four patients,
including the clinical responders.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>CD4 levels and outcome (subgroup analysis)</title><p>In view of the reported absence of toxicity in animal studies and

overexpressed tumour antigens has been reported in a number of
phase I trials in a variety of patients with solid tumours such
as breast, prostate, and cervical cancer [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].
Vaccinations of wild life against rabies have shown vaccinia
virus to be effective and safe for the environment [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].
Nonpathogenic viruses for humans, such as fowl pox viruses, are
also used in vaccination trials and have been shown to increase
the efficacy of boost injections in alternate prime and boost
strategies using different vectors with different antigenic
epitopes [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. We have developed a recombinant vaccinia
virus, replicative but attenuated, that expresses upon infection
the widely overexpressed breast cancer antigen MUC1 as well as
the human immunostimulatory cytokine IL-2. We have been able to
confirm the safety and efficacy of repeated injections of the
same vector as well as provide clinical evidence of vaccine
efficacy in metastatic breast cancer  patients.</p><p>In the present phase II study, repeated injections of this vector
in patients with less advanced disease generated clinical
regressions of axillary lymph nodes (seen after 1 injection) and
of liver metastases (after 3 injections) (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>).
Increasing evidence exists from murine, primate, and human
studies to confirm that T-cell proliferative responses as well as
MHC-restricted cytotoxic T cells can be induced by immunisation
with MUC1 antigenic epitopes [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In
the present study, no specific proliferative response directed
against an epitope of the human MUC1 tandem repeat domain could
be detected in any of our patients. Although with the same assay
T-cell proliferation was seen in a previous trial [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], the
proof of treatment-related MUC1-specific systemic cellular immune
responses could not so far be confirmed in the present patients
by in vitro testing. The recent demonstration of class I HLA-A2
restricted epitopes derived from the MUC-1 tandem repeat region
or from the leader sequence of MUC-1 suggests that the
MUC-1-directed immune responses may not be limited to the
extracellular tandem repeat domain [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Using
peptide-pulsed dendritic cells in addition to Pan-HLA-DR binding
peptides, Brossart et al [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] also
 demonstrated
the importance of CD4 cells for efficient CTL priming. It remains
to be seen whether the patients who demonstrated a clinical
response developed CTL's or a proliferative response against
other epitopes that we have not yet tested for. Murine
experiments have shown that immunisation with MUC1 without tandem
repeats is as effective as immunisation with the entire MUC1 in
inducing a tumour rejecting anti-MUC1 immune response
(Taylor-Papadimitriou et al [<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]). In addition and in a
separate study, several patients immunised with MUC1 showed
T-cell proliferative responses to MUC1 antigenic epitopes outside
the tandem repeat  region
(Rochlitz et al [<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]).</p><p>All but one patient had
serological evidence of vaccination with vaccinia virus in
childhood. Antibodies against the virus were detectable prior to
vaccination, and patients treated with the highest dose levels
had increased serological responses to vaccinia virus, but
surprisingly little response to MUC1. Our results are in contrast
with those of Apostolopoulos et al [<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] who document a
predominant antibody response following serial vaccinations with
a peptide-mannan fusion protein. High titres of antibodies to
MUC1 in MUC1-immunised patients are possible, as reported by
other clinical trials in which patients had been immunised with
polypeptides from the MUC1 tandem repeat sequence [<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].
Antibody, but not T-cell tolerance to MUC1 has been observed in
MUC1 transgenic mice immunised with vaccinia-MUC1-IL-2 [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].
It is not clear whether antibodies may give equivalent antitumour
protection to that of a cellular immune response. A benefit in
survival has been observed in early-stage breast cancer patients
with elevated natural antibodies to MUC1 [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Similarly, an
increase in antibody titres has been reported in multiparous
women [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], and Agrawal et al speculated
 that the well-known decreased breast
cancer risk in women having pregnancies early in their
reproductive life might be related to spontaneous vaccination
against this breast tumour  antigen. Only one patient
(number 301) injected with VV-MUC1-IL-2 had a notable
antibody titre to MUC1 prior to vaccination and maintained
significant titres of IgM anti-MUC1 antibodies following
vaccination. Vaccination using the complete MUC1 gene and
therefore the presentation of a variety of MUC1 class I or II
epitopes in the context of a viral expression vector may also
influence the type (cellular or humoral) of response.</p><p>We did not observe any virus-related toxicity, nor did we detect
any viral particles by PCR technology, suggesting that the
repetitive viral injection was safe. Antiviral antibodies were
present and increased mildly during treatment.</p><p>In a subgroup analysis, a rise in circulating (nonspecified) CD4
T lymphocyte counts was seen in some patients, and in particular,
in the two responding patients suggestive of that the immune
system still susceptible to stimulation. These results compare
with observations from the literature showing a correlation
between high level of circulating
CD4<sub>+</sub> lymphocytes and the favourable
outcome. Recent evidence from a human melanoma model suggested
that the true benefit of CD4<sub>+</sub> T cells may be not only in the
induction and maintenance of cytotoxic T lymphocytes, but
possibly in a direct (CD4-mediated) antitumour response
[<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Low levels of immune-suppressive cytokines such as
M-CSF, TGF<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>1, IL-6, VEGF, and low C-reactive protein had been
seen in those patients able to develop CTL's against MUC1
following vaccination in the past [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. High amounts of
M-CSF, VEGF, and IL-6 in tumour cell supernatants have been
associated with suppression of dendritic cell differentiation
[<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] as well as with tumour progression. Tumour-generated
suppressive factors may thus represent a limiting factor to
immunotherapy. In primary breast carcinomas, Bell et al did
detect only immature dendritic cells within the tumour, whereas
mature dendritic cells were located in peritumoral areas 
[<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p><p>In the same subgroup, several low-grade autoimmune manifestations
were documented in 3 of 10 patients. The rise in self antibodies
was parallel to the rise in peripheral CD4 cells and to the
clinical response in one patient. The presence of inflammatory
cells in a biopsy of accessory salivary glands was seen in one
patient who had complained of dry mouth following injection.
Autoimmune reactions have also been documented in renal cell
cancers following treatment with IL-2 [<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The patients
with signs of antithyroid antibodies had a significantly better
survival, suggesting that a mild degree of autoimmunity may be a
positive sign more than an &#x0201c;acceptable side effect&#x0201d; of
antitumour  vaccinations.</p><p>In conclusion, multiple injections of VV-MUC1-IL-2 were clinically
well tolerated and able to induce clinical responses in two
patients. Mild autoimmune effects were present in some patients,
including one of the clinical responders. We suggest monitoring
peripheral CD4 titres and autoantibodies in future trials.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="B1"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group
