The most frequently reported AEs were those assessed as AEs of interest. During the trial, 4.6% of patients experienced a serious AE and six deaths were reported (three in the 250 &#x000b5;g OD/500 &#x000b5;g OD arm [COPD, cardiac failure, and cardiopulmonary failure], one in the 500 &#x000b5;g EOD/500 &#x000b5;g OD arm [pneumothorax spontaneous], and two in the 500 &#x000b5;g OD arm [lung adenocarcinoma and myocardial infarction]).

Using an alternative reduced dosing regimen for a short initial treatment period (as used successfully with other systemic therapies)<xref rid="b19-copd-13-813" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b22-copd-13-813" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> is one strategy to help increase the acceptability of ROF treatment and help patients stay on therapy. The OPTIMIZE study supports this concept. While use of a reduced dose of ROF as long-term maintenance therapy may not induce sufficient PDE4 inhibition to exert the clinical efficacy of the 500 &#x000b5;g dose,<xref rid="b14-copd-13-813" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="b15-copd-13-813" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> it can be used as part of an up-titration regimen to overcome tolerability issues in the first weeks of treatment and hence reduce discontinuation rates.</p><p>Initiating ROF at a 250 &#x000b5;g daily dose for 4 weeks, before escalating to 500 &#x000b5;g daily dose for 8 weeks, was associated with a statistically significant decrease in the percentage of patients discontinuing treatment for any reason and reporting side effects of interest. The overall discontinuation rate for patients taking ROF 500 &#x000b5;g daily in the current study was in line with that observed in recent ROF clinical trials,<xref rid="b7-copd-13-813" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="b11-copd-13-813" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> and for patients starting at the reduced dosing of 250 &#x000b5;g daily, the odds of early discontinuation and experiencing side effects of interest were 34% and 37% lower (RR reduction 28% and 21%). Patients starting ROF at 500 &#x000b5;g on alternate days also reported fewer side effects and lower treatment discontinuation rates, but this was not significantly different compared with the 500 &#x000b5;g daily regimen.</p><p>The AEs of interest selected as a focus for OPTIMIZE study have previously been identified as limiting tolerability to ROF.<xref rid="b4-copd-13-813" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="b6-copd-13-813" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b9-copd-13-813" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Diarrhea and other gastrointestinal side effects particularly, have been perceived as a barrier to ROF treatment. Diarrhea accounted for approximately one-third of discontinuations with the 500 &#x000b5;g dose, and this was lowered to approximately 20% with reduced dosing.</p><p>The mechanisms by which ROF causes nausea and diarrhea are believed to be distinct. Nausea is mediated by PDE4-D; located outside the blood&#x02013;brain barrier, this subtype is accessible to ROF.<xref rid="b23-copd-13-813" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> The mechanism behind diarrhea is less clear; activators of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) are known to be potent inducers of diarrhea, and it is thought that PDE4 inhibition could activate this mechanism.<xref rid="b24-copd-13-813" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="b25-copd-13-813" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></p><p>Weight loss is a known systemic side effect of ROF<xref rid="b6-copd-13-813" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b9-copd-13-813" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> and has been reported with both selective and nonselective PDE inhibitors.<xref rid="b26-copd-13-813" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> However, it did not appear to be a significant reason for discontinuation in OPTIMIZE, accounting for &#x0003c;1% of discontinuations overall.

One exception was abdominal pain; the reason for this was unclear.

As OPTIMIZE did not include a placebo arm, the impact of the use of daily diary cards on side effect rates cannot be assessed. Additionally, levels of theophylline were not known in the 80 patients who were taking it, but may have contributed to increased reporting of side effects in these patients.</p><p>The 250 &#x000b5;g daily dose was selected as the appropriate reduced dose following modeling studies, suggesting an improved side effect profile, compared with the 500 &#x000b5;g maintenance dose.<xref rid="b13-copd-13-813" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Lung function measurements in OPTIMIZE revealed that the initial 4-week up-titration regimens did not appear to reduce the effect of the drug on lung function.

It is plausible that higher tPDE4i levels lead to more potential off-target effects of ROF such as nausea and diarrhea. However, as expected with linear PK, reducing the dose to 250 &#x000b5;g daily in these patients reduced tPDE4i to well below that typically observed in patients able to tolerate 500 &#x000b5;g daily. However, a daily dose of 250 &#x000b5;g should not be considered suitable as a therapeutic maintenance dose, as efficacy in exacerbation reduction has not been adequately demonstrated in clinical studies.</p><p>A recent Korean study retrospectively analyzed data from 85 patients with severe/very severe COPD taking either 500 &#x000b5;g or 250 &#x000b5;g ROF daily, up-titrated to 500 &#x000b5;g daily up to 3 months after. There was a trend toward fewer AEs and discontinuations with the reduced initial dose.<xref rid="b31-copd-13-813" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Similarly, a recent PK modeling analysis<xref rid="b13-copd-13-813" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> predicted that ROF 250 &#x000b5;g daily and 500 &#x000b5;g on alternate days were associated with lower plasma drug concentrations, lower tPDE4i, and lower incidence of diarrhea, nausea, and headache compared with ROF 500 &#x000b5;g daily. These data support the findings of the OPTIMIZE study.</p><p>Limitations of the current study include the lack of a placebo arm, the low sample size in the down-titration phase, and a short study duration of 12 weeks compared with a long-term maintenance treatment. Nonetheless, the study population is one of the largest to investigate side effects in a targeted COPD population, and gives us confidence in the validity of our conclusions.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Starting ROF treatment at 250 &#x000b5;g daily for 4 weeks before increasing to the therapeutic maintenance dose of 500 &#x000b5;g daily reduced treatment discontinuations and improved the tolerability profile compared with initiating treatment at 500 &#x000b5;g daily. In practice, this should help patients with COPD to stay longer on treatment with the therapeutic dose. However, use of 250 &#x000b5;g OD as long-term maintenance therapy may not induce sufficient PDE4 inhibition to exert clinical efficacy.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Ken Nip (Takeda) provided additional statistical assistance, and Udo-Michael Goehring provided study interpretation.
