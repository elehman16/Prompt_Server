rehabilitation (CACR) and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on cognitive
function in patients with stroke. [Subjects and Methods] We enrolled 20 patients and
divided them into CACR and rTMS groups. CACR and rTMS were performed thrice a week for 4
weeks. Cognitive function was measured with the Korean Mini-Mental State Examination
(K-MMSE) and Lowenstein Occupational Therapy Cognitive Assessment-Geriatric (LOTCA-G)
before and after treatment. The independent samples t-test was performed to test the
homogeneity of K-MMSE and LOTCA-G before treatment and compare the differences in
cognitive improvement between the CACR and rTMS groups. A paired samples t-test was used
to compare cognitive function before and after treatment. [Results] Cognitive function of
both the groups significantly improved after the intervention based on the K-MMSE and
LOTCA-G scores. While the LOTCA-G score improved significantly more in the CACR group than
in the rTMS group, no significant difference was seen in the K-MMSE scores. [Conclusion]
We showed that CACR is more effective than rTMS in improving cognitive function after
stroke.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Stroke</kwd><kwd>Computer-assisted cognitive rehabilitation (CACR)</kwd><kwd>Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS)</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Stroke, which is one of the most common diseases in adults, is generally accompanied by
disabilities, and 50% of the patients sustain neurological damage<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. The major factor that interferes with independent daily
activities is cognitive dysfunction resulting in deterioration of memory, alertness,
attention, and language function<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. In
general, 25% of the patients show dementia 3 months after a stroke, and 50&#x02013;75% show partial
cognitive dysfunction<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Cognitive dysfunction reduces motivation and has a negative effect on functional recovery
and returning to rehabilitation<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Aside
from motor function and emotional disabilities, it is the most problematic disability, and
the importance of cognitive rehabilitation is being emphasized<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Cognitive rehabilitation is a program designed to improve cognitive
functions such as attention, memory, and concept formation ability, by systematically
applying an intervention technique to improve cognitive processes<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>, which is necessary for stroke patients to improve their
functional capabilities for performing daily activities and regaining independence<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>It consists of traditional and computerized cognitive training, which are currently used
actively. Traditional cognitive training consists of pencil and paper activities, peg
design, and puzzle activities that require functions of the damaged area, followed by a 1:1
intervention by a therapist. Therefore, the intervention varies depending on the therapist,
and the feedback is not consistent<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.
However, computer-assisted cognitive rehabilitation (CACR) makes use of a computer program
specific to the damaged area of the patient, and the level of difficulty can be adjusted to
suit the patient. In addition, it provides instant and direct feedback for their
performance. Because the training results during treatment can be saved, the progress of a
patient can be monitored, thus providing objective data for further studies<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Since the first attempt at CACR by Glisky
et al.<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>, many researchers have verified
its effects<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Many studies of CACR have been published in the last 10&#x02005;years, and positive effects of
cognitive rehabilitation on patients with stroke are being reported. Through an analysis of
the studies on the cognitive rehabilitation after stroke published until 2002, Cicerone et
al.<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that cognitive
rehabilitation is beneficial (92.9% level). Lee et al.<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup> and Shin et al.<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup> treated patients with cognitive dysfunction after brain damage with
CACR PSS CogRehab, which contains a problem-solving program that targets issues, such as
defects in basic cognitive function, spatiotemporal perception, memory, and problem-solving
skills. They reported improvement in short-term verbal memory, short-term visual perception
memory, auditory and visual attention focus, and the performance of activities of daily
living.</p><p>Recently, studies have focused on memory improvements occurring in response to noninvasive
brain stimulation, such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), which
modulate the excitation of the cortex by varying the frequency of magnetic stimulation of
specific brain regions<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Noninvasive
brain stimulation is an emerging area of study in the fields of brain and neural
rehabilitation and cognitive science<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>.
The rTMS cognitive network was first introduced by Pascual-Leone and Hallett<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>, who observed a decrease in the
performance of working memory after the application of rTMS to decrease cerebral activities.
They reported that the lateral prefrontal cortex plays an important role in working
memory.</p><p>On et al.<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup> reported an improvement in
the accuracy of working memory (which is the basis of long-term memory and language learning
and execution) after 1,000 rTMS sessions at 10&#x02005;Hz and at 100% intensity of the exercise
threshold. These effects on working memory were maintained up to 30&#x02005;min after the final
stimulation depending on the number of stimulations. Pape et al.<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup> and Mally and Stone<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup> found that rTMS has beneficial effects on the cognitive function
and memory of patients with central nervous system diseases, such as stroke and degenerative
brain diseases.</p><p>However, studies on which treatment method, CACR or rTMS, is more effective in improving
cognitive function are lacking. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine which
intervention, CACR or rTMS, was more effective in improving the cognitive functions of
patients with stroke by setting the prefrontal cortex as the stimulation area when direct
stimulation was possible among the areas of the brain.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The experimental procedure was sufficiently explained beforehand to the subjects, who
voluntarily participated by signing the experiment consent form. This study was approved by
the Institutional Ethics Committee of Namseoul University. The subjects comprised 20
right-handed stroke patients with left hemiplegia who were hospitalized in C Hospital in
Cheon-An City, Republic of Korea. All the subjects were determined to be right-handed with
the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory. The selection criteria included patients who were at
least 6 months post stroke, had a Korea version of the Mini-Mental State Examination
(K-MMSE) score &#x02264; 23 (the cognitive disability standard), were capable of voluntary movements
of the contralateral arm, and could control the touch screen of the CACR with their hands.
rTMS was applied according to the method described by On et al.<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup> except for the frequency, and a TAMAS transcranial
magnetic stimulator (CR Technology Co., Ltd., Daejeon, Korea) with a diameter of 96&#x02005;mm and
an figure-eight coil was used for TMS. After attaching a recording electrode to the first
right dorsal interosseous muscle of the patients, it was stimulated under stable conditions
after fixing a cloth with marks at a 1-cm intervals to the scalp. After finding the hot spot
where the maximal motor evoked potential was induced at the minimal intensity, the minimal
intensity at which an evoked potential&#x0003e;50 &#x003bc;V was induced in more than 5 out of 10
stimulations was set as the resting motor threshold. The intensity of the rTMS was at 100%
of the resting motor threshold, and the stimulation frequency was set at 10&#x02005;Hz. The F3 point
was stimulated according to the International 10/20 EEG recording system to stimulate the
left prefrontal cortex. The stimulation was applied for 5&#x02005;s, and restimulation was applied
after a 55-s resting period. Stimulations of 1,000 times a day were repeated 20 times. The
CACR and rTMS subjects (10 each) were randomly assigned, and the effects of each treatment
intervention were not explained to them in order to prevent a treatment bias effect in the
subjects.</p><p>This study was performed on 20 subjects after the contents of the experiment were
sufficiently explained before the experiment, and they consented to the experiment
participation agreement. All the subjects were hospitalized and received basic inpatient
treatments, such as physical therapy and occupational therapy. After dividing the subjects
into the 10 who received basic inpatient treatment and participated in the PSS Cogrehab FD
Edition CACR and the 10 who received basic inpatient treatment and participated in the rTMS,
the K-MMSE and Lowenstein Occupational Therapy Cognitive Assessment-Geriatric (LOTCA-G) were
administered to both groups, and they were evaluated before and after the treatment
intervention. The K-MMSE and LOTCA-G were used to evaluate cognitive function before and
after the intervention, and the reliability coefficient of the K-MMSE was r=0.72, and that
of the LOTCA-G was r= 0.84 in this study. The PSS CogRehab for the CACR group was performed
for 20&#x02005;min a day 3 times a week for 4 weeks. The rTMS was performed for 20&#x02005;min a day 3 times
a week for 4 weeks.</p><p>SPSS version 20.0 was used for statistical analysis of the data in this study. The general
characteristics of the subjects were calculated with numbers and percentages. General

intervention (p&#x0003c;0.05). Similar to the results of the study by On et al.<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup> that showed improvement in the working
memory function of 10 healthy adults as a result of rTMS applied to the left prefrontal lobe
to improve working memory, it is likely that the cognitive function improvements in the rTMS
group were due to improvements in working memory.</p><p>In both, the CACR and rTMS groups, the improvement in the LOTCA-G scores was greater than
that in the K-MMSE scores. Kim<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup> also
reported greater improvements in the LOTCA-G scores than in the K-MMSE scores in their study
that measured changes in cognitive function resulting from CACR. As shown by Appelros<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup> and Cho et al.<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>, although the MMSE is a reliable and valid tool commonly
used for evaluating cognitive function in patients with brain damage, the K-MMSE, compared
with the LOTCA-G, does not properly reflect the effects of CACR and rTMS because it lacks
the evaluation criteria to assess the management function changes that correspond to higher
cognitive functions.</p><p>The difference in visuomotor organization scores (a LOTCA-G evaluation item) before and
after the intervention was the largest (<xref rid="tbl_003" ref-type="table">Table
3</xref>), indicating that the effect was likely due to the visuospatial training effect of
CACR, which is a visuospatial perception training program. PSS CogRehab appeared to cause an
overall improvement in visuospatial perception. The absence of a sensitive measure for it
supports the finding that the improvement in the LOTCA-G score was bigger than that in the
K-MMSE score.</p><p>In a study on the effects on cognition, visuospatial perception, and daily life resulting
from a Korean computer-based cognitive rehabilitation program (CoTras), Park et al.<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup> showed that the improvement in the
visuomotor organization score, a LOTCA item used as a tool to assess cognition, was largest.
Our results support the findings of Lee et al.<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup><sub>,</sub> who used CACR on stroke patients, and found an
improvement in the scores for all LOTCA-G areas of the subjects, especially in cognition and
visuomotor organization.</p><p>rTMS, which is noninvasive brain stimulation technique, can stimulate the cortex using a
local magnetic wave induced on the head surface. Many studies, such as those on depression,
attention disorders, schizophrenia, sleep disorders, and Parkinson&#x02019;s disease, have used this
feature to excite the cerebral cortex without surgery or anesthesia. The clinical effects
have not been verified, except for depression in the study on rTMS by Choi and Jeong<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>, and this was attributed to the various
technical variables such as the stimulation intensity, location, frequency, pulse width,
interval between stimuli, type of coils, time, number of treatments, gap between procedures,
and treatment time. In fact, information on cognitive function changes with rTMS is lacking
in stroke patients.</p><p>Ko et al.<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup> noted side effects that can
cause seizures in normal humans when rTMS is applied above the threshold intensity for a
long time. Therefore, they recommend its use within the permitted safety standard range.
However, even within this range, patients may feel discomfort because of the unique sounds
that occur during stimulation and facial muscle contractions. In this study, we experienced
difficulty in selecting new subjects because 4 subjects dropped out due to discomfort. In
addition, the high equipment cost is likely to make its clinical use difficult.</p><p>Our results show a greater improvement in cognitive function by CACR than rTMS. In
addition, rTMS caused discomfort in the subjects (a stability issue). Thus, rather than a
rTMS technique, a computerized cognitive rehabilitation program would be more appropriate to
improve cognitive function after stroke. However, in their review on computerized cognitive
rehabilitation programs, Kim et al.<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>
suggested that there are potential problems in each computerized cognitive rehabilitation
program and that a larger number of subjects should be studied to verify the clinical
usefulness.</p><p>Although a number of recent studies on CACR-induced cognition improvements have been
reported from Korea, studies on cognition improvement by rTMS are still lacking. Most
studies have examined improvements in working memory, which is a function of the prefrontal
cortex. Furthermore, no study that has compared cognition improvement by CACR to that by
rTMS has been reported domestically.</p><p>The cognitive improvements in stroke patients might be improved if studies combine the two
interventions (CACR and rTMS) so that they can be both applied to subjects and use proper
evaluation tools that can verify the effects. In addition, it would be clinically
significant to investigate the effects of cognition function improvements on the performance
of daily activities by patients with stroke.</p><p>There were a number of limitations in this study. Firstly, it was difficult to generalize
the results because of the small number of subjects. Secondly, there was no follow-up study
on whether the effects of cognitive function improvements were long term. Thirdly, the
influence of drugs on the results cannot be excluded because the subjects continued their
dementia- and depression-related medication during the course of the study.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Duncan</surname><given-names>PW</given-names></name><name><surname>Goldstein</surname><given-names>LB</given-names></name><name><surname>Matchar</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Measurement of motor recovery after stroke.
