One hundred thirty-one premenopausal women, who had completed child-bearing, mean age of 45.7 years, with abnormal uterine bleeding refractory to medical management without histologic evidence of endometrial neoplasia were studied. The 131 patients were randomized for preoperative preparation for hysteroscopic endometrial destruction into 1 of 5 groups as follows: Group I, dilation and curettage (D &#x00026; C) (39); Group II, gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogue (GnRHa) for 1 month (23); Group III, GnRHa for 3 months (26); Group IV, danazol for 3 months (26); and Group V, medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) 15 mg for 3 months (27).

When neoplastic conditions have safely been ruled out and the patient has failed medical management and has completed childbearing, hysteroscopic endometrial destruction is a viable, minimally invasive and cost-effective treatment option that can often avoid a more costly and potentially more complicated hysterectomy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref></sup> Various pretreatment regimens have been attempted to arrest endometrial growth and reduce vascularity, which are believed to enhance the success of the procedure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref></sup> With greater demands being placed on clinicians for cost-effective outcome-based treatment, it is imperative to find the most efficient regimen for treating women with this disorder.</p><p>We evaluated the outcome of operative hysteroscopic endometrial destruction in patients with abnormal uterine bleeding who were ruled out for neoplastic conditions and had failed medical management, and who were randomized to various pretreatment protocols including dilation and curettage (D &#x00026; C), gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogue (GnRHa), danazol, and depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) before the operative event.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><p>This was a prospective, randomized, comparative investigation conducted at 3 academic teaching hospitals. One hundred thirty-one patients were enrolled in the study. The mean age of the patients was 45.7 years. All study patients had abnormal uterine bleeding refractory to medical management, underwent endometrial sampling to rule out neoplasia, and no longer desired to have children. Patients underwent thoughtful counseling with regard to future childbearing and contraceptive choices prior to enrolling in the study. Other criteria followed prior to endometrial destruction included the following: degree of abnormal uterine bleeding at a level that justified hysterectomy, uterine size &#x0003c; 12 weeks, and patient refusal of continued medical attempts to control bleeding.</p><p>Patients were randomized into 1 of 5 pretreatment groups before hysteroscopic endometrial destruction:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Group I: D &#x00026; C immediately before procedure.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Group II: GnRHa, goserelin 3.6 mg SC, for 1 month before procedure.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Group III: GnRHa, goserelin 3.6 mg SC monthly, for 3 months before procedure.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Group IV: danazol 400-600 mg PO per day, for 3 months before procedure.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Group V: MPA 15 mg PO per day, before procedure.</p></list-item></list><p>Informed consent was obtained from all patients, which explained the involved side effects, risks, and benefits of medications and the procedures. Alternative treatment options were given to patients.</p><p>All surgical procedures were performed in the ambulatory care unit, and the main outcome measures included improvement in bleeding problem, amenorrhea, operative time, complications, and relative costs.</p><p>Endometrial destruction was carried out by either the ablative technique with the 3.5-mm rollerball or by the resection technique with a 24-French cutting loop. Resection was performed with a Martin electro-diathermy unit on a blended cutting coagulation current of 70 W. The type of destruction was dependent upon the surgeon's preference; however, the surgeons were consistent with the type of technique used. We used Karl Storz hysteromat to push Glycine 1.5 fluid as a distension medium. The pressure of the apparatus is between 60 to 90 mm Hg. All procedures were carried out with a 26-French continuous flow resectoscope, fitted with a 4-mm 25-degree telescope.</p><p>Patient follow-up was for 1 year after the procedure for bleeding patterns. The patient reported the number of pad changes during menses and subjective assessment of the amount of menstrual blood loss. Complete blood count was analyzed at follow-up also.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The measured clinical outcomes were defined as improvement or amenorrhea.

At a time when cost-effectiveness of surgical procedures is paramount, it is imperative to scrutinize treatment outcomes, cost, operative times, and complications to select the most appropriate and efficacious management for patients.</p><p>The overall premise of this study shows no significant difference with regard to improvement or amenorrhea based on various pretreatments prior to endometrial destruction including D &#x00026; C, GnRHa, danazol, or MPA. This is consistent with the findings of Seeras and Gilliland,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref></sup> who reported a trend but not a significant difference between the preoperative use of GnRHa or dana-zol, and between ablation versus resection of the endometrium.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref></sup> Maia et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref></sup> achieved amenorrhea in 50% of patients with no preoperative pretreatment before endometrial resection in a series of 70 patients with menorrhagia. Conversely, however Sorensen et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref></sup> found an increased rate of amenorrhea at 1 year in the GnRHa pre-treatment group compared with no pretreatment for endometrial resection. Fraser et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref></sup> compared GnRHa and danazol before endometrial ablation and showed a similar effect with 74% of GnRHa users and 62% of dana-zol users achieving amenorrhea after 6 months of follow-up. The strength of our study is based on the comparison of a wide array of hysteroscopic pretreatment.</p><p>For the purpose of the study, improvement included both diminished menstrual flow and amenorrhea over the measured follow-up period of 1 year. Our patients achieved excellent improvement rates of 85.1% to 92.3% regardless of the type of pretreatment used. These results are consistent with the results reported by others.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref></sup></p><p>Although the rate of amenorrhea in our study was relatively low (18% to 39.1%) when compared with that in other studies (50% to 74%), our follow-up interval was measured up to 1 year after surgery, whereas the studies demonstrating higher rates of amenorrhea were followed for the considerably less time of 2 to 6 months.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref></sup> We and others believe that longer follow-up periods may yield greater recurrence rates of bleeding, which may require reoperation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref></sup></p><p>We found no statistically significant difference in the outcome after endometrial resection versus ablation <bold>(<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>)</bold>.

Cost analysis must also demonstrate acceptable quality for the treatment in question. Although reduced hospital costs and shorter recovery periods have been realized by using endometrial destructive techniques versus hysterectomy, definitive treatment of AUB favors hysterectomy. Among the hysteroscopic endometrial destruction groups, various pretreatments will greatly affect the overall cost. The most costly pretreatments included the use of GnRHa for 3 months prior to the surgical procedure followed by danazol pretreatment for 3 months, GnRHa for 1 month, D &#x00026; C, and MPA.</p><p>In conclusion, endometrial destruction whether performed with the ablation or resection technique is a safe, effective means to surgically control AUB.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref></sup> Surgeon preference should dictate which procedure is used. Our study demonstrated no significant difference in outcome regardless of the type of pretreatment used. In this regard, the authors recommend the most cost-effective pretreatment prior to the surgical procedure, which includes either D &#x00026; C or MPA for 3 months Medroxyprogesterone acetate confers the added advantage of controlling bleeding and induction of an endometrial atrophying effect on the endometrium, thus giving the surgeon better visualization for the procedure.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References:</title><ref id="B1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
