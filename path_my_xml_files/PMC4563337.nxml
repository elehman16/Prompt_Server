has on upper extremity function and performance of daily activities by chronic stroke
patients. [Subjects and Methods] Task-oriented training was applied to two chronic
hemiplegic patients in this research. The training was provided to each patient for 30
minutes a day, five times a week for two weeks. The treatment program included six
different types of training that could be performed by the patients themselves. Evaluation
was performed four times, that is, once a week for three weeks before the intervention and
once after the intervention. The change in upper extremity function was measured with the
Manual Function Test, and the change in performance of daily activity was measured with
the Functional Independence Measure. [Results] The upper extremity function of both
subjects was improved after application of task-oriented training. However, in the
performance of daily activities, subject one showed improvement compared to with before
the intervention, whereas subject two showed the same results. [Conclusion] This research
confirmed that two weeks of task-oriented training for chronic stroke patients is effective
for improvement of upper extremity function and performance of daily activities by chronic
stroke patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Task-oriented training</kwd><kwd>Upper function</kwd><kwd>Stroke</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Motor and cognitive-perceptual disability could occur in patients who have suffered brain
damage from a stroke, which could undermine their capacity to perform daily activities<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Carr and Shepherd suggested task-oriented
training as a treatment method to help improve deteriorated motor skills of stroke patients
and their capacity to perform daily activities, and diverse functional activities properly
applied to patients can help improve their actual motor skills and capacity to perform daily
activities<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Task-oriented training
refers to programs that focus on special functional tasks that unite the muscular skeletal
system and nervous system<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup> and treatments
that encourage active participation and focus on functional tasks rather than simple,
repetitive training of normal motion patterns<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Research on task-oriented training has been active lately, but
application of new research results in the clinical environment is impractical because most
patients are hospitalized for short periods and programs often have long application
periods, which are usually longer than three weeks<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus, the aim of this research was to determine the treatment
effect of a short period of task-oriented training (two weeks) on upper extremity function
and performance of daily activities in chronic stroke patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects of this research were two patients diagnosed with hemiparalysis from stroke

Subject one was a 38-year-old male who was diagnosed with middle cerebral
artery infarction and left hemiparalysis and had been hospitalized for 24 months. Subject
two was a 54-year-old male who was diagnosed with middle cerebral artery infarction and left
hemiparalysis and had been hospitalized for 29 months. Subjects one and two were both
naturally right-handed before their strokes and receiving conservative physical therapy and
work treatment for 30 minutes a day, five times a week. The patients volunteered to
participate and understood the objectives and contents of this study, and both showed a
willingness to actively participate in the study. The patients and their guardians signed an
informed consent form after receiving information about the purpose and methods of the
study. Also, the study was approved by the Inje University Faculty of Health Science Human
Ethics Committee. The inclusion criteria for the research subjects were as follows:
diagnosis of cerebral infarction, reasonable communication skills and 24 points or more on
the mini-mental status examination for Koreans (MMSE-K), no hemineglect phenomenon, and a
Brunnstrom recovery stage of four or higher. This study used an interrupted time series
(ITS) design to determine whether task-oriented activity had an effect greater than that of
natural recovery on impairment of the hemiplegic arm and hand of the subjects after a
stroke. ITS designs are characterized by the collection of multiple observations over time
that are &#x0201c;interrupted&#x0201d; by an intervention or treatment<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Evaluation was performed four times, that is, once a week for three
weeks before the intervention and once after the intervention. Easily accessible and
most-often-used tools in the clinical environment were chosen as evaluation tools. The
Functional Independence Measure (FIM) was used for assessment of subjects&#x02019; capacity to
perform daily activities, and the Manual Function Test (MFT) was used for assessment of the
level of upper limb function. The FIM is a tool for assessing the capacity of disabled
patients to perform daily activities objectively; it is widely used and has a reliability
level of 0.83&#x02013;0.96 among inspectors<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
MFT is a tool for assessing the functional level of upper limbs in the area of daily
activity performance and the recovery process. Its reliability level among inspectors and by
repeated evaluation is indicated by a Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha coefficient of 0.95 or higher, and
its inner consistency validity is 0.95 or higher<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Task-oriented training was provided to each patient for 30 minutes
a day, five times a week for two weeks. The task-oriented training provided to the patients
included six different types of training that could be performed by the patients themselves.
The activities were as follows: changing hospital gowns, throwing a tennis ball into a
basket, stacking cones, moving pegs, wiping tables with a towel, and passing rings along
curved rods. Data analysis included descriptive analysis of mean differences to test whether
the task-oriented training had a larger positive effect on impairment than natural recovery.
For each participant, individual pre-intervention data points were used to determine the
mean pre-intervention score for each measure; the same procedure was followed to obtain mean
post-intervention scores.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p><xref rid="tbl_002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title>Mean pre- and post-intervention scores and mean differences</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Measure</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pre-intervention mean</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Post-intervention mean</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mean difference</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">MFT</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" style="padding-left:10pt" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Participant 1</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">18.0</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">20.0</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.0</td></tr><tr><td align="left" style="padding-left:10pt" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Participant 2</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">22.2</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">24.0</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.8</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">FIM</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" style="padding-left:10pt" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Participant 1</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">121.0</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">122.0</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.0</td></tr><tr><td align="left" style="padding-left:10pt" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Participant 2</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">124.0</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">124.0</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.0</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>MFT: Manual Function Test; FIM: Functional Independence Measure</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap> shows the upper extremity function and ADL scores before and after the

positive effect on upper extremity function and ADL compared with natural recovery of people
in the chronic phase after a stroke. The results of this study confirmed the positive effect
of task-oriented training on all items except the FIM results of subject two. The subjects
in this research participated in the task-oriented training for thirty minutes a day, five
times a week for two weeks, which is a relatively short application period compared with
most previous studies, which have applied long task-oriented training periods of three weeks
or more<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, this research method is
more suitable for a clinical environment with short periods of hospitalization.
Nevertheless, consistent with the results of previous studies of task-oriented training, the
present study also observed a positive effect on the affected side upper extremity. This
indicates the possibility that even a short period of task-oriented training can produce
positive treatment effects. Also, task-oriented training had a positive effect on the
affected upper extremity even though the subjects in this research were chronic stroke
patients. This corresponds with the results of Kim&#x02019;s research, in which electrical
stimulation of the dermatomes combined with task-oriented movements was applied to chronic
stroke patients and resulted in improvement of hand functions<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, there was no improvement in subject two&#x02019;s capacity for
daily activity after the intervention in the present study. Possible explanations for this
include the fact that subject two was older than subject one and the possibility that
subject two&#x02019;s capacity to perform daily activities was already high. The clinical
significance of this research is the introduction of a more easily applicable form of
task-oriented training for chronic stroke patients in a clinical environment compared with
many other previous studies that also employed task-oriented training and confirmation of
the possibility that it is an effective treatment. However, there are some limitations to
this research: generalizing the results of this research is difficult due to the small
number of subjects, and since the two subjects were not treated simultaneously, the possible
influence of external treatment variables cannot be excluded.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>JM</given-names></name><name><surname>Stewart</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Shin</surname><given-names>IS</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Vascular disease/risk and late-life depression in a Korean
