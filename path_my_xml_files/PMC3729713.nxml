The zygomatic bone is particularly prone to facial injuries due to its prominence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] and is the second most common mid-facial bone affected. The fracture of the zygomatic bone can pose considerable functional complications such as restricted mouth opening. Disruption of the zygomatic position can also carry psychological, aesthetic and functional significance, causing impairment of ocular and mandibular functions. Therefore, a prompt diagnosis of fracture and soft tissue injuries is important for both cosmetic and functional reasons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>In most cases the treatment of unilateral zygomatic bone fractures leads to a significant degree of tissue trauma that again causes an inflammatory reaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. As a result, patients display common postoperative symptoms and types of pain, facial swelling and functional impairment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Pain is typically brief and peaks in intensity in the early postoperative period. In contrast, facial swelling reaches the characteristic maximum 48 to 72 hours after surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. These symptoms can affect the patient&#x02019;s quality of life and well-being. To increase patient satisfaction after treatment of uni- and bilateral zygomatic bone fractures, it is a necessary goal to minimize side effects as much as possible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. One way do so is to prescribe medication such as corticosteroids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], a combination of corticosteroids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] or enzyme preparations such as serrapeptase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Furthermore, there are also nonmedication methods to treat the above side effects. These can include manual lymph drainage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], soft laser [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and cryotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Historically, the therapeutic use of local or systemic cryotherapy was first described by Hippocrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Beneficial effects of cold treatment on postoperative swelling have been described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] as well as the positive impact on edema, pain and inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The activity of inflammatory enzymes rises with increasing temperatures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. On reviewing the literature, there is a lack of scientific evidence and trials in oral and maxillofacial surgery which show positive as well as no effect of cold therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Cooling therapy varies from the conventional, such as ice packs, gel packs or cold compresses, to mechanically supported continuous cooling with face masks. Both positive and negative side effects have been previously discussed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of hilotherapy in comparison with a conventional cooling method using cold compresses on swelling, pain, eye motility, diplopia, neurological complaints and overall patient satisfaction following treatment of unilateral zygomatic bone fractures.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The study was approved by the local ethics committee at the University Aachen, Germany (EK 142/2008).

The three-dimensional optical scanner consists of an optical range sensor, two digital cameras, a mirror construction and a commercial personal computer. The sensor is based on a phase-measuring triangulation method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. There is no need for special safety precautions for the patient, since the advantage of this optical sensor is its contactless data acquisition accompanied by its high accuracy in the z-direction with 200 &#x003bc;m and a short measurement time of 430 ms. The mirror construction permits the capture of over 180&#x000b0; of the patient&#x02019;s face. The computer program Slim 3D (3D Shape) automatically triangulates, merges and postprocesses the data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. The final output is a triangulated polygon mesh that is visualized as a synthetically-shaded or wire-mesh representation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. For the volume calculation all patients were photographed with a standard technique for frontal views of the face. Adjustment occurred on the Frankfurt horizontal line, parallel to the floor. Patients sat on a self-adjustable stool and were asked to look into a mirror with standard horizontal and vertical lines simulating a red cross marked on it. The horizontal line was adjusted to subnasale and the vertical line was aligned to the midline of the face. Patients were instructed to swallow hard and to keep their jaws in a relaxed position for the scan. Three-dimensional optical scans were recorded at six points in time: on day 1 after surgery (T1), on day 2 (T2), day 3 (T3), day 7 (T4), day 28 (T5) and day 90 (T6) postoperatively . For each patient we chose time point T6 as a reference, because at this time point swelling of soft tissue could be excluded which otherwise could influence the measurements. Annotations of T1 to T6 were prepared by an error minimization algorithm which applied modified Iterative Closest Point using simulated annealing by the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. To minimize disturbance of soft tissue during the registration process only facial areas that were not influenced by the swellings were used for surface matching: the forehead, ears and root of the nose. The geometrical models were aligned with the forehead and the ears. After the aligned shell deviation panels were created for cutoff to create an individual mask of the face (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>).</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>The final three-dimensional output of the Slim3D software is a triangulated polygon mesh, visualized as a synthetically shaded representation.</bold> Three-dimensional optical scans were recorded during six time points: T1 (day 1 after surgery, mask not shown), T2 (day 2 postoperatively, yellow mask), T3 (day 3 postoperatively, red mask), T4 (day 7 postoperatively, green mask), T5 (day 28 postoperatively, mask not shown) and T6 (day 90 postoperatively, blue mask). The reference three-dimensional model of each patient was T6. An individual mask of the midface of each patient was created and aligned to all captures and the difference in volume was thereby calculated.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1745-6215-14-238-4"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Pain analysis</title><p>Postoperative pain analysis was conducted with the help of a 10-point visual analogue scale based on measurements before surgery (T0), on day 1 (T1), day 2 (T2) and day 7 (T3) postoperatively, where the patients had to rate their pain on a score from 0 to 10, with 0 describing a situation without pain and 10 denoting a maximum intensity of pain.</p></sec><sec><title>Neurological analysis</title><p>The neurological analysis was utilized in order to enable the evaluation of nerve dysfunctions.

Furthermore, satisfaction of patients treated with hilotherapy was greater compared to patients who received conventional cooling. However, eye motility limitation, diplopia and neurological score revealed significant differences only at postoperative day 1. Wound healing was uneventful. Malfunctioning of the Hilotherm cooling device did not occur.</p><p>The healing process and possible complaints regarding the treatment of facial trauma can be influenced by patient-related factors such as age and gender, compliance and health status as well as patient independent factors such as surgeon experience, duration of surgery time, extent of trauma and fragment dislocation as well as use of antibiotics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Since in this study the use of antibiotics and the duration of surgery time were not significantly different among both groups, and since health-compromised patients were excluded from the study, these factors are considered not to have influenced the observed results.</p><p>Although the effects of different cooling methods have been investigated for a number of maxillofacial and plastic surgery treatment procedures, there is so far no study comparing conventional cooling versus hilotherapy following treatment of zygomatic bone fractures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p><p>Consistent with our results, Belli and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] reported the safe use of hilotherapy as well as a postoperative decrease in pain and swelling intensity and duration after Le-Fort-I osteotomy and bilateral sagittal osteotomy of the lower jaw. While they investigated only 10 patients without a comparison to other cooling techniques, Jones and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] recorded differences between hilotherapy and conventional groups in a greater cohort of 50 patients following face-lift surgery procedures. In contrast to our results, Jones and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] described a statistically significant increase in patient-reported postoperative swelling in the Hilotherm group with no significant differences regarding ecchymosis, hematoma or pain between groups. However, subjectively the majority of patients found the cooling masks to be comforting. In order to overcome the lack of significance of subjective assessments versus objective evaluation methods, Moro and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] measured the distance of multiple anatomic landmarks for swelling purposes. In so doing, 90 patients operated on for maxillomandibular malformations were divided into three groups and treated either with hilotherapy, conventional cooling or left untreated as a control group. As expected, no cryotherapy treatment led to the worst results whereas cooling with the hilotherapy method showed the least degree of swelling.</p><p>With the aim of improving measurement accuracy of different swelling stages, our study group used three-dimensional evaluation by the means of an optical face scanner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Hence, three-dimensional volumes could be measured instead of two-dimensional lines.</p><p>Although cryotherapy is a relatively safe way to treat complications after oral or maxillofacial surgeries, cold therapy should only be employed with caution. Above all, very young or very old patients can react with intolerances to external cooling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p><p>Topographical considerations make it difficult to quantify the facial volume of swelling. However, there are some limitations of this measurement technique which have to be discussed. The volume measurement with this technique is limited to localized facial swelling, since facial areas which have not been affected by the swelling are necessary for surface matching [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Some methods are described to predict soft tissue via cephalograms, which are able to create three-dimensional images. Ethically, the benefit of cephalograms might not justify the patient&#x02019;s exposure to ionizing radiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].</p><p>In summary, use of the cooling device by Hilotherm reduces postoperative swelling and pain compared to conventional cooling. Biological effects of cooling therapy on vascular, neural, metabolic and muscular sites are known. Cryotherapy decelerates cell metabolism because, according to Van&#x02019;t Hoff law, it slows down biochemical reactions. Regarding vascular effects, cold therapy constricts blood vessels. The intensity of vasoconstriction reaches the highest value at a temperature of 15&#x000b0;C. Furthermore, a decrease in body temperature slows down peripheral nerve conduction. For temperatures below 15&#x000b0;C, nerve conduction is completely disabled and the vasoconstriction turns into a vasodilatation. These biological effects influence postoperative symptoms. Meanwhile, the anti-edema effect is caused by the vasoconstriction and the pain reducing effect of the cold is related to a blocking of nerve endings. This blocking decelerates nerve conduction, and consequently the inflammation phenomena. Ice packs or similar conventional cooling methods use a temperature of around 0&#x000b0;C. Such a low temperature constrains lymph drainage and cell metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. The effects of a treatment with overly low temperatures have already been mentioned. The inference is that a system is needed that maintains the desired temperature over a fixed period of time. To fulfill this requirement, this study worked with the cooling device Hilotherm Clinic (Hilotherm GmbH) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Further studies are needed to investigate the benefits of this technique in other clinical research areas.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Hilotherm is easy to use for both, patients and medical staff.
