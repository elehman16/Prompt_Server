In this study, we examined different exercise regimens (forced and voluntary exercise) and compared them with the effect of stress-only on stroke protection. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;65) were randomly assigned to treatment groups for 3&#x000a0;weeks. These groups included control, treadmill exercise, voluntary running wheel exercise, restraint, and electric shock. Levels of the stress hormone, corticosterone, were measured in the different groups using ELISA. Animals from each group were then subjected to stroke induced by a 2-h middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion followed by 48-h reperfusion. Infarct volume was determined in each group, while changes in gene expression of stress-induced heat shock proteins (Hsp) 27 and 70 were compared using real-time PCR between voluntary and treadmill exercise groups. The level of corticosterone was significantly higher in both stress (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05) and treadmill exercise (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05) groups, but not in the voluntary exercise group. Infarct volume was significantly reduced (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.01) following stroke in rats exercised on a treadmill. However, the amelioration of damage was not duplicated in voluntary exercise, even though running distance in the voluntary exercise group was significantly (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.01) longer than that of the forced exercise group (4,828 vs. 900&#x000a0;m). Furthermore, rats in the electric shock group displayed a significantly increased (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.01) infarct volume. Expression of both Hsp 27 and Hsp 70 mRNA was significantly increased (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.01) in the treadmill exercise group as compared with that in the voluntary exercise group. These results suggest that exercise with a stressful component, rather than either voluntary exercise or stress alone, is better able to reduce infarct volume. This exercise-induced neuroprotection may be attributable to up-regulation of stress-induced heat shock proteins 27 and 70.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Treadmill</kwd><kwd>Running wheel</kwd><kwd>Stress</kwd><kwd>Ischemia/reperfusion</kwd><kwd>Voluntary</kwd><kwd>Hsp 27</kwd><kwd>Hsp 70</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer-Verlag 2008</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-wrap></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>As one of the current leading causes of death and injury, stroke commands a great deal of attention from the medical research world. Much effort has been focused on identifying therapies which may decrease the severity of injury suffered in stroke or preventative measures which may decrease the occurrence of these devastating incidences. Expanding literature substantiates the beneficial effects of exercise on stroke-induced brain injury in animal models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. In previous studies, a marked improvement in survival and a corresponding decrease in infarct volume were observed in transient forebrain ischemia after physical activity on a treadmill for 2&#x02013;4&#x000a0;weeks in gerbils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], and mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. However, these previous studies employed a treadmill exercise regimen and thus raised questions as to whether the stress involved in the forced procedure itself might play some role in the results. In the current study, preconditioning treatments, which consist of stress alone, were added in order to further elucidate the neuroprotective effects of stress versus exercise. By comparing these results with data from treadmill exercise regimens, we can identify possible effects of stress, whether protective or damaging, on the extent of brain injury which is present after a transient ischemic attack. We also investigate whether the neuroprotection seen with forced exercise on a treadmill could be replicated with a preconditioning regimen of voluntary exercise.</p><p>In addition to identifying any variations in brain infarct area after stroke among different exercise and stress preconditioning regimens, this study aimed to further elucidate the mechanism of neuroprotection at the molecular level. Previous research has shown that heat shock proteins (Hsp) are highly conserved proteins found in the brain which act as molecular chaperones with neuroprotective activities under physiological conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. More specifically, two heat shock proteins in particular, the 70&#x000a0;kDa Hsp (Hsp 70) and the 27&#x000a0;kDa Hsp (Hsp 27), display changes in expression in response to various types of stress, including heat, shock, ischemia, oxidative stress, glucose deprivation, and exposure to toxins and heavy metals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In the central nervous system, inducible expression of both Hsp 70 and Hsp 27 is observed in many areas of the brain and is associated with cellular resistance to a variety of insults. The present study was conducted to determine whether expression levels of Hsp 70 and Hsp 27 are associated with exercise-induced neuroprotection.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Subjects</title><p>Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;65) were subjected to one of four treatment protocols each day for 3&#x000a0;weeks: (1) forced treadmill exercise (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;10 for histology analysis, <italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;6 for mRNA expression analysis); (2) voluntary exercise (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;10 for histology analysis, <italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;6 for mRNA expression analysis); (3) stress via electric shock (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;10 for histology analysis); and (4) stress via physical restraint (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;10 for histology analysis); or a control group (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;7 for histology analysis, <italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;6 for mRNA expression analysis) which underwent no treatment during these 3&#x000a0;weeks.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Exercise and stress procedures</title><p>Animals were randomly assigned to each group. Animals in the forced exercise group were run on a four-lane treadmill (AccuPacer, AccuScan Instruments, Inc., Columbus, OH) at a speed of 30&#x000a0;m/min for 30&#x000a0;min each day, 5&#x000a0;days/week [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The treadmill has an endless conveyor-type belt, driven by a DC servomotor with optical encoder for precise speed control. The animals are separated from each other by opaque partitions. The motor drive electronics permits the user to select any speed from 0 up to 100&#x000a0;m per min. A shock grid is built into each channel, which can be used to stimulate animals to run. In addition, the front of the treadmill is made of dark acrylic so that the animals can run towards the darkened section of the channel. Thus, the animals are provided with both negative and positive stimuli resulting in continuous running. Animals in the voluntary exercise group were housed individually in a cage with a running wheel assembly (Respironics) connected to a switch that counted each revolution of the wheel and were recorded daily for 3&#x000a0;weeks. Animals in the electric shock group were confined to the small electrically charged grid which was used to force animals to run continuously on the treadmill. Animals received 15 stimulations (&#x0003c;2.0&#x000a0;mA) over a 30&#x000a0;min time period, which was comparable to that sustained by the rats which ran on the treadmill. Animals in the restraint group (control stress) were placed individually in a tail access rodent restrainer (Stoelting) for a 120&#x000a0;min period. This action was performed at normal room temperature, in a normal light setting, and with normal room noise. All animals were weighed daily.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>ELISA</title><p>Blood samples were obtained from each animal prior to stroke.

The infarct region, defined as the area with reduced staining or containing dark pyknotic necrotic cell bodies, was determined from serially cut sections through the MCA territory in the frontoparietal sensorimotor cortex and dorsolateral portion of the striatum. Our data demonstrated that forced exercise on a treadmill induces a significant decrease (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05) in brain infarct volume (9.9&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;3.6% of the volume of the contralateral hemisphere) as compared to non-exercise controls (48.5&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;2.5% of the volume of the contralateral hemisphere) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b). In fact, the volume of brain infarct seen after exercise on a treadmill is reduced by approximately 79% in comparison with controls. In contrast, we found no significant decrease in infarct volume in the voluntary exercise group as compared to the control group. In order to determine any effect that the stress involved in forced exercise regimens may have on inducing neuroprotection, we also evaluated infarct volume in ischemic rats exposed to stress, either in the form of physical restraint or electric shock. The data showed no significant difference (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;0.05) in brain infarct volume between the restraint and control groups. Interestingly, exposure to the same electric shock, which was used to stimulate rats to run on the treadmill, caused a significant increase (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05) in brain infarct volume. These results suggest that stress alone did not induce neuroprotection, but rather enhanced the amount of brain damage produced during stroke.

Although, the daily average running distance of individual voluntary exercise group members (4,828&#x000a0;m) was significantly longer than that of the forced exercise group members (900&#x000a0;m), voluntary exercise did not induce neuroprotection as compared to the control group. Furthermore, there was no correlation between the distance run and the infarct volume within the voluntary exercise group.

Furthermore, we observed an increase in infarct volume in rats under a stressful electric shock regimen that was also used to stimulate the treadmill-exercised animals to run. This indicates that different levels or types of stress endured may actually lead to an increase in the resultant damage to the brain after an ischemic attack. Expression of glutamate and related receptors may play a role. Previous studies have demonstrated that CNS disorders, including stress and depression, in both animal and human models are attributable to the expression of glutamate and glutamatergic NMDA receptors, NR2B-selective antagonists, non-NMDA ionotropic glutamate receptors, <italic>N</italic>-acetylaspartylglutamate, glutamate and glycine transporters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].

Several clinical and animal studies have provided evidence that peri-ischemic concentrations of glucocorticoid hormones, i.e., cortisol in humans and corticosterone in rats, are increased during stressful events and exacerbate stroke outcome. High cortisol levels are associated with increased morbidity and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. In rats, an increase in blood corticosterone concentrations during or after cerebral ischemia was associated with an increase in infarct volume [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. It has been proposed that rather than killing neurons directly, exposure to high concentrations of corticosteroids typically induces a physiological state that renders neurons more susceptible to subsequent neurologic insults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. The finding that our shock treatment, which isolated stress alone and involved increased corticosterone levels, was not neuroprotective supported these proposed detrimental effects of elevated corticosterone. However, our finding that treadmill exercise, a treatment which also involves increased corticosterone levels, significantly reduces brain damage following stroke calls this assumption into question. It follows that forced exercise with a stressful component is neuroprotective while stress alone is not. Further studies are needed to fully explain this relationship between stress and brain damage in our stroke model.</p><p>In addition, we have found that two separate exercise regimens, forced treadmill exercise involving both movement and stress, and voluntary running wheel exercise involving movement alone produce very different results. A similar treatment period but much longer running distance in the voluntary exercise regimen does not provide significant neuroprotection in this stroke model as compared with forced exercise. This indicates that some aspect of treadmill exercise itself may be responsible for the reduction in brain infarct area, but more research is needed to further elucidate the mechanism of neuroprotection provided by forced exercise. In contrast with our findings, previous studies in a mouse model demonstrated no difference in the neuroprotection provided by voluntary exercise on a running wheel versus forced exercise on a treadmill (4,000&#x000a0;m vs. 360&#x000a0;m per day, respectively) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In fact, both types of exercise regimens led to an increase in regional cerebral blood flow, a reduction in cerebral infarct size and brain swelling, and diminished neurological deficits in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. However, this discrepancy between rats and mice may be due to different intensities of running between small mice (20&#x02013;25&#x000a0;g body weight and 5&#x02013;6&#x000a0;cm body length for 4,000&#x000a0;m) and large rats (250&#x02013;300&#x000a0;g body weight and 15&#x02013;20&#x000a0;cm length for the same distance). This size difference causes the two species to perform very different amounts of work in traversing a similar distance. Since mice are smaller and thus must expend more energy than rats in running a given distance, it follows that these two animals may produce different results in response to exercise preconditioning in a stroke model.</p><p>In order to further elucidate the mechanism by which treadmill exercise rather than running wheel exercise induces neuroprotection, heat shock proteins Hsp 70 and Hsp 27 were investigated. These proteins can be induced in response to various types of stress, including heat, shock, ischemia, oxidative stress, glucose deprivation, and exposure to toxins and heavy metals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Over-expression of inducible Hsp 70 has been shown to provide protection from cerebral ischemia both in animal stroke models and in cell culture hypoxia models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. As a molecular chaperone expressed constitutively, induced Hsp 70 facilitates optimal folding of nascent and denatured proteins during normal as well as stressful circumstances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Hsp 70 regulates apoptotic cell death by interfering with apoptosis inducing factor (AIF), as well as increasing levels of anti-apoptotic proteins, such as the Bcl-2 family. Hsp 70 induction has been identified in cells that survive cerebral ischemia, as well as in cells that survive after preconditioning with heat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. A number of studies have shown that ischemic preconditioning produces Hsp 70 in neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] and in vasculature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], leading to neuroprotection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Furthermore, physical exercise was reported to induce Hsp 70 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] in association with cardioprotection against ischemia/reperfusion injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Although, the majority of studies on the protective effect of individual Hsps have concentrated on the major inducible heat shock protein Hsp 70, a variety of evidence suggests that the small heat shock protein, Hsp 27, may have a more potent protective effect in the nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. In cultured neurons, over-expression of Hsp 70 can protect against subsequent exposure to thermal or ischemic stress but not against exposure to other stressful stimuli, while over-expression of Hsp 27 protects against a variety of stresses. Similarly, although transgenic animals over-expressing Hsp 70 are protected against cardiac ischemia, more equivocal results have been obtained in terms of their protection against cerebral ischemia and other stresses to the nervous system. In contrast, transgenic animals over-expressing Hsp 27 were shown to possess neuroprotection. Hsp 27 expression was also reported to have a neuroprotective role in dorsal root ganglia and was associated with the Akt signaling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. A number of studies have investigated the relationships between Hsp 27 and Akt, also known as PKB, and reported that Akt forms a complex with Hsp 27 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. By linking with Hsp 27, the activation of Akt after stress or insult can promote survival via a series of signal transduction events that act to inhibit apoptosis, such as phosphorylation and inactivation of Bad [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. It has also been shown that Hsp 27 itself displays anti-apoptotic ability by inhibiting caspases and cytochrome c release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Therefore, increased levels of Hsp 70 and Hsp 27 after forced exercise, as compared to voluntary exercise, could play a pivotal role in inducing neuroprotection.</p><p>Although the present study has shown that heat shock protein expression was associated with infarct reduction, the cause-and-effect relationship will be determined in our future study by selectively blocking Hsp expression and showing that the effect of infarct volume is also blocked. In order to maintain our focus on the neuroprotective effects of forced exercise versus voluntary exercise, Hsp 27 and Hsp 70 expressions were measured in both exercise groups, but not in the restraint and electric shock groups. The stress models were designed to eliminate the stress component from the treadmill exercise group. The electric shock group was specifically designed to eliminate the stress variable in the treadmill group and the restraint group was designed as a stress control. In addition, as previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] suggested, exercise-induced neuroprotection may involve multiple pathways; the key role of Hsp expression as well as its interactions with other molecular pathway will be further investigated in our future study.</p><p>Taken together, the results in the present study suggest that exercise with a stressful component, rather than either voluntary exercise or stress alone, is better able to induce neuroprotection and reduce brain infarct volume after stroke. Although, further studies are needed to confirm protein expression and functional sites, our study suggests that this exercise-induced neuroprotection is attributable to up-regulation of stress-induced heat shock proteins 27 and 70.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are grateful to Dr. Qin Lai for his help in the statistical analysis and to Mr. Yandong Zhou for his help in preparation of the manuscript.
