The study products will be weighed, packaged and signed by consecutive numbers according to the randomisation list by the hospital pharmacy at the Medical University of Warsaw by independent personnel not involved in the conduct of the trial. The randomisation sequence and codes will be secured until all participants have been recruited into the trial and all data have been analysed.</p></sec><sec id="s2k"><title>Blinding</title><p>The study products (GNN and placebo) will be identically packaged capsules. All participants and investigators will be blinded to the assigned treatment throughout the study. Unblinding will occur after the final data analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s2l"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All analysis will be conducted on an intention-to-treat basis, including all patients in the groups to which they are randomised for whom outcomes will be available (including dropouts and withdrawals). Descriptive statistics will be used to summarise baseline characteristics. The Student t test will be used to compare mean values of continuous variables approximating a normal distribution. For non-normally distributed variables, the Mann&#x02013;Whitney U test will be used. The &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test or Fisher exact test will be used, as appropriate, to compare percentages. The same computer software will be used to calculate the relative risk (RR), number needed to treat and MD, all with a 95% CI. The difference between study groups will be considered significant when the p value is &#x0003c;0.05, when the 95% CI for RR does not include 1.0, or when the 95% CI for MD does not include 0. All statistical tests will be two tailed and performed at the 5% level of significance.</p></sec><sec id="s2m"><title>Methods for additional analyses</title><p>Both the primary and secondary outcomes will be analysed using analysis of covariance (adjusted for the baseline value). Potential effect modification (confounding) due to any chance imbalance in pubertal status, age and sex will be counteracted by inclusion of these in a secondary analysis, using a multifactorial regression analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s2n"><title>Missing data</title><p>Every effort will be made to minimise missing baseline and outcome data. The amount of missing data will be reported for each randomised arm. If necessary, multiple imputation or Bayesian methods for missing data will be used as appropriate to address any missing data.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>

An informed written consent form will be signed by a parent or legal guardian (and patients &#x02265;16&#x02005;years) before the study enrolment. Any modifications to the protocol, which may affect the conduct of the study, potential benefits to the patients, or patient safety&#x02014;including changes to the study design&#x02014;will be reported to the ethics committee for all necessary amendments. All study-related information will be stored securely at the study site in locked cabinets, in an area with limited access (databases will be secured with a password-protected access system).</p></sec><sec id="s2p"><title>Dissemination</title><p>The findings of this RCT will be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal (paediatric, nutrition or gastroenterology).

A definitive answer has not yet been provided. Our study, carried out at a research centre with experience in conducting independent, investigator-initiated RCTs, intends to address a gap in the field and will test the effectiveness of GNN for reducing body weight in overweight and obese children.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> HS conceptualised the study.
