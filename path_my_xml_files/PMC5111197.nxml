Currently it is hypothesized that bladder discomfort, lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and hematuria are due to mechanical irritation of bladder trigone as well as bladder neck, while flank pain is associated with vesicoureteric reflux and evidences showed antireflux stent can minimize the pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. As a consequence, efforts such as improving stent design and composition and investigating medical therapy have been made to solve this problem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. So far many researches have shown that &#x003b1;-blockers and anticholinergic agents both can ease these discomforts and ultimately improve the QoL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] . However, there&#x02019;re still not many researches on comparison between monotherapy and combination. In addition, some most recent published papers made different voices: while former researches with International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) found combination therapies provided preferable outcomes, some most current ones declared that monotherapies functioned equally with the combination in Ureteric Stent Symptom Questionnaire (USSQ) assessment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>Basing on the background above, we conducted a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of solifenacin, tamsulosin and the combination therapy, and meanwhile to explore SRSs&#x02019; development features with time as secondary outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Subjects and treatments</title><p>An open-label, randomized, controlled study was conducted at West China Hospital of Sichuan University from Feb 2014 to May 2015.

X-ray plain films were done after both insertions to make sure the stents were in correct position since inappropriate stent location would worsen LUTS and affect the QoL severely [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].

Every patient had two series of follow-ups (pre- and post-lithotripsy) as self-control. Data of patients who missed more than twice dose or follow-ups throughout the follow-up duration were excluded in the final analysis. Also a questionnaire aiming at adverse events was taken on day14 to evaluate the safety.</p><p>The primary outcome was the urinary symptom score of the given questionnaire.

The total incidence rate of adverse events from these three groups and no significant differences (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.727). No serious adverse events were reported throughout the study.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In a previous study on SRSs features, J. Irani et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] declared that the general tolerance to SRSs remains unchanged with time while only some symptoms significantly improve, dysuria and hematuria included. And in the current study, we also recorded that though SRSs relieved spontaneously to some degree within a few days after the insertion, it would stay relatively stable after then, and might even relapse or worsen as time went by. The minimal total symptom score was designed as 4, which meant suffering no SRSs, in our questionnaire. But the actual minimal mean of total scores of all symptoms in the control group was 8.607, which again demonstrated that patients would not develop complete tolerance to SRSs within two weeks. We estimate that the symptoms appearing within the very first days after insertion may be also associated with stimulation of transurethral endoscopic procedures, and these parts of symptoms can rapidly improve. The phenomenon that pre- and post-lithotripsy cases suffered differently in the beginning may support this hypothesis to some degree. And since the patients suffer the most in the first few days, we recommend that active managements should be given to patient right after stent-insertion, especially to whom following ureteroscopy surgeries.</p><p>Speaking of efficacy, solifenacin and tamsulosin showed comparably promising effect on releasing urgency, bladder discomfort and flank pain. And the long-term effects of both monotherapies were not inferior to the combination therapy in the current study. Meanwhile however, we also noticed that in the first few days a combination therapy would take effect faster than monotherapy, especially on symptoms of bladder pain and urgency. We think that the inhibitors of &#x003b1;- receptor and m-receptor may have synergistic effect on releasing irritative symptoms of bladder. So for patients who have relatively severe SRSs from the beginning or who are urge to release the symptom, a combination therapy is recommended. But after the first few days, an alternation to monotherapy would be a proper choice because the outcome demonstrated that a long-term combination therapy was unnecessary.</p><p>Although some transient relieving was observed, no general improvement in hematuria and frequency was found in any medication therapy groups comparing with the control, which disagreed with some previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Hematuria is believed to result from mechanical injury on mucosa by stent, so we think it may be more likely to be affected by patients&#x02019; living habits, exercise habits for example, other than medicine intervention. And for frequency, we believe water-drinking amount also contributes a lot to it apart from stent insertion. In the current study, a daily water intake over 2500&#x000a0;ml resulted in urine volume increasing to about 2000&#x000a0;ml per day. Medication of &#x003b1;-blockers and anticholinergic agents are believed able to release irritating-induced storage symptoms while not affect the normal voiding function of bladder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], so frequency resulting from increased urine volume wouldn&#x02019;t be improved by solifenacin or tamsulosin. This reminds us that recording daily urine volume may be necessary for an accurate SRSs assessment.</p><p>We found it interesting to note that QoL might not improve completely with symptom releasing. On the days just following stent-insertion, patients accepting drug therapies had even poorer score on QoL than the control, although the degrees of their symptoms were about the same or even better. Not satisfied with the slow effect of drug in the first few days may be one of the reasons. Also our advice on water drinking and exercise limitation, which may contribute to the lower incidence of hematuria and flank pain, may also make patients feel bothered. During the follow-up days some patients complained about change in living habits and their QoL scores stayed low even though they have no obvious symptoms.</p><p>There are three previous studies adopting the same or similar regimen with the current study. Essam S. et al. found combined therapy of 0.4&#x000a0;mg tamsulosin and 10&#x000a0;mg solifenacin daily significantly alleviated irritative symptoms associated with stent-insertion comparing to either single medication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Lim KT. et al. drew a conclusion of agreement with Essam S. with half the dose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Jinsung P. et al. adopted the same regimen of Lim KT., but resulted in a totally different conclusion. They declared that neither tamsulosin nor solifenacin medications provide beneficial effects for SRSs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In the current study, we conducted a multiple follow-up on several different days to explore SRSs, which can avoid bias of single-day follow-up adopted by the previous studies since SRSs may be affected by aspects like amount of exercise and water-drinking. All the researches mentioned above reached only one agreement that the administration of solifenacin and tamsulosin as well as their combination appeared equally safe and no severe complications were recorded. And so did the current one.</p><p>The following limitations should be acknowledged. A major one was that our method inevitably increased the workload of follow-up staffs and participants, so a limitation existed in comprehensiveness of symptom assessment and sample size. However since the size reached our established goal, we still believe our outcomes can make some sense. Another problem was that our center only provided stents with the same size and couldn&#x02019;t adjust the lengths of stents with heights. But while the randomized groups had no significant difference in patients&#x02019; heights, this limitation would have little influence on the comparison outcomes. Further studies may take more comprehensive symptoms and effects of living habits into account, ending in more accurate assessment of SRSs, so as to bring out a more optimal protocol which can benefit patients the most.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>As our outcomes demonstrated, SRSs would release spontaneously to some degree in the first few days after the insertion, then stay non-improved or even worsen in the following days, which may still be troublesome. Combination of solifenacin and tamsulosin can take effect faster and improve the SRSs better than monotherapy in the first few days. After that, combination and monotherapy relieve the SRSs equally. So for long-term using, patients with SRSs may get comparable benefits from monotherapy and combination. Patients with frequency or hematuria may benefit little from both drugs because these symptoms would be largely affected by living habits. Further studies with lager sample size are expected to collect more detailed data and drawing more accurate conclusions.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec13"><title>Additional file</title><p>
