Reduction in dental caries is one of the objectives to achieve the Global Goals 2020.

However, most of the studies have shown that it is difficult to completely eliminate <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic> from oral cavity by mechanical and chemical control. In an era where increasing health-care costs, rising food literacy, and the Hippocratic concept of &#x0201c;let food be thy medicine and medicine be thy food&#x0201d; has led to discovery of &#x0201c;functional foods&#x0201d; that have moved into the corporate mainstream,[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] probiotics with their wide range of applicability have been believed to confer various beneficial health effects. Theoretically, oral microbial ecological alteration with these bacteria and a long-term reduction of S. mutans by these bacteria could imply to a reduced risk of initial lesions and also would clarify whether this approach could be an alternative strategy for the reduction of pathogenic <italic>S. mutans</italic> count [<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and thus an alternative to caries control strategy.</p><p><italic>Lactobacillus acidophilus</italic> La5 and <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> lactis Bb12 are widely available in Indian markets with their focus on general health, oral ingestion being the common route of administration.
