This state of hyper circulation also enhances the transdermal drug absorption and assimilation. Massage causes movement of the muscles thereby accelerating the blood supply, which in turn helps in relieving the muscular fatigue and reduces stiffness.

With the advancement of modern science, a new nervous system of abdomen has been discovered, which is named as enteric nervous system (ENS) and is called as the mini brain.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Though nothing about the relation between ENS and <italic>Basti</italic> therapy is known until date, the same is supposed to work in diseases of central nervous system like cerebral palsy. The ingredient drugs of <italic>Mustadi</italic> RB have predominant <italic>Vatahara</italic> and <italic>Rasayana</italic> properties. Hence <italic>Mustadi</italic> RB being a type of <italic>Niruha Basti</italic>, does the <italic>Shodhana</italic> as well as it gives strength to the patient.
