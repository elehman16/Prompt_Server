NAFLD carries increased risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular diseases. There is an urgent need to find effective and safe therapy for children and adults with NAFLD. Data from research and clinical studies suggest that omega-3 fatty acids may be beneficial in metabolic syndrome-related conditions and can reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>We are conducting a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of treatment with omega-3 fatty acids in children with NAFLD. Patients are randomized to receive either omega-3 fatty acids containing docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) or placebo for 24 weeks. The dose of omega-3 (DHA+ EPA) ranges from 450 to 1300 mg daily. Low calorie diet and increased physical activity are advised and monitored using validated questionnaires. The primary outcome of the trial is the number of patients who decreased ALT activity by &#x02265; 0,3 of upper limit of normal. The main secondary outcomes are improvement in the laboratory liver tests, liver steatosis on ultrasound, markers of insulin resistance and difference in fat/lean body mass composition after 6 months of intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Potential efficacy of omega-3 fatty acids in the treatment of NAFLD will provide needed rationale for use of this safe diet supplement together with weight reduction therapy in the growing population of children with NAFLD.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/study/NCT01547910?term=NCT01547910&#x00026;rank=1">NCT01547910</ext-link></p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease</kwd><kwd>Omega-3 fatty acids</kwd><kwd>Polyunsaturated fatty acids</kwd><kwd>Randomized controlled trial</kwd><kwd>Children</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) comprises spectrum of liver damage that ranges from simple steatosis through steatohepatitis (NASH), fibrosis to cirrhosis, end-stage liver disease and occasionally hepatocellular carcinoma. Although the natural history of NAFLD remains yet to be defined, it is now clear that NAFLD and especially NASH carries increased risk of atherosclerosis, cardiovascular disease (CVD) and overall mortality when compared to general population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Emerging evidence suggests that the main cause of death in NAFLD is CVD what strongly reflects its very close relation to metabolic syndrome (MS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. In patients who develop liver steatosis at younger age the complications of the liver disease and metabolic syndrome may appear sooner, therefore they require special concern and early management.</p><p>Weight reduction appears to be the front-line therapy in NAFLD. Dietary restrictions are as important as physical activity and changes in lifestyle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. However compliance is poor in these patients and there is too much inconsistent data from the clinical trials to indicate the optimal rate and extent of weight loss in children.</p><p>Pharmacological treatment remains unsuccessful in both children and adults with NAFLD. In the planning phase of this trial we performed a systematic review of literature on pharmacological interventions for NAFLD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Use of probucol, pioglitazone, metformin and carnitine in high doses may be promising but in conclusion none of the pharmacological agents could be recommended for treatment of NAFLD, especially in children. Recent two large clinical trials using vitamin E and pioglitazone in NAFLD showed conflicting results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>Omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids are safe diet supplements that showed efficacy in the prevention and therapy of cardiovascular diseases, dyslipidemia and metabolic syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In a paucity of effective treatment they may constitute safe pharmacological option for children with NAFLD.</p><p>Recently Parker et al. published systematic review and meta-analysis of studies of omega-3 LC-PUFA (long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids) supplementation in adults with NAFLD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Nine studies (5 RCTs), involving 355 individuals were included. Patients were given either omega-3 LC-PUFA or control treatment. Duration of therapy ranged from 8 weeks to 12 months, as well as the dose of LC-PUFA - from 0,25g to 13,7g per day. In conclusion of the review, omega-3 fatty acids were claimed beneficial vs. placebo in reducing liver fat (estimated by liver biopsy, ultrasound or 1H-MRS) (effect size = &#x002d9;0.97, 95% CI: &#x002d9;0.58 to &#x002d9;1.35, p &#x0003c;0.001) and decreasing AST (effect size = &#x002d9;0.97, 95% CI: &#x002d9;0.13 to &#x002d9;1.82, p = 0.02) but not ALT activity. However the current data are not sufficient to set the optimal dose of LC-PUFA in NAFLD.</p><p>So far there has been only one randomized controlled trial that assessed efficacy of LC-PUFA in children with NAFLD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Patients were assigned to receive 250 mg or 500 mg of DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) per day or placebo for 6 months. Beneficial results of DHA were expressed in the improvement of level triglycerides, markers of insulin resistance and liver fat assessed by ultrasound. DHA did not show significant effect on ALT activity.</p><p>Below we describe design of our multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of omega-3 LC-PUFA supplementation in children with NAFLD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study design overview</title><p>We are conducting a multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial to assess efficacy of treatment with omega-3 LC-PUFA in children with established NAFLD. Eligible patients are randomized to two arms: these who receive either fish oil containing omega-3 LC-PUFA: docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) (450 to 1300 mg daily), or placebo (sunflower oil) for 24 weeks.</p><p>The main aim of the study is to determine whether supplementation of omega-3 LC-PUFA improves biochemical parameters of liver function, markers of insulin resistance, serum lipid profile and liver steatosis on ultrasound in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.

They were previously instructed by a dietician how to fill in the food records. Patients were asked to specify the volume of consumed food with usual household measurements (e.g. cups, tablespoons) or to indicate the weight of commercial products with information recipes. After completing the food record, participants met with the dietician to review all the information for record accuracy, completeness and portion size of individual items.

However the precision in quantifying intakes may be questioned. FFQ is preferred method in large cross-sectional and cohort studies in children.</p><p>For the purpose of our study FFQs were administered by registered dieticians who interviewed children and their parents in all centres. The questionnaire was modified in order to get key information about food ingredients vital for the development of obesity and metabolic syndrome e.g. saturated fatty acids, carbohydrates and antioxidants and on the other hand, these that protect organism from metabolic syndrome development, such us unsaturated fatty acids and antioxidants. Dieticians used food models for an approximate estimation of the portion consumed by the patient. The list contained over 300 products: typical dishes, raw materials, processed food, fluids and dietary supplements. Participants were asked about frequency of intake for different food during the last month in terms of day, week or month. Where available they had to provide recipes for consumed products. Parents were supporting the minors in completing the record. The FFQ was performed at the beginning (week 0) and the end of study medication treatment (week 24).</p><p>Data of consumed food were calculated to 1 day amount intake and recalculated into nutrients and energy by Energia FFQ software by Andrzej Miegoc&#x000ae;.

Patients report their complaints and adverse events to the physician and consult their diet with a dietician.</p><p>At visit M2 patients undergo physical examination, comprehensive laboratory and imaging examinations. Repeated food and physical activity questionnaires are recorded. Patients stop taking the study drug however the lifestyle recommendations are further maintained.</p><p>A follow-up visit (M3) is scheduled 6 months after the end of therapy to check whether changes of body weight, laboratory parameters of liver function and imaging are sustained.</p><p>Blood tests measurements perform the local laboratories, except for antioxidants, cytokines and fatty acids profile that are sent to the central laboratory. Upper limit of normal of ALT activity varies between the four medical centers (40&#x02013;45 U/L), therefore in the statistical analysis we will calculate and use a percentage of the ULN.</p><p>Each anthropometric parameter and vital sign was measured twice and the mean value was taken into statistics. Systolic/diastolic blood pressure and heart rate were measured by the automatic blood pressure device (Dinamap XL, Critikon&#x000ae;, U.S.). Patients rested for 10 minutes in the supine position before measurement. Arm circumference was set midway between the shoulder tip and the olecranon process. The same arm was used throughout the study.</p><p>One experienced radiologist was performing abdominal ultrasound at each centre and estimated the degree of liver steatosis according to Saverymuttu scoring system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. When applicable, liver biopsy was done and assessed by two independent pathologists. At each centre a registered dietician administered food records and monitored adherence to the dietary regime.</p><p>At every visit any adverse events (AEs), that have occurred since the last visit and changes in the concomitant treatment were documented. For all investigations the data were entered into electronic case report form (eCRF) system and stored there anonymously.</p><p>The detailed schedule of the trial visits and investigations are

Using computer statistical software StatsDirect version 2.7.9 (StatsDirect Ltd., England, UK) the list of random treatment assignments was generated. Randomization was made to two arms (omega-3 or placebo), in blocks of four individuals, stratified by centre. The use of centre stratification guarantees balance and increases statistical accuracy. Investigators sent randomizations requests by fax to the central randomization center (CRC) responsible for the process of randomization. In return they received a random number that was subsequently allocated to the choice of one of the products (numbered 100 or 101).</p></sec><sec><title>Treatment dispensing and assessment of compliance</title><p>All the study treatments were provided in a capsule form. Identical appearance of capsules for both arms (omega-3 and placebo) ensured the double blind study design. Study drug were stored in plastic boxes containing 200 capsules at room temperature. The boxes were the same for the two treatments arms, blinded by a manufacturer, marked with 3 digits: &#x0201c;100&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;101&#x0201d; &#x02013; for omega-3 or placebo.</p><p>Study treatment was dispensed by the investigator at the inclusion visit M0. After the validation of patient&#x02019;s eligibility the investigator contacted with the CRC to declare the inclusion of the patient and allocate his/her therapeutic unit number. The kit number attributed by CRC corresponded to the randomized treatment arm. The box marked with respective kit number were given to the patient.</p><p>At the visit M1 the treatment pack allocated at the previous visit was retrieved from the patient and the drug accountability of the remaining capsules was performed.</p><p>At the final M2 study visit the kits allocated at visits M0 and M1 were retrieved from the patient. The number of used and remaining capsules were documented to estimate the compliance with the study drug. When the study had been completed no new allocation of treatment was made.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Patients recruitment for the trial started in 2008 and ended in 2011. From a total of 86 screened participants 10 were found ineligible (11.6%). The most frequent reason for ineligibility was ALT activity &#x0003c;1.3x ULN. A total of 76 children with NAFLD met the inclusion criteria and were randomly assigned to receive either the omega-3 (n=38) or placebo (n=38).</p><p>The follow-up of the study is still ongoing. We are currently finalizing data collection obtained after 24 weeks of treatment. The full statistical analysis of the study results will be completed in the mid-2013.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Marine omega-3 fatty acids are very promising dietary supplements used in prevention and therapy of cardiovascular, inflammatory, immunological, psychological and neurological disorders. They are safe pharmacological agents within the wide range of dose, what was shown in several studies including pregnancy, newborns and elderly and confirmed by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) in 2012 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p><p>The beneficial effects of omega-3 fatty acids are possibly secondary to their anti-inflammatory, antithrombotic, antiarrhythmic, hypolipidemic and vasodilatory properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. There is an evidence they could improve lipid prolife by lowering triglycerides, decrease insulin resistance and cytokine synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. These effects may be linked with the pathogenesis of NAFLD. Already a number of studies showed efficacy of omega-3 fatty acids in the metabolic syndrome-related conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Therefore omega-3 fatty acids may be potentially promising medication in the treatment of NAFLD.</p><p>To our best knowledge, our study is one of the very few double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trials testing efficacy of omega-3 in children with NAFLD. Previously Nobili et al. supplemented a group of 60 children with either DHA or placebo for 6 months. The therapy decreased liver steatosis on ultrasound, improved triglycerides and insulin resistance markers, however no change in ALT activity was observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Further pediatric trials supporting or refuting use of omega-3 fatty in NAFLD are needed.</p><p>The review of the literature of randomized trials suggests that wide-range doses (0,8-13,7g per day) of omega-3 fatty acids are safe and may be efficient in NAFLD, however the optimal dose and proportion in the treatment of NAFLD has not been agreed yet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Moreover the evidence is limited in children. We used omega-3 formula containing EPA and DHA, that should combine positive metabolic (mostly EPA) and anti-inflammatory effects (DHA). The composition of the studied supplement consisted of pre-defined DHA/EPA ratio (3:2). The chosen dose and content of omega-3 in our study was decided on the basis of review of the promising results from available open-label studies and it is a compromise that should provide safety and efficacy of therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. However, the study is testing only one dose of omega-3 instead of multiple doses to determine the dose&#x02013;response relationship. Use of sunflower oil as a placebo/comparator may be justified because omega-6 are commonly present in a regular diet and the given dose does not influence their nutritional balance.</p><p>Weight-dependent dosing may be controversial, but it has to be regarded that the participants are children aged from 6 years to 19 years. The body mass might vary largely in this cohort, therefore differentiation between pediatric and adult doses can be explained. We subjectively set the weight margin at 40 kg and 60 kg for dosage of omega-3 but there are also several studies in children supplementing omega-3 for various indications in weight-dependent manner (per range and per kg) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>].</p><p>6-month duration of treatment is frequently applied in clinical trials with dietetic supplements like fish oil and it is considered sufficient to achieve therapeutic results and maintain satisfactory compliance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>The strength of our study is a well designed randomization and data collection system, clearly defined dietary counseling and a wide-range of parameters tested. In most previous trials investigating pharmacological treatment for NAFLD, dietetic surveillance was poorly described.</p><p>Several methods for assessment of body composition were used in our study (e.g. anthropometry, bioelectric impedance, MRI and DEXA). Among them DEXA becomes the gold standard method giving accurate and noninvasive measure of bone, fat distribution, and muscle tissues during single procedure of total body scan. Data obtained from all these techniques will be studied to estimate the efficacy of treatment and compared between each other to select the most reliable method reflecting changes of body composition in our patients.</p><p>The limitation of our study is the definition of NAFLD which is based on ultrasound and ALT (both criteria fulfilled together). Still, this allows to enroll those who present with significant steatosis (as indicated by ultrasound) and possibly inflammation (as indicated by ALT). Liver biopsy is rarely used to select children with NAFLD and for assessment of therapy as there are limited indications for liver biopsy in children.</p><p>To minimize possible bias we designed randomized, double-blind trial. Study treatment and placebo have identical appearance of capsules and packaging in plastic pill boxes to ensure the double blind study design. Data of the patients are entered and organized in the electronic case report form (e-CRF). The treatment allocation to the patients is done using a centralized randomization. Randomization is fixed, balanced and stratified according to centre. Both e-CRF and randomization are carried by the external company. Ultrasound was performed each time by the same radiologist, histology of the liver was assessed by two independent pathologists. Advanced lab tests are sent and examined in the central laboratory.</p><p>As there is no efficient pharmacological treatment for NAFLD, the positive result of this randomized trial will place omega-3 fatty acids as a useful agent in the treatment of NAFLD in children which can be safely applied together with lifestyle modification. No or negative effect of supplementation will add valuable evidence against its use in NAFLD. Nevertheless, final findings are expected to strongly contribute to the knowledge base and public health guidelines regarding use of omega-3 fatty acids in NAFLD, metabolic syndrome and obesity-related diseases.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>All authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>WJ participated in the study design and coordination of the study, drafted and revised the manuscript.
