Although the results of studies published in the literature so far are contradictory, there is some evidence suggesting that the higher incidence of hypertension after menopause may not be solely due to the increasing age but may also be the result of a greater steepness of the age-related blood pressure increase around the menopausal period [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Moreover, menopause per se has been suggested to potentiate the age-related increase in systolic blood pressure (SBP) [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. An increased pulse pressure (PP) and a decreased diastolic blood pressure (DBP), in association with an elevated SBP, are superior risk markers of hypertensive cardiovascular disease in middle-aged and older subjects, as both large artery stiffness and peripheral vascular resistance are fully represented by these blood pressure indices [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Moreover, despite similar reductions in peripheral blood pressure, different cardiovascular outcomes between different classes could be due to their variable effects on PP [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Currently, it is often necessary to combine two or more antihypertensive agents in many patients with hypertension to reach blood pressure goals [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. A careful selection of combination therapies with low doses of antihypertensive drugs can facilitate good blood pressure control without adverse effects and may even offer the potential for improving quality of life measures during therapy [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>The main objective of this study was to determine whether a patient's best drug could be predicted by a range of baseline measurements and whether interindividual variability in response was itself quantifiable [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] in postmenopausal women with hypertension. Since it has been suggested that a combination of antihypertensive drugs with and without vasodilating actions might be appropriate for the treatment of hypertension, two combinations were selected: (1) losartan, an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), combined with trichlormethiazide, a diuretic, and (2) cilnidipine, a calcium channel blocker (CCB) with the ability to inhibit the activity of the sympathetic nervous system, combined with arotinolol, an &#x003b1;&#x003b2;-blocker.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1_2"><title>Subjects and Methods</title><p>Selected women were required to be naturally menopausal for at least 1 year but not more than 5 years past their menstrual period. Exclusion criteria were a history of preeclampsia or eclampsia, a severe illness such as myocardial infarction or stroke within 6 months, the use of estrogens or progestins within 3 months, proteinuric nephropathy, and surgically induced menopause. There were 114 women who participated in this study after having given their informed consent. These women were diagnosed as having hypertension based on an office blood pressure &#x0003e;140/90 mm Hg as well as on a self-measured blood pressure at home &#x0003e;130/85 mm Hg, or the patients were taking any kind of antihypertensive drugs. If both levels of blood pressure were not fulfilled, the patients were excluded. All antihypertensive medications were withdrawn 6 weeks before the initiation of the study. The patients were randomly assigned in equal numbers to the following groups: (1) losartan 50 mg daily + trichlormethiazide 2 mg twice a week, and (2) cilnidipine [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] 5 mg + arotinolol 10 mg daily. During the 2 weeks prior to the start of the antihypertensive medications, blood pressure measurements in the office and at home were repeated at least twice. Each treatment schedule was continued for 3 months. Blood pressure and heart rate were measured in triplicate with the same oscillometric monitor at each visit after sitting for 10 min. Blood samples for routine laboratory tests were obtained after seated for at least 15 min. The visits were scheduled in the afternoon, and the visit time was the same for each patient. Adverse events were recorded by means of a standard questionnaire.</p><p>The treatment response was evaluated in terms of absolute values of blood pressure at the completion of the study. If a patient's blood pressure was &#x0003c;140/90 mm Hg, the patient was considered a responder to the treatment. If the patient's blood pressure was &#x0003e;140/90 mm Hg, the patient was considered a nonresponder to the treatment.</p><sec id="sec2_1"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>The results are reported as mean &#x000b1; standard error of the mean.

In Group I, there was a significant difference between the two treatment regimens for SBP at 1, 2, and 3 months. For DBP, significance was only shown at 2 months.

Four patients treated with cilnidipine + arotinolol and 2 patients treated with losartan + trichlormethiazide had complaints of mild headache, which was probably due to the sudden reduction in their blood pressure. Transient suspension of antihypertensive treatment relieved these complaints and the patients were able to return to the study protocol.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec1_4"><title>Discussion</title><p>The present study has shown that the level of PP at the start of an antihypertensive therapy influences blood pressure reduction in postmenopausal women with hypertension. In women with a wider PP, the combination with a CCB and an &#x003b1;&#x003b2;-blocker produced a greater reduction in blood pressure and a higher responder rate than in women with a narrower PP. On the contrary, in women with a narrower PP, the combination of an ARB and a diuretic induced a greater reduction in blood pressure than in women with a wider PP. It is suggested that the menopause, by increasing the stiffness of the aorta, may contribute to the rise in SBP and PP that occurs in middle-aged women. However, in the present study, not all postmenopausal women with hypertension experienced an increase in SBP and PP. The percentage of a PP &#x0003e;65 mm Hg was 21%, that of a normal PP ranging from 65 to 45 mm Hg was 50%, and that of a PP &#x0003c;45 mm Hg was 28%. This is partly due to a mixture of subjects who were hypertensive before the cessation of their menstruation and of those who became hypertensive during the transition from a regular menstrual cycle to ovarian failure. Or, as explained by Staessen et al. [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] in a cross-sectional study, it is reflected by the fact that the menopause is accompanied by a steeper rise in SBP with age as well as by an increase in the absolute level of DBP. Another important factor is obesity in postmenopausal women. Shelley et al. [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] reported in a longitudinal study that DBP increases as the body mass index increases during menopausal transition. However, the present study showed that women who were already postmenopausal had the least gain in BMI. It is therefore unlikely that a gain in body weight influences blood pressure changes. The principles of the treatment of hypertension in menopausal women also apply to other women as well as to men [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>The choice of antihypertensive drugs in postmenopausal women should be made based on the results of clinical trials specifically aimed at hypertension in these patients and should be focused on their safety, tolerability, and efficacy. The Moexipril as Anti-hypertensive Drug After Menopause (MADAM) program is a series of trials to test whether or not the drug could be indicated specifically for hypertensive menopausal women. In patients with moderately severe essential hypertension, moexipril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, was as effective as hydrochlorothiazide, a diuretic, and the benefit was additive when the drugs were given together [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In 97 postmenopausal women with a DBP of 95-114 mm Hg while seated, both moexipril and hydrochlorothiazide were satisfactory in reducing blood pressure. In this MADAM study, the adverse effects reported for the 25-mg dose of hydrochlorothiazide were significant increases in serum uric acid, plasma glucose, and total cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein (HDL) ratio, and a significant decrease in HDL. Losartan, which was employed in the present study, increases the excretion of urate after dosing. It has been reported that serum uric acid was significantly reduced after 21 days of therapy in patients with thiazide-induced asymptomatic hyperuricemia [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In addition to these advantages, losartan is neutral in its effect on lipid and glucose metabolisms [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. On the grounds of these reports, we employed the combination therapy with losartan and trichlormethiazide for the treatment of hypertension in postmenopausal women. Contrary to the favorable reputation of ACE inhibitors and ARBs, the role of CCBs for the treatment of hypertension has been a matter of debate [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Dickerson et al. [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] proposed the A (ACE inhibitors) B (&#x003b2;-blockers)/C (CCBs) D (diuretics) rule on choosing a drug combination for the treatment of essential hypertension because of a marked variability in the responses of hypertensive patients to different antihypertensive drugs. According to this rule, if an &#x003b1;&#x003b2;-blocker was selected, a CCB or a diuretic would be preferred as an additive drug in the combination. In our previous reports [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], the combination therapy with a CCB and an &#x003b1;&#x003b2;-blocker was shown to be effective in both the reduction in blood pressure and the protection of target organ damage in patients with renal impairment. These data will be applicable for postmenopausal women with hypertension who have been considered to have a higher risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular events [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>In the present study, we compared the efficacy of blood pressure reduction and the safety of combination therapy using an ARB with a diuretic as well as a CCB with an &#x003b1;&#x003b2;-blocker in postmenopausal women with hypertension. The results of this study show that both combination therapies are effective in significantly reducing blood pressure in hypertensive postmenopausal women. However, there was a significant difference between the two combination treatments. SBP was mainly influenced by ventricular ejection, arterial stiffness, and the timing of wave reflection, while DBP was influenced by arterial stiffness and peripheral vascular resistance. Antihypertensive drugs can decrease PP by changing the amplitude and timing of reflected waves through various mechanisms. &#x003b2;-Adrenoreceptor antagonists can decrease arterial PP by changing the characteristics of left ventricular ejection. ACE inhibitors are known to improve large-artery compliance in hypertensive patients. In the present study, we administered a fixed dose of antihypertensive drugs instead of achieving a target blood pressure. Combination therapy for hypertensive patients would be recommended for several reasons. One major reason is that many factors are considered to contribute to blood pressure elevation in essential hypertension. In addition, combination therapy would cancel adverse effects that are produced by monotherapy treatment. In women who had systolic hypertension, the combination therapy with cilnidipine and arotinolol produced a greater reduction in PP than the combination therapy with losartan and trichlormethiazide. In the present study, we did not measure the patients' aortic peak flow, but the literature suggests that some &#x003b2;-blockers reduce the aortic peak flow, which in turn influences PP. Moreover, combination therapy would potentiate the antihypertensive action of the partner drug. In the present study, two kinds of combination treatment were employed. One was the combination of an ARB and a diuretic. Diuretics are known to potentiate the antihypertensive and antiproteinuric effects of ARBs. Moreover, losartan can cancel hyperuricemia induced by diuretics. The other combination used a CCB and an &#x003b1;&#x003b2;-blocker.</p><p>Two recent issues should be mentioned. First, the NICE guideline from a British study [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] excludes &#x003b2;-blockers from the first-line drugs. In the present study, our plan was based on the previous guideline. However, we believe an &#x003b1;&#x003b2;-blocker is effective for postmenopausal women in reducing higher heart rate, which is frequently seen in this population. Second, PP was used as an index in the present study. This is supported by a recent study by Regnault et al. [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] who showed that the attenuation of PP amplification in postmenopausal women contributes to a significant increase in cardiovascular disease risk. It remains to be seen whether these findings also apply to patient populations other than postmenopausal women. However, large long-term clinical trials of antihypertensive treatment have included both men and women and have not demonstrated clinically significant sex differences in blood pressure response and outcomes [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>In conclusion, it is suggested from this study that the measurement of PP before starting medication of hypertension may be useful for determining the choice of the antihypertensive drugs.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group
