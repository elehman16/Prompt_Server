Using this model, gabapentin, among other drugs, was shown to significantly reduce cutaneous hyperalgesia compared to placebo. Since the larger thermal probes used in the original studies to produce heat sensitization are now commercially unavailable, we decided to assess whether previous findings could be replicated with a currently available smaller probe (heated area 9 cm<sup>2</sup> versus 12.5&#x02013;15.7 cm<sup>2</sup>).</p></sec><sec><title>Study design and methods</title><p>After Institutional Review Board approval, 15 adult healthy volunteers participated in two study sessions, scheduled 1 week apart (Part A). In both sessions, subjects were exposed to the heat/capsaicin cutaneous sensitization model. Areas of hypersensitivity to brush stroke and von Frey (VF) filament stimulation were measured at baseline and after rekindling of skin sensitization. Another group of 15 volunteers was exposed to an identical schedule and set of sensitization procedures, but, in each session, received either gabapentin or placebo (Part B).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Unlike previous reports, a similar reduction of areas of hyperalgesia was observed in all groups/sessions. Fading of areas of hyperalgesia over time was observed in Part A. In Part B, there was no difference in area reduction after gabapentin compared to placebo.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>When using smaller thermal probes than originally proposed, modifications of other parameters of sensitization and/or rekindling process may be needed to allow the heat/capsaicin sensitization protocol to be used as initially intended. Standardization and validation of experimental pain models is critical to the advancement of translational pain research.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical"><title>Video abstract</title><p>

This prompted us to question the possibility to reliably reproduce the model with a smaller area of peripheral sensitization. We knew that some researchers had been able to reproduce heat/capsaicin sensitization with smaller Peltier probes by utilizing modified procedures. The original papers by Petersen and Dirks<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-jpr-6-771">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-jpr-6-771">10</xref> were quoted as a source of the model in multiple studies by different groups in which, however, the protocol was significantly modified from the original, with different exposure time to capsaicin and/or different procedures of application or maintenance of the stimulus.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27-jpr-6-771">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30-jpr-6-771">30</xref></p><p>Prior studies of analgesic responsiveness should be replicated before adopting the 9 cm<sup>2</sup> thermal probe as the standard for inducing heat/capsaicin cutaneous sensitization with this model, and, if a different heat/capsaicin model needs to be proposed as a standard, this would need to be validated on the basis of rigorous observations. The sequential application of heat and capsaicin will not always or necessarily produce reliable and stable sensitization. It is not known what are the essential elements of a model that associates heat and capsaicin to consistently create long lasting cutaneous sensitization; these factors may vary interindividually and also depend on the stimulation site and the outcomes observed. Using the 9 cm<sup>2</sup> Peltier thermode to induce cutaneous sensitization, the present study investigated the reproducibility of the heat/capsaicin model as originally proposed<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-jpr-6-771">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-jpr-6-771">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-jpr-6-771">16</xref> by assessing: a) the size and duration of secondary hyperalgesia; and b) the antihyperalgesic response to a single oral dose of 1,200 mg gabapentin (the same single dose of gabapentin that had significantly decreased areas of hyperalgesia produced with the original heat/capsaicin model compared to placebo).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-jpr-6-771">16</xref></p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec sec-type="methods|subjects"><title>Study subjects and design</title><p>The study was conducted in accordance with ethical principles of Good Clinical Practice and the Declaration of Helsinki and its guidelines, and approved by Washington University in St Louis Institutional Review Board.</p><p>Subjects provided written informed consent after the study procedures were explained and their questions were answered, and before study procedures were initiated.

During the first study session, heat/capsaicin sensitization was induced and maintained by rekindling the stimulation site with heat four times at regular intervals over the 4 hour study day. Areas of secondary allodynia, and hyperalgesia to foam brush and VF filament (primary outcomes); heat pain detection threshold (HPDT) in the stimulation site (secondary outcomes); and the painfulness of thermal stimulation (PTS) on nonsensitized skin (secondary outcomes) were determined multiple times during the study day. In all the study sessions, measurements were performed before the induction of sensitization (M0 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-jpr-6-771">Figure 1B</xref>), after the first rekindling (RK1) (M1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-jpr-6-771">Figure 1B</xref>) and after the fourth rekindling (RK4) (M2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-jpr-6-771">Figure 1B</xref>). The study consisted of two parts:</p><p>Part A evaluated the natural history of sensory changes following heat/capsaicin sensitization. Subjects in this group underwent the procedures and measurements described above during two study sessions separated by at least 1 week to allow the skin to recover between sessions. In this group only, additional area, HPDT, and PTS measurements were repeated after RK2 and after RK3 to better follow the sensory changes. Subjects in Part A will be referred to as the &#x0201c;control group&#x0201d;.</p><p>Part B was a double-blind, randomized, crossover study in healthy volunteers to evaluate the response to gabapentin using the heat/capsaicin model. On the first study session, subjects were randomly assigned to receive a single oral dose of gabapentin (1,200 mg) or placebo immediately after induction of the heat/capsaicin sensitization as previously described by Dirks et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-jpr-6-771">16</xref></p><p>Outcome measures were collected as described above (baseline, pre-drug and post-drug; for detail see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-jpr-6-771">Figure 1B</xref>). During the second study session, subjects underwent the same procedures but received the treatment that they had not received during their first session. Sessions were 1 week apart to allow washout of the treatment administered in the first session. Areas obtained after gabapentin/placebo administration (M2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-jpr-6-771">Figure 1B</xref>) were compared to postsensitization baseline areas (M1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-jpr-6-771">Figure 1B</xref>) and the results obtained with gabapentin and placebo were compared. Subjects in Part B will be referred to as the &#x0201c;gabapentin/placebo group&#x0201d;.</p><p>Sample size estimate was based on the previously published between-days coefficients of variation of the areas of hyperalgesia obtained with this model.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-jpr-6-771">1</xref> In the methodological study aimed at validating the heat/capsaicin model,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-jpr-6-771">1</xref> the authors calculated sample sizes needed to detect treatment differences with this model, based on the coefficients of variation of areas of hyperalgesia within-day and between-day. Assuming for our study the same coefficients of variation, and planning a between-days comparison and a cross-over design, we recalculated the sample size to obtain a probability of 80% that the study could detect a treatment difference at a two-sided 0.05 significance level, if the true difference in area reduction between treatments (gabapentin and placebo) was at least 30% (in the original study, comparing gabapentin and placebo with this model, the observed difference in area reduction was about 70%). Our sample size calculation indicated that 15 subjects were necessary in the treatment group. An equal number of subjects were enrolled in the control group for comparison.</p><p>Forty-nine subjects provided written consent and were enrolled in the study. Seventeen subjects did not meet inclusion criteria during the screening session and two more were excluded during the study as they met exclusion criteria after enrollment. The remaining 30 subjects completed Part A (n=15) or Part B (n=15) of the study. The 15 subjects who took part in Part B of the study were assigned to receive placebo or gabapentin on their first study session by a computer generated randomization table. Subjects and investigators directly involved in data collection and analysis were blinded to the treatment allocation. The randomization sequence was provided by the investigational pharmacy, and a research nurse not directly participating in the study managed the schedule and assigned subjects to interventions. Of the 15 subjects who completed Part B, one subject was excluded from the analysis because the blood sample collected on the placebo day contained gabapentin, indicating a possible confusion in the blood sample analysis or erroneous administration of gabapentin on the placebo day.

An area of the skin on the volar surface of the dominant forearm of each subject was chosen, and the distance of the center of this area from the elbow crease and from the wrist crease was recorded to keep the site of the area consistent between sessions. Heat was applied to this previously delimited area using the thermode, which ramped from 32&#x000b0;C to 45&#x000b0;C at a rate of 1&#x000b0;C per second and then held at 45&#x000b0;C for 5 minutes. During these 5 minutes, subjects used an electronic handheld device to rate their pain every minute by moving a bar on a 0&#x02013;10 visual analog scale (VAS), where 0 indicates &#x0201c;no pain&#x0201d; and 10 indicates &#x0201c;the most intense pain imaginable.&#x0201d; The handheld device was connected to a computer that recorded the ratings on a 0&#x02013;100 scale. The heating procedure was followed by immediate application of capsaicin cream (Capzasin-HP cream [previously 0.075%, now marketed as 0.1%], Chattem Inc., Chattenooga, TN, USA) covering the heated surface (outline of thermode). The cream was left on for 30 minutes and then gently wiped off in one single motion, taking care in avoiding rubbing the cream into the skin. Approximately 0.5 oz of cream was required to cover the entire surface completely. Subjects were asked to rate their pain on the handheld VAS at the start of the 30 minute period and then for every 5 minutes until the cream was removed.</p></sec><sec><title>Rekindling</title><p>On study days, hypersensitivity was maintained by &#x0201c;rekindling&#x0201d; the site of heat/capsaicin application. This was accomplished by restimulating the previously treated skin four times at 45-minute intervals with the thermode increasing from 32&#x000b0;C to 40&#x000b0;C at a rate of 1&#x000b0; per second and held at 40&#x000b0;C for 5 minutes. Subjects rated their pain on a continuous VAS during rekindling.</p></sec><sec><title>Mapping of areas of hypersensitivity</title><p>The borders of secondary allodynia and hyperalgesia were mapped using a 1 inch foam brush and a 26 g VF filament (26 g bending force [North Coast Medical, Gilroy, CA, USA]). Subjects were asked to close their eyes while the brush was applied along four linear paths between the thermode outline and: 1) the antecubital fossa; 2) the wrist; 3) the lateral forearm; and 4) the medial forearm. Stimulation was started distant from the borders of the heated area and worked closer in 5 mm steps at 1-second intervals. Subjects were instructed to recognize a &#x0201c;distinct change in sensation&#x0201d; such as &#x0201c;increased burning, tenderness, more intense pricking, or an unpleasant sensation,&#x0201d; and that location was marked. This procedure was then repeated with the VF filament. Areas of hypersensitivity were calculated (in cm<sup>2</sup>) as the distance between the farthest points marked on the rostral/caudal axis multiplied by the distance between the farthest points marked on the medial/lateral axis. The presence of cutaneous hypersensitivity was assessed before the induction of sensitization (M0 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-jpr-6-771">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-jpr-6-771">B</xref>), after RK1 (M1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-jpr-6-771">Figure 1B</xref>), and after RK4 (M2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-jpr-6-771">Figure 1B</xref>). Two additional measurements (after RK2 and after RK3) were taken in Part A of the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Heat pain detection threshold</title><p>The threshold for heat pain detection was determined by using a thermal ramp protocol on the marked location on the volar surface of the forearm. The temperature applied through the thermode was increased from 32&#x000b0;C to the 50&#x000b0;C safety cutoff at 1&#x000b0;C per second. Subjects were asked to turn off the heated thermode by depressing a button at &#x0201c;the lowest temperature that they perceived as painful.&#x0201d; Four thermal ramps were performed 10 seconds apart and their median value was calculated. To avoid testing individuals whose pain threshold approached the safety cutoff, subjects with HPDTs greater than 47&#x000b0;C were excluded from the study. HPDT was assessed before the induction of sensitization (M0 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-jpr-6-771">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-jpr-6-771">B</xref>), after RK1 (M1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-jpr-6-771">Figure 1B</xref>), and after RK4 (M2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-jpr-6-771">Figure 1B</xref>).

Subjects were asked to rate their pain intensity during the 1-minute heat stimulus continuously using the electronic VAS, as described above. PTS was assessed before the induction of sensitization (M0 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-jpr-6-771">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-jpr-6-771">B</xref>), after RK1 (M1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-jpr-6-771">Figure 1B</xref>), and after RK4 (M2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-jpr-6-771">Figure 1B</xref>). In Part A of the study, PTS was also assessed after RK2 and after RK3.</p></sec><sec><title>Measurement of plasma concentration of gabapentin</title><p>All subjects in the drug/placebo group had a blood sample (5 mL) collected from the nondominant arm to assess gabapentin plasma concentration at 150 minutes after drug/placebo administration (for preservation of blinding in the protocol, the sample was collected in both sessions). Plasma was frozen for later analysis.</p><p>Gabapentin was quantitated using LC/MS/MS (liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry). Plasma samples were thawed, vortexed, and aliquots of 475 &#x003bc;L of sample, standard or quality control sample, were transferred into a deep well 96-well plate. To each well were added 0.25 mL of 1 M sodium phosphate buffer and 25 &#x003bc;L of a 0.5 &#x003bc;g/mL Gabapentin D10 internal standard solution prepared in water (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA). Samples, standards, and quality controls were then applied to a Bond Elut C18 solid phase extraction plate (Agilent Technologies, B&#x000f6;blingen, Germany), which had been prepared by washing first with 1.0 mL of methanol and then with 1.0 mL of 1 M sodium phosphate buffer. After applying the samples to the extraction plate it was washed with 1.0 mL of 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer and then with 1.0 mL of 0.1 M hydrochloric acid. Samples were eluted with 1.0 mL of methanol and the plate dried down at 30&#x000b0;C under a gentle flow of nitrogen. Samples were reconstituted with 500 &#x003bc;L of mobile phase: 95% 4.5 mM ammonium acetate in water/5% 4.5 mM ammonium acetate in acetonitrile. The deep well plate was shaken for 10 minutes and 200 &#x003bc;L was transferred to a 96-well autosampler plate. Calibrators (8 concentrations over the range 0.5 to 50 ng/mL) and three quality control samples (3, 15, and 30 ng/mL) in human plasma were prepared along with experimental samples.</p><p>Instrumental analysis was performed on an API 4000 QTRAP triple-quadropole mass spectrometer (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) equipped with a Turbo IonSpray Source. A Shimadzu UFLC system (Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan) that consisted of a CMB-20A system controller, two LC-20ADXR pumps, a DGU-20A3 degasser, a SIL-20AC autosampler, and a CTO-20A column oven was used to deliver the samples to the detector. An external two-way Valco valve (Valco Instruments Co. Inc., Houston, TX, USA) was utilized to direct high-performance liquid chromatography flow to waste before and after column elution of analytes of interest. Chromatographic separation was performed on a Kinetix 2.6 &#x003bc;m C18 analytical (2.1 by 100 mm) column (Phenomenex Inc., Torrance, CA, USA) with a Security Guard ULTRA C18 guard cartridge for 2.1 mm ID columns installed prior to the analytical column (Phenomenex). Before each injection, the needle was washed with 10% isopropanol. Mobile phase A was 4.5 mM ammonium acetate in water and mobile phase B was 4.5 mM ammonium acetate in acetonitrile. Mobile phase was delivered at initial conditions of 5% B at a flow rate of 0.3 mL/minute with the following time program: hold at 5% B for 0.6 minutes followed by a linear gradient over 0.65 minutes between 5% and 95% B; hold at 95% B for 1.25 minutes; mobile phase composition is then brought back down to initial condition of 5% over 0.01 minutes. The column was re-equilibrated with 5% B from 2.51 to 4.0 minutes. The retention time for gabapentin was 2.2 minutes under these conditions. Both Q1 and Q3 quadrupoles of the mass spectrometer were optimized to unit mass resolution. The instrument was operated in positive-ion mode with an ion spray voltage of 5,500 volts and a temperature of 450&#x000b0;C. The curtain gas was set at 20 pound per square inch (psi), ion source gas 1 at 30 psi, gas 2 at 40 psi, and the collision gas was set to medium. Gabapentin and the internal standard were detected by multiple reaction monitoring, using the transitions m/z 172&#x02192;137 and 182&#x02192;104, respectively. Quantitation was performed in Analyst software version 1.5.2 (Life Technologies).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Our primary outcome measure was the size of the areas of hyperalgesia to punctate stimuli (VF filament stimulation) and dynamic tactile allodynia (brush stimulation) outside the area directly exposed to heat and capsaicin, ie, the areas of secondary hyperalgesia.

The heat/capsaicin model, as originally proposed, has become widely popular, and extensively reported and utilized in pain research. However, size, duration, and intensity of noxious stimulation have been shown to be critical for the induction and maintenance of areas of secondary hyperalgesia in multiple conditions. In our experimental setting, all other controllable variables were consistent with the original protocol that we were seeking to replicate, except for the use of a smaller size thermode, and, in these conditions, we could not confirm previous findings of a significant difference between gaba pentin and placebo in reducing areas of heat/capsaicin induced cutaneous sensitization. We hypothesized that the reduction in area of sensitization observed after placebo might depend on a spontaneous fading of the area as opposed to a &#x0201c;placebo effect&#x0201d;, which had not been previously observed.</p><p>To our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating the inability to reproduce the original heat/capsaicin cutaneous sensitization model by applying the critical &#x0201c;ongoing nociceptive input&#x0201d; on a smaller surface area than originally reported. Additionally, we hope that our negative result will bring focus on the significant issue of standardizing and validating experimental pain models. The advancement of translational pain research strictly depends on the availability of experimental pain models and methods that can be easily and consistently reproduced, so that they can be uniformly applied and provide results that are significant, predictive of clinical efficacy, and comparable among different studies.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Funding for this study was provided by a Pilot Award from the Barnes Jewish Hospital Foundation/ICTS Clinical and Translational Funding Program (supported by NIH CTSA Grant # UL1 RR024992), and by grant NIH R01NS048602 as well as R01NS048602-11S1 from the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke to Robert W Gereau IV.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclosure</bold></p><p>The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="b1-jpr-6-771"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Dirks</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Petersen</surname><given-names>KL</given-names></name><name><surname>Dahl</surname><given-names>JB</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The heat/capsaicin sensitization model: a methodologic study</article-title><source>J Pain</source><year>2003</year><volume>4</volume><issue>3</issue><fpage>122</fpage><lpage>128</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">14622709</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="b2-jpr-6-771"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Frymoyer</surname><given-names>AR</given-names></name><name><surname>Rowbotham</surname><given-names>MC</given-names></name><name><surname>Petersen</surname><given-names>KL</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Placebo-controlled comparison of a morphine/dextromethorphan combination with morphine on experimental pain and hyperalgesia in healthy volunteers</article-title><source>J Pain</source><year>2007</year><volume>8</volume><issue>1</issue><fpage>19</fpage><lpage>25</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">17113353</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="b3-jpr-6-771"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Staud</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Evidence for shared pain mechanisms in osteoarthritis, low back pain, and fibromyalgia</article-title><source>Curr Rheumatol Rep</source><year>2011</year><volume>13</volume><issue>6</issue><fpage>513</fpage><lpage>520</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">21833699</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="b4-jpr-6-771"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Steyaert</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>De Kock</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Chronic postsurgical pain</article-title><source>Curr Opin Anaesthesiol</source><year>2012</year><volume>25</volume><issue>5</issue><fpage>584</fpage><lpage>588</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">22895123</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="b5-jpr-6-771"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Staud</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Is it all central sensitization?
