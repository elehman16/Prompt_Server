Incomplete control of troublesome regurgitation and extraesophageal manifestations of chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a known limitation of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy. This multicenter randomized study compared the efficacy of transoral incisionless fundoplication (TIF) against PPIs in controlling these symptoms in patients with small hiatal hernias. <italic>Methods</italic>. Between June and August 2012, 63 patients were randomized at 7 US community hospitals. Patients in the PPI group were placed on maximum standard dose (MSD). Patients in the TIF group underwent esophagogastric fundoplication using the EsophyX<sub>2</sub> device. Primary outcome was elimination of daily troublesome regurgitation or extraesophageal symptoms. Secondary outcomes were normalization of esophageal acid exposure (EAE), PPI usage and healing of esophagitis. <italic>Results</italic>. Of 63 randomized patients (40 TIF and 23 PPI), 3 were lost to follow-up leaving 39 TIF and 21 PPI patients for analysis. At 6-month follow-up, troublesome regurgitation was eliminated in 97% of TIF patients versus 50% of PPI patients, relative risk (RR) = 1.9, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.2-3.11 (<italic>P</italic> = .006). Globally, 62% of TIF patients experienced elimination of regurgitation and extraesophageal symptoms versus 5% of PPI patients, RR = 12.9, 95% CI = 1.9-88.9 (<italic>P</italic> = .009). EAE was normalized in 54% of TIF patients (off PPIs) versus 52% of PPI patients (on MSD), RR = 1.0, 95% CI = 0.6-1.7 (<italic>P</italic> = .914). Ninety percent of TIF patients were off PPIs. <italic>Conclusion</italic>. At 6-month follow-up, TIF was more effective than MSD PPI therapy in eliminating troublesome regurgitation and extraesophageal symptoms of GERD.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>transoral incisionless fundoplication (TIF)</kwd><kwd>EsophyX</kwd><kwd>extraesophageal GERD symptoms</kwd><kwd>regurgitation</kwd><kwd>proton pump inhibitor (PPI)</kwd><kwd>heartburn</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="section1-1553350614526788"><title>Introduction</title><p>Adequate control of troublesome regurgitation and extraesophageal manifestation such as laryngitis, asthma, chronic cough, and dental erosions<sup><xref rid="bibr1-1553350614526788" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> in chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) patients remains a therapeutic concern.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-1553350614526788" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bibr3-1553350614526788" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Medical therapy with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) causes a modest and considerably less symptomatic relief of regurgitation<sup><xref rid="bibr4-1553350614526788" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> and extraesophageal symptoms<sup><xref rid="bibr5-1553350614526788" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="bibr6-1553350614526788" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr7-1553350614526788" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr8-1553350614526788" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr9-1553350614526788" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr10-1553350614526788" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> compared with heartburn.

The helical retractor was engaged into the tissue slightly distal to Z line. Then, in combination with the tissue manipulating elements, the fundus of the stomach was folded up and around the distal esophagus. After tissue handling elements were appropriately positioned and locked into place, the invaginator was activated to allow the separation of the gastroesophageal junction from the diaphragm. The polypropylene &#x0201c;H&#x0201d; fasteners were delivered through the tissue.

In contrast, as confirmed with present study, current published literature on TIF suggests that incidence of persistent postfundoplication side effects is low after TIF.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-1553350614526788" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup></p><p>The study was conducted by general surgeons (4 centers) and gastroenterologists (3 centers) acting as investigators and device operators.

We believe that patients with extraesophageal symptoms achieved positive results because of the fact that they had objective evidence of GERD, and had relatively small anatomic defects. TIF could be considered a viable alternative for the patient population with a significant extraesophageal component provided that the same inclusion criteria are used in clinical practice.</p><p>Beyond the clinical relevance of the major findings of this study related to TIF, we found that MSD of PPIs were not better than TIF in eliminating heartburn, healing of reflux esophagitis, and normalizing distal EAE. We speculate that the unexpectedly low rate of healing of esophagitis in the PPI group (38%) may indicate that a higher proportion of patients in this study suffered from non-acid reflux or weakly acid reflux. The published data on the normalization of EAE after PPI treatment are limited.<sup><xref rid="bibr14-1553350614526788" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Milkes et al<sup><xref rid="bibr28-1553350614526788" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> reported that 50% of patients had persistent abnormal EAE despite taking PPIs twice daily. Our study reproduces these results in the PPI group. Although we performed a medication count and it appears that patients complied with their prescribed medical regimens, we recognize that full control of patients&#x02019; compliance is difficult to achieve. Therefore, we cannot discount the possibility that some patients did not comply with prescribed medications influencing the rate of EAE normalization in the control group.</p><p>In the TIF group, significant symptoms control (up to 97%) was not followed by the similar rate of pH normalization (54%). Improvement in patient quality of life and healing of esophagitis are often cited as the goals of treatments for GERD, and accordingly are often the endpoints of many studies related to GERD therapies.<sup><xref rid="bibr15-1553350614526788" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> The level of esophageal acid exposure in patients who were asymptomatic on PPI therapy is poorly addressed in the literature.

In this study, none of the patients in the TIF group reported de novo bloating, dysphagia, or flatulence at 6-month follow-up. Although, the comparison of postfundoplication symptoms after the TIF procedure and after LNF is based on different time intervals, we believe that the very limited incidence of side effects combined with a solid safety record (no reported mortality in more than 13 000 cases performed worldwide) represents one of the most attractive aspects of TIF procedure.</p><p>The only patient with short segment Barrett&#x02019;s in this trial was randomized to the TIF group and was completely off PPIs with a normalized distal esophageal exposure at 6-month follow-up. The role of TIF in the management of Barrett&#x02019;s metaplasia remains to be defined and will no doubt require additional studies. This patient will be kept under strict endoscopic surveillance.</p><p>Our findings must be interpreted while considering the limitations of this study, most notably the short-term follow-up and the potential placebo effect in the TIF group. We felt that reporting these encouraging short-term results is reasonable given that the recommended treatment for patients with predominant extraesophageal symptomatology is aggressive acid reduction using PPIs twice daily short-term over a duration of 3 to 4 months.<sup><xref rid="bibr35-1553350614526788" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> To address the potential placebo effect, another randomized trial which includes a sham arm is currently underway with early results expected in the near future. One may argue that the small sample size (39 in the TIF group vs 21 in the PPI group) and unequal randomization allocation could affect our findings. In this context, it is worth pointing that the use of unequal randomization ratios will only significantly reduce the power of the study if a ratio of 3:1 or more is used.<sup><xref rid="bibr36-1553350614526788" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> Furthermore, the study has been appropriately powered (80%) to detect significant differences between the 2 treatment arms. A further potential limitation of this study was that the study population was heterogeneous with regards to predominant symptomatology; we feel that this is reflective of the fact that specialized GERD practices are increasingly evaluating and treating patients with mixed symptomatology. And finally, we used randomization and objective pH testing to minimize potential bias from an open-label study design. To further minimize this bias, all PPI patients were offered crossover to TIF after completion of 6-month follow-up. We will report these outcomes as results become available.</p><p>With regard to predictors of success or failures following TIF, a critical analysis of the 4 patients who continued acid suppressive medication after TIF revealed important findings. As previously suggested,<sup><xref rid="bibr15-1553350614526788" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> our study also demonstrates that patients with more severe disease appear to have a higher likelihood of requiring PPIs after TIF. All 4 patients suffered from severe heartburn (GERD-HRQL scores &#x0003e;30 on PPIs). Although 10% of patients were back on PPI therapy, the significant improvement in the QOL scores postprocedure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1553350614526788">Figure 3</xref>) suggests that TIF may be a useful therapeutic adjunct to PPIs in patients with incomplete symptom control. We attempted to define factors predictive of post-treatment normalization of esophageal acid exposure. The fact that all patients in the study underwent pH testing at screening and at 6-month follow-up presented a unique opportunity to define these factors. We observed that preprocedure % total time pH &#x0003c; 4 inferior to 10 was associated with a high rate of pH normalization after TIF (74% [17/23] normalized vs 25% [4/12] normalized if % time pH &#x0003c; 4 was &#x02265;10; [<italic>P</italic> = .004]). Interestingly, the same observation could not be made in the PPI group (66% normalized [8/12] if % time pH &#x0003c; 4 was inferior to 10 before vs 33% [3/9] if % time was &#x02265;10 after taking maximal PPI dose for 6 months [<italic>P</italic> = .198]). Beyond the previously defined factors associated with successful outcomes such as hiatal hernia &#x02264;2 cm and GERD-HRQL &#x0003c;30, this study suggests that preprocedure total % time pH &#x0003c; 4 inferior to 10 could be an important factor in selecting the most appropriate patients and setting appropriate expectations for the TIF procedure in individual cases. We plan to report a comprehensive evaluation of factors associated with successful outcomes after TIF at a longer term follow-up. Also, in this study, we reported our results in terms of complete elimination of troublesome symptoms and pH normalization over 48 hours rather than &#x02265;50% reduction in total scores and % total time pH &#x0003c; 4 based on 24 hours. We believe that these stricter and more comprehensive evaluation criteria may provide a useful reference in assessing patients for less invasive GERD therapies.</p><p>Based on the results of this study, it would appear that the TIF procedure is ideally suited as a treatment alternative for GERD patients who fall in the so-called &#x0201c;therapy gap,&#x0201d; a term often used to describe the 30% to 40% of patients who take daily PPIs and who remain unsatisfied because of incomplete symptom control.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-1553350614526788" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> These patients are often unwilling to undergo a laparoscopic fundoplication for fear of its side effects.
