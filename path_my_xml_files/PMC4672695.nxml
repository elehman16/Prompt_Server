We explored whether men make spontaneous changes to their physical activity and alcohol intake, body mass index (BMI) and smoking status, following a diagnosis of localised prostate cancer. A detailed diet, health and lifestyle questionnaire was completed by 511 participants within the Prostate Testing for Cancer and Treatment (ProtecT) randomised controlled trial, both before and 9 months after a diagnosis of prostate cancer. Of 177 men who were insufficiently active before their diagnosis (median 0 activity units/week; IQR 0&#x02013;9), 40.7% had increased their activity by a median of 22 U&#x000a0;week<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (IQR 15&#x02013;35) 9 months later, and there was weak evidence that men were more active after diagnosis than before (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.07). Men categorised as &#x0201c;working&#x0201d; occupational social class and who were insufficiently active before diagnosis were 2.03 (95%, CI&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.03&#x02013;3.99, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.04) times more likely to have increased their physical activity levels compared to men classified as &#x0201c;managerial or professional.&#x0201d; Similarly, men who were insufficiently active pre-diagnosis and with T-stage 2 compared with T-stage 1 prostate cancer were 2.47 (95%, CI&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.29&#x02013;4.71, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.006) times more likely to be sufficiently active post-diagnosis. Following diagnosis, there was an overall reduction in alcohol intake (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.03) and the proportion of current smokers (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.09), but no overall change in BMI. We conclude that some men spontaneously change certain lifestyle behaviours on receiving a diagnosis of prostate cancer. For many men, however, additional support through lifestyle interventions is probably required to facilitate and maintain these changes.</p><p>What&#x02019;s new?</p><p>Does cancer diagnosis lead individuals to consider making healthy lifestyle changes? These authors studied men diagnosed with prostate cancer to find out whether they changed their activity level, alcohol consumption, body mass index, or smoking habits after being diagnosed with prostate cancer. They found that some men increased their activity level and/or decreased their alcohol consumption, but not all. As making positive lifestyle changes may improve prognosis, it&#x02019;s worth looking for ways to encourage newly diagnosed patients to make healthy changes.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>prostate cancer</kwd><kwd>behaviour change</kwd><kwd>randomised control trial</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Prostate cancer is the most common male cancer in England: one in eight UK men will be diagnosed in their lifetime and the disease accounted for a quarter of all new cancer diagnoses in 2010.<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></p><p>Despite inconclusive evidence linking the development of prostate cancer to modifiable behaviours, associations with diet and lifestyle have been reported.<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Furthermore, sedentary behaviour,<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> a high alcohol intake,<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> obesity<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> and continuing to smoke,<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> following cancer diagnosis are associated with a worsening of prognosis.

Working class men may have had higher levels of &#x02018;unhealthy&#x02019; physical activity behaviour initially,<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> increasing opportunities for transition to &#x02018;healthy&#x02019; behaviour. Alternatively, if working class social norms dictate higher levels of &#x02018;unhealthy&#x02019; behaviour,<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> a diagnosis could allow for justification of a move towards &#x02018;healthy&#x02019; behaviour. Those with T stage-2 who were insufficiently active pre-diagnosis were twice as likely to be sufficiently active post-diagnosis, compared with T stage-1. A positive change was seen in alcohol intake and smoking behaviours post-diagnosis. No large changes were observed for BMI. It should be considered that a control group was not available for direct comparison; however older populations are reported to be significantly underactive, with BMI, overweight and obesity being higher than younger age groups.<xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> There is no convincing evidence from the literature that older men routinely and spontaneously make lifestyle changes. Research indicates that many are sedentary and do not intend to increase physical activity.<xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></p><p>Pre-diagnosis, the majority of men drank less alcohol than the recommended maximum guidelines and only a small proportion were smoking. Although over half were sufficiently active for health benefits pre-diagnosis, those who were insufficiently active were sedentary, with a weekly physical activity median of zero units. Over two-thirds had a BMI score above the recommendations at diagnosis. This highlights the need for interventions to improve lifestyle factors in this population, in particular diet and physical activity interventions that could increase physical activity levels, and reduce subsequent BMI.</p><p>One of our proposed explanations for the association between physical activity and social class was that working class men had higher levels of &#x0201c;unhealthy&#x0201d; behaviour initially. This is supported by exploratory analysis of physical activity stratified by social class; before diagnosis a higher proportion of working class men were insufficiently active for health benefits compared with intermediate and managerial classes respectively (40.2%, 38.5% and 28.6%). After diagnosis this had reduced to 37.1%, 30.8% and 26.0%.</p><p>Our data support findings that, on average, some people with cancer stop smoking<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> and reduce their alcohol consumption.<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> The overall increase in physical activity is in-line with other studies (in prostate and breast cancer),<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> although another study showed an increase in sedentary behaviour post-diagnosis.<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> A prostate cancer diagnosis may create a teachable moment for some; however, the spontaneous behaviour changes that we observed were not as substantial as documented elsewhere.<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p><p>Prostate cancer may prompt a different behaviour change response compared to other cancers. It may be perceived to have a less severe impact on general health,<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> resulting in fewer spontaneous changes. Gender differences may affect the response to a teachable moment; women have previously demonstrated a larger response.<xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Older patients may be less likely to adopt new behaviours; additionally, females may be more likely to make changes.<xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></p><p>To facilitate spontaneous change, it is important to make lifestyle interventions available to newly diagnosed patients; this is particularly relevant as not all men reported making behaviour changes, which have been shown to improve prognosis.<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> These can be employed at any time, although the largest positive changes may be achieved in the early stages of living with a cancer diagnosis, where individuals may be more open to change.<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> At this time, patients are increasingly likely to have frequent interactions with healthcare providers, who can help to implement change and enhance teachable moments.<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> They may be more inclined to participate in interventions that coincide with the diagnosis, or other teachable moments. However this will not occur in isolation; other factors such as their socio-demographic characteristics, available social support or prior behaviour change attempts must be considered.<xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></p><p>A key strength of our study is that it is based on a large, well defined sample with longitudinal follow-up of health behaviours.<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> However, there are limitations. In the absence of a control group we cannot definitively conclude that the changes resulted from cancer diagnosis. The population was a research-based screen-detected sample, which may not be representative of a routinely detected clinical population. A healthy screen effect may occur, where those who attend screening are healthier, have lower smoking rates or are motivated to improve health. A clinically detected population of men may be less likely to make spontaneous changes. The sub-groups in the study were relatively small, especially current smokers, reducing power. Self-reported measures may be subject to recall and response biases to promote social desirability. The strength of the study is that pre-diagnosis measures were reported prior to knowledge of the PSA screening test result.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We observed that some men spontaneously changed certain lifestyle behaviours (physical activity levels, alcohol consumption and smoking) in a positive (healthy) direction following a diagnosis of localised, screen-detected prostate cancer. Such changes may occur as a result of the prostate cancer diagnosis acting as a teachable moment. Cancer survivors may need better support and accessible interventions to promote positive and sustained behaviour change. There is currently insufficient evidence of exactly what these interventions should be and whether they are feasible or effective in this population.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The views expressed are those of the authors and not necessarily those of the NHS, the NIHR or the Department of Health.
