The age-standardised prevalence of diabetes worldwide was over 9% (9.8% for men, 9.2% for women) in 2008. This translates to around 347&#x02005;million people with diabetes globally, more than double the number from 1980 (153&#x02005;million).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref> Estimates show that, in India, the number of adults with diabetes will increase from 50&#x02005;million in 2010 to at least 87&#x02005;million by 2030.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref> In the UK, in 2010, there were an estimated 3.4&#x02005;million people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (henceforth diabetes), resulting in direct costs to the National Health Service (NHS) of &#x000a3;8.8 billion.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref> The adult age-standardised prevalence of diabetes in UK South Asians (defined here as UK residents with ancestral origins in the Indian Subcontinent) is about 2&#x02013;6 times that of the general population with probably higher progression rates from impaired glycaemia to diabetes, although robust data are lacking.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5 R6 R7">5&#x02013;7</xref></p><p>There is clear evidence from a number of diabetes prevention trials in adults at elevated risk for diabetes that lifestyle intervention focusing on modest weight loss (5&#x02013;10% of body weight) and increased physical activity is effective at preventing or delaying diabetes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8 R9 R10">8&#x02013;10</xref> Such interventions have been found to be effective in a number of ethnic groups including &#x02018;Asians&#x02019; living in the USA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref> and Indians living in India.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref> The evidence from randomised trials has been summarised and published by the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention Primary Prevention Working Group (2004).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref> They conclude that maintenance of moderate weight loss through diet and physical activity reduces the incidence of diabetes by 40&#x02013;60% over 3&#x02013;4&#x02005;years. A review of evidence and application in a UK setting by Davies <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref> showed that major benefits accrue from 5% to 10% body weight loss and 150&#x02005;min/week of physical activity, similar in intensity to brisk walking. They suggest a need to develop and evaluate interventions that target communities and populations at risk in the UK.</p><p>In the UK, the first standard of the National Service Framework for Diabetes (NSFD) is to reduce the number of people who develop diabetes and to reduce inequalities in this disease. The NSFD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref> and the Scottish Government Diabetes Action Plan 2010<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref> place emphasis on the need to prevent and control diabetes in the UK's minority ethnic populations (highlighting the high rates in South Asians) through implementation of effective and culturally relevant interventions. The main risk factors for diabetes, principally weight gain and physical inactivity, need to be tackled in these populations, but there are no UK trial data to guide either practice or policy.</p><p>The current challenge is to adapt existing interventions to meet the cultural needs of South Asians, and to demonstrate efficacy in the UK context, as it has been suggested that strategies that work in some societies may not work in others, as different social, economic, political and cultural environments will affect diet and lifestyle.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref> We based the Prevention of Diabetes &#x00026; Obesity in South Asians (PODOSA) trial on the Finnish Diabetes Prevention study, which demonstrated the effectiveness of an individual-focused behavioural intervention that promoted weight loss and increased physical activity in preventing diabetes in a general population.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref> PODOSA's key adaptations are to shift the emphasis from the individual to the family and from the clinic to the household. A cluster design was chosen first to maximise participation and help achieve behaviour change, by recognising the fact that most health-related behaviours take place within the family or home setting and that other family members may, for example, be involved in food preparation (supplementary information in the NSFD).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref> Second, this design would limit potential &#x02018;contamination&#x02019; where close members of a family were in different arms of the trial, but sharing information. For reasons already described,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref> recruitment proved difficult and the primary aim was changed from a reduction in the incidence of diabetes to weight loss, as this needed a smaller sample size.</p><p>The PODOSA trial thus aims to test the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of an intervention designed to reduce weight and increase physical activity in adults at high risk of diabetes, indicated by Impaired Glucose Tolerance (IGT) or Impaired Fasting Glycaemia (IFG), thereby preventing or delaying diabetes. The aim of this paper was to describe the trial design and methods and baseline characteristics of participants and family volunteers.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design and questions</title><p>PODOSA is a cluster, randomised controlled trial, the &#x02018;cluster&#x02019; represented by a family. The original protocol written in 2007 was designed to answer the primary question, &#x02018;Does a family-based three-year programme promoting weight loss and increased physical activity in South Asians, modelled on interventions of proven effectiveness internationally, reduce the incidence of type 2 diabetes in South Asians?&#x02019; However, owing to recruitment challenges,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref> a substantial amendment was approved by the ethics committee in 2009 to alter the primary outcome as detailed above.</p><p>The principal research questions that we are pursuing are therefore now:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Does a family-based 3-year programme promoting weight loss and increased physical activity in South Asians with IGT and/or IFG, modelled on interventions of proven effectiveness internationally, result in a clinically meaningful weight loss in the intensive intervention (15-visit) group compared with the light intervention (four-visit) group?</p></list-item><list-item><p>What is the cost-effectiveness of the intervention?</p></list-item><list-item><p>What factors assist recruitment, adherence to advice given and retention in the trial?</p></list-item></list></p><p>In addition to participants with impaired glycaemia, we invited adult members of their families to take part, mainly to support the trial participants in the process of lifestyle change. We made limited measurements on the family volunteers both to motivate them in changing their own lifestyles and to help assess the potential benefits to family members outside the main intervention groups.</p><p>The secondary research questions which are designed to help interpret the main outcomes are:

Our goal is weight loss of 2.5&#x02005;kg more (or 2.5&#x02005;kg lower weight gain) in the intensive intervention than in the light intervention group and increase in physical activity to at least 30&#x02005;min daily. Ideally, we would reduce the body mass index (BMI) to at least 25 or preferably 23 (the interim WHO recommendation for Asian populations).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></p><p>Secondary outcome measures of interest are:

Criteria were defined to identify each extended family unit prior to randomisation. To minimise contamination, first-degree relatives (parents, siblings, children) living in the same city could not be randomised separately. The cluster is &#x02018;the core family&#x02019; consisting of the participant(s) with IGT/IFG, plus any family volunteer(s). In practice, given the relatively low prevalence of IGT or IFG (15%), compared with 30% expected, clustering was less common than predicted.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Sample size considerations</title><p>In the original study design, it was anticipated that there would often be at least two eligible individuals per family (ie, per cluster), so the fact that we were using a cluster randomised design was critical in the power calculation. However, when the primary endpoint was amended to weight change, it was clear that the vast majority of &#x02018;clusters&#x02019; would comprise a single individual. Thus, in practice, the impact of clustering will be negligible, and the modified power calculation did not take this into account. The target sample size for the amended trial was calculated to be 175 recruits to allow for a 10% drop-out. This would result in at least 150 recruits having complete follow-up at 3&#x02005;years. This sample size gives adequate (86%) power to detect a difference of 50% of the SD (ie, a mean difference in weight change of 2.5&#x02005;kg between the two groups against a common background SD of 5&#x02005;kg, derived using nQuery Advisor V.7.0) at the 5% significance level (two-sided).</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Randomisation and allocation of interventions</title><p>Randomisation lists were produced by the trial statistician using a random number generator programme. Permuted blocks were used and block size varied randomly. Stratification was by location (Edinburgh or Glasgow), ethnic group (Indian or Pakistani) and number of IGT/IFG recruits in the family (one or more than one). All members of a &#x02018;family&#x02019; gave written informed consent and completed the baseline visit prior to randomisation. Allocation of the intervention group was then performed centrally, by the trial statistician or a deputy, independently from the dietitians and trial office staff. This strategy was implemented to minimise selection bias during the recruitment process and meant that both the dietitians and the families did not know the allocated intervention until the enrolment and baseline measurements had been completed. As in other lifestyle prevention trials, blinding of the intervention was not feasible.</p><p>The study has two groups for comparison, one group having more frequent and tailored contact (intensive or 15-visit intervention) with the research dietitians than the &#x02018;control&#x02019; group (light or 4-visit intervention), which largely receives information. The 15-visit group of 78 families received 15 contacts over 3&#x02005;years, monthly for 3&#x02005;months and quarterly thereafter. The four-visit group of 78 families had annual contact over 3&#x02005;years with the dietitian.

The contacts with the families were, in effect, the intervention, and in general, each family was seen by the same dietitian for the duration of the trial. The content of the contacts was tailored, using a range of culturally adapted change management tools, to the needs of the individuals and families. The dietitians motivated the participating families to achieve weight loss through a calorie deficit diet in conjunction with physical activity. Verbal and written advice was provided including information on shopping, cooking (with demonstrations) and entertaining. Participants were invited to annual group sessions consisting of a food shopping tour, understanding food labels, exchange of recipes, food tasting and brisk walking. The dietitians&#x02019; toolkit (which will be published on the PODOSA website, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.podosa.org">http://www.podosa.org</ext-link>, by the end of March 2013), contained culturally adapted and translated existing resources on diet and physical activity such as Counterweight.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref> A paper on the cultural adaptation process of the study materials has been accepted for publication (subject to minor revisions) by Health Promotion International.

Daily food diaries and pedometer logs, body weight and waist circumference data and the Chester Step Test<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref> were used as educational and motivational tools by the dietitians.</p></sec><sec id="s2k"><title>Intervention for four-visit group</title><p>This group had a baseline and then annual contact with the research dietitian. The dietitians gave both written and verbal advice on healthy eating, diabetes prevention, promotion of physical activity and on accessing available health services for weight control and physical activity. The research team agreed which resources should be given to families in the four-visit group at each visit, to ensure consistency. Although these actions were better than the routine service, it is not anticipated that they will reduce weight substantially and sustainably, though they may stabilise it and counteract the secular trend and age effects of increasing weight.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref> In our opinion, this level of intervention was necessary on ethical grounds. It also offered something in return for participation and measurements.</p></sec><sec id="s2l"><title>Measurement and valuation of costs</title><p>The PODOSA trial design included an integrated cost analysis. Cost data were collected prospectively from randomisation (baseline) to the 3-year follow-up. We chose a societal perspective for the analysis which encompassed the health service costs of the intervention and the opportunity cost of time for trial participants. The programme costs included the number and length of home visits by research dietitians and self-reported health service use in primary and acute care settings. Initial screening and trial recruitment costs were excluded. We valued dietitians&#x02019; time (face-to-face contact, previsit and postvisit review and travel to participants&#x02019; households) using NHS salary scales inclusive of salary on-costs and overheads. Standard NHS unit costs were used to value general practitioner visits and hospital out-patient clinic attendances. Participant time included the number and length of dietitian visits and self-reported time spent doing moderate physical activities and on household allocation of time for food shopping and meal preparation. Median hourly wages by gender and ethnicity reported by the National Equality Panel/Labour Force Survey<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref> were used to value participant time. No estimate of diet costs was included. The present value of the 3-year cumulative costs was calculated using a 3.5% annual rate of discount following the UK Treasury and National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidance. All costs are reported in UK pounds using 2010 pay and price levels.</p><p>All analyses will be conducted on an intention-to-treat basis. The conditional mean cost comparison between 15-visit and 4-visit groups will be modelled using linear regression and generalised linear parametric methods. The mean cost difference between the groups will also be assessed using a non-parametric bootstrap. Quantile regression will be used to examine and compare the median cost differences. The relatively small sample size precludes assessment of heterogeneous treatment effects or subgroup differences in costs.</p><p>The robustness of results will be investigated by using a strategy of comparing different specifications within the generalised linear model and conducting a series of one-way sensitivity analyses, where we will alter key assumptions on programme intensity and frequency as measured by the number, length and duration of visits. The cost implications arising from moving away from a one-to-one programme towards a group-based intervention will also be considered.</p></sec><sec id="s2m"><title>Qualitative study</title><p>An embedded qualitative study was undertaken to:

We also sought to include family volunteers when possible.

We emphasised the need for family involvement as a means of motivating behaviour change and set the complex intervention in the home setting. Our only entry criterion relating to the family was that the main cook agree to co-operate, and this was always achieved. We consider this a major success. It proved harder to recruit family volunteers in Edinburgh than in Glasgow. It was difficult to identify clear reasons for this, but the dietitians reported that, in many instances, the potential volunteers were either unavailable or did not interact or eat with the main recruits with sufficient frequency.</p><p>The proportion of Pakistani to Indian recruits (2:1) in PODOSA closely reflects the wider resident South Asian population as reported in the 2001 Scottish census where those of Pakistani origin represented 31% of the total minority ethnic population and 15% were of Indian origin.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Strengths and weaknesses</title><p>PODOSA, to our knowledge, is one of the first culturally adapted, community-based, randomised intervention trials on lifestyle and health issues in South Asians in the UK. PODOSA will contribute evidence for weight control and diabetes specifically; however, its long-term legacy will be the experience, lessons and example of the evaluation of complex interventions in ethnic minority populations set in the community in the UK multiethnic society.</p><p>Although we were unable to recruit sufficient numbers to examine, with sufficient power, progression to diabetes within the life of the trial, we have participants&#x02019; consent to link trial data to the Scottish national morbidity records and Scottish diabetes register during a 10-year follow-up period. This may allow analysis of this outcome in the longer term. However, weight loss, our new primary outcome, is the main driver for diabetes prevention, and physical activity, a secondary outcome, is also important.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Putting the study in context</title><p>Based on the available evidence in 2005 at the design stage of the trial,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref> we set eligibility criteria for waist circumference (&#x02265;90&#x02005;cm for men and &#x02265;80&#x02005;cm for women) as those with central obesity are more likely to have impaired glycaemia. We estimated that we would identify IGT in around 30% of such volunteers screened for trial eligibility.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref> Within PODOSA, the prevalence rate for IGT and/or IFG was approximately 15%, much lower than expected. The Leicester (UK) Addition study reported finding 19.8% IGT or IFG in South Asians aged 40&#x02013;75&#x02005;years, with no minimum waist size.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref> A recent systematic review<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref> of cross-sectional studies in South Asians also suggests a stable or falling IGT prevalence, although the natural history of prediabetes and its progression to diabetes still remains unclear. Our lower prevalence rate of impaired glycaemia was one of the contributory factors to our difficulty in achieving the original intended sample size.</p><p>Within the UK, the case for national screening programmes for both diabetes and impaired glycaemia remains equivocal.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref> Recent research has suggested that the case is stronger than it was, although evidence from good quality trials showing a subsequent reduction in morbidity and mortality is still required.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref> Hanif <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref> argue that a stepwise screening strategy aimed at the South Asian population could be effective, although further work is needed to examine implementation within primary care. The Addition Leicester trial,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref> a community screening programme and cardiovascular risk intervention, includes a significant South Asian population and is due to report in 2013. The results from PODOSA, also expected in 2013, will contribute to urgently needed evidence about the effectiveness of prevention interventions in a UK ethnic minority population at high risk of developing diabetes.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Implications</title><p>South Asians are at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes and effectiveness data for culturally tailored healthcare interventions are urgently required in order to help prevent this epidemic and to help inform healthcare services and policy in the UK. The trial results, including cost-effectiveness and qualitative findings, will be submitted for publication in 2013. In particular, this study has focused on the family rather than the individual and moved from the traditional clinic to a home setting. This kind of approach has been promoted in guidance from NSFD and NICE,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref> so evidence from PODOSA will be pertinent to this line of argument. More generally, PODOSA will also contribute to the evidence base for conducting randomised lifestyle intervention trials in ethnic minority populations in the UK and contribute to future meta-analyses with ongoing diabetes prevention trials in other South Asian populations.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d34e241" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2012-002226.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d34e242" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2012-002226.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank other PODOSA Investigators and Collaborators (Dr Naureen Ahmed, Dr Colin Fischbacher, Dr Rafik Gardee, Dr Sonja Hunt, Dr Lubna Kerr, Dr Fraser McLeod); the PODOSA Trial Steering Committee (Prof Nigel Unwin, Prof Graham Hitman, Dr Nita Forouhi, Dr Deepak Bhatnagar, Dr Marlie Ferenczi and Mr Iqbal Anwar); the PODOSA Trial Data Monitoring and Ethics Committee (Prof Iain Crombie, Dr Mike Small, Dr Mike Kelly, Prof Kamlesh Khunti); PODOSA Trial Staff (Alyson Hutchison, Alex Celini, Maninder Kaur, Arti Nair, Anne Houghton, Zoe Morrison, Rachael Samuel); the Trial Sponsor (University of Edinburgh); other supporting research networks&#x02014;Scottish Primary Care Research Network, Scottish Diabetes Research Network, Welcome Trust Clinical Research Facility Edinburgh, BHF Glasgow Cardiovascular Research Centre (Dr Lynne Cherry, Pauline Watt); Glasgow &#x00026; Edinburgh Diabetes Managed Clinical Networks; all Health Care Professionals in NHS Lothian and NHS Greater Glasgow &#x00026; Clyde and South Asian Community &#x00026; religious organisations and individuals who contributed to the recruitment for PODOSA, and finally to all the participants who gave their time to take part in this study.
