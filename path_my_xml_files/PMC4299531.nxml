Current existing dengue prevention programs served as the control treatment in comparison clusters. Pupa per person index (PPI) is used as the main outcome measure. Particular attention was paid to social mobilization and empowerment with IIS.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Overall, IIS was successful in reducing PPI levels in intervention communities versus control clusters, with intervention clusters in the six paired clusters that followed the study design experiencing a greater reduction of PPI compared to controls (2.2 OR, 95% CI: 1.2 to 4.7). Analysis of individual cases demonstrates that consideration for contexualizing programs and strategies to local neighborhoods can be very effective in reducing PPI for dengue transmission risk reduction.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>In the rapidly evolving political climate for dengue control in Ecuador, integration of successful social mobilization and empowerment strategies with existing and emerging biolarvicide-based government dengue prevention and control programs is promising in reducing PPI and dengue transmission risk in southern coastal communities like Machala.

While Ecuador reports implementing the Integrated Management Strategy for the Prevention and Control of Dengue (IMS-Dengue; or the Spanish acronym EGI-Dengue<sup><xref rid="TRU209C22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>) in 2010,<sup><xref rid="TRU209C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> common challenges remain in ensuring sustainability of social mobilization and social communication elements, as well as operational challenges in assuring adequate coverage of vector source reduction campaigns and reducing dependence on insecticides.<sup><xref rid="TRU209C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> The work presented here seeks to provide applicable, locally contextualized operational research on these fronts.</p><p>This collaboration's overarching objective was to better understand the effectiveness and feasibility of applying an integrated ecohealth approach to dengue prevention and control in endemic urban and peri-urban settings marked by infrastructural weaknesses. It builds on two separate participatory action research pilot studies based in Machala<sup><xref rid="TRU209C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> that established the feasibility and efficacy of conducting community-based interventions to promote the prevention and control of dengue applying an ecosystem approach to human health. The first study<sup><xref rid="TRU209C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> applied a comprehensive dengue elementary school education program (DESE), including classroom knowledge, practical skill development and application (Arichabala-Wilches A, Universidad T&#x000e9;cnica de Machala, unpublished data). The second study<sup><xref rid="TRU209C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> evaluated a 6-week participatory &#x02018;Clean Patio and Safe Container&#x02019; (CPSC) strategy focusing on removing discarded or unused containers/materials from patios, and brushing out and covering ground-level tanks to prevent <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> breeding sites within the peri-domestic area (Beltr&#x000e1;n-Ayala F, Universidad T&#x000e9;cnica de Machala, unpublished data).

Integrating these two locally successful approaches and applying them to serve a larger population at risk may provide insights into sustainability and operational challenges experienced with IMS-Dengue in Machala. Further, this study provides the timely opportunity to explore the potential use of the pupa per person index (PPI) as a vector control outcome measure to complement the current use of HI and BI outcome measures by the Ministry of Health National Vector Borne Disease Control Service (SNEM).</p><p>Here we examine the effectiveness of applying an integrated community-based approach to prevent and control dengue in a vulnerable endemic setting and analyze its implementation in comparison with current government programs, and we investigate the effectiveness and feasibility of scaling up an ecosystem approach to dengue prevention and control amid the resurgence of dengue in southern Ecuador.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study site</title><p>Machala is the capital of El Oro (population &#x0223c;300 000; 72% urban population), the southernmost province on Ecuador's Pacific coast where 41.4% of the population lives at or below the poverty line.

Essentially, Machala exists in a perpetual state of risk for outbreaks and epidemic transmission of dengue with frequent outbreaks and an average incidence of 28.5 cases per 10 000 popluation.<sup><xref rid="TRU209C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>
<italic>Aedes</italic> indices historically peak between February and April, following the precipitation trend of the rainy season (October to March) and reported cases of dengue routinely closely follow this trend.

Four 30-minute classes over 2 weeks taught modules about the symptoms of dengue, the dengue transmission cycle, the lifecycle of the mosquito <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and laboratory observation of the different life stages of the vector. This was followed by a practical learning session in a neighborhood location providing practical education enabling children to practically apply their knowledge in their own context. Classroom sessions were repeated every 6 months, with once-monthly follow-up practical pupal collection &#x02018;homework&#x02019; assignments where children collected mosquito pupae specimens from their own homes and submitted to DESE personnel for identification at the SNEM vector entomology lab. Classroom and follow-up assignments were administered by health educators, public health practitioners and frontline vector control personnel, and results were returned to the community within 10 days. The expected outcome of the practical sessions is that children are able to identify, record and control (i.e., empty water or request control measures from a parent) mosquito-breeding sites in their immediate environment. This program is designed with specific elements for child empowerment and social mobilization for children as emerging health leaders in their own communities.</p></sec><sec id="s2c2"><title>CPSC</title><p>Using community empowerment and social mobilization to eliminate <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> breeding sites in peri-domestic areas, community volunteer CPSC activators (one activator per each 10&#x02013;15 participant houses, 4 h per month) were recruited from within each cluster. SNEM health promoters supported CPSC activators by coordinating house inspection dates and collecting datasheets for project databases; SNEM employees did not accompany activators on their house visits once training was complete. Once-monthly community-directed visits to participant homes cataloged the state of the patio based on three criteria: (1) cleanliness (absence of discarded containers, solid waste, animal feces and plastics), (2) weed and plant removal (elimination of mosquito sanctuary in wild plants) and (3) orderliness (stored containers are protected from accumulating water, stored water is changed regularly, controlled with larvicides and in well-maintained containers). CPSC data collection recorded condition of the patio, identified and enumerated breeding sites positive for water, larva and/or pupae, and numbers of pupae present in each participant home; monthly visit forms were processed by SNEM health promoters. Households repeatedly showing poor indices over a 3-month period were flagged by community inspectors for support by vector control personnel to collaboratively seek solutions to address underlying dynamics of identified dengue risks. Community CPSC activators were recruited in October 2012, with program rollout unfolding in eight of the ten intervention clusters from an initial fully supported month-long program launch and scaled-up &#x02018;pilot&#x02019; in November 2012. This initial intensive capacity-building and human resource investment ensured communities were trained, willing and able to run CPSC efforts without continued intensive support from vector control and Ministry of Health staff; it was also used to assess levels of community capacity in this respect. The majority of communities independently carried forward the CPSC program using built capacity. Continued capacity building and human resource investments for the duration of the implementation window were offered to communities with higher risk factors and special considerations from November 2012 to November 2013.</p></sec><sec id="s2c3"><title>Control clusters with government-mandated strategy</title><p>Conventional SNEM dengue prevention and control strategies included the use of temephos larvicide (Abate) as a preventive breeding-source control measure, coupled with routine (blanket mosquito control) and reactive (targeted <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> control in response to suspected and confirmed dengue cases) intradomiciliary deltamethrine fogging using backpack sprayers, and neighborhood vehicle-mounted malathion fogging. Once or twice yearly household visits by vector control workers are conducted to monitor entomological indices. However, from April 2013 SNEM dengue control strategies were significantly altered in Machala by the rollout of a new federally mandated <italic>bti-</italic>biolarvicide-based control program characterized by a huge increase in government vector control worker presence, educational and technical intervention in individual homes and communities. In this revised monitoring and control strategy, a vector control technician/frontline worker visits each home in Machala twice per month to educate household members on mosquito-breeding source reduction, to apply biolarvicide, educate around biolarvicide application, leave a small quantity of biolarvicide for domestic use until the next visit, and inspect/record/educate/eliminate mosquito-breeding source containers. Although the new strategy does incorporate eco-bio-social elements, it is currently in the pilot stage and full integration of these elements has not been achieved, nor has full coverage of Machala to date. The biolarvicide-based program was incrementally rolled-out and implemented during the intervention period resulting in a temporally and geographically varied mix of baseline control programs in control clusters. This called for a more sophisticated analysis than had been originally planned, to ensure that the intervention's effect would focus on those cluster pairings that remained faithful to the study design.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Using SPSS statistical software version 21.0, we modelled the pre- and post-intervention pupal counts by using a Poisson regression model, accounting for cluster pairing.

Due to the complexities of IIS implementation introduced by the concurrent rollout of new Ministry of Health biolarvicide mosquito control programs, we organized our analysis to highlight those clusters where the original study design was successfully applied and where there were no confounding municipal interventions, while considering the effects of the biolarviciding program as a confounder in those sites where it had been introduced. This effectively excluded clusters where not all the interventions had been introduced as planned as a result of implementation personnel being overextended with the biolarviciding program (i.e., pairs 1, 2 and 4), and pair 7 (due to cluster 2, Sim&#x000f3;n Bol&#x000ed;var) where effects were observed due to substantially improved infrastructure and basic services being introduced during the study period.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Ethical considerations and partnerships</title><p>Informed consent was obtained for each household and child participant recruited to the study prior to their participation.

Community-driven implementation of the CPSC in two cluster communities required continuing capacity-building support and human resource investment: Sauces #1 (cluster 14), a neighborhood frequently flooding, poor infrastructure and solid waste collection, and significant public insecurity; and Mario Minuche (cluster 19), a peri-urban neighborhood characterized by inadequate housing, poor solid waste collection bordering on an uncovered canal. Implementation of IIS following original experimental design was not achieved in pairs 1, 2 or 4 due to saturation of skilled human resources for vector control and the incremental rollout of the SNEM <italic>bti</italic>-biolarvicide dengue prevention program in the study area and adjacent areas.</p><p>Further, the significant reduction of PPI in control cluster 2 (Sim&#x000f3;n Bol&#x000ed;var; pair 7) is a direct result of long-standing and ongoing community-based political action by the neighborhood council and neighborhood president that saw the realization of a full neighborhood revitalization project in collaboration with the Municipal Government of Machala during the intervention period. Prior to revitalization, Simon Bol&#x000ed;var's dengue transmission risk indicators were high (PPI 1.123), with many residents lacking potable water in their homes, significant gang activity and social insecurity in the neighborhood, poor and sometimes lacking roadway infrastructure and garbage collection, and inadequate housing. The revitalization included basic infrastructure such as installation and improvement of sewers and storm sewers, roads, sidewalks, lighting in public spaces, a children's playground, increased police presence, improved garbage collection, and improvements to private residences and properties. As a result, and without the implementation of the IIS in their neighborhood, PPI was reduced to very low or minimal risk. This empowered intersectoral collaboration between the community of Sim&#x000f3;n Bol&#x000ed;var and the Municipal Government of Machala vividly illustrates the crucial role that provision of basic services, basic infrastructure, and considerations for human and community security, play in establishing healthy communities and reducing the incidence of diseases of poverty like dengue fever and severe dengue. The increase in PPI for cluster 9 is a result of localized flooding during November 2013 in the neighborhood.</p><p>IIS implementation was very successful in cluster 14 (Sauces #1) with high community enthusiasm and sustained involvement. This, along with the effects of localized flooding in 2012 and a very dry season in 2013, resulted in a significant reduction of PPI. Also interesting in this cluster pair is the dramatic reduction of PPI in control cluster 17 (24 de Septiembre). This highly organized and motivated community capitalized on project presence to leverage support for other ongoing efforts to improve well-being and human security in their neighborhood. Community leaders routinely assemble and coordinate efforts to address community issues and garner support from the Municipal Government of Machala as well as the Ministries of Health, Environment and Education; there were a number of these efforts that coincided with interests of the IIS in reducing dengue transmission risk. Two particular efforts were of interest in this respect: an improved community-driven solid waste removal campaign partnered with the Municipal Department of Environment to reduce the presence of containers (possible <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> breeding sites), and an infrastructure project partnered with the Municipal Department of Public Works to fill in the lagoon in their neighborhood square to reduce standing water.</p><p>The unforeseen rollout of a new biolarvicide dengue prevention program complicated IIS implementation efforts within the community-based project model by saturating existing skilled human resources and introducing logistical complications. Increased community interface time within the biolarvicide program (two in-home visits per month by a vector control technician and/or frontline worker) affected the CPSC empowerment strategy and original scale-up recommendations in three ways: (1) shifts in Ministry of Health vector control programs and services increased governmental intervention in communities that do not depend on community-driven empowerment strategies; (2) they introduce a more ecologically sensitive model of dengue prevention with the reduction of insecticides (addressing a major community concern); and (3) offer a parallel stream for community involvement, time, enthusiasm and good-will toward dengue prevention and control. While a complication, this experience introduced a novel opportunity to consider the interface of alternative strategies.</p><p>The success of our proposed IIS dengue prevention program during biolarvicide program rollout indicates a complementarity of efforts: both programs respond to community concerns of reducing insecticide use in domestic and peri-domestic environments, increasing skilled Ministry of Health human resource investment to reduce dengue incidence in affected communities, and improving health education and dengue prevention through positive behavior change in homes, neighborhoods and schools. However, it is the IIS strategy that is observed the more effective approach for reducing PPI levels. Nevertheless, integrating community-driven empowerment strategies like DESE and CPSC within the robust structure and function of the biolarvicide program could enhance synergy between parallel streams and capitalize on emerging momentum and progress in dengue prevention and control in southern Ecuador.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Conclusions</title><p>An integrated eco-bio-social approach to reducing PPI as a useful outcome measure of dengue transmission risk has been successful in Machala, Ecuador, although difficulties encountered in smoothly implementing this study as it was designed suggest that it would still be valuable to conduct further implementation trials as part of scaling-up activity. Additionally, our results suggest that local successes in ecosystems approaches to dengue prevention can be successful if that process is pursued in partnership with communities, incorporates an element of social mobilization and empowerment, and emphasizes intersectoral collaboration. Examples outlined in this paper of intersectoral collaboration between communities, control programs and municipal governments underscore the importance of integrating efforts, resources, momentum and empowerment from all actors involved with and concerned with dengue prevention and control in individual communities and over larger municipal and regional endemic zones.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p><bold>Authors' contributions:</bold> In the opinion of the authors, the first four authors should be regarded as joint first authors.
