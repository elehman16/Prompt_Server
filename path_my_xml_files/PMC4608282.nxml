A process evaluation alongside a trial can shed light on the mechanisms responsible for the outcomes of a trial. The aim of this study was to investigate exposure to and experiences with a computerized decision support system (CDSS) intervention, in order to gain insight into the intervention&#x02019;s impact and to provide suggestions for improvement.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A process evaluation was conducted as part of a large-scale cluster-randomized controlled trial investigating the effects of the CDSS NHGDoc on quality of care. Data on exposure to and experiences with the intervention were collected during the trial period among participants in both the intervention and control group - whenever applicable - by means of the NHGDoc server and an electronic questionnaire. Multiple data were analyzed using descriptive statistics.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Ninety-nine percent (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;229) of the included practices generated data for the NHGDoc server and 50&#x000a0;% (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;116) responded to the questionnaire: both general practitioners (GPs; <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;112; 49&#x000a0;%) and practice nurses (PNs; <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;52; 37&#x000a0;%) participated. The actual exposure to the NHGDoc system and specific heart failure module was limited with 52&#x000a0;% of the GPs and 42&#x000a0;% of the PNs reporting to either never or rarely use the system. Overall, users had a positive attitude towards CDSSs. The most perceived barriers to using NHGDoc were a lack of learning capacity of the system, the additional time and work it requires to use the CDSS, irrelevant alerts, too high intensity of alerts and insufficient knowledge regarding the system.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Several types of barriers may have negatively affected the impact of the intervention. Although users are generally positive about CDSSs, a large share of them is insufficiently aware of the functions of NHGDoc and, finds the decision support not always useful or relevant and difficult to integrate into daily practice. In designing CDSS interventions we suggest to more intensely involve the end-users and increase the system&#x02019;s flexibility and learning capacity. To improve implementation a proper introduction of a CDSS among its target group including adequate training is advocated.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Clinical trials <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01773057">NCT01773057</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12875-015-0364-0) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Clinical decision support</kwd><kwd>Clinical practice guidelines</kwd><kwd>Primary care</kwd><kwd>Process evaluation</kwd><kwd>Barriers</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>Computerized decision support systems (CDSSs) have the potential to improve quality of care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. To the extent that their content is guideline-based, they can support physicians in adhering to the best-available evidence as presented in clinical guidelines, and ultimately lead to improved patient outcomes. Evidence on their uptake and effectiveness, however, is thus far limited and is usually retrieved from small-scale academic-driven settings, in which CDSSs aimed at a limited number of specific decision points are tested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>In the Netherlands, a CDSS for primary care - NHGDoc - was developed in 2006, as a collaborative effort between the Dutch college of General Practitioners (NHG) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and ExpertDoc BV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], a private company. NHGDoc covers multiple domains of care and provides a variety of patient-specific advices during patient consultation for both general practitioners (GPs) and practice nurses (PNs). Its content is based on the NHG guidelines, the national prevailing guidelines for general practice. The system is gradually being implemented at a large scale and is currently available to approximately 65&#x000a0;% of all Dutch general practices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>To evaluate the uptake of NHGDoc and its effectiveness in terms of improving quality of primary care, a large-scale cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT) was conducted within 231 general practices in the Netherlands. More specifically, this two-arm cluster RCT with a follow-up period of 1 year, assessed the effectiveness of NHGDoc with respect to improving the process of medical care (e.g. prescription behavior) as well as patient outcomes (e.g. hospital admissions), which is described in detail in the Methods section [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Preliminary analyses reveal that no effects were found on the identified outcome measures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>Delivering a complex intervention such as a CDSS in a trial setting does not guarantee that the target group is actually exposed to the intervention as planned. Particularly, in cluster RCTs exposure to the intervention may vary considerably between participating practices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Also, participants&#x02019; experiences with the intervention may affect exposure and may help explain the results of a trial. A process evaluation can shed light on the factors/mechanisms responsible for the outcomes of a trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>Therefore, we conducted a process evaluation alongside the trial. The aim of this study was to investigate the exposure to and experiences with our CDSS quality improvement intervention, in order to gain insight into the factors contributing to the intervention&#x02019;s impact. Results of the process evaluation can provide insight in the feasibility and reproducibility of the intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and can be used to improve the implementation of NHGDoc as well as similar CDSS interventions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Description of the intervention</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>The CDSS NHGDoc</title><p>NHGDoc is a CDSS integrated within the electronic health record system (EHRS) and based on the NHG guidelines, the prevailing guidelines for general practice in the Netherlands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].

The patient and performance data are compared to the digitized guideline recommendations and in case of a discrepancy between current and advised care, an alert will be sent back to the GP or PN. Also, users have the option to ask or provide feedback from/to ExpertDoc, the organization that has developed and maintains NHGDoc, about the received alert.

By using <italic>alert settings</italic>, users can adjust the preferences of the alerts to match their personal needs. They can choose to switch alerts on and off on demand at several levels: the system, the modules (NHGDoc domains), the types of alerts (patient data registration, management, drug prescription), and the patients. The <italic>reporting settings</italic> allow users to request specific reports with respect to the number and types of alerts they have received per domain within a specific period of time (per year, per month, per week of per day). See [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] for a detailed description of the NHGDoc system.</p><p>To evaluate the effects of NHGDoc on quality of care we conducted a cluster randomized controlled trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. All general practices in the Netherlands that, at the time of recruitment had NHGDoc at their disposal, were invited to participate in the study (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;approx. 1.100). Our power analysis revealed that we needed to include at least 122 general practices to detect an effect on our main primary outcome measures. A comprehensive recruitment plan was conducted, consisting of a combination of direct invitations via postal mailings as well as emails, combined with announcements of the evaluation study in several relevant Dutch journals, websites, newsletters and through social media (i.e. Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. A total of 231 general practices gave their consent to participate in the trial. 115 practices were randomly assigned to the control arm, whereas 116 practices were allocated to the intervention arm.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Regular NHGDoc modules (control arm)</title><p>General practices assigned to the control arm received the regular NHGDoc decision support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. These practices received decision support with respect to all modules (NHG guidelines) that &#x02013; at the onset of the trial &#x02013; had already been integrated into NHGDoc. These were cardiovascular risk management, asthma/COPD, diabetes mellitus type II, thyroid disorders, viral hepatitis and other liver diseases, atrial fibrillation and subfertility.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>The NHGDoc heart failure module (intervention arm)</title><p>General practices allocated to the intervention arm received the same decision support modules as the control arm, extended with the NHGDoc module on heart failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The NHGDoc module on heart failure is directly derived from the NHG guideline on heart failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. It consists of three types of alerts:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Alerts on heart failure in terms of registering patient data;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Alerts on heart failure in terms of prescribing (or adjusting the dose of) drugs;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Alerts on heart failure in terms of (paying attention to) management aspects.</p><p>See [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] for a detailed description of the module.</p></list-item></list></p><p>At the onset of the trial the NHGDoc heart failure module was activated in the intervention group. Other than that, no activities and time investments were required. General practices and the staff working within these practices were blinded to group allocation. They were even unaware of participating in an intervention trial with a concurrent control group. The trial did not show a significant effect on the identified primary outcome measures (prescribing of ACE inhibitors/angiotensin II; prescribing of beta-blocker; prescribing of diuretics) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Data collection and study measures</title><p>The need for ethical approval for the NHGDoc evaluation study was waived by the research ethics committee of the Radboud university medical center.

Informed written consent was obtained from all practices: each general practice filled out an online registration form in which they agreed with the design of the study and the use of NHGDoc server data as described on the website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nhgdoc-evaluatie.nl">www.nhgdoc-evaluatie.nl</ext-link>) and gave consent on behalf of all practice staff (GPs and PNs).

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] whenever applicable. Besides from describing the intervention itself, this framework recommends to describe the <italic>actual exposure to the intervention</italic> as well as the <italic>experiences</italic> with the interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec8"><title>NHGDoc server</title><p>We extracted the following data from the NHGDoc server to measure <italic>exposure</italic> to the intervention in both study groups: NHGDoc activity (send NHGDoc requests), switched off NHGDoc modules including heart failure (intervention group only), opening of alerts including for heart failure patients (intervention group only). Data were collected continuously during the trial and were sent to our research institute (IQ healthcare) on a monthly base [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Questionnaire</title><p>At the end of the trial an electronic questionnaire (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>) was sent to all participating practices (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;231). From each general practice we invited one GP and one PN (if applicable) to fill out the questionnaire. Aside from demographic and professional characteristics (e.g., age, gender, number of hours worked weekly), <italic>exposure</italic> to and <italic>experiences</italic> with the CDSS intervention were measured.</p><p><italic>Exposure</italic> was measured with six statements about the level of use of the NHGDoc system as a whole; the alert function; the feedback function; the My NHGDoc function, and more specifically the alerts settings and reporting settings. Responses were rated on a 5-point Likert scale (ranging from 1. not at all to 5. very much).</p><p><italic>Experiences</italic> with the intervention were measured in two different ways: by measuring attitudes towards CDSSs in general and by measuring perceived barriers and suggested interventions to using NHGDoc. Prior to developing the questionnaire, we conducted a qualitative focus group study to identify the range of barriers that GPs and PNs perceive in using NHGDoc or similar CDSSs in practice. Three focus group sessions were conducted in which 24 primary care practitioners (PCPs) participated (general practitioners, general practitioners in training and practice nurses), varying from 7 to 9 per session. In each focus group, barriers to using CDSSs were discussed using a semi-structured literature-based topic list. Two researchers independently performed thematic content analysis using the software program Atlas.ti 7.0.</p><p>This resulted in a framework of barriers, which is described elsewhere in detail [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In general, three groups of barriers emerged, related to 1) the users&#x02019; knowledge of the system, 2) the users&#x02019; evaluation of features of the system (source and content, output, and functionality), and 3) the interaction of the system with external factors (patient-related and environmental factors). Whereas the focus group study was conducted to identity all relevant barriers to using CDSSs, the survey study aimed to validate and quantify these findings.</p><p>Eight statements were included to measure the attitudes towards CDSSs in general, based on literature on attitudes towards using clinical practice guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], complemented with results from the focus group study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. A 5-point Likert scale was used to rate the extent of agreement with the statements (ranging from 1. strongly disagree to 5. strongly agree).</p><p>To measure the perceived barriers three groups of barriers were included, based on the framework that emerged from the focus group study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p><italic>Knowledge</italic>-<italic>related barriers</italic> were measured with six statements referring to knowledge about the (specific functions of the) system (e.g. &#x02018;I am aware of the option to ask for or to provide feedback in NHGDoc&#x02019;).</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Barriers related to the evaluation of the features of the CDSS</italic> were measured with 11 statements (e.g. &#x02018;I believe the loading of alerts takes too long&#x02019;).</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>External barriers interacting with the CDSS</italic> were measured with 6 statements (e.g. &#x02018;Using NHGDoc has a negative effect on patient-doctor communication&#x02019;).</p></list-item></list></p><p>The knowledge-related barriers were scored on a 2-point scale (yes/no). All other statements were rated a 5-point scale (ranging from 1. strongly disagree to 5. strongly agree), with the option &#x02018;not applicable&#x02019; (6.) added to the response scale. Suggested interventions to improve CDSS usage were also discussed and will be described elsewhere.</p><p>Finally, the intended &#x02018;blinding&#x02019; in terms of the topic of the intervention was checked among the participants by formulating the following open question &#x02018;Do you have any idea on which clinical topic this study focused on?&#x02019;.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Data from the NHGDoc server measuring exposure to NHGDoc were analyzed using descriptive statistics. To analyze exposure as measured by the questionnaire we categorized the scores 1 and 2 to indicate a low level of use, we coded 3 as a moderate level of use, and combined the scores 4 and 5 to reflect an intermediate to high level of use.</p><p>To analyze the attitudes towards CDSSs in general we categorized the scores 4 and 5 (agree/strongly agree) indicating agreement; the scores 3 to refer to a neutral attitude, and the scores 1 and 2 (strongly disagree/disagree) to indicate disagreement.</p><p>The knowledge-related barriers were calculated by the percentage of respondents that indicated not to be aware of NHGDoc or its specific functions (score 1). For the second and third group of barriers (attitude-related and external barriers) the barrier statements that were stated positively rather than negatively, were first recoded, so that a higher score indicated a higher level of perceived barriers. Next, the scores 4 and 5 were combined to indicate the percentage users that indicate a barrier to be applicable.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec12"><title>Description of study sample</title><p>The 231 participating practices were an acceptable reflection of the population of Dutch GP practices, with solo practices only being slightly overrepresented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec13"><title>Description of sample NHGDoc server</title><p>Almost all recruited practices (229/231&#x02009;=&#x02009;99&#x000a0;%) generated data into the NHGDoc server database; two were eliminated from the trial due to technical problems.

Although (potential) users had a positive attitude towards CDSSs in general, several barriers to using NHGDoc could have hampered the uptake and effectiveness of the intervention. The large share of users that was insufficiently aware of the functions of NHGDoc, as well as the proportion that finds the decision support not useful or not relevant and difficult to integrate into daily practice, indicates that both the CDSS intervention itself as well as its implementation could be improved. These findings are in line with the lack of changes in outcomes of the CDSS intervention.</p><p>The actual exposure to NHGDoc and the heart failure module was low, with about half of the (potential) users reporting to either never or rarely use the system and less than 1&#x000a0;% opening alerts. Despite a few negative spikes in NHGDoc activity, which are presumably related to vacation periods of the staff, the activity was quite stable throughout the trial and technical problems did not seem to be a major issue. Also, the low level of exposure to NHGDoc was not related to users deliberately switching of one or more modules of NHGDoc. In interpreting the number of alerts in our study, it is important to realize that the different modules do not result in different alerts each. Rather, the advices are combined in one alert, consisting of an alert window with different tab pages for all relevant domains. Moreover, prior studies have also found high levels of ignoring of alerts among their users [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Nonetheless, our results suggest that other factors may have prevented our study sample from using NHGDoc as well.</p><p>Although the target group of (potential) users had a positive attitude towards CDSSs in general, several barriers were reported that could have affected the uptake and effectiveness of the intervention. The most perceived barriers to using NHGDoc were a lack of learning capacity of the system, the limited time available and the additional work it requires using the CDSS, irrelevant alerts, too high intensity of alerts and insufficient knowledge regarding the system. These findings are consistent with our focus group study and confirm that barriers to using NHGDoc were found within all three main groups of barriers in our previously developed framework of barriers to using CDSSs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>With respect to the knowledge-related barriers we found that the target group was insufficiently aware of NHGDoc and its functions, particularly the advanced personalization functions. At the onset of the trial the NHGDoc module on heart failure was activated in the intervention practices, without any further instructions. We deliberately chose for this method, as we aimed at both practitioners and patients being blinded to group allocation, which is important in protecting against bias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Moreover, since all participating practices already had NHGDoc at their disposal, we presumed a certain level of basic knowledge about NHGDoc. However, our findings show a serious lack of knowledge about the system and demonstrate the importance of a proper introduction of a CDSS intervention among its target group. This is particularly challenging when implementing CDSSs at a larger scale, outside the academic setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>Aside from improving the implementation of CDSS interventions among the target group, our results indicate that in our study the CDSS intervention itself also exhibits some shortcomings, often referred to as the &#x02018;intervention failure&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. With regard to the features of the system itself, a perceived lack of learning capacity of the system, irrelevant alerts and a too high intensity of (or a too low of a threshold for) alerts were most often perceived as barriers. It is precisely these types of barriers that often result in &#x02018;alert fatigue&#x02019;, and the ignoring of alerts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. They may be less relevant for the more common CDSSs aimed at a limited number of decision points and may particularly apply in the dynamic and complex primary care setting in which different types of PCPs work with CDSSs covering multiple disease areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Increasing the system&#x02019;s flexibility and learning capacity in order to be able to adapt the decision support to meet the varying needs of different users may then become increasingly important.</p><p>External barriers interacting with the CDSS were also experienced as barriers which has been found in other studies as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. As much as 60&#x000a0;% of the GPs from our sample reported the limited time available and the additional work it requires to use the CDSS as barriers to using it. Obviously, many GPs find it difficult to integrate the use of CDSSs into daily practice. However, we found that these barriers only apply to 16&#x02013;27&#x000a0;% of the PNs. This is probably related to the nature of their work activities, which contains a larger share of patient data registration, as well as to the way their patient consultation is scheduled. To reduce integration problems it could be helpful to rearrange GPs&#x02019; patient consultation as well, with more preparation time before actual patient consultation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Adequate training about how to properly use the system as well as providing the target group with decision support that is tailored to the specific and varying needs of each user, could also contribute in solving these integration problems.</p><p>One of the limitations of this study is the seemingly late conduction of this barrier study. However, it should be noted that the NHGDoc system already existed for 5&#x000a0;years at the start of the trial and several small user-satisfaction studies had been conducted among users. Moreover, implementing (CDSS) interventions at a larger scale outside the academic setting, seems to elicit different types of barriers, that cannot be identified in a preceding barrier study among early adopters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Implementing and further developing the system, while conducting prospective formative process evaluations at several stages of implementation, seems therefore necessary. It allows interventions to be disseminated and adopted more successfully at each subsequent later stage.</p><p>A major strength of this study is that we collected data using several methods and targeting different types of PCPs. Moreover, our study demonstrates high content validity as the questionnaire used in this study is based on qualitative study findings from the same group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. However, whereas the samples of the two approaches used (questionnaire, log-data from NHGDoc-server) were quite comparable in terms of background characteristics, selection bias may have occurred with respect to use and attitudes in the self-selected questionnaire. It may well be that responding PCPs used NHGDoc more often and had more positive attitudes towards NHGDoc compared to non-responders. The difference between reported use of NHGDoc in the questionnaire and data from the NHGDoc server points in that direction as well. This should be taken into account in interpreting our findings.</p><p>Few thorough process evaluations have been conducted in the field of CDSSs, particularly regarding multiple-domain covering CDSSs implemented at a larger scale. This study used multiple methods, targeting different types of PCPs, and with data collected within the intervention group as well as the control group. Future studies on CDSSs may benefit from thorough evaluations like this one to determine the factors that facilitate or hinder the implementation. Whereas some of the suggested strategies, such as increasing user flexibility, may particularly be helpful in implementing multiple-domain covering CDSSs at a large scale, other strategies, such as involving the end-users in designing the CDSS, also apply to the more common CDSS aimed at a limited number of decision points.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This process evaluation has identified some factors that might be responsible for the lack of changes in outcomes of the CDSS intervention, as well as useful strategies to improve its implementation. Results indicate that both the CDSS intervention itself as well as its implementation could be improved. Although users are generally positive about CDSSs, a large share of them is insufficiently aware of the functions of NHGDoc and finds the decision support not always useful or relevant and difficult to integrate into daily practice. In designing (similar) CDSS interventions we suggest to more intensely involve the end-users and increase the system&#x02019;s flexibility and learning capacity. To improve implementation a proper introduction of a CDSS among its target group including adequate training is advocated.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec24"><title>Additional file</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="12875_2015_364_MOESM1_ESM.docx" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>
