the effects of single-dose marbofloxacin in protecting horses against fever associated
with transportation using 48 healthy Thoroughbreds. All horses were premedicated with
interferon-&#x003b1; (0.5 U/kg, sublingually, every 24 hr) for 2 days before transportation and on
the day of transportation. Horses were randomly assigned to receive marbofloxacin (2
mg/kg, IV, once; MRFX group), enrofloxacin (5 mg/kg, IV, once; ERFX group) or saline (0.9%
NaCl) solution (10 m<italic>l</italic>, IV, once; control group) &#x02264;1 hr before being
transportation. Each group contained 16 horses (8 males, 8 females). Horses were
transported 1,210 km using commercial vans over the course of approximately 26 hr.
Clinical examinations and hematologic analyses were performed on all horses both before
and after transportation. Post-transportation neutrophil to lymphocyte ratios were
significantly lower in horses in the MRFX group compared with the control horses. The
serum amyloid A levels were significantly lower in horses in the MRFX group and ERFX group
compared with the control horses. Regarding the post-transportation rectal temperatures,
fever was detected in 0 horses and 1 horse in the MRFX and ERFX groups, respectively,
whereas fevers exceeding 39.1&#x000b0;C were detected in 2 horses in the control group.
Additionally, the number of essential post-transportation treatments provided by
veterinarians was reduced 3-fold in the MRFX and ERFX groups compared with the saline
group. MRFX provided ERFX-like protection against fever associated with long-distance
transportation, yielding significantly better protection than saline. Administration of
MRFX just before transportation deserves a further study for efficacy in preventing horse
fever associated with transportation.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>equine</kwd><kwd>marbofloxacin</kwd><kwd>prevention</kwd><kwd>transportation-associated fever</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>With the globalization of horse racing, long-distance transportation of racehorses via
airplane or horse trailer has become common. Fever associated with transportation is a serious
symptom that can disrupt training and racing schedules, and pneumonia and pleuropneumonia due
to bacterial infection resulting from long-distance transportation potentially increase equine
mortality [<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Prevention of this symptom improves the planning of training and racing
schedules, potentially minimizing the physical deconditioning associated with such
transportation.</p><p>Research into fever associated with transportation has been performed from various
perspectives [<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Fever associated with transportation
is thought to be induced primarily by transportation stress and deterioration of the
environment in the truck, and it is typically observed 20 hr or more after the start of
transportation [<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. During long-distance transportation,
the horse&#x02019;s elevated head position induces inflammation, obstruction of tracheal mucociliary
clearance and changes in host immunity, with associated increases in bacterial abundance in
the lower respiratory tract [<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The horse&#x02019;s
bronchoalveolar region can become infected by opportunistic pathogens, including
<italic>Streptococcus equi</italic> subsp. <italic>zooepidemicus </italic>(<italic>S.
zooepidemicus</italic>), a resident of the tonsillar tissues and trachea that is considered
the main causative organism of shipping fever [<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>Some of these previous studies have suggested prophylactic treatments intended to prevent
fever associated with transportation. A decrease in the incidence of fever associated with
transportation and improvement in clinical condition was reported for horses orally
administered interferon-&#x003b1; (IFN-&#x003b1;) for 3 consecutive days before transportation to activate the
immune system [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. However, this protocol did not
completely prevent fever associated with transportation, so further prophylactic measures are
needed. Based on these previous papers, we think that activation of immunity by IFN-&#x003b1;
administration before transportation, together with the presence in the bronchoalveolar region
during transportation of an antimicrobial agent that is effective against the bacteria that
exist in the tonsillar tissues and trachea, is important for effective prevention of fever
associated with transportation. However, most of the antimicrobial agents used in horse
clinics have short active durations [<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and it is
difficult to maintain an effective concentration in the body for long periods after a single
dose before transportation.</p><p>In contrast, new broad-spectrum quinolone antibiotics, including enrofloxacin (ERFX) and
marbofloxacin (MRFX), have been used clinically as long-acting antimicrobial agents, including
for treatment of infections of the respiratory system [<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].
Following intravenous administration in adult horses, these antibiotics are transported
effectively to the bronchoalveolar region, and blood concentrations remain high throughout the
24 hr after dosing [<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In a long-distance-transport model,
Davis <italic>et al.</italic> examined the efficacy of ERFX administration after
transportation for the purpose of treatment [<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].
Separately, we reported that fever associated with transportation was significantly decreased
by prophylactic administration of 5 mg/kg ERFX [<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].
However, the ERFX formulation is strongly alkaline and highly tissue invasive, potentially
resulting in necrosis of tissue from leaking injections; the risk of leakage is increased,
because of the large dose volume required. In contrast, MRFX exhibits little local tissue
damage, even when administered by the subcutaneous or intramuscular route [<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, there
are, to our knowledge, no previous reports of the administration of MRFX for the prevention of
fever associated with transportation.</p><p>We therefore investigated the efficacy of MRFX in protecting against fever associated with
transportation. ERFX was used as a comparative treatment, and the study subjects (Thoroughbred
horses) also received sublingual IFN-&#x003b1; for 3 days before transportation, including the
transportation day.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p><italic>Animals</italic>: The experiment was approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee
at the Hidaka Training and Research Center of the JRA.</p><p>Forty-eight clinically healthy Thoroughbred horses (24 males, 24 females; age, 2 years old)
were used for the study. The animals had been purchased for sale in the following year&#x02019;s
trained horse sale and so had received training for approximately 6 months at the Hidaka
Training and Research Center of the JRA in Hokkaido Prefecture (JRA Hidaka). The animals
were destined for the trained horse sale held at the JRA&#x02019;s Nakayama Racecourse in Chiba
Prefecture (JRA Nakayama). Prior to transport, we confirmed that the horses were not
suffering from severe respiratory diseases, such as pneumonia or pleuropneumonia.</p><p>All animals received IFN-&#x003b1; (BIMURON, Biovet, Tokyo, Japan) sublingually at 0.5 U/kg, every
24 hr, for 3 consecutive days before transportation, including the day of transportation
[<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The horses then were randomly divided into 3
groups of 16 horses (8 males, 8 females) each: an MRFX administration group (MRFX group), an
ERFX administration group (ERFX group) and a control group. The horses in the 3 groups were
administered, by intravenous injection, MRFX (Marbocyl 10%, Meiji, Tokyo, Japan) at 2 mg/kg,
ERFX (Baytril 5%, Bayer, Osaka, Japan) at 5 mg/kg or saline (Otsuka Saline Injection,
Otsuka, Tokyo, Japan) at 10 m<italic>l</italic>, respectively. These doses were determined
based on previous studies [<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Intravenous injections were
administered no more than 1 hr before the animals were loaded onto a van. The horses were
transported for approximately 26 hr, and we performed a clinical examination and hematologic
analysis before and after transportation. MRFX and ERFX are used in general equine practice
abroad [<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], but use of them is limited by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and
Fisheries in Japan.</p><p><italic>Transportation</italic>: The departure point was JRA Hidaka, and the destination
was JRA Nakayama. The duration of transportation was approximately 26 hr, and the distance
was 1,210 km. The land portion of the route was 1,100 km (expressway 1,000 km and national
highway 100 km), and the sea portion of the route was 110 km. We used a large ferry for the
sea portion of the route (from Hakodate Port in Hokkaido Prefecture to Aomori Port in Aomori
Prefecture); the ferry trip took 3 hr and 30 min.</p><p>We used 10 commercial vans, each of which could be loaded with 6 horses and was designed
exclusively for horse transportation. The structure of the vans was the same for all 10. The
horses were fed twice during transportation (at comfort stops 7 hr and 23 hr after the start
of transportation); they were individually fed assorted types of feed at 1 kg/head. Water
was always in free supply. Travel breaks were taken for about 15 to 30 min every 4 hr, and
the insides of the trucks were ventilated at every break. After transportation, all horses
were subjected to training for 7 days.</p><p><italic>Clinical examination and hematologic analysis</italic>: Before, during and after
transportation, the horses were also examined by ocular inspection and palpation for the
presence of any locomotive or digestive system signs associated with the medication (MRFX,
ERFX or saline). Rectal temperature was taken with a mercury thermometer just before and
just after transportation and at one day after arrival. Horses with an elevated rectal
temperature after transportation were treated with an antimicrobial agent based on the
judgment of veterinarians with abundant experience in horse transportation; thier judgments
were based on evaluation of the degree of rectal temperature elevation and the clinical
manifestations of the horses. In accordance with the clinical signs, horses were given a
penicillin&#x02013;streptomycin combination (Mycillin, Meiji) at penicillin 8,000 U/kg and
streptomycin 10 mg/kg, IM, every 24 hr, or cephalothin sodium (Coaxin, Chemix, Yokohama,
Japan) at 20 mg/kg, IV, every 8 hr, to treat fever associated with transportation. The
penicillin&#x02013;streptomycin combination and cephalothin sodium were selected in accordance with
the susceptibility of the bacteria typically isolated from lower respiratory infections in
horses [<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In addition, a penicillin&#x02013;streptomycin combination is authorized and used at
this dose routinely and widely in Japan. Horses with temperatures above 38.5&#x000b0;C were
administered one of these 2 antimicrobial agents as follows: horses that lacked systemic or
respiratory symptoms received the penicillin-streptomycin combination; animals exhibiting
depression, respiratory symptoms such as coughs or signs by ocular inspection received
cephalothin sodium.</p><p>Blood samples were collected from the jugular veins of the animals in plain blood
collection tubes (VP-P100K, Terumo, Tokyo, Japan) or tubes containing EDTA (VC-C50, Terumo).
The EDTA blood was used to measure the peripheral white blood cell (WBC) count and
hemoglobin (Hgb) concentration by automatic hemocytometer (K-4500, Sysmex, Kobe, Japan). The
EDTA blood also was used to measure packed cell volume (PCV) with a hematocrit capillary
tube and to calculate the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (N/L ratio) after preparation of
smears by a fixation method (Diff-Quick 16920, Sysmex). For horses in the MRFX and control
groups, two hundred cells per representative area were counted, and the N/L ratio was
calculated.</p><p>Sera were isolated from the samples collected in plain blood collection tubes following
clotting and centrifugation (2,000 &#x000d7; <italic>g</italic>, 10 min, 25&#x000b0;C). The serum amyloid A
(SAA) concentration was measured by the latex agglomeration method (LZ test &#x0201c;Eiken&#x0201d; SAA;
Eiken Chemical, Tokyo, Japan) using equine standard sera with SAA concentrations ranging
from 0.0 to 400.0 <italic>&#x000b5;</italic>g/m<italic>l</italic>; these standards were produced by
methods described in previous reports [<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p><italic>Statistical analysis</italic>: Data are expressed as the mean &#x000b1; SD. For the N/L
ratios, a Mann-Whitney U-test was used to compare the control and MRFX groups. For other
values, variances were evaluated via the Bartlett test. Homogeneous data were subjected to
the one-factor ANOVA. Nonhomogeneous data were subjected to a nonparametric test
(Kruskal-Wallis). All analyses were upper tailed. Values of <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05 were
considered significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><p>No side effects, including locomotive or digestive system signs, were associated with the

synthesis in articular cartilage [<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. MRFX, another member of the same class of new
quinolone antibiotics, may also have adverse effects on articular cartilage in immature
animals. However, the reports on the toxicity of the new quinolone antibiotics were obtained
from <italic>in vitro</italic> studies that used high doses of these agents, and there have
been, to our knowledge, no reports of side effects at the usual dose range <italic>in
vivo</italic> [<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In the present study, no side
effects, including signs for the locomotive and digestive systems, were observed before,
during or after transportation in animals administered MRFX. Therefore, we surmise that MRFX
is safe for intravenous administration (at 2 mg/kg) just before transportation in young
racehorses.</p><p>After transportation, the N/L ratios and SAA concentrations in the peripheral blood were
significantly lower in the MRFX group than in the control group. Also, SAA was significantly
lower in the ERFX group than in the control group. In the ERFX group, we did not calculate
the N/L ratio, because we confirmed a significant difference between the ERFX group and the
control group in our previous study [<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In the MRFX
and ERFX groups, the number of febrile horses was lower than in the control group, and the
clinical signs were slight; the rectal temperatures of the febrile horses in the MRFX and
ERFX groups recovered to essentially normal values following a single dose of the
penicillin&#x02013;streptomycin combination.</p><p>In a previous study, it was thought that transport adversely affected the normally
effective mucosal defence mechanism (e.g., ciliary motility) in the airways, leading to
invasion by <italic>S. zooepidemicus </italic>(a common commensal microorganism in the
equine tonsil and nasopharynx) into the lower airways, thus inducing acute lower airway
inflammation in the affected horses [<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The present
study suggests that administration of MRFX just before transportation markedly reduces the
number of <italic>S. zooepidemicus</italic> in and of itself and that as a result, it
relieves the invasion by <italic>S. zooepidemicus</italic>.</p><p>Once horses have a transportation-associated fever, treatment for several days is required
[<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Although we transported the horses so that
they could be used for horse racing, febrile horses cannot run. This situation results in
large economic losses. In a previous study in which enrofloxacin was administered just after
transportation, the results showed that the duration of treatment was several days [<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Therefore, administration of marbofloxacin just before
transportation is useful as a prophylactic measure.</p><p>A previous study tested the efficacy of IFN-&#x003b1; administration before transportation of
racehorses [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. That study showed that although IFN-&#x003b1;
did not decrease the incidence of fever associated with transportation, IFN-&#x003b1; significantly
reduced inflammation and improved the clinical conditions of horses compared with those of
control horses [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In the present study, we
prophylactically treated all the test horses with IFN-&#x003b1; at a dose similar to that used in
the previous report [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], but we found significant
differences in the numbers of horses with fever and in the results of the hematologic
analysis after transportation. These findings clearly indicate that administration of MRFX
or ERFX just before transportation along with IFN-&#x003b1; can prevent fever associated with
transportation more effectively than IFN-&#x003b1; alone.</p><p>In our study, administration of MRFX (2 mg/kg) just before transportation was significantly
more effective than saline in protecting against fever associated with transportation; the
efficacy was similar to that seen with ERFX at 5 mg/kg [<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Furthermore, because of
the low tissue invasiveness, MRFX seemed more useful than ERFX. However, the administration
of new quinolone antibiotics, such as MRFX, raises the concern of the potential emergence of
resistant bacteria, and the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries
restricts its use. We selected new quinolone antibiotics, because <italic>S.
zooepidemicus</italic> is sensitive to them and their antibacterial activity lasts 24 hr
or more, but their use should be limited. The route of administration should be intravenous
to minimize the adverse effect on enteral bacteria. Furthermore, we have created a new
guideline for use within our racehorse medical office (JRA). Specifically, MRFX is to be
used only at transportation and only for long periods of transportation (projected to exceed
20 hr); furthermore, it is to be used for animals that have previously developed shipping
fever or animals with an elevated risk of developing shipping fever (e.g., horses with a
history of laryngoplasty or pneumonia). Additionally, antimicrobial susceptibility tests for
the post-transportation flora from tracheobronchial aspirate and feces will be performed
regularly in the future to monitor for the emergence of resistant bacteria. Also, the
antibiotics should ultimately be used after having taken all other steps for fever
prophylaxis including ventilation of the vehicle.</p><p>In conclusion, it was thought that administration of MRFX (along with IFN-&#x003b1;) just before
transportation in healthy Thoroughbreds is worth studying further for efficacy in preventing
horse fever associated with transportation. This regimen has advantages over the similar use
of ERFX, but will require a sufficient level of caution to preclude the potential
development of antimicrobial resistance. Also, studies concerning preventive administration
of agents such as agents that activate immunity other than antibiotics are expected.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Akai</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name><name><surname>Hobo</surname><given-names>S.</given-names></name><name><surname>Wada</surname><given-names>S.</given-names></name></person-group><year>2008</year>. <article-title>Effect of low-dose human interferon-alpha
