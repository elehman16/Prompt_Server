Advances in the cataract surgical procedure and IOL design have significantly reduced the PCO rate. Effective hydrodissection, cortical removal, sealed capsular irrigation, square edge optics of the IOL, and ultraviolet treatment of lens epithelial cells (LECs) are a few methods to prevent PCO. Trypan blue is a vital dye that has been shown to reduce the density and viability of LECs when used on the outer surface of the anterior capsule.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Sharma and Panwarinjected trypan blue into the capsular bag after hydrodissection and studied the PCO rate in a follow-up period of 1 year.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] The long-term results of the effect of trypan blue dye on preventing PCO are not available in the literature.</p><p>The purpose of the present study was to report the effect of trypan blue dye irrigation on the causative factor of PCO, i.e., LECs in a follow-up period of 3 years. Trypan blue was injected into the capsular bag after cortical wash under air.

Patients with operable cataracts at our outpatient department of Government Medical College who were willing to undergo bilateral cataract surgery in the near future (duration of 1 month) were included in the study. The exclusion criteria were glaucoma, pseudoexfoliation, uveitis, previous intraocular surgeries, subluxated cataracts, diabetes, trauma, monocular vision, poor pupillary dilation, and an age &#x0003c;40 years. The intraoperative exclusion criteria were preexisting posterior capsular opacity or plaque and posterior capsular rent. Preoperative assessment included the best-corrected visual acuity, slit-lamp examination, intraocular pressure, retinal evaluation, and A-scan biometry for IOL power calculation.</p><p>One eye of each patient was randomized to one of two groups. The simple randomization method by toss method was used. Heads were assigned to the intervention group (dye group) and tails to the control group (BSS group). The dye group received 0.2 ml of trypan blue (0.06%) injected in the capsular bag after cortical cleanup under air. The control group (other eye of the same patient) received 0.2 ml of BSS injected in a similar manner.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Surgical technique</title><p>A single surgeon (R.J.) performed all the surgeries. Preoperative dilatation of the pupil was achieved using a combination of 0.8% tropicamide and 5% phenylephrine. Patients underwent operations with 0.5% topical proparacaine hydrochloride drops instilled twice 10 min before the surgical procedure and supplemented by a 0.5 ml subconjunctival injection of 2% lignocaine hydrochloride at the beginning of surgery. A 20-gauge side port incision was created on the appropriate side, as required. Viscoelastic material (2% hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, Appavisc, Appasamy Ocular Devices, Puducherry, India) was injected through the side port with a 23-gauge blunt tip cannula. A 2.8 mm clear corneal temporal incision was made. Continuous curvilinear capsulorhexis (CCC) was completed using capsulorhexis forceps under viscoelastic pressure. The size of the rhexis was kept at approximately 5.5 mm. Hydrodissection was performed with BSS. The nucleus was managed using the direct chop method. The settings for the nucleus chop were power 90% (linear), vacuum 350 mmHg, and aspiration flow rate 34 cc/min. The parameters were the same for all cases and were not changed until the last fragment was emulsified. Phacoemulsification was performed in the capsular bag. Thorough cortical cleanup was accomplished with an irrigation and aspiration probe. In the dye group, 0.2 ml of trypan blue dye (Marketed by BLUE DYE, Indoco remedies limited, Mumbai, India; Manufactured by Care group, India) was injected under air through the two side ports (0.1 ml each), which were 180 degrees apart. A period of 45 s was allowed for the diffusion of the dye in the bag. The dye was then washed with irrigation and aspiration [<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Video 1</xref>]. Viscoelastic material was injected into the anterior chamber (AC). A single-piece hydrophilic lens (6-mm optic diameter, overall length 12.5 mm, biconvex optic design, and square edge) was implanted in the capsular bag (Acryfold, Appasamy Ocular Devices, Puducherry, India). A thorough AC wash was used to clear viscoelastic material. Stromal hydration of the side port and main incision was completed with BSS. In the control group, all steps were the same except; in place of trypan blue, 0.2 ml of BSS was injected under the air.</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><media mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mp4" xlink:href="IJO-65-1440-v001.mp4" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e170" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Postoperative follow-up period</title><p>Patients were followed at 1 and 7 days and at 1, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months. The corrected distance visual acuity and slit-lamp examination were evaluated at every visit. PCO was assessed by an independent observer. Central 3 mm area of IOL optic was considered for the evaluation of PCO (EPCO). Retroillumination slit-lamp images (Imaging system-990 5X Elite, CSO, Italy) were obtained at 6, 12, 24, and 36 months&#x02019; visits after full mydriasis. Images were imported into the EPCO software computer analysis system. The data about the diameter of IOL and the central 3 mm diameter area were entered in the software. Capsulorhexis margin was defined.

It has been demonstrated that PCO is caused by proliferation, migration, and the epithelial&#x02013;mesenchymal transition of LECs present in the equatorial area of the capsular bag.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>There have been efforts to reduce the incidence of PCO by various means.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Use of trypan blue dye is one approach.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Trypan blue dye selectively stains the basement membrane.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] It is used to stain the anterior capsule for creating CCC in patients with white or dense cataracts. It has no known toxicity at the concentration approved by the Food and Drug Administration, USA.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] An <italic>in vitro</italic> study has shown that trypan blue has little toxicity for LECs irrespective of the dye concentration.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] However, an <italic>in vivo</italic> study has shown decreased density and viability of LECs when the dye was used at a concentration of 0.0125% to stain the anterior capsule.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] The concentration of dye used in our study was 0.06%. This dye concentration has been approved by the FDA, USA. Sharma and Panwar in their study on the initial postoperative PCO results used 0.1% dye that was subcapsularly injected after cortical cleaving hydrodissection.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] We injected the dye into the capsular bag under air after a thorough cortical wash. This is the reason for keeping the dye concentration 0.06%. The advantage of injecting the dye under air is that the dye diffuses in the capsular bag so that it reaches the LECs at a sufficient concentration. As the air bubble was occupying the entire AC covering the side port and the main incision, gentle placement of the cannula at the side port was sufficient to inject the dye. In the event of a shallow AC due to leakage of an air bubble, one needs to exit the AC and inject an air bubble again. Another advantage was it did not stain the endothelium. Due to nonavailability of specular microscope in the setup, we could not measure corneal endothelial cell count before and after the surgical procedure. However, long-term study by Norn has shown that trypan blue dye does not cause endothelial damage.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] An exposure period of 45 s was allowed for the diffusion of dye into the capsular bag. Period of 45 s was decided as the concentration of dye used was 0.06%, compared to 0.1% by Sharma and Panwar.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Care was taken not to damage the iris and posterior capsule during dye injection. Trypan blue dye has been used to stain the posterior capsule when performing posterior capsulorhexis.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] An exposure time of 30 s was allowed to pass for the staining of the posterior capsule. We had two options for the injection of dye into the capsular bag. One option was air, and another was under viscoelastic. A pilot study performed by us on the injection of dye under viscoelastic did not cause diffusion of dye in the capsular bag. The dye remained in the AC mixed with viscoelastic material. The injection of dye beneath the viscoelastic was risky as one needs to be closer to the posterior capsule for the injection. Therefore, we choose the technique of injecting dye under air.</p><p>The injection of dye under air did cause posterior capsular or IOL staining. Postoperative follow-up showed staining of the posterior capsule in two eyes and an IOL stain in one eye. Staining took two days to clear. Permanent staining of hydrogel lenses has been reported at a dye concentration of 0.1%.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] None of the patients had blue or dark vision during the follow-up period. No other dye-related complications were seen in any of the patients.</p><p>The long-term results of the injection of dye to prevent PCO are not available in the literature. Our study shows that the PCO score at 6 months is significantly lower in the dye group than in the control group. However, from 6 months onward, there were no significant differences in the PCO scores between the two groups. Sharma and Panwar, in their study on PCO prevention by trypan blue dye, have shown that the PCO scores at 6 and 12 months were significantly lower in the dye group than in the control group.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] The concentration of dye used in their study was 0.1% compared with 0.06% in our study.</p><p>They have also shown that at the end of 12 months, 2 eyes in the trypan blue group and 6 eyes in the control group required Nd: YAG laser capsulotomy for significant central PCO.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] In our study, at the end of 36 months, 8 eyes (16%) in the dye group and 7 eyes (14%) in the control group required YAG capsulotomy for significant PCO (<italic>P</italic> = 0.21), causing decreased visual acuity. Drop in the visual acuity of 2-Snellen's line was considered for the ND: YAG capsulotomy. This finding suggests that the dye might have no permanent toxicity effect on the LECs. It also indicates that a single dose of the dye might not permanently prevent PCO formation. Using a high concentration of dye in the capsular bag for a long contact period may prevent PCO formation. However, the deleterious effects of the dye on the AC structures and endothelium cannot be denied. What concentration of the dye and length of time of contact are ideal for preventing PCO merits further research.</p><p>Hydrophilic IOL has a high PCO rate compared with hydrophobic IOL.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Hydrophobic implantation would have defeated the purpose of this study. Therefore, we preferred the hydrophilic IOL in our study. On the contrary, the use of dye in patients undergoing hydrophobic IOL implantation would have delayed PCO formation in these lenses. The present study was carried out in a rural setup. Cost was a limiting factor to use hydrophobic lenses.</p><p>One patient in the dye group (2%) and two patients (4%) in the control group had partial optic cover of the anterior capsule. Partial overlap of the rim of anterior capsule over the optic of IOL leads to incomplete capsular bend formation creating a gap between optic of IOL and posterior capsule through which LECs migrate over the posterior capsule causing PCO.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Vasavada <italic>et al</italic>. have shown no significant difference in the development of PCO in patients with partial versus total optic cover of anterior capsule 5 years postoperative in patients implanted with single-piece hydrophobic IOL.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] In our study, hydrophilic IOL with square edge was used.
