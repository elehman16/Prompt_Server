The conditions share an immune-mediated pathophysiological process but the clinical features may vary between conditions. Guillain-Barr&#x000e9; syndrome (GBS) is an acute inflammatory polyneuropathy, characterised by rapidly progressive weakness, paralysis and sensory impairment reaching nadir within four weeks of onset [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] such that the majority of patients are unable to walk independently when maximum weakness is reached [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Prompt immunomodulatory treatment facilitates earlier recovery that is generally good; with the majority of patients regaining mobility within six to twelve months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] although residual problems are common and improvements may continue beyond this period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) shares many characteristics with GBS but presents a progressive or relapsing clinical course [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. There are a number of first-line, combination and supportive treatments available for CIDP, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and whilst many patients experience long-term improvement, prognosis is variable and a significant proportion experience ongoing problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. A related condition, paraproteinaemic demyelinating neuropathy (PDN), is characterised by an IgM monoclonal gammopathy with, in about 50&#x000a0;% of cases, serum antibodies to myelin associated glycoprotein. PDN typically presents at an older age than GBS and CIDP, with most cases presenting in the sixth decade or later and symptoms appear similar to CIDP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Despite differences in the initial presentation and time course of GBS, CIDP and PDN, the symptoms experienced by patients and the impact of them on their daily lives are similar.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Study design flowchart. Flowchart depicting the process of recruitment, randomisation, data collection and data analysis throughout the trial</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12883_2015_398_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p>At least a third of people with IN experience long term activity limitation. Residual symptoms may still be present many years after recovery from GBS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and CIDP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. One ten year follow-up study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] showed that 14&#x000a0;% of participants with GBS still had moderate to severe disability and a further 50&#x000a0;% had more minor symptoms, suggesting that residual disability may be life-long. Fatigue is also a very common consequence of IN with between 40 &#x02013; 80&#x000a0;% of people reporting it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. It is often associated with reduced quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and greater activity limitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>Persistent disability or fatigue experienced by people with IN adversely affects their working and daily lives, including family and social activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Many people with IN need long-term informal care, often supplemented by support from health and social services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. People with IN are high users of services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and the personal suffering, as well as health and social care expenditure, increases as people live longer. Therefore, the potential for cost effective self-management programmes aimed at improving disability, mood, societal participation and quality of life should be evaluated.</p><p>There is currently no standardised care for patients with ongoing activity limitation and participation restriction as a result of IN. A systematic review of the efficacy of exercise on disability in IN concluded that the current evidence is of poor quality, although progressive resisted strengthening exercise may moderately improve muscle strength [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. However, observational studies show that supervised aerobic-cycling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] or unsupervised physiotherapist prescribed community based aerobic and strengthening exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] are associated with an improvement in function, fatigue and quality of life in people with IN. Further, one randomised controlled trial showed that high intensity multi-disciplinary rehabilitation that incorporated physiotherapy for strengthening, endurance and gait training was superior to low-intensity rehabilitation in improving disability in people with GBS several years after recovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Therefore exercise may be beneficial in improving activity limitation after IN and tailoring the intervention for participants following physiotherapy assessment and incorporating patient preference for type and location of aerobic and strengthening exercise may be important [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p>A tailored approach to exercise prescription based on our pilot study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] has been developed for the current study in light of social cognition theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The theory suggests that behaviour is determined by the interaction of current and previous behaviour, social, environmental and cognitive factors such as social support, observational learning or modelling, outcome expectations, self-efficacy, goal setting and self-regulation.</p><p>Thus, the current pragmatic randomised controlled trial (RCT) includes a process evaluation that is underpinned by the transtheoretical model (TTM) for behaviour change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The TTM has been shown to be useful in understanding and predicting behaviour change across a range of health behaviours including physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The model proposes a temporal dimension of stages of change (SoC) to describe the sequential change in health related behaviours. The five stages of change are: pre-contemplation, contemplation, preparation, action and maintenance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The model assumes that the likelihood for behavioural change will be dependent on the stage of change at which individuals are currently at and that progress through the stages may be complex. Factors such as self-efficacy and decisional balance (the relative pros and cons of behaviour change) have been consistently shown to increase in a linear fashion alongside this progression through stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], suggesting various potential factors to be targeted for intervention.</p><p>In order to evaluate the potential role of home exercise for the management of IN, the current RCT will therefore assess the effectiveness, cost effectiveness and cost utility of a tHEP versus advice about exercise and usual care (UC) in a sample of adults with stable IN in the UK.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Objectives and hypotheses</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Principal research question</title><p>Is a tailored home exercise programme more effective in reducing disability (activity limitation) than advice about exercise and usual care in people with stable inflammatory immune-mediated neuropathy?</p><p>Primary hypothesis - a tailored home exercise programme will be more beneficial than advice about exercise and usual care in reducing activity limitation for people with IN.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Secondary research questions</title><p>What is the cost-effectiveness and cost utility of a tHEP compared with advice about exercise and usual care for people with IN?</p><p>Are the health beliefs of people with IN associated with their response to a tHEP versus advice about exercise and usual care?</p><p>What are participants&#x02019; experiences of a tHEP and which factors influence uptake of and adherence to the programme?</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec5" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec6"><title>Design</title><p>The study is a pragmatic, prospective, parallel observer blind, RCT to evaluate the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of a twelve week tHEP versus advice and usual care.

Potential participants from clinics will be approached by either their doctor or a member of the research team (with the prior consent of the patient&#x02019;s doctor) and provided with information about the study. Alternatively, they will be sent an invitation letter and information sheet through the post. In both cases, participants will be offered the opportunity to discuss the project and ask questions. Signed consent forms will be returned directly to the research team if they decide to take part, either in person at the clinic, or via the post once the participant has returned home. Potential participants who access GAIN publications will be approached by advertisements on their website and newsletters. Potential participants will contact the research team directly to receive information sheets and to discuss the study prior to consenting to take part.</p><p>All potential participants will be screened for compliance with the study inclusion criteria (below) and their diagnosis, IVIg therapy and fitness to participate will be confirmed with their GP or neurologist, with their consent.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Inclusion/exclusion criteria</title><p>Participants will be included if they fulfil the following criteria:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>They are adults with stable motor neuropathy, with or without sensory neuropathy, as a result of GBS, CIDP or PDN diagnosed using established criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] (and where PDN is defined as the combination of demyelinating neuropathy, serum antibodies to myelin associated glycoprotein, and an IgM monoclonal gammopathy with no evidence of haematological malignancy)</p></list-item><list-item><p>They are able to walk 10&#x000a0;m, with or without walking aids</p></list-item><list-item><p>They are at least one year since onset if they have GBS</p></list-item><list-item><p>They have had no change in self-reported disability, immunotherapy or medication for neuropathic pain in the previous six months (excepting medication dose of azathioprine, which must not have changed for twelve months).

Fifty-four people (27 per group) will be needed&#x0037e; therefore 70 people will be recruited to allow for a 25&#x000a0;% attrition rate at twelve months. The ODSS is a pre-cursor of the ONLS and was used for sample size calculation as this was the recommended outcome measure of disability in IN at the time of the pilot study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Randomisation and allocation concealment</title><p>Participants will be allocated into either the treatment or control group using randomisation with computerised block minimisation to stratify for severity based on baseline ONLS score (mild&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;3, moderate/severe&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;4) and recruitment site to ensure even distribution between groups. Participants will also be stratified by IVIg treatment (yes/no) to minimise the likelihood that small numbers of participants receiving this expensive therapy may skew the cost-effectiveness analysis if not controlled for across the groups. Randomisation will be conducted by the King&#x02019;s College London Clinical Trials Unit to ensure both the validity and balance of the randomisation and support the successful blinding of the outcome assessor for the intervention duration. Once allocation has taken place, the outcome observer will receive a blinded email confirming the participant number, and the research physiotherapist will receive an un-blinded email confirming participant number and allocation. In order to maintain observer blindness throughout the study period, participants will be requested not to discuss the intervention with the outcome assessor.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Interventions</title><sec id="Sec12"><title>Control group</title><p>Participants allocated to the control group will receive by post a letter advising them that they have been allocated to the information and advice group and including the UK Physical Activity Guidelines factsheet outlining the benefits of regular exercise and the recommended level of exercise for adults or older adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] and a copy of the Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire (PAR-Q) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. This group will not receive any contact with the study physiotherapist. They will receive any other usual medical care which may include pharmacological, physical or other therapy interventions deemed necessary by their doctor during the study period. Participants will be requested to try and avoid having additional physiotherapy for their IN during the study but treatment not directly related to their IN will not be restricted.</p><p>All referrals to other therapies and the specific interventions applied will be meticulously documented in both groups using the Client Service Receipt Inventory (CSRI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Data will include service utilisation in the preceding month (home-help, personal and informal care etc.) and less regularly used services in the preceding twelve months (General Practitioner (GP) visits, hospital admission etc.). Informal care and financial costs borne by carers will also be estimated and recorded.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Intervention group</title><p>In addition to usual care (as characterised above) the intervention group will be prescribed tHEP by the study physiotherapist. Participants will undergo a clinical interview and objective evaluation of their symptoms, activity limitations and any underlying impairments likely to affect their ability to exercise. In addition, in order to foster uptake and adherence to exercise behaviour, the therapist will ask participants to identify their preferences for exercise type and location and any factors that they feel may affect their willingness or ability to carry out a tHEP and how these may be overcome. This information will be used to facilitate the development of individualised exercise programmes tailored to take account of participants SoC and personal beliefs and that include physical activity and exercise goals identified by participants. Based on this assessment, the physiotherapist will prescribe a tailored progressive programme of aerobic and three strengthening exercises. Demonstration and practice of each exercise will ensure participants are carrying them out effectively, safely and with the confidence to continue exercising alone. Participants will be asked to continue the programme by themselves at home for twelve weeks. The therapist will advise participants on how and when to progress their exercises and this will be reinforced in follow-up telephone calls.</p><p>Aerobic exercise prescription will be informed by previous neurological exercise interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], evidence based exercise guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] and participant preference. The dosage of exercise prescribed will be based on the recommendations of the UK Activity Guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Thus participants will be encouraged to gradually build up to at least the minimum recommended guideline amount of 150&#x000a0;min of moderate exercise a week. Moderate intensity exercise such as brisk walking or cycling should make adults feel as if they are breathing harder and their heart is beating faster but that they are still able to carry on a conversation. Participants will be taught how to use the Category Ratio 10 scale (CR-10) for rating of perceived exertion (RPE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] to evaluate exercise intensity where moderate intensity is graded at CR-10 grade 4.</p><p>Participants already meeting the guidelines at a moderate level, or those participants who build up to this level during the intervention period will be encouraged to set goals to either increase the exercise duration or to increase the intensity of exercise to a vigorous level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Vigorous intensity exercise such as running or sporting activity, will make adults feel they are breathing much harder, their hearts are beating rapidly and they will find it more difficult to carry on a conversation. This intensity of exercise is graded 7 on the CR-10 of RPE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].</p><p>Each participant will also be prescribed three strengthening exercises that target weak muscles, chosen from a standardised menu of strengthening exercises compiled by the study physiotherapist and informed by the literature and evidence based exercise guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Each exercise, and any modifications or progressions, is facilitated by an exercise sheet supplied to the participant, with written and pictorial instructions based on those available on the peer reviewed website <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.physiotherapyexercises.com">www.physiotherapyexercises.com</ext-link> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. In order to standardise exercise intensity participants will be advised to perform strengthening exercises at a RPE of 7&#x02013;10 on the CR-10 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] with the goal of achieving 3 sets of 8&#x02013;10 repetitions of each exercise prior to progression. Altering starting position may be used to eliminate or increase the influence of gravity on muscle activity and adding external resistance such as weighted bands or elastic resistance bands, may be used to increase the intensity of exercise as required. Examples of exercises include: heel raises in standing, squats and knee extension in sitting using weighted ankle bands.</p><p>Participants in the treatment group will receive a minimum of three follow-up telephone calls from the physiotherapist during the twelve week intervention period. The physiotherapist will use the calls to encourage and monitor adherence, discuss any adaptations or progressions to exercises and to review goals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Participants will be asked to complete a daily exercise diary to monitor their adherence to the programme and to record any adverse events or barriers to exercise they encounter.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Adverse event reporting</title><p>Participants in both groups will be asked to contact either the principal investigator or research physiotherapist if they experience any adverse events during the study/intervention period. All events will be recorded and reviewed by the principal investigator and the participant&#x02019;s GP informed if appropriate. Serious adverse events will be referred to the study sponsor and a monitoring group will be convened in order to review the event and ongoing trial safety. Adverse events will be included as a secondary outcome of the study.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Outcome assessment</title><sec id="Sec16"><title>Primary outcome</title><p><italic>Activity limitation</italic> will be assessed using the recently validated Rasch based Overall Disability Scale (RODS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>].

The scale consists of separate anxiety and depression subscales of seven items each and has been found to correlate well with other measures of depression and anxiety.</p><p><italic>Functional health and well being</italic> will be assessed using the Medical Outcomes Short Form 12 (SF-12). The norms-based scoring system allows direct data comparisons to be made between the SF-12 and other generic health surveys [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>].</p><p><italic>Levels of physical activity</italic> will be assessed using the 7-question International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ-short). The questions ask participants to report the frequency and duration of moderate activity, vigorous activity and walking, and to rate the proportion of time they spent sedentary in the previous week. The scale has shown acceptable measurement properties, similar to other self-report assessments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>].</p><p><italic>Health beliefs</italic> will be assessed using the Brief Illness Perceptions Questionnaire (Brief-IPQ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>] developed from the revised Illness Perceptions Questionnaire (IPQ-R) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. Nine questions address participants beliefs with regard to various features such as perceived severity of consequences, perceived chronicity of an illness or condition, and perceived control over the course or treatment of a given condition. Participants respond on an eleven point Likert scale (for example, 0&#x02009;=&#x02009;no symptoms at all, 10&#x02009;=&#x02009;many severe symptoms).</p><p><italic>Self-efficacy;</italic> an individuals confidence in their ability to exercise, will be measured using the self-efficacy for exercise (SEE) scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. The scale examines 9 potential barriers to exercise, such as feeling tired or depressed; participants are asked to rate each item on an eleven point Likert scale spanning the extent to which they feel confident that they could exercise in the presence of a particular barrier (0&#x02009;=&#x02009;Not confident, 10&#x02009;=&#x02009;Very confident). The authors report good internal consistency (alpha 0.92) and good predictive validity for the scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>].</p><p><italic>Adherence</italic> to the tailored home exercise programme in the study will be evaluated using a) the Exercise Adherence Rating Scale (EARS) and b) self-report diary entries.<list list-type="alpha-lower"><list-item><p>The EARS has been developed based on the Medication Adherence Rating Scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>] and evaluates barriers to adherence for prescribed exercise by asking participants to rate, on a five-point Likert scale, the extent to which they agree with sixteen statements about their exercise adherence (for example, &#x0201c;I forget to do my exercises&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;I&#x02019;m not sure how to do my exercises&#x0201d;). The EARS will only be completed by participants randomised to the tHEP intervention.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Self-report exercise diaries record exercise type, completion and factors affecting exercise.

The questionnaire records the interviewee&#x02019;s use of health and social care services, accommodation and living situation, income, employment and benefits. Service use data are combined with appropriate unit costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>] to generate total care costs per patient. Lost employment will be valued using average wage rates.</p><p>The EQ-5D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>] is a brief scale designed to measure health related quality of life across five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. For each domain participants are asked to rate their current health using a five point scale to describe the extent to which they can perform activities (&#x0201c;No problems&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;Unable to perform&#x0201d;). The scale also includes a visual analogue scale on which participants mark their current health status between 0 (worst health they can imagine) and 100 (best health they can imagine). Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) will be derived from the EQ-5D scores for the cost-utility analysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Qualitative assessment of intervention acceptability</title><p>A purposive sub-sample of 8&#x02013;10 participants from the tHEP group and up to 5 from the usual care group will be invited to attend a semi-structured interview following completion of their twelve month follow-up to evaluate participants&#x02019; experiences. Participants in the tHEP group will be asked about their experience of the tHEP and the factors that facilitate and impede adherence to it. Participants in the usual care group will be asked whether the advice they received prompted any change in exercise or physical activity behaviour and about their experience of exercise. The interviews will be recorded, transcribed and undergo thematic analysis to explore themes within the data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Data analysis</title><sec id="Sec21"><title>Efficacy of intervention</title><p>For our primary outcome of activity limitation (RODS) we will adjust for baseline score. For all other outcomes, we will adjust for the severity stratification group using ONLS baseline score, but not for the IVIg stratification group as the likely low numbers will lead to an unstable model.</p><p>Intention to treat analysis will be our primary model for efficacy analysis. We will conduct a linear regression of change from baseline to the twelve month follow up and add in both intervention arm and baseline score. A secondary analysis will examine changes between baseline and 12&#x000a0;week follow up. Complete case analysis is most often used but not ideal in this study as we have small numbers. If we have some missing data at twelve month follow up we can attempt to extrapolate based on the data from participants with complete datasets if there is less than 25&#x000a0;% missing data.</p><p>Per protocol analysis: If we can identify a suitable cut-off from our measure of adherence we can also run a per protocol analysis by removing those participants from the dataset who did not complete enough of the exercise intervention to be able to show an effect. However, due to low numbers we do not wish to put the analysis at risk by excluding too many.</p><p>We will also run an exploratory secondary subgroup analysis of the self-efficacy data in order to see whether self-efficacy influences the efficacy of the intervention. A high/low score threshold will be identified for this purpose.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses</title><p>Costs generated from the CSRI will be added to costs of the intervention. These will be derived from information on staff time involved in delivering the intervention and other non-staff costs. The endpoint for the economic analysis will be twelve months when, if costs are lower in the exercise group and outcome better, then the exercise intervention will have been cost-effective. However, if costs are higher and outcomes better then we will construct cost-effectiveness acceptability curves to show the probability that the intervention is cost-effective for different values placed on a change in outcome. Cost-utility analyses will be conducted in a similar way, but will use QALYs as the outcome measure. Uncertainty around the results will be explored using cost-effectiveness planes and acceptability curves.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Participant experience and factors influencing adherence</title><p>Data from transcriptions of semi-structured interviews will be analysed thematically to identify common themes and connections between themes.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec24" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This is the first randomised controlled trial to compare the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of a tHEP with advice about exercise and usual care in IN.
