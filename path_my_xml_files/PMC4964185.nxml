This study aims to assess the feasibility of conducting a randomised controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the effectiveness of individual placement and support (IPS), in improving employment rates and associated psychosocial outcomes in forensic psychiatric populations. IPS has been found consistently to achieve employment rates above 50% in psychiatric patients without a history of involvement in criminal justice services.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>This is a single-centre feasibility cluster RCT. Clusters will be defined according to clinical services in the community forensic services of Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust (NHCT). IPS will be implemented into 2 of the randomly assigned intervention clusters in the community forensic services of NHCT. A feasibility cluster RCT will estimate the parameters required to design a full RCT. The primary outcome is the proportion of people in open employment at 12-month follow-up. Secondary outcome measures will include employment, educational activities, psychosocial and economic outcomes, as well as reoffending rates. Outcome measures will be recorded at baseline, 6&#x02005;months and 12&#x02005;months. In accordance with the UK Medical Research Council guidelines on the evaluation of complex interventions, a process evaluation will be carried out; qualitative interviews with patients and staff will explore general views of IPS as well as barriers and facilitators to implementation. Fidelity reviews will assess the extent to which the services follow the principles of IPS prior, during and at the end of the trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>Ethical approval was obtained from the East Midlands Research Ethics Committee-Nottingham 1 (REC reference number 15/EM/0253).

<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> and can enhance a person's self-esteem and inspire optimism.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p><p>People with severe mental disorders have far higher rates of unemployment when compared with the general population<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> and are more likely to be unemployed compared with the general disabled population.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Recent Department for Work and Pensions&#x02019; (DWP) figures show that 6.5 million working-age people in the UK are classified as disabled under the Equality Act 2010 because they have a physical or mental condition that affects their ability to carry out daily activities.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> However, many of these people can work and the employment aspirations of many remain unfulfilled. Use of supported employment, to help with this issue, has been consistently advocated in public policy.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><p>Furthermore, employment rates for offenders are also worryingly low, with the Ministry of Justice and DWP<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> reporting that 29% of prisoners found paid employment at some point in the 2&#x02005;years following their release and that only 15% were in paid employment 2&#x02005;years after their release. Government initiatives have also emphasised the importance of using work to reduce reoffending rates among offenders.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Offending history is further compounded by the fact that the prevalence of mental disorders among offenders is far greater than in the general population.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p><p>Offenders with mental disorders arguable fare worse in regards to employment partly due to the stigma attributed to their offending history and negative stereotypes of people with mental health problems on the part of employers and members of the public.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Complex personal and social problems, including homelessness, substance misuse, lack of relevant skills or qualifications and limited employment experience, make it even more difficult for them to secure employment.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p><p>There is strong evidence in favour of individual placement and support (IPS), a well-established form of supported employment, as the most effective approach to help people with severe mental disorders get back into employment.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13&#x02013;17</xref> IPS operates according to the following principles: (1) it aims to get people into competitive employment; (2) it is open to all those who want to work; (3) it tries to find jobs consistent with people's preferences; (4) it works quickly; (5) it brings employment specialists into clinical teams; (6) employment specialists develop relationships with employers based on a person's work preferences; (7) it provides time unlimited, individualised support for the person and their employer; and (8) benefits counselling is included.</p><p>The Cochrane review by Kinoshita <italic>et al</italic>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> including 14 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (2265 participants in total), showed that IPS significantly increased levels of employment and increased length of competitive employment for individuals with severe mental illness, when compared with other vocational approaches. Although the literature supports the effectiveness of IPS in generic mental healthcare settings, the evidence base for its effectiveness in forensic mental health settings is lacking.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> A paper commissioned by the Sainsbury Centre for Mental Health,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> which reviewed the literature on employment support for offenders with mental health problems, concluded that many principles of IPS, if suitably adapted, have the potential to help offenders with mental disorders gain employment. However, it is not known how best to adapt IPS to forensic mental health settings, and to the best of our knowledge, no empirical studies of IPS in UK community forensic mental health settings have been completed to date.</p><p>IPS can be regarded as a complex intervention as it involves a number of interacting components. Developing an evidence base for IPS in a forensic mental health setting adds to this complexity, since the management of mentally disordered offenders combines various treatment modalities to address mental health issues, offending behaviour and risk management.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Nevertheless, little attention, particularly in the health sector, is paid to supporting mentally disordered offenders into mainstream employment. It is the very complexities in the practice of forensic mental health, which make the implementation and evaluation of IPS a challenge; the present study is, therefore, needed to underpin robust future RCTs, so that this intervention, proven to be effective in adults with mental health problems, can be appraised for its potential to enable patients with offending histories to live more rewarding lives, reduce reoffending and minimise their dependency on formal services. It is hypothesised that the benefits of IPS found in adult mental health settings will be replicated to some degree in the forensic population. The proposed study will, therefore, bring benefits to patients, to the local service, to national forensic and mental health services and will inform commissioning and policymakers.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Aims and objectives</title><p>The overall aim of the study is to assess the feasibility of conducting a fully powered RCT to evaluate the effectiveness of IPS in improving employment rates and associated psychosocial outcomes in community forensic psychiatric populations.</p><p>The specific objectives of the study are as follows:

This study will, therefore, allocate 6&#x02005;months to embedding the IPS model within the intervention clusters. IPS will be embedded by bringing an employment specialist into the clinical teams, raising awareness about IPS within the organisation and forming links with IPS services within the local National Health Service (NHS) Trust, in addition to developing important links with employers and the DWP. This process of implementation is guided by prior work in adult mental health and led by a dedicated development team.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Feasibility study (24&#x02005;months)</title><sec id="s3b1"><title>Participants and study design</title><p>This study will recruit adult patients (male and female) who are over the age of 18 and who are currently on the caseload of the community forensic services. Patients who are unable to provide informed consent, who are not eligible to work in the UK, do not have an offending history, are currently in open employment or who do not wish to work will be excluded from this study.</p><p>This study employs a cluster RCT design.

Individuals will receive ongoing support from the employment specialist in accordance with the IPS principles. The employment specialist will work closely with patients assigned to IPS and begin job searches rapidly, based on their preferences. Colocation of the employment specialist within clinical teams will allow information about risks and past offending histories to be shared with employers (with patient's consent), health and criminal justice systems (for those concurrently under probation) and subsequently taken into consideration when matching job opportunities to individual preferences. The employment specialist will bridge the gap between the research team and the community forensic teams by virtue of being a member of both teams.</p><p>Group 2: Individuals assigned to the control group will not receive any IPS support but will continue to receive TAU from the community forensic services. TAU for patients who are part of the city or county forensic teams entails case management, where each individual is allocated a consultant and care coordinator. TAU for patients who are part of the City or County Personality Disorder teams will primarily be made up of therapy services providing specialised psychological interventions, including group therapy and attendance, at a therapeutic community. Neither groups are offered specialist employment support as part of TAU.</p></sec><sec id="s3b4"><title>Sample size</title><p>The sample size calculation was based on an assertion by Eldridge and Kerry<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> that, for samples of 75&#x02013;150 individuals, four clusters will be required to achieve reasonably precise 95% CI for intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC).

An IPS service that meets the criteria for fidelity will affect the clinical services and their personnel, as well as on the employers, with whom the service interacts. IPS fosters a culture of employability, and this is a virtuous circle: care coordinators, their managers, potential employers and commissioners grow in the conviction that anyone who wishes to work can, with suitable support, attain their ambition. Our study will provide commissioners with a full understanding of how IPS could be implemented in forensic mental health settings throughout the UK and will provide an insight into the structural-level, organisational-level, legal-level and individual-level barriers to the implementation of IPS in forensic mental health settings, in accordance with the policy climate. The proposed study is highly original and has the potential to improve the employment prospects of patients in community forensic mental health settings. By helping patients with offending histories to obtain competitive employment, they will hopefully enjoy many of the psychological and social benefits that working status entails, offering the possibility of cost savings, as people in employment reduce their use of the NHS and make progress towards greater economic independence and reduced reoffending.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The author thank Erick Wodke, Jo Russell and Karan Sahota for their expert guidance in relation to IPS implementation, and the members of the patient and public involvement group for their invaluable advice.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> NK and ET have drafted the first version of the manuscript.
