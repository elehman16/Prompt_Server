The proportion of patients who developed significant drug-related adverse event(s) (defined as a serious drug-related adverse event or a drug-related adverse event leading to study therapy discontinuation) was compared in 120 patients [caspofungin 50&#x000a0;mg, or 50&#x000a0;mg following a 70-mg loading dose on Day 1 (hereinafter, 70/50&#x000a0;mg) group: 60 patients; micafungin 150&#x000a0;mg: 60 patients]. The overall response rate was primarily evaluated in the per-protocol set (PPS) population. The proportion of patients who developed significant drug-related adverse events was 5.0&#x000a0;% (3/60) in the caspofungin group and 10.0&#x000a0;% (6/60) in the micafungin group [95&#x000a0;% confidence interval (CI) for the difference: &#x02212;15.9&#x000a0;%, 5.2&#x000a0;%]. The favorable overall response in the PPS population for patients with esophageal candidiasis, invasive candidiasis, and chronic pulmonary aspergillosis including aspergilloma was 100.0&#x000a0;% (6/6), 100.0&#x000a0;% (3/3), and 46.7&#x000a0;% (14/30) in the caspofungin group, and 83.3&#x000a0;% (5/6), 100.0&#x000a0;% (1/1), and 42.4&#x000a0;% (14/33) in the micafungin group, respectively.

A comparator-controlled study of caspofungin and micafungin conducted in patients with candidemia has been reported by Pappas et al. In this study, micafungin 100&#x000a0;mg or 150&#x000a0;mg once daily was shown to be effective (non-inferior) compared to caspofungin 50&#x000a0;mg daily following a 70-mg loading dose on Day 1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Additionally, in a cohort analysis, caspofungin and micafungin were compared as empirical therapy in patients with febrile neutropenia, with similar efficacy reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].

The study was conducted in 43 study sites in Japan from August 2008 through July 2010. The protocol was reviewed by the Institutional Review Board of each participating site, and written informed consent was obtained from each patient. The protocol was also registered on clinicaltrials.gov (NCT00717860). In this study, a serious drug-related adverse event or a drug-related adverse event leading to study therapy discontinuation was defined as significant drug-related adverse event(s). Definitions of adverse events and drug relationships, and the determination of seriousness basically complied with the &#x0201c;Definitions and Terminology Associated with Clinical Safety Experience&#x0201d; in the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH)-E2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The primary objective of this study was to compare the difference in the proportion of patients who develop significant drug-related adverse events(s) between the caspofungin and micafungin groups. The secondary objective was to evaluate the difference in the overall response by each of esophageal candidiasis, invasive candidiasis, and aspergillosis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Patient inclusion criteria</title><p>Japanese patients aged 20&#x000a0;years and over were enrolled in this study following obtainment of written informed consent.

The most common reason for why patients were excluded from the FAS population and the PPS population was unconfirmed &#x0201c;positive culture&#x0201d; for esophageal candidiasis and invasive candidiasis (15 patients). Most of these excluded patients were with probable candidemia. Candidemia patients were allowed to start study therapy based on the positive (1,3)-&#x003b2;-<sc>D</sc>-glucan test and clinical symptoms, and, as a result, most of the culture results in these patients were demonstrated as negative. Patients who were not classified into diseases predefined in the study protocol (two patients with aspergillosis not classified) were also excluded from the PPS population.

However, it should be noted that two patients in the PPS population receiving caspofungin died due to worsening of the primary disease of chronic pulmonary aspergillosis after 1 and 12&#x000a0;days following the completion of study therapy, respectively, and were assessed as &#x0201c;unable to be judged&#x0201d; by the IEAC because both patients also had bacterial infection and the efficacy of caspofungin could not be evaluated based on their clinical symptoms. Since the ultimate cause of death was the worsening of primary disease, these two patients were highly likely not to respond to caspofungin, and, consequently, the efficacy of caspofungin might be slightly lower in this study. All <italic>Candida</italic> spp. isolates detected at screening in this study showed caspofungin MIC below the current CLSI clinical breakpoint (2&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mL) and were deemed to be susceptible. No CLSI clinical breakpoint for <italic>Aspergillus</italic> spp. has been established; however, the MEC values were similar to the data reported to date [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Therefore, <italic>Candida</italic> spp. and <italic>Aspergillus</italic> spp. in Japan appear to be susceptible to caspofungin.</p><p>Both caspofungin and micafungin demonstrated favorable treatment efficacy against <italic>Candida</italic> infections. This result is similar to that in the fluconazole-controlled comparative studies of caspofungin and micafungin in patients with esophageal candidiasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and to that in the direct comparative study between caspofungin and micafungin in patients with invasive candidiasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>On the other hand, the favorable response rate was slightly below 50&#x000a0;% in aspergillosis. In this study, no patients in the primary efficacy analysis group were confirmed by the IEAC to have invasive aspergillosis, and, thus, all patients who were categorized into the aspergillosis population had subacute to chronic stage of aspergillosis. As for the study evaluating the efficacy against chronic pulmonary aspergillosis, a study has been conducted comparing micafungin with voriconazole. In this study, the favorable overall response rates at the completion of study therapy with micafungin (average dose 167.4&#x000a0;mg/day) or voriconazole (6&#x000a0;mg/kg twice daily on Day 1, followed by 4&#x000a0;mg/kg twice daily on Day 2 onwards) were 60.0&#x000a0;% and 53.2&#x000a0;%, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Although a direct comparative assessment is difficult due to the different enrollment and efficacy evaluation criteria, based on this previous report and the results from the current study (favorable overall response rate of 46.7&#x000a0;% in the caspofungin group and 42.4&#x000a0;% in the micafungin group), it can be considered that both agents are effective to some extent against chronic pulmonary aspergillosis. Additionally, among the chronic pulmonary aspergillosis patients who showed favorable efficacy response, we found that the duration of therapy in the caspofungin group was numerically shorter than that in the micafungin group. Since the number of patients was very limited (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;14 in each group) and any adjustment based on the medical history or concomitant diseases including risk factors for fungal infection was not considered, it is difficult to conclude that the difference in periods show antifungal responses. However, it might be interesting to investigate the difference of echinocandins, and, thus, further investigation in the patients with more controlled status is needed.</p><p>Taken together, the overall efficacy results seem consistent to those of other previous reports, although there is a limitation to comparing the efficacy to each candidiasis and aspergillosis between caspofungin and micafungin due to the small number of patients in each subset of infection.</p><p>Amongst the proportion of patients with significant drug-related adverse events, the primary endpoint of this study was 5.0&#x000a0;% in the caspofungin group and 10.0&#x000a0;% in the micafungin group. The 95&#x000a0;% CI for the treatment difference in the incidence was &#x02212;15.9&#x000a0;% to 5.2&#x000a0;%, thereby, showing no significant difference. Furthermore, no apparent difference between the treatment groups was observed in the incidence of specific adverse events or drug-related adverse events. In addition, relatively common drug-related adverse event categories were similar to those previously reported in association with caspofungin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Drug-related adverse events relating to liver function enzymes have been commonly reported in association with echinocandins. Since these events were also frequently reported compared to other drug-related adverse events in this study, these events were further assessed. When maximal levels of AST, ALT, and ALP were graded in accordance with CTCAE Version 3 criteria, all abnormal changes observed in the caspofungin group were Grade 2 (&#x0003e;2.5&#x02013;5 &#x000d7; ULN), but some patients in the micafungin group had Grade 3 levels (&#x0003e;5.0&#x02013;20.0 &#x000d7; ULN). Since multiple types of drugs were concomitantly used with the study therapy in this trial, a discussion of the drug association with elevation of these enzymes is difficult to make. However, the monitoring of liver function enzymes is generally recommended for patients receiving echinocandins.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In Japanese patients with <italic>Aspergillus</italic> or <italic>Candida</italic> infections, the safety of the treatment with caspofungin 50&#x000a0;mg or 70/50&#x000a0;mg once daily was similar to that of micafungin 150&#x000a0;mg daily. Consistent to other data on these two agents, caspofungin treatment showed similar efficacy to micafungin.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to express our deepest appreciation to the study investigators who had committed to the enrollment of patients into this study.
