Approval of institutional medical Ethical Committee and written consent from patients were obtained. All patients were prepared for elective cesarean section. Exclusion criteria included refusal of patients, contra-indications for spinal anesthesia, known allergy to granisetron, patients receiving serotonin agonists or antagonists, ischemic heart disease, chronic hypertension or pregnancy induced hypertension.</p><p>All patients were prehydrated with IV 500 ml lactated ringer. Base line heart rate (HR) and mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) were measured before spinal anesthesia. Spinal anesthesia was performed in sitting position with 25-gauge spinal needle in 3-4 or 4-5 lumbar interspaces, 2 ml 0.5% hyperbaric bupivcaine was injected.</p><p>Sensory level was evaluated by testing for cold sensation, and motor block was assessed according to Bromage scale after 5 min and repeated again after 10 min.</p><p>Mean arterial blood pressure and HR were recorded every 3 min until the end of surgery (for 45 min). Blood pressure was measured every 1 min if vasopressors were needed until hypotension was controlled and then the predetermined protocol was followed.</p><p>The patients were randomly classified into two groups (100 patients in each group): Group I was given 1 mg granisetron diluted in 10 ml normal saline slowly IV (over 1 min) 5 min before spinal anesthesia. Group II was given 10 ml of normal saline (placebo) slowly IV (within 1 min) 5 min before spinal anesthesia.</p><p>Randomization was performed using a computer-based random number generator in permutated blocks of varying sizes and the assignment entered in sealed envelopes that were not opened till informed consent was obtained.</p><p>The study was double-blind where the anesthetists, data collectors and patients were blinded to the assignment groups. The syringes were prepared by anesthetist who was blinded to study protocol.</p><p>Parturients were placed on the operating table in the supine position with 15&#x000b0; of left lateral tilt with supplemental oxygen through a face mask. Maintenance fluid of lactated Ringer's solution was infused at a rate of 10 ml/kg/h in both groups during the surgical procedure. An additional rapid bolus infusion (100 ml) of lactated Ringer's was given at each episode of hypotension.</p><p>Vasopressors were administered if MABP &#x0003c;70 mmHg. IV vasopressors consisted of ephedrine given in a bolus dose of 5 mg if HR was &#x0003c;90 beat/min, or phenylephrine 0.1 mg IV bolus if HR was &#x0003e;90 beat/min. Vasopressors treatment was repeated every 1 min if hypotension persisted or recurred. If bradycardia occurred (HR &#x0003c;60 beat/min), 0.5 mg atropine was given IV if bradycardia was not associated with hypotension. The total dose of vasopressors and atropine administered was recorded.
