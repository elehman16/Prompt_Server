We investigated long-term VL and resistance in HIV-infected children managed without real-time VL monitoring.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Methods and findings</title><p>In the ARROW factorial trial, 1,206 children initiating ART in Uganda and Zimbabwe between 15 March 2007 and 18 November 2008, aged a median 6 years old, with median CD4% of 12%, were randomised to monitoring with or without 12-weekly CD4 counts and to receive 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (2NRTI, mainly abacavir+lamivudine) with a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) or 3 NRTIs as long-term ART. All children had VL assayed retrospectively after a median of 4 years on ART; those with &#x0003e;1,000 copies/ml were genotyped. Three hundred and sixteen children had VL and genotypes assayed longitudinally (at least every 24 weeks). Overall, 67 (6%) switched to second-line ART and 54 (4%) died. In children randomised to WHO-recommended 2NRTI+NNRTI long-term ART, 308/378 (81%) monitored with CD4 counts versus 297/375 (79%) without had VL &#x0003c;1,000 copies/ml at 4 years (difference = +2.3% [95% CI &#x02212;3.4% to +8.0%]; <italic>P</italic> = 0.43), with no evidence of differences in intermediate/high-level resistance to 11 drugs. Among children with longitudinal VLs, only 5% of child-time post&#x02013;week 24 was spent with persistent low-level viraemia (80&#x02013;5,000 copies/ml) and 10% with VL rebound &#x02265;5,000 copies/ml. No child resuppressed &#x0003c;80 copies/ml after confirmed VL rebound &#x02265;5,000 copies/ml. A median of 1.0 (IQR 0.0,1.5) additional NRTI mutation accumulated over 2 years&#x02019; rebound. Nineteen out of 48 (40%) VLs 1,000&#x02013;5,000 copies/ml were immediately followed by resuppression &#x0003c;1,000 copies/ml, but only 17/155 (11%) VLs &#x02265;5,000 copies/ml resuppressed (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001). Main study limitations are that analyses were exploratory and treatment initiation used 2006 criteria, without pre-ART genotypes.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this study, children receiving first-line ART in sub-Saharan Africa without real-time VL monitoring had good virological and resistance outcomes over 4 years, regardless of CD4 monitoring strategy. Many children with detectable low-level viraemia spontaneously resuppressed, highlighting the importance of confirming virological failure before switching to second-line therapy. Children experiencing rebound &#x02265;5,000 copies/ml were much less likely to resuppress, but NRTI resistance increased only slowly. These results are relevant to the increasing numbers of HIV-infected children receiving first-line ART in sub-Saharan Africa with limited access to virological monitoring.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Trial registration</title><p>ISRCTN Registry, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN24791884">ISRCTN24791884</ext-link></p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>In an analysis based on the ARROW trial, Alex Szubert and colleagues report on virological and drug resistance outcomes in children with HIV infection.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><sec id="sec005"><title>Why was this study done?</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Although WHO guidelines recommend that HIV-infected children be monitored using HIV viral load tests when they are receiving treatment, availability remains limited.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Most HIV-infected children on treatment therefore get either no or infrequent viral load tests; they may get CD4 count measurements and regular clinical assessments.</p></list-item><list-item><p>We wanted to find out what implications this might have for children&#x02019;s long-term response to treatment, in terms of controlling the virus and development of resistance to antiretroviral drugs.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>What did the researchers do and find?</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>We measured viral load and drug resistance using stored samples from a large randomised controlled trial of 1,206 HIV-infected children starting treatment in Uganda and Zimbabwe who were randomised to monitoring with or without CD4 counts, as well as to 2 different first-line antiretroviral drug regimens. Two-thirds received the treatment regimen that WHO now recommends long-term (2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and 1 non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor).</p></list-item><list-item><p>After an average of 4 years on treatment, we found no evidence that CD4 monitoring strategy affected viral suppression or resistance. Overall, 74% of the 753 children randomised to current WHO-recommended regimens were fully suppressed.</p></list-item><list-item><p>We also investigated how viral load changed and resistance developed over time in a subset of children taking current WHO-recommended regimens.

There are an estimated 1.8 million HIV-infected children worldwide, &#x0003e;80% of whom live in sub-Saharan Africa. Treating children is challenging, given their more limited access to antiretroviral drugs compared with adults; in 2015, only 49% of HIV-infected children globally were estimated to be receiving ART [<xref rid="pmed.1002432.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Current WHO guidelines recommend VL monitoring 6 and 12 months after initiating ART, and every 12 months thereafter [<xref rid="pmed.1002432.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. A threshold of &#x0003e;1,000 copies/ml is used to define virological failure, which, if confirmed and adherence has been addressed, should be followed by the switch to second-line ART. Current guidelines also recommend stopping routine CD4 monitoring, provided patients are clinically stable and virologically suppressed. However, despite this push to increase VL monitoring and reduce reliance on immunological and clinical failure criteria, the availability of VL monitoring remains limited in low-income settings (estimated at 25% of people living with HIV in 2014 [<xref rid="pmed.1002432.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]), and VL is less frequently measured in low-income settings than in well-resourced ones (typically annually versus 3-monthly). Therefore, it is important to understand virological outcomes among children who are not managed using real-time VL monitoring, as this reflects the reality in most ART programmes in resource-limited settings.</p><p>Although management without VL monitoring has enabled ART rollout, children with virological failure risk developing resistance, which may reduce efficacy of second-line therapy. In a systematic review of 30 studies from low-income settings in 2011 [<xref rid="pmed.1002432.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], 80% and 88% of children failing first-line ART had 1 or more International AIDS Society (IAS)-USA major nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) resistance-associated mutations, respectively. In 2012, WHO reported that 60% and 67% of adults and children in sub-Saharan Africa failing first-line ART at 12 months had NRTI and NNRTI resistance, respectively [<xref rid="pmed.1002432.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The only large randomised trial to date of second-line ART in African adults found that those receiving NRTI-based second-line regimens had equivalent virological suppression to those receiving regimens based on 2 new drug classes [<xref rid="pmed.1002432.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], suggesting that NRTI cross-resistance may have less relevance than feared. However, longitudinal VL and resistance data are rare in children starting first-line ART in resource-limited settings.</p><p>We therefore investigated virological outcomes and resistance in the ARROW randomised trial (ISRCTN24791884), which compared first-line ART regimens and CD4 monitoring strategies in children and adolescents in Uganda and Zimbabwe [<xref rid="pmed.1002432.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Overall, ARROW showed that CD4 monitoring, compared with clinical monitoring alone, provided some clinical benefit after the first year on ART, but 5-year survival was very high overall (96%), supporting prioritisation of ART rollout over access to laboratory monitoring. There was no evidence of differences between 3NRTI and 2NRTI+NNRTI long-term maintenance regimens in terms of clinical outcomes or CD4, but medium-term virological suppression was poorer with 3NRTI, supporting 2NRTI+NNRTI becoming the WHO-recommended first-line regimen for children as of 2013.</p><p>The ARROW trial provided a unique opportunity to evaluate long-term virological outcomes in stored samples from a large cohort of well-characterised children with high retention in whom VL monitoring was not undertaken in real-time. In the present study, we had 2 main objectives. The first was to directly compare children randomised to monitoring with and without CD4 counts in terms of long-term VL suppression and resistance. The second was to characterise the patterns of long-term virological control and resistance in children receiving first-line ART in sub-Saharan Africa without frequent, regular real-time VL monitoring (reflecting the reality in most ART programmes) in an observational analysis without regard to the trial randomisations. We focussed on children receiving currently WHO-recommended 2NRTI+NNRTI maintenance ART regimens.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec009"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>The ARROW trial (ISRCTN24791884) recruited 1,206 previously untreated HIV-infected children and adolescents (aged 3 months to 17 years) eligible for ART using WHO 2006 criteria [<xref rid="pmed.1002432.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], between 15 March 2007 and 18 November 2008.

In this study, we compared virological outcomes in a large cohort of children with moderately advanced HIV disease receiving first-line ART without real-time VL monitoring in Uganda and Zimbabwe. Overall, virological outcomes were good, with almost three-quarters of children on current WHO-recommended abacavir+lamivudine+NNRTI regimens fully suppressed after 4 years of ART and only 6% switching to second-line treatment. We found no evidence of a difference in VL suppression or drug susceptibility between children managed with or without CD4 monitoring. Virological blips were relatively common, but pLLVL and rebound &#x02265;5,000 copies/ml occurred in a minority; only 15% of child-time after week 24 was spent with viraemia in children taking NNRTI+2NRTI regimens. Even among children with VL &#x0003e;1,000 copies/ml, intermediate/high-level drug resistance to key second-line NRTIs was found only in a minority. Children with virological rebound did have a small increase in genotypic NRTI resistance over 2 years. Overall, these results suggest that, where available, annual VL monitoring as recommended by WHO is a reasonable and pragmatic approach in low- and middle-income countries.</p><p>The ARROW trial showed that CD4 monitoring (without routine VL monitoring) provided clinical benefit over clinical monitoring alone after the first year on ART. However, event rates were very low (new WHO stage 4 disease/death 0.4 per 100 child-years with CD4 monitoring versus 1.3 without) and 5-year survival was very high (96%). We have now extended these findings, by showing that virological suppression in the cohort as a whole was high. After a median of 4 years, 80% of children randomised to WHO-recommended 2NRTI+NNRTI&#x02013;based regimens had VL &#x0003c;1,000 copies/ml and 74% had undetectable virus. This is similar to a recent small cohort of Kenyan children monitored for 4 years, in whom two-thirds maintained long-term virological control [<xref rid="pmed.1002432.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Virological suppression from most paediatric [<xref rid="pmed.1002432.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002432.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] cohorts falls short of the 90% target set by UNAIDS, highlighting the need for simpler, better-tolerated regimens and effective adherence interventions.</p><p>VL did not increase significantly over time in children with pLLVL or rebound; rather, it appeared that viraemia reached an equilibrium (approximately 1,000 and approximately 40,000 copies/ml, respectively), similar to the set-point that is characteristic of untreated HIV infection [<xref rid="pmed.1002432.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], perhaps due to the capacity for HIV-specific CD8+ T-cell responses to control viral replication on suboptimal ART [<xref rid="pmed.1002432.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], before potentially changing again to a new equilibrium in the rebound state, driven by further loss of adherence or by immune escape from previously effective T-cell responses [<xref rid="pmed.1002432.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Future studies of HIV-specific T-cell responses in ART-treated children are warranted to investigate these hypotheses further.</p><p>Children with virological failure in ARROW had frequent NNRTI and lamivudine resistance, as expected, but retained high susceptibility to both tenofovir and zidovudine, the recommended second-line NRTI options. Perhaps more importantly, a median of 2 years&#x02019; viral replication at approximately 40,000 copies/ml led to an increase of only 1 major NRTI mutation and did not substantively alter drug susceptibility. In the PENPACT-1 trial, which compared switch at VL 1,000 versus 30,000 copies/ml in Europe and the Americas, NNRTI resistance had already developed when VL reached &#x0003e;1,000 copies/ml [<xref rid="pmed.1002432.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], despite 3-monthly VL monitoring. Although NRTI thymidine analogue mutations accumulated with ongoing replication in the 30,000 copies/ml switch threshold group in PENPACT-1, this occurred less frequently in children taking abacavir+lamivudine. Children took a median 80 weeks for VL to increase from 1,000 to 30,000 copies/ml, but all those switching from 2NRTI+NNRTI to second-line at VL &#x0003e;30,000 copies/ml resuppressed within 24 weeks and had similar VL suppression at 5 years compared with those switching at &#x0003e;1,000 copies/ml. Similarly, responses to second-line therapy were good despite modest accumulation of resistance in the Kenyan study [<xref rid="pmed.1002432.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Even when failure is confirmed virologically, clinicians are often reluctant to switch ART because of limited and more complex second-line options (particularly appropriate formulations); limited access to resistance testing to inform decision-making; concerns regarding adherence; and, in resource-limited settings, very limited availability of third-line ART [<xref rid="pmed.1002432.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. ARROW provides some reassurance that delays in switching of up to 2 years should have limited implications, particularly since the risk of onward transmission from children is low and the only large randomised trial addressing the role of NRTIs with substantial predicted cross-resistance in second-line treatment suggested they retained considerable activity in adults [<xref rid="pmed.1002432.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002432.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>Over the longer term, substantial efforts are being made to ensure virological monitoring is available in all settings. However, challenges in training, procurement, specimen transport, and financial resources have limited its roll-out [<xref rid="pmed.1002432.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Coverage was estimated at 25% in 2014 [<xref rid="pmed.1002432.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and is only estimated to increase to around 47% by 2019 [<xref rid="pmed.1002432.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]; furthermore, monitoring is mostly restricted to high-level facilities and after the first year is not recommended more often than yearly in most low-income countries. No virological monitoring was undertaken in ARROW; furthermore, VL suppression did not differ between children with or without CD4 monitoring, showing that good virological outcomes are achievable even with clinical monitoring, which can be done at low-level health facilities. Most children switching to second-line ART had detectable VL. Together, these findings highlight that absence of VL monitoring should not be a barrier to providing first-line or switching to second-line ART, given the considerable morbidity and mortality benefits of treatment.</p><p>Where virological monitoring is used, it is important to consider the implications of detectable viraemia in children. Current guidelines recommend switching to second-line ART at a confirmed VL above 1,000 copies/ml. However, we found that it was not uncommon for single, or even confirmed, VLs above this threshold to be immediately followed by return to values below the threshold without adherence counselling (since all VLs were measured retrospectively). This was particularly true for VLs between 1,000&#x02013;5,000 copies/ml&#x02014;precisely those levels where switch might be considered to have the greatest potential to prevent resistance accumulation. Resuppression on NNRTI-based regimens despite NNRTI resistance has previously been noted in cohorts [<xref rid="pmed.1002432.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and a treatment interruption study [<xref rid="pmed.1002432.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. This highlights the importance of maximising efforts to extend the durability of first-line ART, for example through enhanced adherence counselling and peer support, given detectable VL. Furthermore, it demonstrates the importance of repeating VL testing before switching from first-line to second-line ART in low-income countries, given the limited treatment regimens available, particularly where VL is 1,000&#x02013;5,000 copies/ml. Importantly, no children with confirmed VL &#x02265;5,000 copies/ml resuppressed &#x0003c;80 copies/ml. Outside a clinical trial such as ARROW, blips may also be caused by ART interruptions following drug stock-outs. Whilst blips have previously been shown to have no deleterious effect on subsequent VL rebound or CD4 responses [<xref rid="pmed.1002432.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], their impact on markers of underlying inflammation remains unclear in children and requires further study.</p><p>Study limitations include the fact that this was an exploratory analysis within a clinical trial that was conducted using 2006 WHO treatment thresholds, which have now been superseded by universal ART initiation criteria; whether virological outcomes would be different in children treated using current guidelines is unknown. However, given that VLs would be expected to be lower and CD4 percentages higher with earlier treatment, our results plausibly reflect a &#x02018;worst-case&#x02019; scenario moving forwards. Genotyping was not conducted at ART initiation, and so may have missed preexisting resistance before ART. A reported 6.8% of those in the WHO African Region with available pre-ART genotypes had 1 or more mutations in any drug class before therapy initiation in 2010 [<xref rid="pmed.1002432.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], although prevalence of transmitted drug resistance is likely to be considerably lower here, since children were born between 1990&#x02013;2008. Further resistance could have been identified by sequencing at lower thresholds; all genotyping was performed in Uganda based on a 1,000 copies/ml genotyping threshold. Our study was conducted within a clinical trial where drug supplies were continuous and participants received greater support than in a treatment programme; therefore, incidence of virological failure could have been lower. However, in contrast, most existing paediatric resistance data are from programmes/clinics with real-time VL monitoring; one might expect that resistance may be more prevalent without real-time VL monitoring.</p><p>In summary, we found that virological and resistance outcomes were good in this study, and that neither VL suppression nor predicted susceptibility of second-line treatment options were impacted by monitoring with or without CD4 counts over median 4 years follow-up in children initiating ART in Uganda and Zimbabwe. Despite being managed without real-time VL monitoring, only 20% of children on WHO-recommended 2NRTI+NNRTI first-line ART experienced pLLVL or rebound, during which time VL levels were stably maintained over relatively long periods. In rebound, genotypic resistance increased only slightly over 2 years, providing reassurance that annual VL monitoring, as recommended by WHO, is a reasonable and pragmatic approach for HIV-infected children on first-line ART in resource-limited settings.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec020"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1002432.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Longitudinal cohort VLs and classification.</title><p>Abbreviation: VL, viral load.</p><p>(XLS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.1002432.s001.xls"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1002432.s002"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>Cross-sectional study VLs.</title><p>Abbreviation: VL, viral load.</p><p>(XLS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.1002432.s002.xls"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1002432.s003"><label>S3 Table</label><caption><title>VL response, blips, pLLVL, and rebound over weeks on ART by CD4 monitoring randomisation in 2NRTI+NNRTI.</title><p>Abbreviations: ART, antiretroviral therapy;
