In addition, approximately 68% of the preventable costs were due to medication non-adherence and delayed implementation of evidence-based treatment.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-2050312117709189" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Medication non-adherence is a complex and multidimensional healthcare problem. In general, medication adherence rates are lower in chronic disease patients than in those with acute disease.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-2050312117709189" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Patients with chronic disease require a lifelong commitment to medication to achieve adequate control and to prevent progression of their disease. However, the adherence rate for those with chronic illness, especially hypertension, is low and drops dramatically after the first 6&#x02009;months of treatment.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-2050312117709189" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup></p><p>Of the chronic diseases, hypertension is one that is associated with high avoidable costs and low adherence rates.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-2050312117709189" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> In Malaysia, the National Health and Morbidity Survey in 2015 reported that the overall prevalence of hypertension for adults aged 18&#x02009;years and above was 30.3%.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-2050312117709189" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> A study conducted in Malaysia by Ramli et al.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-2050312117709189" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> in 2012 reported that only 53.4% of the hypertensive patients in Malaysia were adherent to their antihypertensive medication. The public healthcare system in Malaysia provided cheap and affordable health services to all Malaysian citizens, whereby primary healthcare cost is only MYR 1 for outpatient treatment and MYR 5 for specialist care. In addition, senior citizen aged 60&#x02009;years and above is entitled for free health care.<sup><xref rid="bibr7-2050312117709189" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Even though the Malaysia population is with this good and easy accessibility to effective antihypertensive medical therapy under public healthcare system, only 35% of Malaysian hypertensive patients have achieved optimal blood-pressure control.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-2050312117709189" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup></p><p>Low adherence to antihypertensive medication is associated with poor blood-pressure control and results in high healthcare costs, poor treatment outcomes, an increased risk of cardiovascular illness and poor quality of life.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-2050312117709189" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bibr9-2050312117709189" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> There are many reasons for the low adherence, including doubts about treatment efficacy, financial issues, low health literacy, individual beliefs and perceptions about the disease, as well as ethnicity, age group and income level.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-2050312117709189" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="bibr11-2050312117709189" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup></p><p>Various interventions aiming to improve medication adherence in hypertension have been studied.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-2050312117709189" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="bibr13-2050312117709189" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr14-2050312117709189" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Interventions to improve adherence can be classified into different categories including technical (e.g. dosage simplification and special packaging), behavioural (e.g. reminders and patient diaries), educational (e.g. providing knowledge and information related to the disease), social support (e.g. buddy system) and structural interventions (e.g. disease management program).<sup><xref rid="bibr15-2050312117709189" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> However, interventions that are designed for long-term care generally require active involvement of healthcare resources and thus are usually costly and labour-intensive. Passive technical interventions such as calendar blister packs (CBPs) have recently been receiving increased interest, as they could improve adherence with minimal involvement of healthcare resources. CBPs are an innovative unit-of-use packaging system in which each tablet&#x02019;s blister is labelled with a day or date feature that is designed to provide a visual record of when the patient last took the medicine.<sup><xref rid="bibr16-2050312117709189" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup></p><p>However, CBP interventions have not been widely studied in the Asian setting when compared to education or counselling interventions to improve adherence rates among hypertensive patients.<sup><xref rid="bibr17-2050312117709189" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> Thus, the objective of this study was to investigate the effect of a CBP intervention on medication adherence, blood pressure and associated costs among hypertensive patients in a Malaysian setting.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="section6-2050312117709189"><title>Methods</title><sec id="section7-2050312117709189"><title>Study design and setting</title><p>This was a randomized controlled trial with two parallel groups (CBP and normal blister pack).

Potential patients were identified through prescription screening and were recruited by a research assistant and study pharmacist at the outpatients&#x02019; pharmacy department. The inclusion criteria were as follows: patients aged 18&#x02013;75&#x02009;years who had filled a prescription of amlodipine for the treatment of hypertension for at least 3&#x02009;months; had been diagnosed with hypertension for at least 6&#x02009;months; and agreed to follow-ups for the 7-month study period. The doses of amlodipine could be changed during the study period, and other antihypertensive agents could be added or discontinued. The exclusion criteria for the study were as follows: patients who exhibited cognitive impairment, visual impairment, moderate-severe valvular heart disease, pericarditis or myocarditis; had a recent (&#x02a7d; 3&#x02009;months) history of stroke, abnormal thyroid function, haemochromatosis or alcohol abuse or were hepatitis B, hepatitis C, HIV or cancer patients; were pregnant or planned to be pregnant during the study; had known secondary arterial hypertension or end-stage renal failure or were receiving dialysis; and were illiterate in both Malay and English. Finally, patients who used an organized pill box or required special or third-party assistance to take their medications were excluded from this study. Patients were considered drop-outs or lost to follow-up if they did not refill their prescription at least once after signing the informed consent form or did not visit the outpatient pharmacy for refills during the entire 7-month study period. Patients were required to refill their prescription at least once after signing the informed consent form for the investigator to compute the adherence rate. The end points of the study included death, completion of the 7-month study period, lack of need for amlodipine as part of hypertension treatment, discharge to a health clinic and discontinuation of follow-up at Hospital Kulim.</p></sec><sec id="section10-2050312117709189"><title>Study protocol</title><p>Prior to consent, eligible patients were screened verbally for their ability to either read or write in English or Malay. After patients signed the informed consent form, the baseline assessment was administered by a research assistant. The baseline assessment included self-reported demographic questions, education level, household income, medical history and blood-pressure measurement. After the baseline assessment, the patients were randomly allocated (1:1) into the intervention or control group using block randomization with 10 patients per block, reported according to the CONSORT statement. Randomization was conducted using computer pre-generated randomized number lists generated by the investigator using Random Allocation Software Version 1.0.<sup><xref rid="bibr20-2050312117709189" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> CBPs containing amlodipine with seven tablets per strip, labelled with the day feature on the back of the blister pack, were dispensed to the patients in the intervention group, whereas patients in the control group were given amlodipine in a normal blister pack, which had seven tablets in a strip without the day feature on the back (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2050312117709189">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1-2050312117709189" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Calendar-packaged and normal-packaged medications.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_2050312117709189-fig1"/></fig><p>Due to the packaging of the medicine, patients, study pharmacist and investigators were not blinded to the study assignment.

Two different colour codes were used to label the medication box and the patient&#x02019;s prescription to indicate the intervention (yellow) and control group (blue). Pharmacy assistants prepared the amlodipine according to the colour code on the prescription and recorded the patient&#x02019;s study ID and the date on the stock card for each refill. The medications were then labelled and counter-checked by study pharmacist before being dispensed to the patients according to the study guidelines. For patients in the intervention group, the pharmacist advised them to take the medicine once a day according to the days of the week or number sequence stated on the blister pack, and the patients were advised to self-monitor their medication consumption as recommended to complete a strip of medicine each week. For patients in the control group, study pharmacists dispensed the medications according to the hospital&#x02019;s standard drug counselling protocol.</p><p>After study assignment, the patients were scheduled to visit the study pharmacist to refill their prescription every 28&#x02009;days from the first day of enrolment during the 7-month follow-up period. All patients who receive long-term care in Malaysia Ministry of Health facilities are required to refill their prescription every 28&#x02009;days as part of the ministry&#x02019;s effort to reduce medication wastage. The current study applied the same protocol to avoid patient confusion.<sup><xref rid="bibr22-2050312117709189" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> Blood-pressure measurements were recorded by a research assistant at baseline and at 3 and 6&#x02009;months after enrolment. On each occasion, blood pressure was measured in exactly the same way, with three measurements taken 5&#x02009;minutes apart; patients were at rest for 5&#x02009;minutes in a seated position with back support, and blood pressure was measured using an automated measurement device (OMROM Healthcare, HEM-7322). The mean of the three measurements was used as the blood-pressure level at the visit. The date of every medication refilled by the patients was recorded by a study pharmacist or pharmacy assistant.

The CBP for daily medication dosage used in this study is unique and different from the packaging studied by Simmons et al.<sup><xref rid="bibr26-2050312117709189" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> and Valenstein et al.<sup><xref rid="bibr27-2050312117709189" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> The CBP used in the Simmons et al. and Valenstein et al. studies contained 7&#x02009;days of therapies arranged on a strip prepared by pharmacists that were labelled with medication-specific instructions and the times of day (morning, noon, evening and night) at which the doses had to be taken. In contrast, the CBP used in our study was four individual strips of medicine (amlodipine) packed in a single box by the drug manufacturer, each of which contained four rows of seven single tablets and incorporated the number of days in a week that the dose had to be taken. This provided an ongoing visual record of the doses that needed to be taken each day. Moreover, it may also have allowed the patient to track the doses missed each week, and third parties such as family members were also able to monitor the patients&#x02019; medication consumption based on the packaging. Thus, the CBP packaging design may have guided the patients towards taking their medication on time and thus slowly developing the habit of adherence to their medication.<sup><xref rid="bibr23-2050312117709189" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="bibr28-2050312117709189" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup></p><p>In addition to the improvement in medication adherence, this study also demonstrated a significant improvement in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure between the intervention and control groups. This simple and labour-saving calendar packaging design can assist patients in identifying the correct medication and in taking medications more reliably. This packaging design has also been found to be useful for elderly patients and patients with memory deficits to monitor their medication consumption and thus improve their adherence to medications, ultimately leading to better treatment outcomes.<sup><xref rid="bibr23-2050312117709189" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup></p><p>To our knowledge, this is the first study in Southeast Asia to evaluate the cost of a CBP intervention to improve medication adherence among hypertensive patients. Previous studies have been conducted to evaluate the effects of various interventions including medication counselling and family member-based supervision on medication adherence among hypertensive patients in Asian countries.<sup><xref rid="bibr29-2050312117709189" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="bibr30-2050312117709189" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> The cost analysis in this study showed that there was a difference of MYR 26,084.16 in total healthcare costs per year between the two groups. This finding showed that improved medication adherence was associated with lower total healthcare expenditures. This was consistent with a study by Iuga and McGuire<sup><xref rid="bibr31-2050312117709189" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> that showed that improved medication adherence among patients with chronic diseases substantially reduced overall medical costs and use of emergency and inpatient services. These services are key drivers in the overall reduction of healthcare costs.<sup><xref rid="bibr31-2050312117709189" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup></p><p>However, there was a numerical but not significant difference between the groups in the treatment costs per patient. Over a 12-month period, the mean cost of treatment for intervention patients was lower than the control group. As CBP medication improved patients&#x02019; medication adherence, it could lead to better blood-pressure control and avoid progression of the disease.<sup><xref rid="bibr32-2050312117709189" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> There were fewer patients in the intervention group who required additional procedures, imaging services, and hospital admissions compared to the control group in this study. However, the sample size was not large enough to demonstrate a statically significant difference in the treatment cost between the groups.</p><p>In randomized controlled trials, analyses commonly use the intent-to-treat principle, in which all randomized patients are analysed according to their randomized group. However, deviations from this approach are common, especially in analyses of incomplete and missing data, which may result in a more adherent cohort, bias estimates, and possible invalid inferences.<sup><xref rid="bibr33-2050312117709189" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> As the MPR could not be computed without at least one refill by the patients, thus the per protocol principle was used for the analysis in this study. Although the sample size was reduced due to this exclusion, with this approach, the adherence and blood-pressure outcomes were more reliable and specially linked to aspects of the intervention.</p><p>Finally, the MPR was high in this study, as MPR was defined as the total number of medications supply to patients over the refill interval. Thus, patients who routinely refill their medications early would have an inflated MPR as the numerator (total medications supply) would be larger than the denominator (refill interval). For chronic diseases, patients who were on long-term medications, it is common for them to refill their medications before running out. Apart from this, the public healthcare system in Malaysia provided cheap, affordable health services and free-of-charges prescription refills to Malaysian citizens if patients refill their medication on time.<sup><xref rid="bibr7-2050312117709189" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Thus, these would lead to high MPR among chronic disease patients in Malaysia.</p><sec id="section20-2050312117709189"><title>Limitations</title><p>There were several limitations to this study. This study was limited by a small sample size, and the time frame of the intervention was short, which might have affected the long-term study outcomes. Longer intervention periods may provide a better reflection of the intervention&#x02019;s effects on patient medication adherence, blood pressure and costs. Moreover, the findings may not be generalizable internationally as the study was based in Malaysia and was limited to elderly patients who were currently on multiple prescribed medications including amlodipine as part of their hypertensive treatment. The results might not be applicable to elderly patients in assisted living or those with cognitive and mental impairment. This study excluded a large number of patients due to their inability to personally refill their prescription. Although this could mean that the study might be more applicable to our subgroup of patients, our sample closely resembled the characteristics of outpatients in public facilities that allow family members to collect medications on behalf of the patient.<sup><xref rid="bibr34-2050312117709189" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> In addition, similar response could be expected from the excluded patients given the close proximity of the baseline adherence rate with other local study.<sup><xref rid="bibr35-2050312117709189" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> Finally, due to the study and packaging design, both the patients and pharmacists were not blinded, and the Hawthorne effect could have occurred in the intervention group.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="section21-2050312117709189"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study combined a wide range of adherence measurements. The MPR and percentage of on-time refills favoured the use of CBP over the control condition for medication adherence, indicating the robustness and reliability of the findings. Moreover, CBP also improved the blood pressure among the study patients. As this packaging does not require special technical skills, it is therefore suitable for patients of all ages, especially elderly patients. The cost of treatment per patient in the CBP group was numerically lower than that of patients receiving the normal blister pack. From the provider perspective, this finding is encouraging because CBP could likely lead to long-term substantial cost savings from avoidable direct healthcare expenditures. Thus, future studies should conduct more detailed cost-effective analyses with a larger sample size and a longer intervention period.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank the Director General of Health Malaysia for his permission to publish this article.
