Glucose-based PD fluids reduce immunological defenses in the peritoneal cavity. Low concentrations of peritoneal extracellular glutamine during PD may contribute to this immune deficit. For these reasons we have developed a clinical assay to measure the function of the immune-competent cells in PD effluent from PD patients. We then applied this assay to test the impact on peritoneal immune-competence of PD fluid supplementation with alanyl-glutamine (AlaGln) in 6 patients in an open-label, randomized, crossover pilot trial (EudraCT 2012-004004-36), and related the functional results to transcriptome changes in PD effluent cells. <italic>Ex-vivo</italic> stimulation of PD effluent peritoneal cells increased release of interleukin (IL) 6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) &#x003b1;. Both IL-6 and TNF-&#x003b1; were lower at 1&#x02009;h than at 4&#x02009;h of the peritoneal equilibration test but the reductions in cytokine release were attenuated in AlaGln-supplemented samples. AlaGln-supplemented samples exhibited priming of IL-6-related pathways and downregulation of TNF-&#x003b1; upstream elements. Results from measurement of cytokine release and transcriptome analysis in this pilot clinical study support the conclusion that suppression of PD effluent cell immune function in human subjects by standard PD fluid is attenuated by AlaGln supplementation.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Infectious complications of peritoneal dialysis (PD) remain the major causes for therapeutic failure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Peritonitis, in particular, is one of the main predictors of long-term morbidity and mortality in PD patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Several studies have shown currently available PD fluids (PDFs) to be bioincompatible due to acidity, buffer composition, high glucose content, hyperosmolarity, and presence of glucose degradation products<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Analyses of effects of PDF on peritoneal leukocyte function demonstrate reduced peritoneal immune-competence, potentially contributing to increased risk of PD-related peritonitis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. However, deciphering the complex interplay of inflammation, stress responses, and host defence requires application of both functional assays and powerful global analytic methods.</p><p id="Par3">The introduction of multi-chamber bags in PD has increased preclinical biocompatibility of PDF by allowing more physiologic fluid compositions and better sterilization procedures than achievable with single-chamber bags<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. However, a recent Cochrane meta-analysis on the use of biocompatible PDFs concluded that the rate of infectious complications was not significantly improved by these measures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. These data emphasize the ongoing medical need to understand and prevent infectious complications of PD.</p><p id="Par4">The prohibitive costs of clinical PD trials based on hard outcomes such as peritonitis require development of reliable surrogate outcome parameters for early clinical development of improved formulations of PDFs. In previous studies focusing on different aspects of systemic immune-competence, whole-blood culture assays were developed and cytokine content was analyzed in diluted heparinized blood after <italic>ex-vivo</italic> exposure to toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. This method as reported was sufficiently reproducible to detect meaningful changes in clinical trials of relatively small sample size<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. In the intensive care setting, <italic>ex-vivo</italic> cytokine release has been shown to correlate with clinical outcomes, establishing this functional assay as a useful biomarker for tests of novel therapeutic interventions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Interestingly, addition of glutamine results in improved post-operative <italic>ex-vivo</italic> cytokine release<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. A Cochrane meta-analysis on glutamine (Gln) supplementation of parenteral nutrition in critically ill patients demonstrated that systemic Gln administration reduced infection rate in this vulnerable patient population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. The use of comparable tools in clinical PD research, however, has not attained broad acceptance, likely reflecting high complexity and low practicability of the surrogate assays tested to date<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">Understanding the underlying molecular biological connections of such a test is of critical importance. Omics technologies represent an attractive approach for gaining insight into the complex mechanisms of PD-induced immune-suppression and its potential pathobiological effects on clinical outcomes. Transcriptomics techniques are currently the most widely used of these tools, with microarray-based techniques measuring normalized nucleotide sequence abundance values. In contrast, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) overcomes the limitations of genetic variation of patients and the complexity of transcriptional regulation by alternative splicing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Thereby RNA-seq allows de-novo analysis of miniscule amounts of cells as expected in PD effluents without prior definition of a consensus genome or transcripts of interest.</p><p id="Par7">In this study we test the feasibility of a simple method for monitoring function of peritoneal immune-competent cells in clinical practice, based on an adaptation of the <italic>ex-vivo</italic> lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated cytokine release assay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. We next use this streamlined assay in a randomized pilot-feasibility trial to assess effects of a novel PDF supplemented with the stable Gln dipeptide alanyl-glutamine (AlaGln). We then employ a multi-level transcriptomic approach to gain insight into the regulatory mechanisms leading to increased peritoneal immune-competence. The resultant increased understanding of potential cytoprotection targets should facilitate translation of this immune-modulatory approach into the clinical setting of PD.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Assay simplification</title><p id="Par8">Peritoneal cells for stimulation experiments were isolated by three increasingly simplified protocols (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>) from PD effluents after 4&#x02009;hour dwells from stable PD patients.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Bio-assay simplification.

</p><p id="Par13">Stimulated cytokine release in effluent samples was significantly influenced by dwell time, with lower values for IL-6 and TNF-&#x003b1; release observed in the 1-hour dwell samples and higher values in the overnight dwell effluent samples (16&#x02009;hours dwell time) (both <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05 vs. 4-hour dwell) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). Stimulated release of cytokines in effluent samples obtained at 4&#x02009;hours of dwell time was increased to an extent comparable to that previously observed in the test optimization phase.

The search for miRNA:mRNA interaction yielded 418 hits of which 117 could be assigned to genes included in significantly enriched pathways (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref> for genes; Suppl.

The miRNA:mRNA interactions associated with enriched pathway genes are visualized as a network (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>). Increased levels of specific miRNAs should reduce both expression and upregulation of the target genes of those miRNAs, and vice versa. Interestingly, the majority of identified miRNAs are down-regulated by AlaGln, consistent with up-regulation of the target genes of those miRNAs, as indicated by opposing color-gradients in the network.

LPS-stimulated cytokine release of whole blood has been successfully applied as a test for predicting clinical outcomes in intensive care unit patients post-surgery and/or trauma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. More than 10 years ago <italic>ex-vivo</italic> stimulated cytokine release was introduced to measure the function of peritoneal leukocytes. This test examined mainly macrophages isolated either from chilled overnight PD effluent or from fresh effluent from short dwells, and assessed cytokine secretion after TLR-stimulation by LPS or by serum-treated zymosan (STZ)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. However, this test has not yet achieved broad acceptance in PD outcome research, likely due to its impracticality in the clinical setting, to uncertain transferability from other disease models, and to incomplete understanding of underlying molecular mechanisms.</p><p id="Par25">The first part of our study thus set out to simplify this test by assessing <italic>ex-vivo</italic> stimulated cytokine release directly in crude PD effluents. Original procedures, i.e. stimulation of a defined number of cells following pre-analytic isolation, counting and concentration steps, were feasible only in a subgroup of stable patients. In contrast, stimulation of cells in a defined volume of effluent, with or without prior concentration by centrifugation, allowed assessment of <italic>ex-vivo</italic> stimulated cytokine release in all patients. Interestingly, absolute level of cytokine release remained almost unchanged despite the (~50-fold) lower cell density due to omission of pre-analytic concentration steps. This finding suggests that procedures for effluent cell isolation and/or concentration themselves dampened cell reactivity, and should thus be eliminated.</p><p id="Par26">As with whole blood stimulation, the volume of PD effluent rather than the number of responding cells was therefore held constant in the assay further developed in this study. Although adding inter-individual variation among, and intra-individual within PD patients over time, this may nonetheless amplify the diagnostic value of the measurements. Per-cell normalization for peritoneal effluent cell number in each sample, however, may be a challenge, as the type of responding cells cannot be adequately determined without reducing clinical feasibility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Variation of the cell count &#x02013; if disproportionate in magnitude to the cytokine release &#x02013; can lead to an apparently inconsistent trend as assessed by (non-normalized) cytokine levels. We therefore decided for the remainder of the study to assess and report both global and per-cell normalized immune responses. Direct measurement of global (rather than normalized) cytokine release in fresh peritoneal effluent exposed to TLR ligands (mimicking bacterial challenge) may be regarded as a composite surrogate outcome reflecting immune-competence in the peritoneal cavity. Certainly, cohort studies in larger PD collectives are needed to compare the utility of each readout of this test for prediction of risk of infectious complications/peritonitis in PD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par27">The next step in this study was to confirm the technical feasibility of the streamlined assay in a small independent PD population, and to obtain first evidence of its ability to discriminate sample dwell time and PD exposure to AlaGln-supplemented PD fluids.</p><p id="Par28">The assay revealed that global responses of PD effluent samples to TLR-stimulation were dwell time-dependent. The shortest dwell time resulted in lowest cytokine release from stimulated samples. As previously described for whole blood culture-based tests, the observed variation between samples obtained at different dwell times was in part due to variability in leukocyte counts, with numbers of responding cells increasing as dwell time increased. This variation, however, will likely have no relevance in the clinical application of this test, as sampling will ultimately be restricted to a single, well defined PET time point. For any given dwell time, the variability of peritoneal cell number was within the range previously shown in whole blood cultures to remain informative<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par29">When normalized for cell count, the effluent sample collected at the shortest dwell time still demonstrated the lowest increases in IL-6 and TNF-&#x003b1; upon TLR-stimulation. Dampened cellular responsiveness towards TLR-stimulation during earlier dwell times suggest the importance of additional factors possibly intrinsic to the PD effluent, as the non-physiologic composition of PDF was less well equilibrated at early dwell times<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. This early time window after dwell initiation might also be most relevant for an effective peritoneal host defence to stop the transition from bacterial contamination (<italic>e.g</italic>. from dialysate contamination by handling error) to peritonitis.</p><p id="Par30">The known protective effects of glutamine against infectious complications in immune compromised hosts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> prompted our assessment of PDF supplementation with AlaGln. Our simplified assay found significant effects of AlaGln supplementation on global IL-6 release in PD samples obtained from the early sampling time point of the PET, reflecting improved function of immune-competent peritoneal cells. Glutamine is an essential substrate for rapidly dividing cells of the immune system, and has been reported to increase numbers and improve function of lymphocytes and macrophages in varied <italic>in-vitro</italic> and <italic>in-vivo</italic> settings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Glutamine deficiency (glutamine levels markedly below normal serum levels) as present in the peritoneal cavity particularly during early dwell times with standard PDF, has been previously associated with increased vulnerability to stress through inadequate cellular stress response, impaired metabolism and immune-competence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Our results in this PD pilot trial are concordant with data from a recent first-in-man trial that described significantly enhanced LPS-stimulated cytokine release from peripheral blood mononuclear cells following incubation in PD effluent from patients treated with AlaGln<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Interestingly, the relative effects of AlaGln-supplementation on cytokine responses in these trials appeared comparable to those previously reported (between 70 and 260%) comparing double-chamber bag PDF to a standard single-chamber bag PDF<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Infection rates and patient outcomes among the critically ill are known to deteriorate in parallel with glutamine depletion and improve upon glutamine supplementation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. The degree of reduction in LPS-stimulated TNF-&#x003b1; production in cells from septic trauma patients was correlated with non-survival, whereas supplementation of parenteral nutrition with glutamine-containing dipeptides restored LPS-stimulated cytokine release following post-operative immune suppression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Additional studies with a larger population of PD patients will be required to validate the clinical impact of peritoneal immune-modulation by addition of AlaGln to PDF.</p><p id="Par31">To search for molecular mechanisms underlying the enhanced response to TLR-stimulation, the transcriptomes of peritoneal effluent cells harvested from PD patients undergoing randomized exposure to PDF or AlaGln-supplemented PDF were analyzed by next-generation sequencing-based RNA-seq for mRNA and by microarray-based analysis of miRNA. Until now, there are hardly any studies presenting transcriptome analysis of patient derived PD effluent cells. This is the first study that uses highly sensitive RNA-seq which allows system-wide characterization of biological processes and pathways in miniscule amounts of cells, harvested from clinical PD effluents. We identified transcripts from nearly 10,000 unique genes, and data obtained from PET samples separated by at least one month showed good reproducibility. The fact that an individual patient can be identified in the data by a characteristic transcriptomic signature also suggests that delineation of biomarker signatures from omics data might be a promising option for a precision medicine approach in PD.</p><p id="Par32">Pathway analysis of differentially abundant transcripts identified pathways attributable to stress responses, inflammation and immune-competence, fibrosis, and other pathways including peritoneal effluent cell biological processes not yet described in literature. In this study, we focused on pathways linked to immune signaling that might be highly relevant for peritoneal effluent cells. In particular, pathways linked to IL-6 signaling, to the IL-1 receptor and to IL-17 signaling were enriched in our dataset. Transcriptome analysis was repeated with more stringent cut-offs, in order to challenge the robustness of this analysis. Among those pathways that remained significantly enriched independent of number of input molecules was the IL-6 pathway, of specific interest since IL-6 is one of the reporter molecules of immune-competence in the <italic>ex-vivo</italic> TLR-stimulation assay. These results suggest that the responsiveness of peritoneal effluent cells upon maximal stimulation are primed by AlaGln addition. Therefore, our transcriptome data relate the functional results obtained with the streamlined assay to molecular mechanisms underlying enhanced response to TLR-stimulation. Unlike elevated basal levels of peritoneal IL-6 in PD patients, which predispose to membrane transformation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>, increased response to bacterial stimuli would more likely reduce peritonitis rates. However, further large scale trials are required to elucidate whether findings obtained in the settings of sepsis and other disorders can be translated to PD.</p><p id="Par33">Several of the differentially regulated genes within the identified inflammation and immune-response pathways corroborate with modulation of responsiveness to immune stimuli by AlaGln. Although similar effects have been described in the context of glutamine supplementation in other models, the precise mechanism is still unclear<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. As suggested by our data, the connection with G-protein signaling through regulator of G-protein signaling 4 (RGS4) and RGS16 might modulate leukocyte responsiveness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. G-protein signaling and its connection to the T<sub>H</sub>17 response might also link immune-modulatory effects of AlaGln and its recently reported anti-fibrotic properties<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. Notably, although AlaGln treatment up-regulated the majority of differentially abundant transcripts, those down-stream of IL-17 (CCL2 and TNF-&#x003b1;) were down-regulated by AlaGln, with TNF-&#x003b1; being at the center of one of the top identified interaction networks, consistent with mitigation of acute inflammation, a known immune-modulatory effect of glutamine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. IL-17 activation was recently also linked to the pro-fibrotic inflammatory state associated with <italic>in-vivo</italic> PDF exposure. This effect was abrogated by AlaGln addition to PDF<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. Confirmation of long-term effects on IL-6/IL-17 signaling-related increased immune-competence will require treatment of larger numbers of patients over more extended periods.</p><p id="Par34">We also analyzed non-coding RNAs with a focus on miRNAs. miRNAs are regulators of transcription and/or translation of multiple target gene products that are in turn subject to regulation by multiple miRNAs. The resulting complexity of interaction networks allows identification of important hubs of transcriptional regulation. The majority of miRNAs identified as differentially abundant were down-regulated. Concordantly, differentially expressed potential mRNA targets of these miRNAs were upregulated, consistent with functional interaction of the miRNAs and their target genes. The node with the highest number of targets regulated as predicted within enriched pathways was miR-29b. miR-29b related enriched pathways included genes related to IL-1R signaling, G-protein-signaling, Akt signaling and extracellular matrix processes. IL-1R signaling has been shown to mediate sterile inflammation in mesothelial cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. Circulating miR-29b and miR-21 have been proposed as biomarkers of PD homeostasis, as well as to join IL-6 in signaling between cancer cells and immune cells in co-culture<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. Our multi-level transcriptomics data are therefore consistent with peritoneal immune-modulation, at least for short-term administration of AlaGln during two dwells.</p><p id="Par35">In conclusion, our study has shown that measurement of <italic>ex-vivo</italic> stimulated cytokine release can be performed by a simple assay in fresh peritoneal effluent samples in the clinical setting of PD. This method for assessment of function of peritoneal immune-competent cells was found to be reproducible and stable in repeated short studies of cross-over design, suggesting that relatively small sample sizes may suffice to allow detection of statistically meaningful effects of novel interventions in clinical trials. Addition of AlaGln to PDF primed immune-modulatory transcriptional pathways and increased immune function responsiveness, while dampening effector transcripts. However, future studies in larger populations will be needed to investigate the clinical usefulness of this assay to predict the risk for infectious complications in PD patients, and to further assess and understand peritoneal and systemic immune-modulatory effects of prolonged use of AlaGln-supplemented PDF.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><p id="Par36">Standard chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St.Louis, MO, USA) if not specified otherwise.

RNA was isolated from cell pellets using Qiazol buffer and the miRNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) per manufacturer&#x02019;s protocol. One patient yielded insufficient RNA under one condition and was therefore excluded from paired analysis. RNA was checked for integrity with the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 and subjected to transcriptome analysis by next generation RNA-seq (Illumina TruSeq mRNA with single-end 50&#x02009;bp read length on a HiSeq 2000 (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA)) per manufacturer&#x02019;s protocol.</p><p id="Par49">The Raw sequencing data was processed to remove any adaptor, PCR primers and low quality transcripts using FASTQC and Trimomatic softwares, providing comprehensive estimates of sample quality on the basis of read quality, read length, GC content, uncalled bases, ratio of bases called, sequence duplication, adaptor and PCR primer contamination. Resulting high quality, clean reads were aligned against the hg19 reference human genome assembly using tophat2 and bowtie2 packages (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://tophat.cbcb.umd.edu/">http://tophat.cbcb.umd.edu/</ext-link>). Gene expression measurement was performed from aligned reads by counting unique reads. The read count based gene expression data was normalized on the basis of library complexity and gene variation. The normalized and log transformed count data was compared among groups in a paired manner using a negative binomial model to identify differentially expressed genes. The differentially expressed genes were identified on the basis of raw <italic>p-</italic>value and fold-change. Genes were considered significantly differentially expressed if the <italic>p</italic>-value was &#x0003c;0.05 and absolute fold change &#x0003e;1.5.

Preparation of cDNA, hybridization to the array and scanning were per manufacturer&#x02019;s protocols. Scanned array image quality was determined by standard Affymetrix metrics including background values, boxplots, MA plots and signals of spike in controls and were normalized with the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) algorithm (that includes background correction, quantile normalization and summarization transcript signal using the median polish algorithm). To identify differentially expressed genes, a linear model was implemented using linear model microarray analysis software Bioconductor R-package (LIMMA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. In LIMMA, all probes were ranked by t statistic using a pooled variance, a technique particularly suited to small numbers of samples per group.
