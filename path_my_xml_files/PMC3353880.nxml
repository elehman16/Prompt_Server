With this regimen, tablet taking was continuous for at least 24 days (&#x02018;mandatory phase&#x02019;); in this manner, the minimum cycle length was 28 days and the design of the COC was based on the approved and marketed conventional 24/4-day regimen of EE 20 &#x000b5;g/DRSP 3 mg (YAZ&#x000ae;; Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals). After the mandatory phase, the cycle could continue up to a maximum of 120 consecutive days (i.e. for a maximum cycle length of 124 days). A 4-day tablet-free interval had to be taken at the latest after 120 days of continuous tablet intake. Between Days 25 and 120 (&#x02018;flexible phase&#x02019;) women were instructed to observe a 4-day tablet-free interval if they experienced three consecutive days of bleeding and/or spotting.

During active hormonal intake, tablets could be taken in the morning or the evening, but the interval between two tablets had to remain as close as possible to 24 hours. If a woman missed a tablet she was to take it as soon as possible (even if this meant taking two tablets at the same time); thereafter, tablet intake was to continue as normal. With regard to the rules for the use of back-up contraception, a missed tablet was defined as tablet intake that was delayed by more than 24 hours.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s10"><title>Study outcomes</title><sec id="s11"><title>Primary outcomes</title><p>The main primary outcome was the total number of bleeding/spotting days during the 1-year comparative phase. The total number of bleeding/spotting days per subject was calculated by summing all of the days with a bleeding intensity of spotting or greater.</p><p>The other primary outcome was the number of observed unintended pregnancies with the flexible<sub>MIB</sub> regimen over the 2 years of treatment. (This variable was originally a secondary outcome, but was changed to a co-primary outcome based on a recommendation by the Food and Drug Administration during a scientific advisory meeting.) The number of observed unintended pregnancies was used to measure contraceptive efficacy, calculated using the Pearl Index (number of pregnancies divided by the exposure in woman-years multiplied by 100) and by life-table analysis. The Pearl Index was only calculated in women who received the flexible<sub>MIB</sub> regimen as the number of women in the other two groups were planned for a comparison of bleeding pattern and safety and were, therefore, not powered for a reliable calculation of the pregnancy rate. A life-table analysis was performed for the time to the occurrence of a pregnancy. The cumulative failure rate (i.e. the probability of getting pregnant) was calculated using the Kaplan&#x02013;Meier estimator on the basis of pregnancies that were considered to have occurred after up to 2 years of treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s12"><title>Secondary outcomes</title><p>Secondary outcomes included bleeding pattern and cycle control outcomes over the first year. Bleeding pattern parameters included the number and length of bleeding/spotting episodes and spotting-only episodes (days with bleeding/spotting or spotting only preceded and followed by at least two bleed-free days); these parameters were determined for each subject for 90-day reference periods. The first reference period started on the first day of study medication intake. Cycle control parameters included withdrawal bleeding, intracyclic bleeding, scheduled bleeding and unscheduled bleeding defined according to the different regimens (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>).

Randomisation blocks of 12 were used. Eligible subjects were assigned their randomisation numbers via an interactive voice response system to avoid any assignment bias in this open-label study.

It was also associated with a similarly significant reduction in the number of days of bleeding/spotting than the fixed extended regimen. In addition, the flexible<sub>MIB</sub> regimen showed good contraceptive efficacy similar to other COCs and was well tolerated.</p><p>The flexible<sub>MIB</sub> regimen had a more favourable effect on various aspects of menstrual bleeding than the two other regimens, including fewer bleeding/spotting days overall and fewer days with unscheduled bleeding. The reduction in bleeding/spotting days with the flexible<sub>MIB</sub> regimen compared with the conventional regimen was mainly related to 50% fewer days of menstruation-like bleeding. The reduction in bleeding/spotting days with the flexible<sub>MIB</sub> regimen compared with fixed extended regimen could be related to one-half the number of days with spotting only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Overall, the flexible<sub>MIB</sub> regimen was associated with a reduced proportion of bleeding days of any intensity; by one-third compared with the conventional regimen and potentially by one-third compared with the fixed extended regimen. In addition, the flexible<sub>MIB</sub> regimen appeared to be associated with less variation in the overall number of days of bleeding/spotting than the fixed extended regimen. On average, women taking the flexible<sub>MIB</sub> regimen can expect to have approximately 40 days of bleeding per year in comparison to approximately 65 days with the conventional regimen (corresponding to 5 days of bleeding per cycle).</p><p>The mean number of intracyclic bleeding/spotting days in recipients of the flexible<sub>MIB</sub> regimen seemed to be markedly lower than that in recipients of the fixed extended regimen. This may be because women who received the latter regimen were instructed to take 120 days of uninterrupted active hormonal intake irrespective of any bleeding/spotting. In contrast, women who received the flexible<sub>MIB</sub> regimen who experienced three consecutive days of bleeding/spotting during Days 25&#x02013;120 were instructed to observe a 4-day tablet-free interval; in this manner, the 3 days of bleeding/spotting that preceded the tablet-free interval became part of the bleeding episode of the withdrawal bleed. As such, the length of the whole bleeding episode in the flexible<sub>MIB</sub> group was prolonged by 3 days because of the stipulated &#x02018;wait and see&#x02019; period of three consecutive days of bleeding/spotting. Ultimately, this may translate into fewer bleeding days overall and better cycle control with fewer episodes of intracyclic bleeding, which could improve the acceptability of the flexible<sub>MIB</sub> regimen compared with the fixed extended regimen.</p><p>The acceptability of the flexible<sub>MIB</sub> regimen may also be influenced by the fact that the onset of bleeding could be managed, within the limitations of the regimen. With the flexible<sub>MIB</sub> regimen women could take treatment for 24 days, 120 days, or for an amount of time between 25 and 120 days, depending on the occurrence of bleeding/spotting. Although this study did not allow the flexible<sub>MIB</sub> regimen group to observe a 4-day tablet-free interval at any time between Days 25 and 120 (i.e. independent of the occurrence of bleeding/spotting), in clinical practice women may do so. In fact, in the flexible<sub>MIB</sub> group 5.9% of all cycles ended with a 4-day break during the flexible intake phase without the preceding days of intracyclic (breakthrough) bleeding. The importance to women of being able to manage their withdrawal bleeding should not be underestimated. Many women find menstrual bleeding both painful and inconvenient,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref> with 75.6%, 28.8% and 48.4% of women reporting that their menstrual bleeding interfered with their sex lives, work lives or sporting activities, respectively.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref> The freedom to decide when their menstrual bleeding occurs also appears to be important to women; data indicate that women using COCs will deviate from the recommended intake pattern in order to prevent bleeding during special occasions or holidays/weekends.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref> In the current study, approximately 20% of all cycles were of the maximum length of 124 days, indicating that around 80% of the intake cycles required flexibility in length in order to manage three consecutive days of bleeding/spotting.</p><p>In this study, the tolerability of the three regimens was comparable based on an assessment of AEs occurring during the first year of use and similar to those reported for other low-dose COCs, including EE 20 &#x003bc;g/DRSP 3 mg in a 24/4 regimen.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref> It should be noted that the type of AE reporting did not allow for an assessment of the frequency of AEs in an individual woman. A similar AE rate between the three groups, therefore, does not necessarily mean a similar frequency in individual women. As such, the expectation that menstrual-related complaints will occur less frequently when a woman has less frequent menstrual periods is not disproved by this finding. Four SAEs that were considered to be possibly related to study medication were recorded: focal nodular hyperplasia, uterine leiomyoma and two cases of DVT. A more comprehensive overview of the safety and tolerability of the three regimens investigated in the current study is reported elsewhere.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></p><p>Comparison of the bleeding profile of the flexible extended regimen in this study with fixed extended COC regimens is difficult, primarily because of the way in which treatment was administered and data were collected. Specifically, beyond the first 24 days of mandatory intake, cycle length with the flexible extended regimen was variable because women had to take a 4-day tablet-free interval between Days 25 and 120 if they experienced three consecutive days of bleeding/spotting; in contrast, in studies of fixed extended regimens, cycle length was fixed. Some previous studies have, however, reported the overall number of bleeding/spotting days. In a 1-year study, women were randomised to receive EE 30 &#x000b5;g/levonorgestrel (LNG) 150 &#x000b5;g in a 91-day extended regimen for four cycles (<italic>n</italic>=456) or EE 30 &#x000b5;g/LNG 150 &#x000b5;g in a 21/7 regimen for 13 cycles (<italic>n</italic>=226).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref> There was a reduced number of bleeding/spotting days in women who received the fixed extended regimen (median 35 days) versus the conventional 28-day regimen (median 53 days), similar to the findings reported here. The proportion of women on the EE/LNG fixed extended regimen who prematurely discontinued medication because of any AE or bleeding irregularities was 14.9% and 7.7%, respectively. In the current study these values were lower: 6.4% and 1.2% with the flexible<sub>MIB</sub> regimen, respectively. In a second study, women received EE 20 &#x003bc;g/LNG 100 &#x003bc;g (<italic>n</italic>=16) administered for 168 days without a pill-free interval or as six 28-day cycles (<italic>n</italic>=16) on an open-label basis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref> Over the course of the study, women on the fixed extended regimen had a mean of 25.9&#x000b1;29.2 days of bleeding/spotting. In a similarly designed, double-blind study, in which 31 women received EE 20 &#x003bc;g/norethindrone acetate 1 mg for 168 days, 31.5&#x000b1;21.8 days of vaginal bleeding were reported.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref> It should be noted that the latter two studies were conducted over 168 days, whereas bleeding outcomes in the current study are reported for a full year.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s25"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The results of this study show that EE/DRSP administered as a flexible<sub>MIB</sub> regimen is associated with fewer days of bleeding/spotting and fewer withdrawal bleeding episodes over 1 year compared with the same hormonal combination in a conventional 28-day regimen. It also appeared to provide fewer spotting days compared with the same combination in a fixed extended 124-day regimen. The flexible<sub>MIB</sub> regimen provides reliable contraceptive efficacy, and has a comparable tolerability profile to the conventional and fixed extended regimens. The flexible<sub>MIB</sub> regimen is unique in that it extends the menstrual cycle and provides women with the flexibility to manage their intracyclic (breakthrough) bleeding.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank Lyndal Staples and Clare Wheatcroft of <italic>in</italic>Science Communications for medical writing support and Bodo Kirsch of Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals for statistical support.
