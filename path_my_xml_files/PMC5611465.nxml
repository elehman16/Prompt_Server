Studies of mucosal immunity induced by oral poliovirus (OPV) or inactivated poliovirus (IPV) vaccines and mixed schedules thereof will determine the effectiveness of different vaccine strategies to block virus shedding. We used samples from a clinical trial of different vaccination schedules to measure intestinal immunity as judged by neutralisation of virus and virus-specific IgA in stools.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In the FIDEC trial, Latin American infants were randomly assigned to nine groups to assess the efficacy of two schedules of bivalent OPV (bOPV) and IPV and challenge with monovalent type 2 OPV, and stools samples were collected. We selected three groups of particular interest&#x02014;the bOPV control group (serotypes 1 and 3 at 6, 10, and 14 weeks), the trivalent attenuated OPV (tOPV) control group (tOPV at 6, 10, and 14 weeks), and the bOPV&#x02013;IPV group (bOPV at 6, 10, and 14 weeks plus IPV at 14 weeks). Neutralising activity and poliovirus type-specific IgA were measured in stool after a monovalent OPV type 2 challenge at 18 weeks of age. Mucosal immunity was measured by in-vitro neutralisation of a type 2 polio pseudovirus (PV2). Neutralisation titres and total and poliovirus-type-specific IgG and IgA concentrations in stools were assessed in samples collected before challenge and 2 weeks after challenge from all participants.</p></sec><sec><title>Findings</title><p>210 infants from Guatemala and Dominican Republic were included in this analysis. Of 38 infants tested for mucosal antibody in the tOPV group, two were shedding virus 1 week after challenge, compared with 59 of 85 infants receiving bOPV (p&#x0003c;0&#x000b7;0001) and 53 of 87 infants receiving bOPV&#x02013;IPV (p&#x0003c;0&#x000b7;0001). Mucosal type 2 neutralisation and type-specific IgA were noted primarily in response to tOPV. An inverse correlation was noted between virus shedding and both serum type 2 neutralisation at challenge (p&#x0003c;0&#x000b7;0001) and mucosal type 2 neutralisation at challenge (p&#x0003c;0&#x000b7;0001).</p></sec><sec><title>Interpretation</title><p>Mucosal type-2-specific antibodies can be measured in stool and develop in response to receipt of OPV type 2 either in the primary vaccine series or at challenge.

The cessation of the use of OPV type 2 and the substitution of at least one dose of IPV occurred as planned globally in April and May, 2016.</p><p>These recommendations, made in 2012, were based on expert opinion and the epidemiological situation of poliovirus transmission, but no immunogenicity and safety data for bOPV&#x02013;IPV routine immunisation schedules compared with tOPV immunisation schedules&#x02014;particularly the effects on intestinal immunity against type 2 Sabin virus&#x02014;were available to inform them. The IPV and OPV both prevent paralytic poliomyelits in the vaccine recipient, and both have interrupted transmission, although the impact of IPV on transmission has largely been reported in developed countries. Mucosal immunity is presumed to have a key role in limitation of enteric and pharyngeal infection with poliovirus, and hence could be crucial in diminishing the efficiency of transmission. Yet the notion that IPV will be central to maintenance of eradication is based on the potential development of vaccine-associated paralytic polio in OPV recipients,<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> chronic OPV infection in immunodeficient vaccine recipients,<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> and circulation of vaccine-derived polioviruses.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref></p><p><boxed-text id="cetextbox10"><caption><title>Research in context</title></caption><p><bold>Evidence before this study</bold></p><p>We searched PubMed with the term &#x0201c;polio mucosal immunity&#x0201d; for articles published in English between Jan 31, 1975, and Dec 31,2015. We identified several studies in which virus shedding after oral challenge was used as a surrogate for mucosal immunity, but very few in which investigators attempted to measure IgA specific antibody in the stool and none in which neutralising antibody in the stool was successfully measure and correlated with virus recovery on oral poliovirus challenge.</p><p><bold>Added value of this study</bold></p><p>We present the first data showing the impact of trivalent attenuated oral poliovirus vaccine (tOPV), bivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (bOPV), and a combination of bOPV and inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) on intestinal immunity against type 2 poliovirus when administered according to the Expanded Program on Immunization schedule and document the effect of that immunity on subsequent challenge with the proposed outbreak response tool of the future, monovalent oral poliovirus vaccine (mOPV) type 2. Immunity is measured by restriction of virus shedding, neutralisation of virus in the stool, and mOPV type 2 IgA specific antibody. The correlations of each with the other strengthens the concept that we now have tools to measure mucosal immunity and predict the effectiveness of a vaccine regimen in limiting outbreaks as we approach polio eradication.</p><p><bold>Implications of the available evidence</bold></p><p>Our novel data have direct and immediate global policy implications and point to the unique ability of tOPV to stimulate mucosal immunity, the dissociation of serum and mucosal antibody responses, and the crucial role of mucosal immunity in preventing infection on an mOPV type 2 challenge. They provide support for the global withdrawal of type-2-containing oral poliovirus vaccines to eliminate the only source of paralytic disease caused by this serotype, and show that, although IPV is highly protective against paralytic disease in the individual vaccinee, it has only a small effect on subsequent virus shedding and thus could allow a continued train of transmission. Our data will help national, regional, and global policy makers to develop public health strategies to achieve and sustain polio eradication in the near term and long term.</p></boxed-text></p><p>The comparative ability of OPV and IPV to induce mucosal immunity has been explored since the early days of polio research.

Studies of mucosal immunity induced by OPV, IPV, and mixed schedules will define the best strategy, not only for prevention of paralytic disease, but also for the true eradication of all circulating poliovirus. The lack of definitive information in this area was shown in 2013 by leaders in the field, who expressed very diverse views on the effectiveness of IPV in limiting virus replication at mucosal sites and thus preventing transmission.<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> Previous studies have yet to link mucosal responses measured by current immunological techniques to the type of vaccine given or to virus shedding on challenge. To address this gap in knowledge, we measured polio-specific mucosal IgA responses and virus-neutralising capacity of stool samples and correlated these findings with vaccine regimen and virus shedding on OPV challenge.</p></sec><sec id="cesec20"><title>Methods</title><sec id="cesec30"><title>Study design and participants</title><p>The FIDEC study (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="ctgov:NCT01831050" id="interrefs10">NCT 01831050</ext-link>) was designed to explore the safety, immunogenicity, and protective efficacy of combinations of IPV and OPV in anticipation of the elimination of type 2 OPV from global vaccination use. Infants in the study were randomly assigned to nine groups to assess the efficacy of two schedules of bOPV and IPV and challenge with monovalent type 2 OPV. Stool samples were collected during the FIDEC trial as reported<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> and provided to us so that we could analyse mucosal responses. Because of the large number of samples collected and the complexity of the analyses, stool specimens were specifically selected from three non-overlapping groups of particular scientific interest: the bOPV control group, in which 210 infants received bOPV (serotypes 1 and 3) at 6, 10, and 14 weeks, followed by challenge with mOPV type 2 at 18 weeks; the tOPV control group, in which 100 infants received tOPV at 6, 10, and 14 weeks, with mOPV type 2 challenge at 18 weeks; and the bOPV&#x02013;IPV group, in which 210 infants received bOPV at 6, 10, and 14 weeks and one dose of the IPV at 14 weeks, with mOPV type 2 challenge at 18 weeks.

The same measurements were done on samples collected weekly for the first 4 weeks after challenge from 49 randomly chosen participants by the Dartmouth team (before any knowledge of group allocation). Serum neutralisation titres before challenge and a week later, and virus shedding weekly after challenge, were measured at the Polio and Picornavirus Laboratory Branch of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Atlanta, GA, USA).

We used ANOVA to compare the geometric means of observed virus shedding, stool and serum neutralisation titres, and mucosal IgA concentrations across the three groups. Differences between pairs of groups and between visits within each group were compared with Tukey's honest significant difference method&#x02014;a simultaneous comparison of all pairwise means that identifies differences between two means that are greater than the expected SE and is robust when sample sizes are unequal between groups.

A correlation of virus shedding with mucosal IgA was not noted (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">figure 7C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="cesec80"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our results suggest that mucosal neutralising type-2-specific antibody, generated by previous serotype-specific OPV exposure, highly corresponds with resistance to challenge with mOPV type 2. Although type-2-specific serum neutralising antibody also influenced the initial replication of mOPV type 2 after challenge, further amplification of this response by inclusion of a dose of IPV in the immunisation regimen (ie, in the bOPV&#x02013;IPV group) did not further reduce virus recovery. Restriction of virus shedding after mOPV type 2 challenge was linked to previous receipt of homotypic OPV (tOPV). Additionally, little if any immunity to type 2 mOPV was induced by receipt of heterotypic bOPV. Although unlikely, resistance to mOPV type 2 challenge could be due to induction of some other type of protective immunity unrelated or additional to the observed mucosal and serum neutralisation responses. Because the number of infants in the tOPV group who shed virus after challenge was quite small, we were unable to rigorously implicate mucosal antibody as the key protective factor within that group. In general, discerning the relative contribution of mucosal or serum neutralisation responses to the recorded restriction of virus shedding was complicated by the limited number of infants shedding virus after immunisation with tOPV; confounding serum and mucosal antibody responses that were not attributable to vaccine receipt in the trial and were noted in infants from all groups; and a general concordance of the mucosal and serum neutralising responses after immunisation with tOPV.</p><p>Furthermore, we conclude that serum neutralising antibody, the traditional measure of vaccine-induced immunity, is a limited determinant of virus replication in the intestinal tract. This observation is crucial to decisions about future approaches to elimination of poliovirus circulation and sustainment of a polio-free world. The experience in Israel, where sustained circulation of wild-type polio occurred in a population highly immunised with IPV,<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> provides further evidence of the importance of adopting an endgame vaccine regimen for the interim that also induces mucosal immunity.</p><p>Together with our preceding study,<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> in this study we establish a unique method to measure strain-specific mucosal antibody responses to poliovirus that reveals functionality (virus neutralisation) at very high titres (often &#x02265;512) equivalent to those measured in serum. Previous attempts to measure mucosal immunity have largely focused on measurements of binding antibody, primarily of the IgA class. Luminex provides a state-of-the-art platform for polio-specific IgA determination. Substantial difficulties have also been encountered in development of reproducible assays to assess virus neutralisation mediated by respiratory, genital, or enteric specimens. Aside from the recognised complications of sample variability during collection, processing, and assaying, measurement of functional activity in biological assays is fraught with challenges associated with cellular toxicity or cell culture contamination by the specimen, or both. Most of these shortcomings are subverted by the rapid readout of the polio pseudovirus assay, which provides a sensitive and reproducible means of assessing neutralisation after a single cycle of virus replication.<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref></p><p>Several questions remain unanswered. First, what is the origin of the serum and mucosal neutralising responses seen in the bOPV group before OPV type 2 challenge, which theoretically had not yet received any type 2 vaccine? Serum responses could indicate residual maternal antibody or antibody acquired during intercurrent infection, although efforts were made to avoid any secondary exposure to vaccine virus in the family setting. Mucosal antibody responses might also reflect variation in sample collection, storage, or residual maternal breast milk antibody. Second, what mediates the early neutralising response noted on challenge? IgA is assumed to be the major mediator of mucosal immunity.<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> If so, why was there not a better correlation between the height of mucosal neutralisation and IgA concentrations at challenge and the amount of virus shedding 1 week later? In determining virus titre, the samples were frozen on collection and treated with chloroform immediately after thawing. We have shown that chloroform rapidly inactivates antibody. Thus neutralisation has little opportunity to occur in the limited timeframe between evacuation and sample processing. With respiratory syncytial virus, mucosal antibody was found bound to cell-associated virus in secretions and only later were investigators able to detect free antibody.<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> The poorly defined site or sites of replication of poliovirus in the enteric tract (eg, Peyer's patches) could make the virus inaccessible to antibody secreted into the intestinal lumen.<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> Furthermore, we would conclude that the induction of immunity noted 1 week after challenge is not necessarily indicative of priming, because it was reported in children who were undergoing their initial exposure to type 2 vaccine. Finally, the duration of mucosal immunity is unknown, but we suspect it to be shorter than that of serum antibody, and thus the protection recorded almost certainly will wane.<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> In this study, we could not address duration or the concept that previous OPV mucosal immunity is boosted by IPV.<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref></p><p>In summary, another tool has been added to assessments of immunity after receipt of polio vaccines. Our findings move beyond the initial observation that OPV is a much better mucosal immunogen than IPV, as evidenced by greater inhibition of virus replication upon challenge, and show a mechanism by which this anti-viral activity might occur. In defining a mechanism for measuring mucosal immunity for polio, there is a mandate to extend these observations and apply these findings to other live virus vaccines that are either in clinical use (eg, influenza, rotavirus) or actively under development (eg, respiratory syncytial virus).</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="bibl10"><title>References</title><ref
