At the time of the conduct of the present trial, over a third of Canadians between the ages of 18 and 74&#x000a0;years had hypertension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]; and despite the fact that only a fraction of these individuals were being treated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], prescription drugs used in the treatment of hypertension are the leading therapeutic category of prescription drugs in Canada, accounting for 20&#x000a0;% of total prescription drug sales [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Decisions concerning the medical management of hypertension therefore have the potential to have a significant impact on health care costs.</p><p id="Par11">Initial treatment of hypertension with thiazide diuretics has been shown to significantly reduce morbidity and mortality, with benefits at least as great as with other classes of antihypertensive drugs, at less cost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Yet in Canada and elsewhere, there is evidence of low adherence to published recommendations that thiazides be used as the first-line treatment for patients with uncomplicated hypertension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The cost to patients and insurers may be high: one study estimated savings of $13.8 million (in US dollars in the year 2000) for Canada (year 2000 population 31,281,100) by using thiazides as the first-line antihypertensive drug [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Since most individuals with hypertension were not being treated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], more aggressive screening and treatment of hypertension would markedly increase the number of prescriptions and thus the beneficial economic impact of choosing thiazides over other antihypertensive treatment.</p><p id="Par12">Printed educational messages (PEMs) directed to physicians are one way to address health care gaps that are under physician influence. While PEMs have the advantages of low cost and easy dissemination, there is great uncertainty about their effects. Several early systematic reviews concluded that printed materials, on their own, do not lead to change in physician practices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. However, Grimshaw observed that the median effect in the RCTs where guidelines were disseminated as PEMs was 8.1&#x000a0;% absolute risk reduction (range +3.6 to +17.0&#x000a0;%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], on par with other much more expensive interventions like audit and feedback or academic outreach, and this result was the main stimulus for the current trial. A subsequent larger review of PEMs observed a smaller effect size, showing a median absolute risk difference of 0.02 (range 0 to 0.11) in seven RCTs reporting categorical outcomes and a standardized mean difference of 0.13 (range &#x02212;0.16 to 0.36) in three RCTs reporting continuous outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. A recent review of trials of PEMs for improving physician behaviour specifically in primary care settings did not show significant improvement in physician behaviour across included trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par13">The uncertainty in the evidence leaves policy makers uncertain about the role of PEMs, at a time when closing evidence-to-practice gaps has become a more cost-effective investment of health system resources than developing new interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par14">Reviews cannot overcome limitations of the primary evidence: the small number of trials (of varying size) and methodological weaknesses (insufficient power to detect modest effects, unit of analysis errors). Thus, there is a need for a pragmatic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], randomized controlled trial on the effect of PEMs on guideline adherence, conducted in real-world settings, on typical practitioners, taking into account group practices. Given the simplicity and low cost of PEM-based practice change programs, and the large population impact that even modest improvements may achieve when applied to all potential beneficiaries, a large trial is needed.</p><p id="Par15">We developed and used four criteria to identify important evidence/practice gaps in Ontario primary care on which to test the impact of PEMs in a pragmatic trial: the gap is large and important to patients; it involves a common disorder; evidence-based practice is not constrained by structural or financial barriers; and process indicators exist that are measurable using the administrative datasets available to us.</p><p id="Par16">The present study addresses these criteria by targeting first-line treatment of uncomplicated hypertension using a thiazide diuretic. This clearly qualifies as an important primary care gap involving a common disorder not constrained by structural or financial barriers and for which routinely collected administrative data could be used to evaluate an intervention. If the above-mentioned modest impact on clinical practice of PEMs is applied, then at the trivial cost of a letter to each physician, Ontario&#x02019;s health care system stands to save over $1 million, at current levels of treatment of hypertension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], with correspondingly greater savings if identification and treatment of hypertension is improved. The Ontario Printed Educational Materials (OPEM) trial aimed to evaluate different forms of PEMs: long inserts compared to shorter bullet-pointed outserts and different forms of outserts. We hypothesized that active arms would be superior to control, that individually, different forms of PEMs would be similarly effective on prescribing thiazides, and would be more effective when combined and when developed using a theory of behaviour.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>The interventions</title><p id="Par17">
<italic>informed</italic> was a free, peer-reviewed, evidence-based practice synopsis, mailed to nearly 15,000 primary care providers in Ontario from 1994 to January 2007 (when publication ceased). Articles were developed by clinical and research staff from the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences (ICES).</p><p id="Par18">Two types of PEMs addressed the identified evidence-practice gap: a two-page article, indistinguishable from the rest of the newsletter in size and style (the &#x0201c;insert&#x0201d;) and two versions of a short, directive, evidence-based PEM on a postcard-sized card stapled to the front page of <italic>informed</italic> (the &#x0201c;outsert&#x0201d;). The insert and one of the versions of the outsert (the atheoretical outsert) were developed without any explicit theory of action using input from a diverse group of physicians who identified barriers to evidence-based practice and from a communications expert. The second outsert (the theory of planned behaviour-based outsert) was developed by a group consisting of three health psychologists and two implementation researchers with experience using theories of behaviour. Full details about the development process for this outsert are described in the study protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The addition of the &#x0201c;theory of planned behaviour-based&#x0201d; outsert allowed us to test the hypothesis that a message inspired by a psychological theory, specifically the <italic>theory of planned behaviour</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] (TPB), would be more effective in changing clinical behaviour toward more evidence-based practice than a message designed without an explicit theoretical basis.

In order to ensure that the cohort included only individuals newly treated for hypertension, individuals who had filled a prescription for any antihypertensive medication in the year prior to the intervention were also excluded [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Only the first prescription for an antihypertensive filled during the observation year was included; all prescriptions filled on the same day were taken into consideration when determining the outcome. While data were available for individuals 65&#x000a0;years and over, all individuals included in the study were at least 66&#x000a0;years old at the time they filled their first prescription for an antihypertensive medication in order to ensure that information covering a 1-year look back period for prior prescriptions was available.</p><p id="Par30">Using the OHIP physician claims database, we identified the physician seen during the 14&#x000a0;days prior to and including the date the antihypertensive prescription was filled. In some cases, more than one study physician was selected. (Patients who had not visited any of the study physicians during the 14-day period were not included in the analysis.)

A &#x0201c;successful&#x0201d; outcome was a first-line prescription for a thiazide and no other antihypertensive medication. Combinations of a thiazide plus potassium or a potassium-sparing medication were counted as a &#x0201c;success&#x0201d;; combinations of a thiazide plus another diuretic were counted as a &#x0201c;failure&#x0201d;.

Based on pilot data, Monte Carlo simulations, assuming an intracluster correlation coefficient of 0.092, three patients per physician, a baseline success rate of 0.36 and absolute intervention effects of 0.05, 0.075 and 0.10, demonstrated that a trial with 1250 practices per arm would provide over 97&#x000a0;% power to detect a 5&#x000a0;% increase, and over 98&#x000a0;% power to distinguish between the effects of the combined intervention and either alone, assuming the combined effect to be additive. This original power calculation was based on testing the effectiveness of the insert and one version of the outsert. We conducted a follow-up simulation to assess whether we could test a second version of the outsert (theory of planned behaviour-based), which suggested that the power would be greater than 80&#x000a0;%.

This strength also imposes some limitations, one of which is the inability to study non-fee-for-service physicians. However, it is estimated that only 2&#x000a0;% of Ontario primary care physicians were on alternative payment plans whose billings did not appear in OHIP claims at the time of the study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p id="Par51">A second limitation imposed by reliance on administrative data is that we cannot differentiate between failure of the PEM to be delivered, read or remembered, failure of the physician to advise the patient and failure of the patient to act on that advice. While the Canadian postal service is highly reliable, and the addresses used are equally so, it is possible that, despite the widely recognized brand of <italic>informed</italic> as an evidence-based newsletter from a respected research institute (rather than a product marketing leaflet), it may not have been received by study physicians. This is a possible fate for all PEMs and so does not detract from our main conclusion that PEMs do not change practice.</p><p id="Par52">From the perspective of patient health, interventions are useful only if they affect the treatment the patient receives. This was a pragmatic trial, designed to give a definitive answer about the value of a particular mode of information transmission for the purpose of improving health care. The trial was not designed to explain the barriers that remained. We did however investigate the reasons that may explain the lack of observed effect in a theory-based process evaluation conducted alongside the trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par53">Consistent with systematic review findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], this study supports the conclusion that PEMs, whether long and discursive, or short and directive, and whether based on a theory of behaviour or no theory at all, did not, on their own, bring about an effective change in physician prescribing, even in the absence of financial and structural barriers to change.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec17"><title>Additional file</title><p id="Par60">
