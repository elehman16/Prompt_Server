The incidence of the disease is about 3 per 1000 persons per year.<sup><xref rid="bibr36-2325967113505433" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup>
</p><p>This disease is common in the fourth decade of life, with a frequent consequence being absence from work for several weeks or months and even change of occupation. In the literature, local injury, aging, and overuse have been mentioned as causes of lateral epicondylitis.<sup><xref rid="bibr11-2325967113505433" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="bibr14-2325967113505433" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="bibr21-2325967113505433" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="bibr26-2325967113505433" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="bibr34-2325967113505433" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup>
</p><p>The diagnosis is mainly a clinical one. Tenderness on the lateral epicondyle and exacerbation of pain by resisted extension of the wrist with the elbow extended (Thomsen test) suggest affection of the extensor carpi radialis brevis (ECRB) and extensor carpi radialis longus (ECRL). Affection of the extensor digitorum communis (EDC) can be tested by resisted active extension of the middle finger. A number of conditions may be associated with pain laterally on the elbow, including posterior interosseous nerve entrapment syndrome, osteochondritis dissecans, varus instability, osteoarthritis, radial tunnel syndrome, posterior lateral rotatory instability, lateral plica syndrome, and cervical and shoulder pathology.</p><p>A routine radiographic examination (anteroposterior and lateral views) is important to rule out alternative lesions such as tumors and osteoarthritis. Radiographs may show enthesopathic exostosis, loose bodies, or evidence of past fracture. Calcification in the region of the lateral epicondyle has been reported in up to 7% of cases, a finding that does not alter the treatment strategy.<sup><xref rid="bibr34-2325967113505433" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup>
</p><p>Lateral epicondylitis is a degenerative condition associated with angiofibroplastic hyperplasia.<sup><xref rid="bibr21-2325967113505433" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> However, many treatment approaches are based on the view that it is an inflammation. Most patients respond to conservative management, and only 5% to 10% of patients require surgery.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-2325967113505433" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> There are more than 40 methods for treating lateral epicondylitis, but no particular one is recognized as being superior.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-2325967113505433" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="bibr11-2325967113505433" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Conservative treatment, such as rest, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), stretching, splinting, local injections of corticosteroid,<sup><xref rid="bibr14-2325967113505433" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> and shock wave therapy<sup><xref rid="bibr12-2325967113505433" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="bibr24-2325967113505433" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> have been reported with varying results. In several studies, the treatment of chronic elbow extensor&#x02013;origin tendinosis with buffered platelet-rich plasma (PRP) reduced pain significantly.<sup><xref rid="bibr13-2325967113505433" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="bibr18-2325967113505433" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="bibr19-2325967113505433" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>
</p><p>A percutaneous soft tissue release for treating lateral epicondylitis was reported by Lin et al<sup><xref rid="bibr15-2325967113505433" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> with beneficial effects. Surgical procedures consisting of the release of the extensor tendon, epicondylar resection, and the excision and debridement of affected tissue are reported to render good to excellent results in up to 90% of patients.<sup><xref rid="bibr21-2325967113505433" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="bibr22-2325967113505433" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>
</p><p>Tasto et al<sup><xref rid="bibr30-2325967113505433" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> reported that radiofrequency (RF)-based microtenotomy could be employed as a safe and effective procedure for the treatment of chronic tendinosis. The treatment goal is to initiate healing by stimulating angiogenic responses. Bipolar RF-based microtenotomy is thought to induce healing by a controlled inflammatory response, followed by the stimulation of angiogenic healing in the tendon.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-2325967113505433" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> In opposition to this, it has been reported that RF incites a healing response mediated by growth factors and cytokines,<sup><xref rid="bibr37-2325967113505433" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> while Takahashi et al<sup><xref rid="bibr29-2325967113505433" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> suggested that RF induces acute degeneration and/or ablation of sensory nerve fibers, which might explain the early pain relief after RF microtenotomy for tendinopathy.</p><p>The aim of this study was to make a medium-term evaluation of patients with recalcitrant lateral epicondylitis, comparing the results after open release and microtenotomy in a prospective, randomized trial. The hypothesis was that microtenotomy would provide good medium-term pain relief that was as good as that for the open release method.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="section1-2325967113505433"><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Twenty-four patients (11 women, 13 men) with tendinosis in the lateral epicondyle of the elbow, who were randomized using closed envelopes to either open release or microtenotomy between 2006 and 2007, were assessed after 5 to 7 years. The study was approved by the Regional Ethics Committee at the University of Troms&#x000f8;, Norway. The mean age was 49.2 years (range, 36-62 years) in the release group and 46.2 years (range, 30-64 years) in the microtenotomy group. The mean symptom duration in the release group was 28 months (range, 12-60 months; standard deviation [SD], 14.3 months), while it was 22 months (range, 12-50 months; SD, 9.7 months) in the microtenotomy group (not significant).</p><p>All patients had completed at least 1 year of conservative therapy before they were considered for surgical intervention. This included multiple injections with corticosteroids, oral medication with NSAIDs for several weeks without improvement, and physical therapy, which had been prescribed by the primary health care facility over a period of at least 3 months.</p><p>Eleven patients underwent surgery with extensor tendon release and repair, while 13 patients were operated on with microtenotomy using a Topaz Micro Debrider electrode (ArthroCare, Austin, Texas, USA).</p><p>Patients with cancer, severe organic diseases, seriously reduced general health status, or those with an unclear diagnosis with diffuse pain were excluded. All operations were performed by the first author (KM). Routine radiographic examinations of the affected elbow were performed preoperatively.

First, an approximately 3- to 4-cm incision was centered slightly distal to the lateral epicondyle, and the origin of the common extensor was exposed by dissection. Violation of the joint capsule was avoided. The interval between the ECRL and EDC was identified and widened by a small incision in line with the fibers, exposing the ECRB deeper and posterior to the ECRL. The proximal origin of the ECRB was released from its attachment. In some cases, the EDC was fibrillated and discolored, and it was released in a manner similar to the ECRB. The exposed fibrous-like granulation tissue was then removed with a curette or periosteal sleeve. The lateral epicondyle was decorticated. The tendon was repaired using a side-to-side suture technique without tension. The extensor aponeurosis was then closed before wound closure. A soft dressing was applied to the elbow. Pain permitting, postoperative mobilization was encouraged.</p><p>For the microtenotomy procedure, an incision approximately 3 cm in length was made over the affected epicondyle to expose the involved extensor tendon. The electrode, which was connected to a sterile isotonic saline flow system, was used for the microtenotomy. An RF apparatus provided the energy delivered through the electrode. The electrode was placed on the tendon perpendicular to its surface. The routine consisted of performing RF applications on the tendon in a grid-like pattern where each stimulated spot was placed 5 mm from the neighboring one. First, 2 to 3 light touches were made, followed by penetration of the tendon to a depth of 3 to 5 mm, depending on tendon thickness.<sup><xref rid="bibr30-2325967113505433" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> The activation time for the electrode is fixed by the manufacturer at 0.5 seconds.
