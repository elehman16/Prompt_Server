Bronchial blockers (BBs), such as Univent blocker, Arndt blocker,<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup> Cohen blocker, Uniblocker, EZ blocker, and Coopdech blocker, have more advantages than the DLT: easier insertion, especially in patients with difficult airway,<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup> and no need to exchange the tube when mechanical ventilation is required after surgery. However, in many studies, the BBs required more time for correct placement when compared with the left-sided DLT.<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup></p><p>Recently, 2 studies show us that extraluminal use of the Arndt pediatric endobronchial blocker is an easier and more reliable method of attaining OLV in infants and small children.<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup> However, to our knowledge, there has been no prospective study comparing the effectiveness and safety issues of extraluminal use of the Uniblocker in adult patients. Thus, we designed this study to evaluate the feasibility and safety issues of extraluminal use of the Uniblocker for OLV in adult patients undergoing left thoracic surgery.</p></sec><sec><label>2</label><title>Patients and methods</title><sec><label>2.1</label><title>Study population</title><p>This study was approved by the local medical ethics committee of the first hospital of Qinhuangdao (Approval Number: 20160521), and written informed consent was obtained from all patients.

These codes were kept in sequentially numbered opaque envelopes and stored at the site of investigation until the end of the study.</p><p>All patients in 2 groups without premedication were received standard monitoring systems in the operating room, including invasive arterial blood pressure, heart rate (HR), electrocardiogram, and peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>).</p><p>Patients were placed in a supine position and preoxygenated for 3&#x0200a;minutes.

After passing the glottis, the Uniblocker was advanced toward the left mainstem bronchus until slight resistance was encountered, then a SLT with appropriate size (male: 8.0&#x0200a;mm, female: 7.5&#x0200a;mm) was intubated via video laryngoscope into the appropriate depth. After determine of the tube within the trachea, the cuff of SLT was inflated and the tube was fixed firmly at the patient's mouth with cloth tape. Before correct the position of Uniblocker, the cuff of SLT was deflated for pushing and twisting Uniblocker more freely. When correct the position of Uniblocker, the FOB (external diameter 3.8mm; MDHAO Medical Technology Co, Ltd, Zhuhai, China) was inserted into the tracheal tube and the Uniblocker was guided to the correct position under direct vision of FOB (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>B and C).

The Uniblocker was advanced through the SLT and directed to the left mainstem bronchus at sufficient depth, and then FOB was inserted into the SLT.

However, in the study by Campos and Kernstine,<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup> the time of initial tube placement for Univent bronchial blocker (UBB) took 158&#x0200a;seconds (from the tube past the vocal cords until satisfactory placement of the UBB). Narayanaswamy et al<sup>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup> found that the intubation time (from beginning of laryngoscopy to lung isolation) for the Uniblocker was 213&#x0200a;seconds, which required an average of 110&#x0200a;seconds longer than that for the left-sided DLT. This may be due to the anatomical reason that the left mainstem bronchus continues at a bigger angle and slender than right one. The data of Patel et al's<sup>[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup> study suggested that the trachea does not merely branch in the horizontal plane, but branches posteriorly as well.</p><p>In our study, the time for the placement of Uniblocker in intraluminal use of group was 153&#x0200a;seconds (intubation time add correct positioning time), which was similar to previous study,<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup> whereas in extraluminal use of group, the time of placement of Uniblocker was 109&#x0200a;seconds (intubation time add correct positioning time), which was obviously shorter than that in I group. The reasons may be that the internal diameter of SLT commonly used is 8.0 to 8.5&#x0200a;mm for male and 7.0 to 7.5&#x0200a;mm for female, the outer diameter of Uniblocker for adult patients is 3&#x0200a;mm, and the outer diameter of FOB commonly used is 3 to 5&#x0200a;mm. In I group, both Uniblocker and FOB were needed to be inserted into the tracheal tube lumen, so there was not enough space for Uniblocker to push and twist, and when Uniblocker or FOB was pushed forward, they were influenced by each other. Furthermore, the direction of the SLT is forward, which also limited the rotation of the Uniblocker to the left mainstem bronchus. Whereas in E group, without the constraints of SLT and the influence of FOB, the Uniblocker can be pushed and twisted more freely. In addition, there are more sizes of endotracheal tube and FOB for anesthesiologists to choose for extraluminal use of the Uniblocker.</p><p>Displacement of BBs is a familiar problem, which may result in failure of sufficiently collapse the lung and increases the risk of hypoxia during OLV.<sup>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup> In the study by Campos and Kernstine,<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup> malposition after turning patients to a lateral position occurred in 1 of 16 cases using Univent bronchial blocker. In this study, malposition of Uniblocker after turning patients to a lateral position occurred in 1 of 20 cases in E group, and 2 of 20 cases in I group. There was no significant difference between the 2 groups. However, once displacement of Uniblocker occurs, it is harder to reposition in I group than in E group, especially in lateral positions. The main reason for this was also that the SLT and FOB limited the rotation of Uniblocker.</p><p>Sore throat and hoarseness postoperative are common complaints, especially after tracheal intubation.<sup>[<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup> In E group, the Uniblocker outside the lumen of SLT may cause compression effect on the vocal cord. However, the result of our study demonstrated that the incidence of sore throat and hoarseness between the 2 groups had no significant differences. This may be related that the Uniblocker is very thin and the glottis is a narrow crack, so the compression caused by the Uniblocker may be very slightly. A study reported that the incidence of sore throat of patients in Univent bronchial blocker group was 30%,<sup>[<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup> which similar to our findings (25%&#x02013;30%). Indeed, regardless of which device is chosen, it is most important that the operators are familiar with the device.<sup>[<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup> In this study, to reduce the bias by operators with different levels of experience, all intubations were performed by the same experienced anesthesiologist in thoracic anesthesia.</p><p>The grades of bronchial damage of patients in I group were more serious than that in E group. Although this result has no statistical significance, which may be due to the small sample size, we believe that there is a clinical significance. An explanation for this may be that in I group, the Uniblocker needed to be inserted more to correct the position or reposition than that in E group.</p><p>Shaolin et al<sup>[<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup> reported that the combined use of a Proseal laryngeal mask and Coopdech bronchial blocker for OLV in adults can achieve OLV for thoracoscopic procedures. However, perilaryngeal leakage and malposition of Proseal laryngeal mask often occur, especially when the patients are placed in the lateral position, so this method need more experienced anesthesiologists and may not be conducive to popularization and promotion.</p><p>There are several limitations in this study. First, the overall sample size was small. Second, it was not possible to blind investigator to the technique. So, we could not completely rule out the possibility of biases in investigator in the comparisons between the 2 groups. Third, we only recruited the left-side thoracic surgery. Therefore, our results may not apply to the right-side thoracic surgery.</p></sec><sec><label>5</label><title>Conclusions</title><p>Extraluminal use of the Uniblocker is an efficient, successful, and easy to use method to provide OLV for left thoracic surgery.
