Improved oxygen systems can reduce childhood pneumonia mortality substantially. However, providing oxygen to children is challenging, especially in small hospitals with weak infrastructure and low human resource capacity.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p id="Par2">This trial will evaluate the implementation of improved oxygen systems at secondary-level hospitals in southwest Nigeria. The improved oxygen system includes: a standardised equipment package; training of clinical and technical staff; infrastructure support (including improved power supply); and quality improvement activities such as supportive supervision. Phase 1 will involve the introduction of pulse oximetry alone; phase 2 will involve the introduction of the full, improved oxygen system package. We have based the intervention design on a theory-based analysis of previous oxygen projects, and used quality improvement principles, evidence-based teaching methods, and behaviour-change strategies.</p><p id="Par3">We are using a stepped-wedge cluster randomised design with participating hospitals randomised to receive an improved oxygen system at 4-month steps (three hospitals per step). Our mixed-methods evaluation will evaluate effectiveness, impact, sustainability, process and fidelity. Our primary outcome measures are childhood pneumonia case fatality rate and inpatient neonatal mortality rate. Secondary outcome measures include a range of clinical, quality of care, technical, and health systems outcomes. The planned study duration is from 2015 to 2018.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par4">Our study will provide quality evidence on the effectiveness of improved oxygen systems, and how to better implement and scale-up oxygen systems in resource-limited settings.

As the primary treatment for hypoxaemia, oxygen therapy is relevant for a variety of clinical conditions including pneumonia and other lung conditions, sepsis, malaria, trauma, and neonatal conditions (including respiratory distress syndrome, asphyxia, and neonatal sepsis). Together, these conditions are responsible for 50% of child deaths globally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], and hypoxaemia is both a common fatal complication and a significant independent risk factor for death. A recent systematic review estimated that hypoxaemia affects approximately 13% of children admitted to hospital with severe pneumonia, 20% of sick neonates and 10&#x02013;15% of children with conditions such as malaria, meningitis, or convulsions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par15">Despite the enormous need for oxygen, its availability and use in hospitals globally is poor. Oxygen assessment from various countries shows that access to oxygen equipment, clinical guidelines, training, and technical support is lacking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Improved oxygen systems can reduce hospital case fatality rates from childhood pneumonia by 35% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], when implemented as part of a broad-based quality improvement package. However, experience from four decades of &#x02018;oxygen projects&#x02019; shows that effective improvement of oxygen systems in low-resource settings is complex, requiring context-specific technical, clinical, and managerial solutions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par16">Data from various countries shows that improved oxygen use requires optimising both oxygen availability and the use of oxygen by healthcare workers. Achieving good oxygen access requires provision of quality, user-friendly equipment that functions in harsh conditions (e.g. high heat, humidity and dust) and systems to ensure equipment can be maintained, repaired, and replaced (including a system for sustained financing or cost-recovery) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Projects in Egypt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], the Gambia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and Papua New Guinea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] provide successful examples of improving oxygen access through the use of appropriate equipment and supported by maintenance systems. Achieving good clinical use of oxygen requires skilled, motivated healthcare workers and a work environment that makes it easy to use oxygen well. Projects in Laos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and Papua New Guinea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] provide successful examples of improving healthcare worker use of oxygen through practical training, supportive supervision, and the implementation of evidence-based clinical guidelines. These and other oxygen projects demonstrate that improving oxygen therapy for children in hospitals requires addressing broader case management and care processes, and managerial and policy support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Nigerian context</title><p id="Par17">Nigeria is a populous middle-income country in sub-Saharan Africa that contributes to global child mortality disproportionately. Despite a decrease in child mortality since 1990 (U/5 mortality 213 to 117, 1990 to 2012), child, infant, and neonatal mortality remains high (117, 69 and 34 per 1000 live births, respectively) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The biggest childhood killers are pneumonia (18%), malaria (14%), complications of prematurity (12%), birth asphyxia and trauma (11%), diarrhoeal diseases (10%), and neonatal sepsis (5%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p id="Par18">Nigeria has a decentralised healthcare system with three levels of healthcare delivery: primary, secondary, and tertiary (plus alternative and traditional healthcare providers). Government health expenditure is minimal (7% of total government expenditure, among the lowest in the world) and 66% of total health expenditure is out-of-pocket expenditure, accounting for 9% of household expenditure on average [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Public secondary health facilities generally are managed by state government, which provide salary support; however, most day-to-day service activities are funded by patient fees [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Private and mission-based health services are common [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Nigeria has a large number of healthcare providers, comprising the largest human resource for health in Africa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. However, their distribution is weighted heavily towards large urban areas and there is a strong financial incentive to work at federally funded tertiary institutions over state-funded secondary health facilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Migration of healthcare workers out of Nigeria, and out of the Africa region, is a persistent challenge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p id="Par19">Limited data from southwest Nigeria suggests that hypoxaemia is common in children admitted to hospital [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], and access to oxygen therapy for children and newborns is a major challenge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. At one tertiary hospital, 29% of children under 5&#x000a0;years of age were hypoxaemic on admission, including 49% of pneumonia cases, 41% of sick neonates, and 14&#x02013;30% of malaria cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Theoretical basis</title><p id="Par20">We use a realist approach to project design, implementation, and evaluation. The realist approach seeks to understand <italic>how</italic> intervention(s) work to produce particular outcomes in a particular context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. As such, the realist approach is similar to other theory-based approaches in seeking to develop and test theories of how interventions work in particular contexts in order to inform future implementation in challenging real-world environments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. In planning this project, we reviewed experience from previous oxygen projects, including interviewing project coordinators about what they had done, why they chose that approach, and how it had worked (processes and outcomes) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. From this, we obtained an understanding of how various strategies have succeeded and failed in different contexts, and could make more informed decisions about how we would approach it in the Nigerian hospital context.</p><p id="Par21">In designing the various components of our intervention, we drew heavily on theories of behaviour change, in particular Michie&#x02019;s Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] and the Behaviour Change Wheel (BCW) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The TDF (and BCW) provides a framework for choosing particular behaviour-change strategies based on the behaviour being targeted and the barriers that need to be addressed. For the training activities, we used modern educational theories, particularly Merrill&#x02019;s &#x02018;first principles&#x02019; approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Merrill promotes a task-based, active learning approach that is structured around &#x02018;demonstration&#x02019; (showing), &#x02018;application&#x02019; (practice and feedback), &#x02018;activation&#x02019; (builds on prior knowledge), and &#x02018;integration&#x02019; (application in their particular context).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Objectives</title><p id="Par22">Given the clinical benefits of oxygen therapy, and the current poor access and use of oxygen therapy in Nigerian hospitals, we aim to implement an improved oxygen system in 12 Nigerian hospitals.

</p><p id="Par24">We chose a stepped-wedge design as the most efficient and pragmatic trial design for our purposes, using methodology described by Hemming et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Stepped-wedge designs can be useful for investigating the effects of an intervention that is likely to be beneficial in real-world environments. For this reason, it has been used increasingly for evaluating service delivery type interventions in developing countries, and is regarded as a pragmatic design suited to real-world settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. We wanted all hospitals to receive the intervention and we had preliminary data suggesting that it was an effective intervention. We wanted to roll the intervention out sequentially, so it was not feasible to do parallel randomisation. We anticipated moderate intra-cluster correlation meaning that the stepped-wedge design would be relatively efficient. The pulse oximetry provision and training will be done before the full intervention as a &#x02018;phase I&#x02019;, as hypoxaemia data is necessary for evaluation of the full intervention.</p><p id="Par25">We made a pragmatic decision to define clusters at the hospital level, as this was the natural level at which the intervention would be implemented and geographic separation between hospitals meant there was minimal risk of contamination. We considered clustering at the sub-hospital level (e.g. by ward), but rejected this due to the heterogeneity of ward arrangements, the large cross-over between wards, and the logistical complications that would have resulted. We randomised groups of three hospitals to receive the intervention at four different time-points (steps), spaced 4&#x000a0;months apart. This was based on practical considerations (i.e. how many hospitals could be practically set-up at a particular point in time), effect considerations (i.e. the effect should be realised within this time period), and statistical considerations (i.e. balancing the number of steps with the number of clusters within each step). We considered pairing clusters (hospitals), but rejected this due to the low number of included hospitals. We nominated a 3-week cross-over time for each hospital as it &#x02018;stepped&#x02019; into the intervention, as this would be adequate time for the intervention to be fully implemented and pre-intervention patients to be discharged (to avoid contamination). We determined that data collection would be cross-sectional, measured at multiple points before and after the intervention at the level of individual patients (and anticipating a low rate of re-admission during the trial period).</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Study setting</title><p id="Par26">This study is based in 12 secondary-level hospitals across four states (Oyo, Ondo, Ogun, and Osun) in southwest Nigeria (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). In a three-tier health system, secondary-level hospitals have an important role in providing first-contact hospital care for the population. We wanted to conduct this study in hospitals that would be representative of secondary-level hospitals treating children in a challenging, high-mortality environment, to ensure that findings would be most relevant for future scale-up in Nigeria and sub-Saharan Africa more broadly.<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Characteristics of 12 secondary-level hospitals in southwest Nigeria: paediatric and neonatal wards (adapted from baseline needs assessment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>])</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th>1</th><th>2</th><th>3</th><th>4</th><th>5</th><th>6</th><th>7</th><th>8</th><th>9</th><th>10</th><th>11</th><th>12</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Hospital type</td><td>State</td><td>Mission</td><td>Mission</td><td>State</td><td>State</td><td>State</td><td>State</td><td>State</td><td>Mission</td><td>Mission</td><td>Mission</td><td>State</td></tr><tr><td>Beds (child&#x02009;+&#x02009;neonatal)</td><td>13 (9&#x02009;+&#x02009;4)</td><td>32 (20&#x02009;+&#x02009;12)</td><td>63 (38&#x02009;+&#x02009;25)</td><td>36 (26&#x02009;+&#x02009;10)</td><td>46 (22&#x02009;+&#x02009;24)</td><td>60 (44&#x02009;+&#x02009;16)</td><td>48 (20&#x02009;+&#x02009;28)</td><td>36 (16&#x02009;+&#x02009;20)</td><td>20 (15&#x02009;+&#x02009;5)</td><td>14 (12&#x02009;+&#x02009;2)</td><td>70 (40&#x02009;+&#x02009;30)</td><td>25 (21&#x02009;+&#x02009;4)</td></tr><tr><td>Admissions (annual)</td><td>185</td><td>507</td><td>2343</td><td>238</td><td>791</td><td>849</td><td>3431</td><td>1945</td><td>431</td><td>344</td><td>2345</td><td>744</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;Child</td><td>180</td><td>444</td><td>1649</td><td>231</td><td>552</td><td>679</td><td>1959</td><td>1111</td><td>292</td><td>325</td><td>972</td><td>683</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;Neonate</td><td>5</td><td>63</td><td>693</td><td>7</td><td>239</td><td>170</td><td>1473</td><td>834</td><td>139</td><td>19</td><td>1373</td><td>61</td></tr><tr><td colspan="13">Staffing</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;Access to paediatrician</td><td>No<sup>a</sup>

For example, while hospital administrators have been open to alternative financing structures for oxygen, the actual implementation of this has been difficult in some hospitals due to administrative and governance requirements. We have been impressed with the ingenuity and problem-solving capacity of the participating hospitals, but informal feedback shows significant variability in the functioning of teams at different hospitals. This highlights the importance of measuring and reporting fidelity and other process indicators, in order to better understand this variability and how improved oxygen systems work in different contexts. Overall, the intervention appears to be achieving very high levels of fidelity, and early data shows large improvements in oxygen-related clinical behaviours (e.g. the use of pulse oximetry, administration of oxygen to hypoxaemic patients, etc.). Interim safety data suggests that the intervention is not causing harm and probably causing benefit, and we anticipate having adequate power to detect a meaningful difference by the end of data collection despite lower than expected admission numbers.</p><p id="Par56">Oxygen therapy is a basic, life-saving therapy that is relevant for many paediatric and adult health conditions, but has limited global availability. Our study should provide quality evidence on the effectiveness of improved oxygen systems, and how to better implement and scale up oxygen systems in resource-limited settings. Our results will have important implications for policy-makers, hospital administrators, and child health organisations in Africa and globally. Our findings may have broader applicability to other healthcare interventions that are worthy of scale-up but are proving challenging to implement in the places that can benefit the most.</p><sec id="Sec18"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par57">This trial is underway.
