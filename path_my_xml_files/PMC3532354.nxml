Accordingly, we investigated changes in mitochondrial gene expression and protein abundance in response to the same acute exercise before and after 10-d of intensive cycle training. Nine untrained, healthy participants (mean&#x000b1;SD; VO<sub>2peak</sub> 44.1&#x000b1;17.6 ml/kg/min) performed a 60 min bout of cycling exercise at 164&#x000b1;18 W (72% of pre-training VO<sub>2peak</sub>). Muscle biopsies were obtained from the vastus lateralis muscle at rest, immediately and 3 h after exercise. The participants then underwent 10-d of cycle training which included four high-intensity interval training sessions (6&#x000d7;5 min; 90&#x02013;100% VO<sub>2peak</sub>) and six prolonged moderate-intensity sessions (45&#x02013;90 min; 75% VO<sub>2peak</sub>). Participants repeated the pre-training exercise trial at the same absolute work load (64% of pre-training VO<sub>2peak</sub>). Muscle PGC1-&#x003b1; mRNA expression was attenuated as it increased by 11- and 4- fold (P&#x0003c;0.001) after exercise pre- and post-training, respectively. PGC1-&#x003b1; protein expression increased 1.5 fold (P&#x0003c;0.05) in response to exercise pre-training with no further increases after the post-training exercise bout. RIP140 protein abundance was responsive to acute exercise only (P&#x0003c;0.01). COXIV mRNA (1.6 fold; P&#x0003c;0.01) and COXIV protein expression (1.5 fold; P&#x0003c;0.05) were increased by training but COXIV protein expression was decreased (20%; P&#x0003c;0.01) by acute exercise pre- and post-training. These findings demonstrate that short-term intensified training promotes increased mitochondrial gene expression and protein abundance. Furthermore, acute indicators of exercise-induced mitochondrial adaptation appear to be blunted in response to exercise at the same absolute intensity following short-term training.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by grants from the Swedish Research Council, the Novo-Nordisk Foundation, and the commission of the European Communities (Contract number LSHM-CT-2004-512013 EUGENEHEART and Contract No. LSHM-CT-2004-005272 EXGENESIS)to AVC.

Traditional studies investigating mitochondrial adaptations were conducted utilising prolonged endurance training protocols in rodents <xref rid="pone.0053080-Holloszy1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0053080-Baar1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> and humans <xref rid="pone.0053080-Gollnick1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. These and other studies demonstrated that 6&#x02013;12 weeks of endurance exercise training increased the capacity of the mitochondria to produce ATP. This enhanced function is mediated by increased levels of the mitochondrial proteins that regulate substrate entry and oxidation, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, respiratory chain, and ATP synthesis (reviewed in <xref rid="pone.0053080-Holloszy2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>). Recently, expansion of mitochondrial volume and function have been suggested to increase rapidly with mitochondrial protein content increases observed after as little as six to ten consecutive <xref rid="pone.0053080-Chesley1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0053080-Spina1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> and non-consecutive <xref rid="pone.0053080-Burgomaster1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0053080-Perry1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> days of training in humans.</p><p>The mitochondrial biogenesis transcriptional programme in skeletal muscle results from the coordinated activation of signalling pathways, transcription co-activators, transcription factors, and repressors initiated in response to muscle contraction <xref rid="pone.0053080-Coffey1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Specifically, the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMK) II and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) signalling cascades are well characterized upstream modulators of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor &#x003b3; co-activator -1&#x003b1; (PGC-1&#x003b1;) gene expression in skeletal muscle <xref rid="pone.0053080-Akimoto1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0053080-Wright1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. These cascades activate downstream regulatory factors <xref rid="pone.0053080-Akimoto1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0053080-Wright1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, and in the case of AMPK <xref rid="pone.0053080-Jger1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> and p38 <xref rid="pone.0053080-Puigserver1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, also directly phosphorylate PGC-1&#x003b1;, thereby increasing transcriptional activation of the PGC-1&#x003b1;. Also, repressors interact with co-activators, such as the receptor interacting protein 140 (RIP 140; <xref rid="pone.0053080-Hallberg1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>) to help regulate mitochondrial biogenesis. RIP140 is subject to post-translational modifications like ubiquitination, acetylation, phosphorylation, and methylation, via a yet to be defined signalling pathways, and a number of these modifications have been shown to affect its function <xref rid="pone.0053080-Fritah1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0053080-Gupta1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>.</p><p>Given that skeletal muscle energy flux during contraction is effected by exercise training status, it is not surprising that signal transduction cascades are differentially regulated by acute exercise before and after training <xref rid="pone.0053080-Benziane1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0053080-McConell1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Specifically, AMPK and p38 MAPK phosphorylation are attenuated in response to the same exercise bout after training <xref rid="pone.0053080-Benziane1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> or in a highly trained compared to untrained individuals <xref rid="pone.0053080-Yu1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Furthermore, exercise intensity and/or total work done not only determine signalling cascade activation but also gene expression of genes like PGC1&#x003b1; <xref rid="pone.0053080-Bartlett1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0053080-Nordsborg1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. However, it is unknown whether this training-induced reduction in relative exercise intensity and reduced activation of these signalling cascades lead to down regulation of target genes (for example PGC1&#x003b1;,&#x003b2;, PGC-1 related co-activator [PRC], mitochondrial transcription factor A [Tfam] and nuclear respiratory factor 1 [NRF1]) or alterations in transcriptional regulation by PGC1&#x003b1; and RIP140 proteins that determine exercise induced mitochondrial reticulum expansion.</p><p>At present, there remains a significant gap in the literature on the molecular events (gene expression and changes in protein abundance) that occur in the process of mitochondrial biogenesis and reticulum expansion in human skeletal muscle in response to acute exercise before and after intensified endurance exercise training. The purposes of this study were to firstly examine changes in expression of mitochondrial genes that are involved in the regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis (PGC-1&#x003b1; and &#x003b2;, PRC, Tfam, NRF 2) under exercise conditions that maximally highlighted training adaptions (exercise at the same absolute intensity). Secondly, to investigate changes in protein abundance of mitochondrial biogenesis regulators and mitochondrial function including PGC-1&#x003b1;, RIP140 and the Electron Transport System (ETS) proteins. We hypothesized that with exercise training there would be an attenuation of the increase in key mitochondrial genes expressed in response to the same absolute bout of exercise before compared with after training. Additionally, we hypothesized that there will be an increase in mitochondrial protein abundance after training with no effects of acute exercise both before and after training.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>The study protocols were approved by the Monash University Standing Committee on Ethics in Research Involving Humans and the Karolinska Institutet Human Research Ethics Committee, and conducted according to the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki.

These findings are in contrast to both Pilegaard et al. <xref rid="pone.0053080-Pilegaard1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref> and Perry et al. <xref rid="pone.0053080-Perry1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> who demonstrated increases in NRF2 and Tfam gene expression of &#x0223c;1.5 fold 4 h after exercise both before and after training. These contrasting findings again may be explained by different intensities of the exercise bouts and training used. Alternatively, the differences in timing of the biopsy samples between studies may also impact the extent of the mRNA expression post exercise (that is in the current study the biopsies were taken 3 h post while in the other studies they were at 4 and 24 h after exercise). Notwithstanding the limitations, the TFam mRNA expression data are suggestive of a physiologically relevant reduction in mRNA responses to the same acute exercise after training.</p></sec><sec id="s4a2"><title>Mitochondrial genes</title><p>The findings that the mRNA for mitochondrial matrix enzymes such as CS and &#x003b2;-HAD were not acutely or chronically regulated by exercise or training was somewhat surprising considering the genes encoding the ETS membrane proteins Cytochrome C and COXVI as well as previous studies <xref rid="pone.0053080-Perry1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0053080-Pilegaard1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>.

However, our data raises further questions as to whether a 4-fold increase in PGC-1&#x003b1; after exercise that reaches a 50% higher &#x0201c;steady state&#x0201d; after training is sufficient to induce and maintain mitochondrial adaptation? Furthermore, due to the disproportionately small changes in abundance, we therefore speculate that post-translational modifications of PGC-1&#x003b1; (e.g. phosphorylation, deacetylation etc.) in response to exercise also contributes to exercise induced mitochondrial adaptation. These latter points warrant further mechanistic investigation.</p></sec><sec id="s4b2"><title>ETS proteins</title><p>The most important endpoint of mitochondrial biogenesis is increase in abundance of proteins that make up the ETS on the inner mitochondrial membrane.

The functional significance of the exercise induced reductions in C-IV protein abundance are unclear and warrants further investigation.</p><p>The main limitation of this study was that we were unable to empirically determine mitochondrial biogenesis by protein synthesis <xref rid="pone.0053080-Miller1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref> or mitochondrial reticulum expansion using other microscopy or biochemical techniques (eg citrate synthase activity, abundance of voltage dependant anion channels, or mitochondrial DNA copy number) <xref rid="pone.0053080-Medeiros1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref> due to study design, tissue sampling procedures and the lack of remaining muscle tissue. However, Larsen et al. <xref rid="pone.0053080-Larsen1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>, indicated that mitochondrial DNA copy number was not indicative of mitochondrial content or function in human muscle. Furthermore, our study design did not include a non-exercise control group or an exercise trial or group undertaking exercise at the same relative intensity exercise post training. The exclusion of the non-exercising control group was based on the powerful repeated measures study design where each participant acts as their own control, the fact that molecular response to exercise are transient <xref rid="pone.0053080-Pilegaard1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0053080-Pilegaard2" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, molecular adaptations to training in skeletal muscle are the sum of all exercise bouts <xref rid="pone.0053080-Perry1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0053080-Fluck1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0053080-Fluck2" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>, and training status is an important determinant of molecular responses to exercise <xref rid="pone.0053080-Yu1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. While we cannot definitely exclude the carry over effects of the first pre-training trial, it is highly unlikely that the results in the post-training trial are influenced by this pre-training trial two and a half weeks earlier. PGC-1&#x003b1; mRNA has a half-life in skeletal muscle of approximately 1 hour <xref rid="pone.0053080-Dsouza1" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref> and its protein abundance in human skeletal muscle returns to baseline two days following a single bout of endurance exercise <xref rid="pone.0053080-Mathai1" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>. Mitochondrial proteins in skeletal muscle have a half-life of several days <xref rid="pone.0053080-Booth1" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0053080-Coyle1" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref> and are only significantly increased by 3&#x02013;5 sessions of endurance exercise over a ten day period <xref rid="pone.0053080-Perry1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Furthermore, the mitochondrial adaptations to several weeks of endurance training are mostly reduced towards baseline by 3 weeks of detraining in humans <xref rid="pone.0053080-Wibom1" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref>. Finally, not investigating molecular responses at the same relative exercise intensity post-training, while potentially informative, was due not only to the ethical and practical issues, but the understanding that pre- and post- exercise bouts at the same relative intensity would have participants cycling at &#x0223c;189W post-training (vs. &#x0223c;164W pre-training; 25W increase in intensity) resulting in different amounts of work being done. Additionally, while the &#x0201c;adaptive&#x0201d; processes in the muscle in our study may be different due to the short-training regimen, there is evidence from a long-term (9-week) training studies in humans that indicate that the active muscle are indeed responding, metabolically (a significant adaptive signal), in an identical manner to the same relative intensity exercise pre- and post-training <xref rid="pone.0053080-Bergman1" ref-type="bibr">[67]</xref>. Despite these limitations the current data on gene expression and protein abundance changes are suggestive of exercise induced the mitochondrial adaptation.</p><p>In conclusion our study provides evidence that 10-d of intensified cycle training reduced PGC-1&#x003b1; mRNA expression, suggestive of reduced mitochondrial biogenesis processes and adaptation in responses to the same (absolute work done) acute bout of endurance exercise in human skeletal muscle. This alteration in molecular programming is potentially due to reduction of relative exercise intensity, and suggests at a molecular level that maintaining relative exercise intensity is important for continued mitochondrial adaptation after as little as 10 consecutive exercise sessions. Additionally, we provide evidence that exercise acutely reduces the protein abundance of COXI and COXIV before and after training, which may impair post exercise mitochondrial function and explain marked and rapid training induced changes in both COXIV mRNA expression and protein abundance. The practical implications of these findings are that we provide evidence that suggests that maintaining absolute exercise intensity even after a short period of endurance training results in a blunting of the molecular programs for mitochondrial reticulum expansion in human skeletal muscle, and may have implications for health and exercise performance.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank Timothy Burton and Brendon Scanlan of Monash University for their invaluable assistance with the exercise testing and training.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0053080-Holloszy1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
