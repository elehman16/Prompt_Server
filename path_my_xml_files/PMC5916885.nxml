Thus, we undertook a 12-week randomised trial to evaluate the effect of a lifestyle education intervention alone (LEI) or with partial MR (LEI&#x02009;+&#x02009;MR) in obese Thai adults with MS.</p></sec><sec><title>Subjects/Methods</title><p id="Par2">A total of 110 patients were randomised to receive either LEI or LEI&#x02009;+&#x02009;MR. Both groups received LEI to achieve weight loss. LEI&#x02009;+&#x02009;MR group additionally received two MR daily to replace either breakfast, lunch or dinner. Mean&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;SE body mass index of all participants was 34.6&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.6&#x02009;kg/m<sup>2</sup>, mean&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;SE age was 42.5&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.1 years and 83% of patients were female. Both groups were compared for anthropometric and cardiometabolic indices at 12-week. Body weight was also compared at weeks 38 and 64.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">At 12 weeks, both groups exhibited statistically significant percentage weight loss (%WL) compared to initial weight but greater %WL was observed in LEI&#x02009;+&#x02009;MR compared to LEI, 2.9% vs. 1.5%, respectively (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05). MS criteria such as waist circumference and blood pressure improved significantly in both groups compared to baseline. However, improvement in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) was only significant in LEI&#x02009;+&#x02009;MR, and more participants with impaired FPG at baseline in LEI&#x02009;+&#x02009;MR (42.9%) than LEI (19%) returned to normal FPG at 12 weeks (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05). HbA<sub>1c</sub>, fasting insulin and HOMA-IR in LEI&#x02009;+&#x02009;MR were significantly lower than with LEI. At the end of the 12-week intervention period, 16% of participants no longer fulfilled MS criteria.

Metabolic syndrome (MS), a condition commonly found in obesity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> and proposed to be driven primarily by insulin resistance, is a constellation of metabolic derangements including abdominal obesity, elevation of blood pressure (BP), fasting plasma glucose (FPG) level, triglyceride (TG) level and low level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c). It is also significantly related to the risk of the development of T2DM and CVD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">Globally, the prevalence of obesity continues to increase with over 600 million (13%) adults affected by obesity in 2014<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. In particular, the prevalence of obesity and MS have markedly increased in many low-income and middle-income countries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, as a consequence of economic growth, increased urbanisation and adoption of a &#x02018;western&#x02019; lifestyle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. One such country is Thailand, where there has been a marked increase in obesity, defined as a body mass index (BMI) of 25&#x02009;kg/m<sup>2</sup> or more<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, and MS with 37.5% and 28.9% of the adult population effected, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par7">Weight-loss interventions aimed at reducing weight at least 3&#x02013;5%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> by reducing energy intake and increasing physical activity through behavioural modification are the mainstay of the treatment of obesity and MS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. However, poor compliance is the key obstacle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Currently, there is a paucity of data regarding the effectiveness of weight-loss programmes in Thai adults coupled with a lack of specialist weight management services, hampering the delivery of multi-disciplinary intensive lifestyle interventions akin to the Look AHEAD study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. A previous study by Karintrakul et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> demonstrated that four monthly individualised nutrition counselling visits with 3, 5&#x02013;10-min telephone contacts led to a significant weight reduction in Thai women with overweight and obesity.</p><p id="Par8">Meal replacement (MR), either partial or full have been proposed to be an effective strategy assisting patients to lose weight and gain metabolic advantages in western countries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> and some subgroups of Asian ethnicities; Indians<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, Chinese<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, Japanese<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> and Koreans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. However, there are no data examining their effectiveness in Southeast Asians. Given the high prevalence of obesity and MS within Thailand, there is an urgent need to develop and evaluate pragmatic cost-effective weight management programmes that can be delivered at scale. Incorporating partial or full MR into a weight management programme incurs additional economic costs. Thus, we undertook a randomised trial in Thai adults with obesity and MS to evaluate the effect of a low-cost lifestyle education intervention (LEI) alone or a LEI with MR (LEI&#x02009;+&#x02009;MR) on body weight (BW), body composition, insulin sensitivity and metabolic variables.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Subjects and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design and setting</title><p id="Par9">The Siriraj Institutional Review Board, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand reviewed and approved the trial protocol for this single-centre prospective randomised trial. The trial has been registered in the clinical trial registry of the National Institute of Health (Reference: NCT02626741). Potential subjects were alerted to the trial through the placement of posters on notice boards throughout the Siriraj Hospital and were advised to contact the study team by telephone for further information and initial screening. Interested individuals fulfilling initial inclusion and exclusion criteria then attended a visit at the Research Centre of Nutrition Support, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, between February 2015 and December 2015 and were given a participant information sheet and verbal explanation from the study investigators in person.

The main objective of the lifestyle education was to raise participants&#x02019; awareness regarding the health complications related to obesity and MS and subsequently to promote weight loss through nutritional and behavioural modifications.</p><p id="Par18">The group educational session, attended by 15&#x02013;20 participants, focused upon ways to reduce energy intake by having three main meals and avoiding snacks. Participants were advised to aim for 2093&#x02013;4186&#x02009;kJ (500&#x02013;1000&#x02009;kcal) deficit compared to the Thais&#x02019; Dietary Reference Intake (7325.5&#x02009;kJ [1750&#x02009;kcal] and 8790.6&#x02009;kJ [2100&#x02009;kcal] for females and males, respectively) by using methods such as calorie counting, portion control, food exchange and reading food labels. This session also covered healthy eating tips to lose weight such as limiting intake of sugary food and beverages as well as fried and fatty foods; increasing intake of fruits and vegetables; substitution of red meat with white meat or fish; drinking a glass of water before meals and chewing food slowly while eating. In addition, participants were given advice about how to cope with situations or behaviours leading to excessive energy intake. Participants were also encouraged to inform their family members and friends of their intention to lose weight in order to create a supportive environment. All participants were advised to increase physical activity, aiming for a minimum 150&#x02009;min of moderate-intensity exercise per week and/or 10,000 steps per day. Participants were also instructed to keep a food diary (2 weekdays and 1 weekend day) every week throughout the study period.</p><p id="Par19">The subsequent four sessions at weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12 were a 30-min individual counselling with a dietitian. Participants were weighed and given individualised dietary and physical activity advice based on their reported food diaries and weight-loss achievement.</p><p id="Par20">In addition to the lifestyle education, participants in the LEI&#x02009;+&#x02009;MR group were supplied with high-protein MR (Slimwell&#x000ae;, Benswell Corporation, Bangkok, Thailand) and instructed to replace two main meals daily with one sachet per meal (2 sachets per day), which were either breakfast, lunch or dinner throughout the 12-week period. For the remaining meal, they were advised to eat food that was low in fat and sugar. Each sachet of the MR powder contained 912.5&#x02009;kJ (218&#x02009;kcal), 46% of carbohydrate (24.95&#x02009;g), 29% of protein (15.92&#x02009;g) and 25% fat (6.06&#x02009;g), and was dissolved in 250&#x02009;mL of warm water. Sufficient MR were supplied at each study visit until the participants&#x02019; next scheduled visit.

Moreover, that LEI combined with partial MR leads to greater weight reduction and improvement in glycaemic indices. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first trial of its kind undertaken in a Thai population.</p><p id="Par37">Our findings of modest weight loss and benefits in MS in both groups compared to baseline, show that a pragmatic LEI is an effective weight-loss strategy for Thai patients with obesity, in agreement with the previous study undertaken by Karintrakul et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup></p><p id="Par38">BW reduction was significantly greater in LEI&#x02009;+&#x02009;MR than LEI alone. This difference could be due to a lower total energy intake in the LEI&#x02009;+&#x02009;MR compared to the LEI group, as a consequence of replacing two of the daily main meals with MR. Each MR contained 912.5&#x02009;kJ (218&#x02009;kcal) compared to the 2093&#x02009;kJ (500&#x02009;kcal) that is usually consumed in a typical Thai meal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Furthermore, the MR used in our study possesses high protein as the high dietary protein is thought to enhance satiety through various mechanisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par39">Consistent with other studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, after cessation of the intervention, subjects in both groups regained weight at 64 weeks. This finding emphasises the need for ongoing support. Indeed, the recent DiRECT study, which including monthly individually tailored calorie prescription and support weight stabilisation, reported only 1.9&#x02009;kg of weight regain during the weight maintenance phase up to 52 weeks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. In addition, one MR per day could potentially have a role in weight maintenance, this was an option for participants in DiRECT. Even though the difference in BW between groups at 64 weeks is not statistically significant, it appears that LEI&#x02009;+&#x02009;MR tends to regain weight more than LEI. This could be due to a greater reliance on MR rather than lifestyle modification in the LEI&#x02009;+&#x02009;MR group. On the other hand, the only intervention offered to the LEI group was LEI. Hence, after cessation of the intervention, subjects in LEI perhaps may have continued with their lifestyle modification to a greater extent than LEI&#x02009;+&#x02009;MR. In addition, the more extreme outliers in LEI who lost substantial weight may potentially deviate the mean of the weight reduction observed at 64 weeks.</p><p id="Par40">WC is a strong predictor of T2DM, CVD risk factors and CVD events<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. A previous study has shown that every centimetre increase in WC was associated with a 2% increase in CVD risk<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Similarly, a study undertaken in Thailand has also demonstrated that normal weight individuals with central obesity were 2.03 times more likely to have at least one CVD risk factor compared to normal weight individuals without central obesity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. In addition, evidence has shown that a reduction in WC resulted in a decline in CVD risk<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. In our study, there was a significant decrease in WC in both groups during the intervention but the LEI&#x02009;+&#x02009;MR group exhibited a significantly greater reduction. This finding implies that patients could benefit from the reduction in CVD risk.</p><p id="Par41">Glycaemic control (FPG and HbA<sub>1c</sub>) and insulin sensitivity (fasting insulin level and HOMA-IR) improved significantly more in LEI&#x02009;+&#x02009;MR than LEI at 12 weeks. The percentage of subjects with reversal of impaired FPG at 12 weeks was also significantly greater in LEI&#x02009;+&#x02009;MR than LEI. This could be explained by the greater weight loss, lower energy and CHO consumption in LEI&#x02009;+&#x02009;MR compared to LEI and the high-protein MR per se. A study undertaken by Daniel K&#x000f6;nig et al. demonstrated that ingestion of high-protein/low glycaemic index MR promoted greater fat oxidation, and thus improved insulin sensitivity compared to a high glycaemic index/low protein diet<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. The normalisation of FPG seen in our study is likely to prevent the future development of diabetes, as observed in the Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study (DPPOS) demonstrating that the regression from IPG to normal glucose regulation reduced long-term diabetes increase by 56%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par42">Elevated BP is common in patients with obesity and MS. Our findings support the effectiveness of lifestyle modification in reducing BP because both groups exhibited significant reduction in systolic and diastolic BP. The improvement in lipid profiles in our study was not significant. This could be due to the normal or only slightly high levels of the lipid profiles at baseline. Moreover, patients in the present study only achieved a modest weight loss, whereas at least 5&#x02013;10% or 3&#x02013;5&#x02009;kg of weight reduction is required to achieve therapeutic targets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par43">Subjects in both groups lost FM at 12 weeks compared to baseline, but no significant difference between groups. It is known that both FM and FFM loss occur during the weight-loss period<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. We found that at 12 weeks FFM in the LEI&#x02009;+&#x02009;MR group was significantly lower than in the LEI group. This finding may at least be explained by the greater weight loss achieved in LEI&#x02009;+&#x02009;MR than LEI. Alternatively, those subjects in LEI might have been more physically active than LEI&#x02009;+&#x02009;MR, although we did not monitor subjects&#x02019; compliance towards the recommended physical activity.</p><p id="Par44">With regard to the applicability of MR, the use of MR was well-tolerated as no adverse effects were reported. Nonetheless, the cost is a major disadvantage. Given that the average income per month of individuals in Thailand was 13,878 THB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup> in 2017 and the cost of MR was 11,800 THB monthly, MR could only be an option for people who are able to afford the cost.</p><p id="Par45">There are several strengths of the present study. First, the LEI used was pragmatic and less expensive than intensive lifestyle interventions, a best practice in the Western world. Hence, it is probably more feasible for low- and middle-income countries where resources and manpower are limited. Second, allowing subjects to decide which meals were suitable for them to take MR was also another strength as it is flexible and feasible on a day-to-day basis. Third, we demonstrated that after cessation of the interventions, there was a weight regain in long-term follow-up until 64 weeks. In addition, the current guidelines for management of overweight and obesity in adults recommended at least 3&#x02013;5 %WL in 2013 AHA/ACC/TOS guideline<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> and 5&#x02013;15 %WL in 2016 AACE/ACE guideline<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup> to achieve metabolic benefit and reduce the risk of developing T2DM. Nevertheless, despite only a modest weight reduction achieved in the present study (1.5&#x02013;2.9%), significant advantages were observed regarding MS components, glycaemic control and insulin sensitivity. Importantly, this modest weight loss resulted in reduction in the number of participants fulfilling MS criteria by 16% and led to the regression of IFG.</p><p id="Par46">Several limitations are worth noting. First, the accuracy of the food record is limited since it tends to underestimate the amount of actual intake. We thus used it primarily for self-feedback to subjects as a part of behavioural modification. Second, participants&#x02019; compliance towards the recommended physical activity levels was not assessed. Nevertheless, during the individual follow-up session, the dietitian reviewed the food diary and interviewed subjects about the actual intake and physical activity to lessen these limitations. Finally, owing to the limited funding and unexpected excessive number of excluded subjects during the baseline assessment, there were only 110 subjects in both groups after randomisation, not attaining the sample size determination. Nonetheless, the difference of weight reduction between groups achieved statistical significance.</p><p id="Par47">Future studies should examine a total MR regimen, similar to the DiRECT study, and the advantages and disadvantages of the MR in the longer term, particularly with respect to weight-loss maintenance. Furthermore, the mechanisms behind the greater improvement of weight reduction, glycaemic control, insulin resistance and MS in the LEI&#x02009;+&#x02009;MR group need to be elucidated.</p><p id="Par48">In conclusion, LEI and LEI&#x02009;+&#x02009;MR are acceptable and practicable for Thai patients with obesity and MS and lead to improvement in MS components and glycaemic indices and modest weight reduction. The LEI&#x02009;+&#x02009;MR group exhibited greater benefits at 12 weeks. Future longer term studies with ongoing support is now warranted.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>These authors contributed equally: Preyanuj Yamwong, Rachel L.
