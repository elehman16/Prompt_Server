Celgosivir was given as a 400 mg loading dose and 200 mg bid (twice a day) over 5 days. Replication competent virus was measured by plaque assay and compared to reverse transcription quantitative PCR (qPCR) of viral RNA. Pharmacokinetics (PK) correlations with viremia, immunological profiling, next generation sequence (NGS) analysis and hematological data were evaluated as exploratory endpoints here to identify possible signals of pharmacological activity. Viremia by plaque assay strongly correlated with qPCR during the first four days. Immunological profiling demonstrated a qualitative shift in T helper cell profile during the course of infection. NGS analysis did not reveal any prominent signature that could be associated with drug treatment; however the phylogenetic spread of patients&#x02019; isolates underlines the importance of strain variability that may potentially confound interpretation of dengue drug trials conducted during different outbreaks and in different countries. Celgosivir rapidly converted to castanospermine (Cast) with mean peak and trough concentrations of 5727 ng/mL (30.2 &#x003bc;M) and 430 ng/mL (2.3 &#x003bc;M), respectively and cleared with a half-life of 2.5 (&#x000b1; 0.6) hr. Mean viral log reduction between day 2 and 4 (VLR2-4) was significantly greater in secondary dengue than primary dengue (p = 0.002). VLR2-4 did not correlate with drug AUC but showed a trend of greater response with increasing Cmin. PK modeling identified dosing regimens predicted to achieve 2.4 to 4.5 times higher Cmin. than in the CELADEN trial for only 13% to 33% increase in overall dose. A small, non-statistical trend towards better outcome on platelet nadir and difference between maximum and minimum hematocrit was observed in celgosivir-treated patients with secondary dengue infection. Optimization of the dosing regimen and patient stratification may enhance the ability of a clinical trial to demonstrate celgosivir activity in treating dengue fever based on hematological endpoints. A new clinical trial with a revised dosing regimen is slated to start in 2016 (NCT02569827). Furthermore celgosivir&#x02019;s potential value for treatment of other flaviruses such as Zika virus should be investigated urgently.</p><p><bold>Trial Registration:</bold> ClinicalTrials.gov <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01619969">NCT01619969</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Dengue virus is currently threatening 40% of the world&#x02019;s population. An approximately 60% efficacious vaccine has been registered for use in Mexico, Brazil, the Philippines, Paraguay and El Salvador, but there are no approved antiviral treatments available. We have shown that celgosivir, an endoplasmic reticulum alpha glucosidase inhibitor, has submicromolar activity against all 4 serotypes of dengue virus (DENV) and also efficacious in mouse model of infection. The strong preclinical pharmacology motivated the conduct of an investigator-initiated, Phase 1b randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of celgosivir in 50 adult dengue patients. Although the trial did not meet the primary endpoints of lowering viremia or fever, the safety profile of the drug prompted extended hematological, pharmacokinetic, immunological and viral sequence profiling. Here we report several non-significant trends of pharmacological effect of celgosivir on platelet count, hematocrit, and NS1 clearance in secondary dengue patients. In addition, pharmacokinetic modeling identified an alternate dosing regimen that is predicted to achieve a 4.5-fold increase in minimum drug concentrations during treatment (C<sub>min</sub>) with only a modest increase in overall dose. A new Phase 2a clinical trial with an optimized dosing regimen of celgosivir (ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT02569827) is scheduled to start in the latter part of 2016.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001349</institution-id><institution>National Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>STOP Dengue TCR</award-id></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>Duke-NUS Start-up funds</institution></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5083-3831</contrib-id><name><surname>Vasudevan</surname><given-names>Subhash G.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution>Duke-NUS Start-up fund</institution></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ooi</surname><given-names>Eng Eong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award004"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001349</institution-id><institution>National Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NMRC/MOHIAFCat1/0008/2014</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5083-3831</contrib-id><name><surname>Vasudevan</surname><given-names>Subhash G.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>CELADEN clinical trial was funded by &#x0201c;National Medical Research Council STOP Dengue TCR, Duke-NUS Start-up funds and National Medical Research Council Industry Alliance grant NMRC/MOHIAFCat1/0008/2014.

Dengue is one of 17 neglected tropical diseases that the World Health Organization (WHO) has identified for priority attention due to its disproportionate impact on global health, with cases reported from over 100 countries [<xref rid="pntd.0004851.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Singapore maintains an aggressive mosquito control program [<xref rid="pntd.0004851.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], with spending by the National Environment Agency approaching US$50 million annually. These efforts have successfully driven the proportion of households harboring the Aedes mosquito, the vector for dengue, to historic lows of less than 1%. Yet, in the last decade, the incidence rates have continued to climb, with the highest rate recorded in 2013 of 404.9 cases per 100,000 with 8 deaths [<xref rid="pntd.0004851.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Currently, there are no approved drugs for dengue. Vaccine development has been underway since the 1970s [<xref rid="pntd.0004851.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], an extraordinarily challenging effort because immunity to one serotype does not confer protection against the others. Furthermore, a phenomenon known as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) posits that antibodies to one serotype from a previous dengue infection increases the risk of more serious forms of the illness, dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) or dengue shock syndrome (DSS) [<xref rid="pntd.0004851.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0004851.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Indeed, the proportion of DHF among patients with secondary dengue is much higher than those with primary dengue [<xref rid="pntd.0004851.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0004851.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Therefore, vaccine development has proceeded under the premise that a vaccine must protect against all four dengue serotypes; otherwise, potentially more serious outcomes may ensue if the subject achieves only partial immunity. Sanofi&#x02019;s tetravalent dengue vaccine CYD-TDV achieved 56% and 65% efficacy in Phase 3 field studies in Southeast Asia and Latin America, respectively. Protection was serotype dependent with protective efficacy for DENV 2 of 35% and 42% in the two trials [<xref rid="pntd.0004851.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0004851.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In December 2015, a number of countries, namely Mexico, Brazil, and the Philippines, approved CYD-TDV for use as a dengue vaccine.

Celgosivir, an inhibitor of alpha-glucosidase, a host enzyme required for proper processing of viral surface glycoproteins, has been given to hundreds of patients in HIV and HCV trials, but further pharma-driven development of celgosivir was discontinued because approved drugs for those indications had better or equivalent efficacy in Phase 2 trials [<xref rid="pntd.0004851.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0004851.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].

An important objective of early phase clinical trials is to identify dose regimen(s) that are safe and tolerable and that show some evidence of pharmacological activity. Previous clinical experience in hundreds of subjects (healthy volunteers, HIV and HCV patients) established that celgosivir&#x02019;s maximally tolerated dose (MTD) is 400 mg qd (once a day) for 12 weeks [<xref rid="pntd.0004851.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. A small trial in HCV patients (N = 43) reported asymptomatic, reversible increases in creatine kinase (19% for 200 mg qd, 42% for 200 mg bid and 80% for 400 mg qd), suggesting that a divided dose would be better tolerated than a single daily dose of the same amount of total drug [<xref rid="pntd.0004851.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Among CELADEN patients who received celgosivir, the mean observed trough castanospermine concentration was 430 ng/mL (2.3 &#x003bc;M). This was comparable to the corresponding Cmin in the mouse model (400 ng/mL) where 50 mg/kg bid for 5 days protected all animals from dengue-related death when treated immediately after infection, and was far more effective than 100 mg/kg qd [<xref rid="pntd.0004851.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. When treatment in mice was delayed by 24 and 48 hr post-infection, survival rates were lower at 75% and 50%, respectively [<xref rid="pntd.0004851.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In dengue patients, symptoms do not arise until several days after infection. Therefore, it may be necessary to achieve higher trough drug concentrations to overcome the delay in treatment after becoming infected. By decreasing the dosing interval from 12 to 8 or 6 hr, PK simulations demonstrate that 2.4- to 4.5-fold increase in Cmin are achievable with only a 13% to 33% increase in total dose. Indeed, AG129 mice treated at peak viremia with a four-times-daily regimen had a significantly reduced viremia compared to untreated animals in a mouse viremia model using clinical isolates of DENV2 [<xref rid="pntd.0004851.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>Drug clearance was significantly correlated with creatinine clearance, and 80% of the drug was recovered in the urine, indicating that renal clearance is the dominant elimination pathway, as was previously reported from animal studies [<xref rid="pntd.0004851.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. While all patients in the trial had serum creatinine levels well below the exclusion criterion of 165 &#x003bc;mol/l, retrospective creatinine clearance calculations indicated that one patient who had a serum creatinine of 114 &#x003bc;mol/ fell in the moderate renal impairment category [<xref rid="pntd.0004851.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Although this issue did not specifically result in any AE or SAE in CELADEN, our current PK analysis suggests a greater awareness of renal function for future trials.</p><p>DENV cleared significantly more rapidly in patients with secondary dengue compared to primary dengue, confirming a previous finding [<xref rid="pntd.0004851.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Future trials of antiviral drugs for dengue drugs that use viremia as an endpoint may need to take this into account when calculating trial size in order to achieve adequate power. Although an ideal case Target Product Profile [<xref rid="pntd.0004851.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] for a dengue drug should be efficacy in both primary and secondary dengue, it is possible that for some early phase proof-of-concept studies, previous infection status could either be an inclusion criteria or a stratification variable to achieve balanced groups with respect to this parameter.</p><p>In the clinical management of dengue, platelet count is closely monitored for signs of incipient bleeding and progression to more serious DHF. Hemoconcentration is monitored through changes in hematocrit to decide whether to administer intravenous fluids and which type of fluid should be given [<xref rid="pntd.0004851.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. For Proof of Concept and early stage human clinical trials, it is worth considering other parameters such as imaging leakage as an alternative early biomarker for clinical outcome in assessing potential drugs to treat dengue fever [<xref rid="pntd.0004851.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. By gathering evidence to promote these biomarkers or hematology laboratory results to surrogate or valid clinical endpoints, it will become easier to evaluate other dengue drugs in the future.</p><p>The NGS analysis to obtain critical information on nucleotide changes did not reveal any suggestion that rapid development of resistance to celgosivir is an explanation for the low efficacy observed in our trial. However it does reinforce the need for a panel of strains that are representative for the various genotypes of DENV serotypes 1&#x02013;4 to be examined as part of preclinical evaluation for efficacy, especially when the drug targets a host enzyme. Interestingly recent in vitro biochemical studies have confirmed that celgosivir&#x02019;s mechanism of action is via inhibition of ER &#x003b1;-gulcosidases and also showed that the antiviral activity of celgosivir in primary human macrophages in vitro, inhibits DENV secretion with an EC50 of 5 &#x003bc;M [<xref rid="pntd.0004851.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. These studies do lend support to celgosivir as a potential drug for detailed clinical analysis. Celgosivir&#x02019;s efficacy on zika virus (ZIKV) has not been reported but given its close relationship with dengue virus within the flavivirus membership, it is possible that it may inhibit ZIKV using a similar mechanism. ZIKV, like DENV is spread by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes but its current association with widespread numbers of Guillain-Barre syndrome and microcephaly in babies born to mothers infected during the first trimester of pregnancy is unique and a cause of much concern [<xref rid="pntd.0004851.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].</p><p>Several lines of evidence suggest a trend towards a pharmacological effect of celgosivir in dengue patients. Celgosivir patients with secondary dengue had a slightly less decline in platelets. Only 1 of 13 (7.6%) of the secondary dengue patients treated with celgosivir had a platelet nadir below 20,000/&#x003bc;L compared to 2 of 5 (40%) in the placebo group. Secondary dengue patients treated with celgosivir also had a smaller difference between maximum and minimum hematocrit than secondary dengue patients in the placebo group. Other evidence of a trend towards pharmacologic activity include (i) the significantly lower level of TNF&#x003b1; in celgosivir-treated patients compared to placebo controls during the early stage of treatment, independent of prior infection status and (ii) enhanced NS1 clearance in secondary infection following celgosivir treatment [<xref rid="pntd.0004851.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>In conclusion, lessons derived from the analysis of the secondary endpoint data of the CELADEN trial are a useful guide for future dengue drug trials. PK analyses and simulations show that alternate dosing regimens can achieve several-fold increases in steady-state trough concentrations with the same or modestly higher total dose. The difference in viremia kinetics for primary and secondary dengue underscores the need for balanced arms with respect to infection status in future trials. Pathological endpoints such as HCT and vascular leakage may be potentially better surrogate endpoints than viremia in assessing activity of dengue antivirals. We note that CELADEN was not powered to determine statistically significant differences in secondary endpoints. Such analyses are subject to inflated Type I error and merit cautious interpretation. However taken together, the trends in pharmcological activity are consistent with increasing celgosivir exposure. Since PK simulations of further divided doses suggest a potentially large increase in Cmin with a modest increase in AUC, which is supported by recent animal data [<xref rid="pntd.0004851.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], we plan to evaluate a revised dosing regimen of celgosivir in a Phase 2a to start in 2016 (NCT02569827).</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec020"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0004851.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Summary of inclusion and exclusion criteria for CELADEN study [<xref rid="pntd.0004851.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0004851.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0004851.s002"><label>S2 Fig</label><caption><title>Examination of intra-host genetic diversity by position for DENV1.</title><p>The DENV1 genome was analyzed for positions having detectable, &#x0003e;1% and 5% non-consensus base calls for (A) placebo-treated and (B) celgosivir-treated samples.
