mat and balance exercise on an unstable base of support for trunk stability on the balance
ability of elderly females. [Subjects and Methods] Forty elderly women aged 65 or older
were equally assigned to a Pilates mat exercise (PME) group and an unstable support
surface exercise (USSE) group. They conducted exercise three times per week for 12 weeks
for 40 minutes each time. In order to examine balance, sway length and the speed of the
center of foot pressure were measured for one minute, and in order to examine dynamic
balance, the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test was conducted. [Results] After the intervention,
sway length, sway speed, and TUG significantly decreased in both groups. A comparison of
sway speed after the intervention between the two groups revealed that the PME group
showed larger decreases than the USSE group. [Conclusion] PME and USSE elicited
significant effects on the static and dynamic balance of elderly female subjects,
suggesting that those exercises are effective at enhancing the balance ability of this
group of subjects. However, the Pilates mat exercise is regarded as being safer than
exercise on an unstable base of support.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Pilates mat exercise</kwd><kwd>Unstable support surface exercise</kwd><kwd>Elderly females</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Elderly people have many risk factors for contracting disease due to aging and lack of
exercise. Aging is the process in which the number of cells comprising the body decreases,
the activity of each cell degrades, and physical adaptability is gradually lost, ultimately
leading to death<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Decrease in balance ability resulting from aging triggers motor and gait disabilities in
elderly people, which greatly affects their mobility in day-to-day life. Therefore, in the
assessment of an exercise program for elderly people, the main focus should be on whether it
prevents falls and affects gait in a positive way<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Physical factors that influence falls include weakening of lower extremity muscular
strength, a decrease in gait ability, a reduction in balance ability, and a decrease in
sensory motor control<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. There are diverse
interventions for fall prevention, such as strengthening of muscle power through exercise
and gait training, medication, and preventive education. Among these, strengthening of
muscle power and balance training has largely been used as exercise for methods.</p><p>That exercise is effective at improving balance for the prevention of falls by elderly
people has become generally accepted<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>, and
different studies have verified that balance exercise programs improve elderly people&#x02019;s
balance and gait abilities<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. In
particular, Sherrington et al.<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup> stressed
that training, including balance training, lowers the risk of fall by 17% compared to muscle
strength training, and that in order to prevent falls, balance training should take
precedence, emphasizing the importance of balance ability.</p><p>Balance ability is a very complicated function that maintains positions through diverse
functional elements, and intervention of the nervous and musculoskeletal systems<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Adjustment of balance ability is a
complicated process that requires integration of sensory information and appropriate
postural response practice. Visual information and articular and muscular sensory
information are integrated through the central nervous system by non-sequitur the visual
somatic senses and the vestibular system in order to maintain an erect position<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Balance adjustment also requires
well-coordinated voluntary movement and reflexive muscular response<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. In general, various sensory motor neurons interact in
response to changes in gravity, base of support, vision, and physical stability, and the
external environment, resulting in stability of the body<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>To increase physical stability, trunk stabilization exercise is helpful for enhancing
balance ability, as the muscular strength of the trunk, among other different factors, is
related to balance and functional activities<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Activity of the trunk muscles maintains balance against gravity,
adjusts posture, and prepares for the movement of the extremities in activities of daily
living<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Most exercises for the improvement of balance ability aim to stabilize the trunk. Pilates
exercises also stresses strengthening of the muscles to stabilize the trunk through core
exercise<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Balance exercise on an
unstable base of support is also used clinically to stabilize the trunk<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Accordingly, this study compared the effects of Pilates exercise on a mat and balance
exercise for trunk stability in on the balance ability of elderly female subjects.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The study subjects were 40 elderly people living in a local community located in Busan

those who had no disease that affected the performance of exercise. Those who had problems
with their visual, auditory, neural, or vestibular systems, and those who did not understand
the content of the experiment were excluded. Information about this study was provided to
all subjects, and their consent to participation in this study was obtained (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title> General characteristics of the subjects</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">PME</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">USSE</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (year)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">70.0&#x000b1;2.2</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">69.3&#x000b1;2.6</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Height (cm)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">157.3&#x000b1;3.6</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">157.7&#x000b1;3.0</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Weight (kg)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">55.7&#x000b1;4.4</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">55.4&#x000b1;3.1</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Mean&#x000b1;SD.

into a Pilates mat exercise (PME) group and an unstable support surface exercise (USSE)
group, and the subjects conducted exercises three times per week for 12 weeks for 40 minutes
each time.</p><p>In this study, the Pilates mat exercise program complied with the recommended amount of
exercise for the improvement of elderly people&#x02019;s health, and movements appropriate for the
elderly to perform were selected from the work of Cathleen Murakami<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. The Pilates exercise program had a five-minute warm-up
exercise, and the order was as follows: breathing, 2 repetitions (reps); imprint and

on an aero-step (TOGU, Germany). They adapted to the base of support and lightly flexed
their muscles for five minutes, stood on both feet balancing the body for five minutes,
stood on both feet moving the center of the body for five minutes, stood on one foot for
five minutes, conducted squats for five minutes, walked in place for five minutes,
maintained a squatting position for five minutes, and conducted cool-down exercise for five
minutes.</p><p>In order to measure the static balance ability of the subjects who participated in this
study, AP1153 BIORESCUE (RM INGENIERIE, France) was used, and center of foot pressure sway
length and sway average speed were measured in Romberg&#x02019;s test, with the subjects&#x02019; eyes open.
In order to measure dynamic balance ability, subjects&#x02019; performance time in the Timed Up and
Go test was measured. All measurement results were expressed as mean &#x000b1; standard

system, and the nervous system<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Due to
aging, elderly people undergo degradation of these functions. In particular, a decline in
proprioceptive sense impairs the physical functions that maintain balance ability, resulting
in falls. Falls by elderly women occur more often than by elderly men. Countries across the
world have recognized this as a serious public health problem and are proceeding with
various prevention programs<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Many studies have verified that for the prevention of falls by elderly women, trunk
stabilization exercises that improve balance ability<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup> are required. This study examined the effects of exercise on an
unstable base of support for trunk stabilization, and Pilates mat exercise focusing on trunk
core activation, on the static and dynamic balance abilities of elderly women.</p><p>Static balance measures of both the PME group and the ISSE group significantly decreased
over time, suggesting that their balance abilities improved; however and the USSE group
showed less improvement in balance ability than the PME group. This result means that
continuous control of Pilates mat exercise was possible relative to the exercise on an
unstable base of support, and Pilates mat exercise on a stable base of support was more
effective. According to a study by Cressey et al.<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>, exercise on a stable base of support was more effective than on an
unstable base of support for static balance ability, which is consistent with the present
study&#x02019;s results. An uncontrolled unstable base of support improves static balance ability
through positive stimulation of the vestibular system rather than by strengthening deep
muscles, and Pilates mat exercise on a controlled stable base of support enhances static
balance ability through organic activation of the deep muscles of the trunk. Pilates mat
exercise also resulted in greater improvement in the static balance ability of elderly women
than exercise on an unstable base of support in the present study.</p><p>This study employed the TUG test in order to measure dynamic balance ability prior to and
after exercise. Both groups showed significant decreases in TUG time, and the PME group
showed more improvement in dynamic balance ability than the ISSE group. Shumway-Cook et
al.<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup> noted that TUG as test times of
14 seconds or longer indicated a risk of fall; 20 to 29 seconds indicated the possibility of
gait disability; and 30 seconds or longer suggested impaired gait ability.</p><p>According to the TUG results of our present study, prior to the exercise, the subjects had
TUG test performance times of 30 seconds or longer. After they conducted exercises three
times per week for 12 weeks, their TUG test performance times were within the range was 20
to 29 seconds; indicating an improvement in gait classification from possible gait
impairment to possible gait disability, Both exercises performed in the present study
elicited positive effects, but steady performance of Pilates mat exercise elicited better
improvements in static and dynamic balance abilities than exercise on an unstable base of
support.</p><p>In this study, PME and USSE elicited significant improvements in static and dynamic balance
ability when they were performed by elderly female subjects; i.e., both were effective at
enhancing balance ability. Therefore, both exercises are considered appropriate for elderly
women subjects. However, in terms of stability, Pilates mat exercise was safer than exercise
on an unstable base of support, and in particular, the Pilates mat exercise program was
easier to adjust to each individual&#x02019;s balance ability.</p><p>Based on the results of the present study, a future study that conducts a Pilates mat
exercise program with a greater number of subjects, and patients with musculoskeletal system
disease, as well as elderly women, is considered necessary. In addition, research into the
Pilates mat exercise program&#x02019;s relevant effects on motor functions, and more appropriate
exercises for improving subjects&#x02019; balance ability are also regarded as necessary.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><person-group><name><surname>Spiduso</surname><given-names>WW</given-names></name></person-group>: Physical Dimensions of aging.
