stabilization exercises in chronic low back pain patients. [Subjects and Methods] Swiss
ball exercise regimen group and sling exercise regimen group exercised for 30 minutes a
day, 5 days a week, for 12 weeks. The control group was to continue performing their usual
daily living activities. [Results] We obtained significant results in both the Swiss ball
and sling exercise groups, but not in the control group. The best effect was obtained in
the sling exercise group. [Conclusion] The Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Index and
visual pain scale scores of the patients with low back pain decreased in both the Swiss
ball exercise group and the sling exercise group, and these patients experienced an
increase in waist isometric muscular strength after 12 weeks of exercise compared with
those doing no exercise (the control group).</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Lumbar stabilizing</kwd><kwd>Sling exercise</kwd><kwd>Chronic back pain</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>As society is highly industrialized and automated, reduced activity and lack of physical
activity has brought an increase in chronic diseases that are accompanied by various
symptoms and disorders; back pain is one such disorder experienced by many people. More than
60&#x02013;90% of the entire population have back pain at least once in their life time. Excessive
force applied to the spine can cause a change in the intervertebral discs. Back pain is also
produced by the vertebral ligament that supports a vertebral body, muscle contractions, and
rupture phenomena, and unlike diseases, it frequently occurs in people in all types of
occupations, at any age, and at all levels<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>If the back pain persists repeatedly, the muscles around the spine can weaken, and this can
cause a decrease in muscle size and momentum compared with patients who do not experience
persistent back pain. There are various types of exercise treatments for low back pain; for
example, pain relieving pelvic tilt exercise therapy, muscle strengthening exercises,
flexibility exercises, endurance exercise, and physical adaptation exercises<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. The most widely used exercise therapies for
reducing pain are Williams flexion exercise and Mckenzie expansion exercise. Lumbar
stability exercises and core stability exercises, which are known to play an important role
in spinal segment control and to provide stability where there is spinal segmental
instability, complement the two widely used exercise treatments used in treatment of back
pain<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Lumbar stabilization exercise is performed within the painless range of motion. It is
progressed as isometric exercises, which control an unstable posture, and as lumbopelvic
posture-controlling exercises when undergoing functional activities. This lumbar
stabilization exercises leads to reduction of stress, as much as possible, when mechanically
applied to the human spinal structure while performing the functions of daily life and in
professional activities<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In addition to helping to maintain appropriate neuromuscular control and coordination, this
lumbar stabilization exercise is capable of expanding the shorter parts of muscles by
developing and strengthening the spine standing muscles that are involved in the
stabilization of the lumbopelvic and abdominal muscles<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Among these lumbar stabilization exercises, Swiss ball exercises and sling movements are
best suited if patients are self-motivated to participate in the exercise program, have less
burden of an anti-gravity condition, and require treatment that includes a variety of
applications<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In this study, after the Swiss ball exercise and sling exercise, it was considered to help
the rehabilitation treatment by comparing the effects on Oswestry Lumbar Disability Index, a
visual measure and Isometric lumbar muscles, and it was also conducted because more
systematic rehabilitation therapy could be possible by identifying each feature.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study was conducted using 30 male patients with back pain who had no particular
injury, had agreed to participate in this study, and were visiting the &#x0201c;S&#x0201d; center of &#x0201c;H&#x0201d;
industry, the &#x0201c;SM&#x0201d; training center, or &#x0201c;S&#x0201d; orthopedics in Ulsan. The participants were
provided a written informed consent form in accordance with the ethical standards of the
Declaration of Helsinki. The 30 subjects were divided into three groups of 10 and allocated
to a Swiss ball exercise group, sling exercise group, or control group. We asked the
patients to stop performing other exercises as much as possible within the prescribed period
of time so that we could monitor the effect of each exercise regimen.</p><p>The Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Index questionnaire, which was developed to measure
clinical remission and relapse in patients with back pain, was used. It showed that a degree
of functional disability appeared because of pain, and a self-questionnaire based on
interest and response on daily life under physical disability due to chronic low back pain.
The questionnaire consists of 10 questions regarding pain management, personal care,
walking, sitting, standing, sleeping, and social life. A score of 0&#x02013;5 is assigned for each
question, and the maximum total score is 50. After summing the scores for the questions, the
percentage is calculated relative to the total score of 50, and this is referred to as the
interference level<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In this study, a clinical visual pain scale was presented to evaluate the degree of pain.
After displaying the pain levels the patient felt on a straight line of a 10&#x02005;cm ruler
without gradations, we made points by measuring the distance from the starting point (the
range of points was from 0 to 10). We defined 0 points as indicating no pain and 10 points
as indicating unbearable pain. After this, each patient was asked to sit on a table for an
ISO check (Dr. August Wolff GmbH &#x00026; Co. KG Arzneimittel, Bielefeld, Germany) to consider
the length of his legs. His pelvis was then tightened with lumbar belt, and adjustments were
made to the shoulder width of proband and the height (the top surface of the cushion was
adjusted to match the height of the acromion of the proband). It was then fixed tightly
after winding it up around the thorax of the proband. Both feet remained in contact with the
floor and the patient kept both hands on the thorax cushion by using the proband and attach
the power sensor to the equipment. At the start of the measurement, the patient maintained
maximum muscular strength for 6 seconds in the direction indicated.</p><p>We asked the Swiss ball exercise group and the sling exercise group to exercise for 30
minutes a day, 5 days a week, for 12 week. The control group was to continue performing
their normal daily living activities. It was carried out in an active way and Swiss ball
exercise and Sling exercise were progressed in the same way.</p><p>Supine position pelvic lift ball exercise: Lift up both pelvic limb proximal on the Swiss
ball (or sling) in the supine position. After contracting the deep muscles, lift up the
pelvis to make the body a straight line. Kneeling position lumbar stability ball exercise:
Put each hand on the Swiss ball (or sling) making a kneeling position and move the trunk
forward. Side lying position pelvic lift Swiss ball exercise: After lying on either side,
put the distal of the pelvic limb on a Swiss ball. Side lying position pelvic sling
exercise: After contracting the deep muscles, lift up the pelvis to make the body a straight
line. Pilates of Swiss ball exercise: After making an all-fours posture, put the top of each
foot on the Swiss ball. Pilates of sling exercise: After contracting the deep muscles, fully
extend both the hips and the knees.</p><p>IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows (version 20.0) was used for statistical analysis in this
study. We described and analyzed the pre- and post-intervention results of the Oswestry Low
Back Pain Disability Index, the visual pain scale, and isometric muscular strength in the
all groups. The paired t-test was used to evaluate the changes between before and after the
intervention in the two experimental groups and the control group, and statistical
significance was accepted for p values of &#x0003c;0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>A significant difference was found between all three groups (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>General characteristics of the subjects</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Group</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (years)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Height (cm)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Weight (kg)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">SBEG</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">46.0&#x000b1;3.37</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">172.0&#x000b1;3.20</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">69.3&#x000b1;9.18</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">SEG</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">46.2&#x000b1;3.22</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">170.1&#x000b1;4.48</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">71.0&#x000b1;10.47</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CG</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">44.2&#x000b1;2.70</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">169.9&#x000b1;4.88</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">69.2&#x000b1;7.79</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>SBEG: Swiss ball exercise group, SEG: Sling exercise group, CG: Control group</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap>).

Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Index, the visual pain scale, and isometric muscular
strength when conducting an experiment using lumbar stabilization exercises for low back
pain patients assigned to a Swiss ball exercise group, sling exercise group, and control
group.</p><p>Low back pain is not a specific term for one disease but is a term that is broadly
expressed as a pain syndrome. It is also a term that refers to the pain syndrome that can
occur from below the end of the lumbar spinal cord of 2 which sacroiliac is finished to the
range of sacroiliac. It is defined as a symptom that appears as a result of musculoskeletal
and neurologic status problems<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Low back pain can be divided into acute, subacute, and chronic. It is defined as acute if
it lasts less than 6 weeks, subacute if it lasts 6&#x02013;12 weeks, and chronic if it lasts more
than 12 weeks. However, recently, pain has been classified as acute if it lasts 7 days or
less, subacute if it lasts from 7 to 17 weeks, and chronic if it lasts for more than 8 weeks
in terms of the period of active treatment. Because the causes of low back pain vary and are
complex, low back pain should be treated from different angles. The pain can be classified
as a disease that requires accurate diagnosis, since it is highly dependent on the
individual&#x02019;s psychological state<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Restriction of movement due to low back pain can lead to changes in the morphological
characteristics of the back muscles<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Back pain also affects the strength and endurance of the back muscles, eventually has an
adverse effect on lumbar spine stability, and can be a cause of functional disability<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>If we strengthen the lumbar area by applying Swiss ball exercises and sling exercises
selectively to prevent changes in muscles that limit movement, boost the stability of the
lumbar area, and prevent a malfunction of the back, we can obtain a positive effect. Back
stabilization exercise is one of the most popular methods of exercise treatment in recent
years, and it has been applied to a variety of patients: those with musculoskeletal
problems, those with low back pain, athletes, etc. Also, various types of lumbar
stabilization exercises have been implemented in order to prevent damage occurring in
everyday life, such as falling, and to target the general public to prevent back pain<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In an experiment with results similar to those obtained in this study, trunk stabilization
exercise was reported to be effective in preventing pain and recurrence of pelvic<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Furthermore, to determine the effect of a
trunk stabilization program on postural balance, speed, and functional muscular strength of
elite female handball players, we carried out the sling exercise training and focused on the
throwing action targeting 24 people for 6 weeks<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. We concluded that functional muscular strength of the pelvis and
trunk significantly improved; therefore, functional muscular strength exercise using a sling
was effective in improving neuromuscular adjustment<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. In another experiment, we found that spinal stability was greater
due to the increase of contractility of the lumbar bending and extending force and because
the intra-abdominal pressure was increased by the abdominal power. We need to reduce the low
back pain of patients through a lot of movement development and utilization using the sling,
as it has been shown to be effective for improvement of stability<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In conclusion, both the Swiss ball exercise and sling exercise resulted in a reduction in
the Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Index and the visual pain scale in patients with low
back pain, and these patients experienced an increase in lumbar isometric muscular strength
after 12 weeks exercise compared with patients who performed no exercise (i.e., the control
group). However, in comparing the Swiss ball and sling exercise groups, it was found that
the sling exercise group was more effective in decreasing the Oswestry Low Back Pain
Disability Index and the visual pain scale and increasing lumbar muscular strength.</p><p>We performed the sling exercise treatment by applying a variety of strengthening movements
to the patient by using easily the cause for changes such as the movement of the contact
point and adjustable straps with a line when we perform a certain task using different
muscles of the human body, certain muscular strength of muscle is considered to be more
useful to find the weakened muscles enough not to perform this function and enhance
them.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Leigh</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Introduction to occupational epidemiology</article-title>.
