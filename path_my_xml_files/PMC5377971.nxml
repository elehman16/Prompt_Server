Moreover, the mechanism of the effects of Vitamin D on calcium is not known and no study has been conducted on the effects of Vitamin D on leg cramps. Furthermore, Vitamin D is present in very quantities in food materials, vitamins are cheap, and pregnant women are very willing to take vitamins.

Thirty-three health centers from various areas in Tabriz, with different sociocultural situations that were visited by the largest numbers of women were first selected from the total of eighty health centers in the city. Health centers in the country are public, nonreferral, and governmental that all primary care services, including prenatal care, are provided free of charge. The participants were selected by purposefully method sampling. A list of all pregnant women in their 25<sup>th</sup>&#x02013;30<sup>th</sup> week of pregnancy who visited the selected centers was prepared. They were then contacted by telephone and invited to take part in the study. During their first visit to the center, the goals and method of the study were explained and the checklists for recording characteristics of leg cramps including the frequency, length, and intensity of leg cramps were given to them to record these during the week before the intervention started. At the end of this week, those who had recorded two and more cramps during the week and had other eligibility criteria entered the study and completed their informed written consent to participate in the research.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Randomization</title><p>The participants were allocated to three groups using a randomized block design with block sizes of three and six with the allocation ratio 1:1:1. To hide the allocation, each participant received two small envelopes, each with enough medicine for 3 weeks, inside a large matte-colored envelope of the same shape that were serially numbered. Each participant received one pill every day for 42 days.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Intervention</title><p>Pills containing Vitamin D (1000 units) or Vitamin D plus calcium complements (300 mg of calcium carbonate and 1000 units of Vitamin D) were of the same shape, size, and weight as the placebo pills. The pills were prepared by the Faculty of Pharmacy in Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Iran.</p><p>At the start of the intervention, each participant received a small envelope containing calcium plus Vitamin D or Vitamin D or the placebo, a checklist for recording leg cramp characteristics, and a checklist for recording daily multivitamins and pills taken during 3 weeks. They were asked to mark the checklists every time they took the pills. At the end of the 2<sup>nd</sup> week of the study, the participants were called and asked to record the characteristics of leg cramps during the third week in the related checklists. They were reminded to bring the medicine envelope and the checklist for leg cramps during the 3<sup>rd</sup> week and the checklist of medicines taken with them at the next follow-up that was at the end of the 3<sup>rd</sup> week. During this visit, each of the participants received a second envelope with the same content as the first, together with the checklists for the second 3-week period. At the end of the 5<sup>th</sup> week, the participants were called and reminded to record the characteristics of the leg cramps that happened during the 6<sup>th</sup> week in the related checklists.

The K-S test was used to investigate the normality of the quantitative data. The variables of the length of cramps before the intervention, during the 3<sup>rd</sup> week of the intervention, and during the 6<sup>th</sup> week of the intervention were not normal. The variable of the number of cramps was considered as discrete variable. The Chi-square, Chi-square for trend, Fisher exact test, and one-way ANOVA were used to examine the consistency of study groups. To compare the average pain severity of leg cramps between three groups, repeated measures ANOVA was used after intervention with adjusting for basic score. The baseline (preintervention) value of pain severity as possible confounder factor was entered to repeated measures ANOVA model as covariate. Sidak test was used as <italic>post hoc</italic> test for pairwise comparisons. Kruskal&#x02013;Wallis and Friedman tests were used, respectively, for inter- and intra-groups comparisons of the number and the length of leg cramps before, during the 3<sup>rd</sup>, and 6<sup>th</sup> after the start of the intervention. The power of repeated measures ANOVA test was equal with 0.74.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>In this study, 126 pregnant women with leg cramps from July 2013 to January 2014 entered the study and their conditions were followed up to April 2014.

They found that prescribing calcium carbonate at 500 mg/day for 45 days reduced the number, length, and pain intensity on the 45<sup>th</sup> day, but that on the 90<sup>th</sup> day after the first visit, these figures returned to their previous values.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Their results are not consistent with those of the present study.</p><p>Khoramroudi <italic>et al</italic>. observed that prescription of calcium at 500 mg/day for 40 days reduced the number of leg cramps but had no effect on pain intensity.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] Moreover, according to the study of Hammar <italic>et al</italic>. (1987), prescription of one gram of calcium for 2 weeks clinically improved leg cramps.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Results of these two studies do not conform to those found in the present study, probably due to the difference in the doses of the prescribed medicines, and because calcium was used together with Vitamin D in our research. We suggest that future studies be carried out using higher doses to determine the effective one.</p><p>According to the study by Zhou <italic>et al</italic>., there was no difference in the frequency of leg cramps after treatment with calcium versus Vitamin C.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Since the control group received ascorbic acid in their study, and cramps improved relatively or completely in most participants. Thus, ascorbic acid may also be effective in treating muscle cramps.</p><p>The results of systematic review by Young <italic>et al</italic>. showed that calcium can decrease pain in a leg cramps and it has positive effect on treatment.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Furthermore, the results of Cochrane systematic review showed that a greater proportion of women receiving calcium supplements experienced no leg cramps after treatment than those receiving no treatment. This review suggested that large well-conducted randomized controlled trials are needed in this regard due to poor study design and small sample size of trials. The results of these reviews are not consistent with those of present study.</p><p>The above-mentioned studies have assessed the effects of calcium on leg cramps but no studies have been conducted so far on the effect of Vitamin D supplement on cramps. However, calcium and bone metabolisms greatly depend on Vitamin D concentration and on its metabolically active form, 1,25(OH)2D, and the human body cannot absorb sufficient Ca and <italic>P</italic> without the help of 1,25(OH)2D.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] Moreover, the 1,25(OH)2D produced in the kidneys stimulate the calcium reserve in bone tissues and in the intestines and helps Ca and <italic>P</italic> absorption; and finally, the combination of these activities increases serum Ca and P. Increased levels of serum Ca and <italic>P</italic> cause improvements in metabolic performances, bone health, and neuromuscular functions.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] As Vitamin D and Ca had no effect on leg cramps in our study, and because the main reason for, and the mechanism of leg cramps in pregnancy are not clear yet,[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] leg cramps during pregnancy may not be due to calcium deficiency and could have other causes.</p><p>Lack of visual observation to investigate pain intensity in leg cramps was one of the limitations of this study. Furthermore, the impossibility of measuring blood calcium and Vitamin D levels was another limitation. It is recommended that future clinical trials should investigate the effects of Vitamin D and calcium-Vitamin D supplements with different doses of these materials, intervention should take place using a larger sample, and serum calcium and Vitamin D levels ought to be assessed to obtain results that are more accurate.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Results of this study indicated that taking 1000 IU Vitamin D and 300 mg calcium plus 1000 IU Vitamin D every day for 6 weeks has no effect on leg cramps. One of the limitations in this study was the short follow-up period, so that a follow-up period longer than 6 weeks in the future researches was suggested. Furthermore, the serum levels of calcium and Vitamin D did not determined in this study due to cost restrictions. Therefore, these supplements should be administrated by assessing their serum levels before and after the intervention.</p><sec id="sec2-7"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-8" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec1-6"><title>AUTHORS&#x02019; CONTRIBUTION</title><p>AM contributed in the conception of the work, conducting the study, drafting, and agreed for all aspects of the work.
