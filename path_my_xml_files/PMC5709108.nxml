The primary aims of this trial were to test whether replacing prednisone with dexamethasone during induction increases event-free survival in the subgroups with T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma and whether therapy duration could be reduced from 24 to 18 months (factorial design, randomizations). These questions could not be answered due to premature closure of the trial. Here we report on the secondary aims of the trial: whether the results of the NHL-BFM90 study could be reproduced and evaluation of disease features and prognostic factors. Three hundred and nineteen patients (66 with precursor B-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma, 233 with T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma, 12 with mixed phenotype, 8 not classifiable) were enrolled. In induction, 215 patients received prednisone and 104 patients received dexamethasone. The median follow-up was 6.8 years (range, 3.0&#x02013;10.3). The 5-year event-free survival was 82&#x000b1;2% [12 toxic deaths, 5 secondary malignancies, 43 non-response/relapse (central nervous system n=9; all received prednisone during induction)]. The event-free survival rate was 80&#x000b1;5% for patients with precursor B-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma, 82&#x000b1;3% for those with T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma, and 100% for patients with a mixed phenotype. During induction, significantly more grade III/IV toxicities were observed in patients receiving dexamethasone, resulting in significant treatment delays. The number of toxic deaths did not differ significantly. The only variable associated with outcome was performance status at diagnosis. The 90% event-free survival rate for patients with T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma shown in study NHL-BFM90 was not replicated, mainly due to more toxic deaths and central nervous system relapses. Dexamethasone in induction may prevent central nervous system relapse more effectively than prednisone but produces a higher burden of toxicity.

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)-type therapeutic strategies have been demonstrated to be efficacious in LBL. Treatment protocols derived from the Berlin-Frankfurt M&#x000fc;nster (BFM) group ALL strategy result in event-free survival rates of 75% to 90%. These survival rates are, however, achieved at the expense of considerable toxicity.<sup><xref rid="b1-1022086" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b7-1022086" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> On the other hand, children who do not respond to this treatment or who relapse after it still have an extremely poor chance of surviving.<sup><xref rid="b8-1022086" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Thus, many questions regarding optimal treatment of childhood LBL remain to be clarified.</p><p>Although LBL and ALL are biologically similar, they probably represent different diseases, as suggested by recent research,<sup><xref rid="b9-1022086" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b12-1022086" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> and advances achieved in the optimization of childhood ALL treatment cannot be adopted as LBL treatment strategies. In particular, meaningful parameters allowing risk-adapted therapies, such as chromosomal translocations and minimal residual disease monitoring,<sup><xref rid="b13-1022086" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="b14-1022086" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> are not yet available for LBL.</p><p>The lack of meaningful prognostic parameters for childhood LBL is mostly explained by the nature of the disease and the limited number of patients who are treated uniformly. In contrast to ALL, peripheral blood and bone marrow are limited sources of tumor cells. More extensive surgery to obtain appropriate tumor material for biological studies, may not be feasible given the often life-threatening condition of the patients at initial presentation. Thus, even the immunological classification of the lymphoma is not exact in some cases.</p><p>The EURO-LB 02 study was the second inter-group clinical trial of the newly established European Intergroup Cooperation on Childhood and Adolescent NHL (EIC-NHL). The patients were diagnosed and classified according to a standardized work-up, including a central pathology review. The treatment strategy of the trial was adapted from the NHL-BFM90 study, with the omission of prophylactic cranial irradiation.<sup><xref rid="b3-1022086" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b15-1022086" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> The primary aims of the EURO-LB02 study were to test, in a randomized manner, whether replacing prednisone with dexamethasone during the induction phase increases event-free survival (EFS) in the subgroup of patients with T-cell LBL (T-LBL) and whether therapy duration could be reduced from 24 to 18 months (factorial design). We could not answer these questions because the trial had to be closed prematurely due to a substantial number of toxic deaths.</p><p>Here we report on the results of the secondary aims of this study: to determine whether the outstanding results for patients with T-LBL in the NHL-BFM90 study could be reproduced in a large European inter-group trial, to assess features of the disease, and to evaluate prognostic factors.

The lower 5-year EFS of 82% for patients with T-LBL in the EURO-LB02 trial was primarily due to higher rates of toxic death (0% in NHL-BFM 90, 3.4% in EURO-LB02) and CNS relapse (cumulative incidence of CNS relapse at 5 years: 0% in NHL-BFM 90 and 3&#x000b1;1% in EURO-LB02; <italic>P</italic>=0.05), but the cumulative incidence of non-CNS relapse/non-response was comparable (cumulative incidence of non-CNS relapse/non-response at 5 years: 8&#x000b1;3% in NHL-BFM 90 and 10&#x000b1;2% in EURO-LB02; <italic>P</italic>=0.27).</p><p>The higher incidence of toxic deaths in the EURO-LB02 trial compared to the previous NHL-BFM studies<sup><xref rid="b3-1022086" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b5-1022086" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> cannot be clearly ascribed to a distinct reason.</p><p>At the premature stopping of the EURO-LB02 trial, the rate of toxic deaths in the 319 enrolled patients was 3.8% (no further toxic deaths occurred during follow-up) and was higher than expected from previous BFM group studies, since no toxic deaths were observed in the NHL-BFM90 trial<sup><xref rid="b5-1022086" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> and the rate of such deaths in the NHL-BFM95 trial was 1.3%.<sup><xref rid="b3-1022086" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Infection was the most frequent cause of death, and induction phase Ia and re-intensification phase IIa were clearly the most dangerous phases of this therapy.</p><p>According to several ALL studies, compared to prednisone, dexamethasone increases the toxicity of induction therapy.<sup><xref rid="b20-1022086" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b23-1022086" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> In the randomized ALL AIEOP-BFM 2000 trial, toxic deaths also occurred significantly more frequently in patients who were randomized to receive dexamethasone in the induction phase than in patients randomized to receive prednisone.<sup><xref rid="b24-1022086" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup></p><p>In the EURO-LB02 study, there was no significant difference in the number of toxic deaths between patients receiving dexamethasone or prednisone in induction phase Ia, either in the number of toxic deaths observed during induction phase Ia itself or in the total number of toxic deaths. However, non-fatal grade III and IV toxicity occurred significantly more frequently in patients receiving dexamethasone, resulting in a significant delay in subsequent treatment phases.</p><p>Some of the participating study groups had not previously used the BFM strategy. Although the toxic death rate was higher in those study groups than in the groups in which the BFM strategy had been established prior to the EURO-LB02 study, this difference was not statistically significant. Nevertheless, familiarity with treatment protocols should be considered when planning further multi-group trials.</p><p>An unexpectedly high number of CNS relapses was observed in the EURO-LB02 study; all of these relapses occurred in patients who had received prednisone during induction phase Ia. The prevention of CNS relapse remains an unsolved problem. The A5971 trial by the Children&#x02019;s Oncology Group (COG)<sup><xref rid="b25-1022086" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> showed comparable outcomes when CNS prophylaxis depended on the frequent delivery of intrathecal methotrexate compared to high-dose methotrexate. Thus, additional intrathecal methotrexate applications might represent a promising approach. Additional high-dose methotrexate infusions are another promising approach. In the SIOP LMT96 trial,<sup><xref rid="b26-1022086" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> ten courses of high-dose methotrexate (3 g/m<sup>2</sup>) were administered. Only one of the 79 trial participants experienced a CNS relapse. The administration of additional high-dose methotrexate infusions during the maintenance phase has also been shown to treat CNS disease effectively in patients with T-LBL.<sup><xref rid="b7-1022086" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Based on our data, the use of dexamethasone during induction phase Ia is more efficacious than prednisone in preventing CNS relapse, but is more toxic. The higher rate of infections observed in the dexamethasone group is of particular concern. This finding is consistent with the results from several,<sup><xref rid="b20-1022086" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b24-1022086" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="b27-1022086" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> but not all,<sup><xref rid="b28-1022086" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="b29-1022086" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> trials in patients with ALL. However, some studies have reported higher EFS and overall survival, despite higher rates of severe infection, in patients treated with dexamethasone than in patients treated with prednisone.<sup><xref rid="b23-1022086" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="b27-1022086" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> An important point to consider is the dose equivalence between dexamethasone and prednisone with regard to anti-tumor efficacy and toxicity. Data regarding these drugs&#x02019; relative anti-leukemic activity are inconsistent, and data on their toxic potential are lacking.<sup><xref rid="b30-1022086" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="b31-1022086" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> In animal models, the cerebrospinal fluid penetration of dexamethasone is greater than that of prednisone.<sup><xref rid="b32-1022086" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> Thus, a dose of dexamethasone lower than 10 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/day, which was used in this study, might be less toxic but more efficacious in protecting against CNS toxicity, as has been shown in children suffering from ALL.<sup><xref rid="b29-1022086" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> A shorter duration of dexamethasone treatment might be another reasonable option for taking advantage of the efficacy of dexamethasone at a tolerable toxicity.</p><p>The administration of dexamethasone for 2 weeks <italic>versus</italic> prednisone for 4 weeks in patients with high-risk precursor-B-ALL during induction therapy was recently shown to result in better efficacy of dexamethasone in patients younger than 10 years, but not in patients aged 10 years or older. The rate of CNS relapses was lower in patients treated with dexamethasone.<sup><xref rid="b33-1022086" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup></p><p>In the EURO-LB02 study, patients with stage I or II disease did not receive re-intensification therapy. Given the biological similarities between LBL and ALL, we reasonably asked whether patients with LBL would also benefit from delayed intensification therapy, like patients with ALL.<sup><xref rid="b34-1022086" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> Notably, the 5-year EFS rates for patients with stage I/II disease were 90% in both the EURO-LB02 study (5-year EFS, 90&#x000b1;5%, n=40) and the COG A5971 study<sup><xref rid="b35-1022086" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> (5-year EFS, 90%, n=51). However, delayed intensification therapy for patients with stage I/II disease was only administered in the COG A5971 study, resulting in a higher cumulative dose of anthracycline and cyclophosphamide.</p><p>Improving the outcome for pediatric/adolescent patients with LBL remains a challenge. The toxic death rate of 3.8% in our study indicates a critical balance between treatment efficacy and risks. However, the salvage of relapsed patients has been shown to be poor.<sup><xref rid="b1-1022086" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b8-1022086" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b25-1022086" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> Thus, treatment optimization involves finding highly predictive markers that enable the early identification of patients who are not curable with current treatments. These patients could be designated to alternative treatment strategies, whereas all others could be protected from the risk of experimental treatments.</p><p>We performed a comprehensive analysis of variables with possible impacts on outcomes in this large group of children who were classified and treated uniformly.</p><p>Apart from localized <italic>versus</italic> advanced stage, the only variable associated with decreased EFS was a poor performance status at diagnosis. Researchers have not clearly determined whether a poor performance status reflects disease with a more aggressive biology or difficulties in treatment realization. In any case, this parameter is not very useful for risk stratification. Nevertheless, this finding might alert physicians to pay special attention to these patients.</p><p>The EURO-LB02 study contributed reliable up-to-date information on the classification of patients with LBL. A central pathology review was performed in as many as 90.4% of the cases. Additional detailed immunohistochemical analyses of this large series were performed by the European Childhood Lymphoma Panel. The results enabled the development of a step-wise and material-sparing diagnostic approach as a complementary strategy to the strategy recommended by the World Health Organization.<sup><xref rid="b36-1022086" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> Based on this reliable classification, we also showed that the immunophenotype lineage had no additional impact on outcome. A novel observation from the EURO-LB02 study was that lineage promiscuity was present in as many as 4% of all patients diagnosed with LBL. Given the aggressive course observed in children with leukemia of an ambiguous lineage,<sup><xref rid="b37-1022086" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> the outcomes of the 12 patients with mixed phenotype LBL in the EURO-LB02 study were rather favorable, with no events observed among this subgroup.</p><p>The prognostic power of new biomarkers must be evaluated for the standardized classification and treatment of patients. NOTCH1 and FBXW7 mutations<sup><xref rid="b38-1022086" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="b39-1022086" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> and loss of heterozygosity at chromosome 6q<sup><xref rid="b38-1022086" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="b40-1022086" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> were recently shown to be promising prognostic biomarkers of pediatric T-LBL. Other candidates for prospective evaluation may be parameters of the kinetics of the response to treatment, such as those determined by positron emission tomography and minimal disseminated disease and its monitoring during treatment.<sup><xref rid="b41-1022086" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="b42-1022086" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> The network of collaborators established in the EURO-LB02 study may provide a platform for this purpose.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>An independent Data Safety and Monitoring Committee (DSMC) monitored the progress of this study and received reports on the current status of the trial every 6 months.
