Conventional routes of opioid administration consist of oral, intramuscular, and subcutaneous are helpful in controlling pain if the treatments are individualized and dosages are titrated to effect.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Nasal administration of opioids possibly is an option for intravenous (IV), transmucosal and subcutaneous analgesia administration in a number of patients and it is a subject on which attention is focused.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Different doses of fentanyl (75, 100, 150, or 200 &#x000b5;g) by both the intranasal (IN) and IV routes were compared for the management of acute pain in patients undergoing molar extractions. The onsets and durations of analgesia were not significantly different between single doses of IN and IV fentanyl (INF and IVF, respectively) in these adult patients.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Furthermore, in the postoperative period in patients undergoing surgery for abdominal, orthopedic, or thyroid surgery, INF was an effective alternative to IVF in postoperative patients.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>Fentanyl is a strong m-opioid receptor agonist with a relatively low molecular weight and (unlike morphine) lipophilic characteristics, which makes it appropriate for transmucosal administration e.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] On the other hand, IN administration of fentanyl results in a time to onset of action comparable to IV administration and cause pain relief with lower maximum plasma concentrations comparable to IV administration and results in lower rates of adverse events such as nausea, vomiting, and respiratory depression.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>To our knowledge, no study compares the effect of three routes of fentanyl administration for pain management. The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of IV, subcutaneous and INF for pain control in patients undergoing cesarean section.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This prospective, randomized, single-blind clinical trial was conducted in Shahid Beheshti Hospital in Isfahan, Iran. The study protocol was approved by the Anesthesiology Department and Ethic Committee of Isfahan Medical University and written informed consent was obtained from 75 healthy parturients with normal singleton pregnancy beyond 36 weeks of gestational age. Eligible subjects were American Society of Anesthesiology-1, 20&#x02013;40 years of age, undergoing cesarean section following general anesthesia with no history of substance abuse, drug hypersensitivity, blocked or traumatized nose, psychiatric or neurologic impairment (to be unable to do pain scoring) and not refusing nasal administration of the drug. Patients were randomized with the use of randomization tables to three groups (25 patients in each group).</p><p>After enrollment, every patient was weighed on the same scale. In the operating room, routine monitors including noninvasive blood pressure, electrocardiogram, pulse oximeter, and capnogram were attached to the patients and vital signs were recorded. All patients in three groups received similar induction and maintenance of anesthesia. General anesthesia was induced with 5 mg/kg thiopental sodium given over 10&#x02013;15 s, after preoxygenation for 5 min. An assistant applied cricoid pressure from the time of induction of anesthesia until the airway was secured. Laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation were performed 60 s after giving 1.5 mg/kg succinylcholine. Anesthesia was maintained with 50% nitrous oxide in oxygen and 1.2% isoflurane. Atracurium was used for muscle relaxation. EtCO<sub>2</sub> was maintained at 33&#x02013;40 mmHg throughout surgery. After delivery of the baby, analgesia was provided by 0.1 mg/kg morphine, and 20 IU IV Syntocinon in 1 L Ringer's lactate was infused to initiate uterine contraction.</p><p>Toward the end of the surgery, after closure of cesarean incision, patients were randomly placed in one of these three treatment groups:</p><p>

In this method, the patient should be reclining at 45&#x000b0; and the syringe should be held horizontal and the contents expelled as a mist into the nares in one rapid dose and not ask the patient to sniff. Dose of 1 ml should be divided between nares.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>An anesthetist who administered fentanyl did not interfere in data collection.</p><p>After completion of surgery, the residual effects of neuromuscular blockade were reversed with 0.05 mg/kg neostigmine and 0.02 mg/kg atropine.</p><p>At the time of admission to the recovery room and then for every 30 min, until 4 h postoperatively, the pain intensity and nausea were assessed by visual analog scale (VAS), ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worse pain). If analgesia was considered inadequate and VAS for pain was &#x0003e;4 the meperidine (1 mg/kg) were administered by an anesthesiologist. The systolic and diastolic blood pressures were measured and recorded before induction of anesthesia (baseline), before fentanyl administration and then at 5, 15, and 30 min later in the recovery room.</p><p>All data were collected and recorded by an anesthetist who was not aware of the method of intervention.</p><p>Data were analyzed using the SPSS version 20 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA). Assuming a 5% significance level (&#x003b1; = 0.05) and power of 80% (&#x003b2; = 0.20) to detect 1.3 differences in VAS score between three groups, a sample size of 25 patients per group was required. Statistical analysis was performed by using analysis of variance test, Chi-square test and Kruskal&#x02013;Wallis tests. A <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>A total of 75 patients were randomized during the study period. All of the patients completed the study and were evaluable. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>, the baseline characteristics of patients were equivalent. The average pain VAS score was less in the second group who received fentanyl subcutaneously at the time of recovery admission (6.8 &#x000b1; 1.5) (<italic>P</italic> = 0.037) and after 3 h (6.36 &#x000b1; 1.5) (<italic>P</italic> = 0.033) [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>]. The mean of VAS score of nausea was not statistically significant between three groups throughout the study (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05).

However, a significant group difference at 4 h after application of the fentanyl was achieved and individuals who received subcutaneous fentanyl had consistently lower self-reported pain intensity scores than the other groups without any side effect. These findings are of clinical significance.</p><p>Fentanyl, a synthetic opioid, is 7000 times more lipophilic and 75&#x02013;200 times more potent, than morphine.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] It is highly protein bound and has a high affinity for fat therefore extended exposure may consequence in accumulation in fat tissues.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] The drug has entered palliative care as a useful strong opioid,[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and is efficacious, well accepted, and well tolerated by patients than morphine in some cases.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] The onset of action of fentanyl is almost immediate when the drug is given intravenously. However, the maximal analgesic effect may not be noted for several minutes. The usual duration of action of analgesic effect is 30&#x02013;60 min after a single IV dose of up to 100 &#x000b5;g. IVF is used safely for severe cancer pain when the rapid titration is being considered.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Transmucosal fentanyl has been used in cancer pain management as an alternative route for opioid administration or as rotation strategy.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] INF has become available, providing an alternative analgesic that does not rely on venous access. The IN delivery of fentanyl provides rapid absorption (therapeutic levels within 2 min) and provide significant reduction in pain scores by 5 min. It has duration of action of at least 30 min and excellent bioavailability (at least 50%).</p><p>Borland showed that INF is a suitable analgesic agent for use in pediatric burns dressing changes either by itself or in combination with oral morphine as a top-up titratable agent.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Similarly, Finn <italic>et al</italic>.'s study revealed that patient controlled INF was similar in efficacy and safety to oral morphine for relief of procedural burns wound care pain.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Davies reported that fentanyl pectin nasal spray provided superior and more rapid pain relief with greater acceptability from breakthrough cancer pain (BTCP) compared with immediate-release morphine sulfate in patients with one to four BTCP episodes/day while receiving &#x02265;60 mg/day oral morphine (or equivalent) for background pain.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>Christrup <italic>et al</italic>. compared the tolerability, pharmacokinetic profile, and the efficacy of IN and IV administration of fentanyl in acute, episodic pain in patients undergoing third molar extraction. He concluded that the onsets and durations of analgesia were not significantly different between single doses of INF and IVF, and both routes of administration were generally well tolerated.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Since the IV administration causes quick systemic penetration, the finding that the clearance with these two routes was similar suggests that bioavailability via the IV route is high.</p><p>Moreover, data on the pharmacokinetics of subcutaneous fentanyl does not exist in healthy volunteers. Capper studied pharmacokinetics of fentanyl after subcutaneous administration in volunteers. He reported that absorption of subcutaneous fentanyl was relatively rapid and similar to the rate of absorption previously reported for subcutaneous morphine; the terminal half-life for fentanyl was substantially longer (10 h) than that of morphine (2.1 h), and blood concentrations were no more variable than that after administration by other non-IV routes.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Watanabe <italic>et al</italic>. studied retrospectively and showed that fentanyl by continuous subcutaneous infusion is a useful alternative for cancer pain.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] It is revealed that subcutaneously administered medicines are absorbed primarily by capillary diffusion, which makes it possible to avoid the so-called first-pass effect and therefore, there are no significant differences between the subcutaneous and IV application of medicines in terms of their absorption, efficacy and the frequency of side effects[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] which can explain the findings of our study.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Limitations</title><p>However, it is not yet clear whether the concentration-effect relationship elucidated here applies to patients with different types of pain. Furthermore, the patients involved in this study were relatively young; therefore, prediction of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of IN and subcutaneous fentanyl in older patients remains to be determined. Also, more emphasis should be placed on several concepts to obtain maximal efficacy when using IN medications. These concepts are minimizing drug volume while maximizing drug concentration, adequate dosing to overcome bioavailability limitations presented by the nasal mucosa, utilization of both nostrils to double the available mucosal surface for absorption and medication delivery characteristics.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>The IN and IV routes of fentanyl administration are similar regarding to their pain control and side effect incidence. Subcutaneous fentanyl is an effective alternative to IV and IN routes of administration for pain management particularly for patients where cannulation is undesirable or impossible.</p><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>This study was funded by the Isfahan Medical University.
