vibration stimulus during bodyblade exercise followed by forward head posture improvement.
[Subjects and Methods] Craniovertebral angle and cranial rotation angle were measured with
24 patients who were diagnosed with forward head posture. The experimental group conducted
bodyblade exercise for 6 weeks and all patients received conventional physical therapy.
The craniovertebral angle and cranial rotation angle were measured using a diagnostic
imaging device to measure the change in forward head posture. Sternocleidomastoid, upper
trapezius and serratus anterior muscle activity were measured using surface
electromyography, voluntary contraction was converting into a percentage and mean value
was calculated. [Results] The experimental group showed a significant increase in the
comparison of the results of both groups before and after the intervention. The comparing
group showed no significant difference. The experimental group showed the significant
difference in mean value after the intervention in the comparison between the groups.
[Conclusion] Resistant vibration stimulus by bodyblade controlled shoulder muscle activity
causing scapular stabilization followed by neck position stability improvement.
Rehabilitation program that activates whole kinetic chain of proximal and distal muscles
such as bodyblade will show more effective improvement when choosing rehabilitation
program for neck and shoulder disease clinically.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Bodyblade</kwd><kwd>Resistant active vibration stimulus</kwd><kwd>Forward head posture</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Neck tends to be exposed to injury or stress biomechanically causing structural change
because of its great mobility and low stability<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Long-term continuous neck forward flexion which is abnormal
asymmetric posture induces excessive forward flexion of lower cervical spine causing
increased flexion moment and forward head posture (FHP)<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Thoracic kyphosis accompanies RSP due to biomechanical connections between the neck and
back and body structural characteristics<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.
For RSP, acromion protrudes forward causing scapular protraction, downward rotation and
anterior tilt and scapula deviates from its normal position<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Abnormal scapular position
and movement produce imbalance in muscle activity and tone of surrounding muscles of neck
and shoulder girdle<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>, causing muscle
balance disorder such as upper crossed syndrome and neck pain and disorder<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, FHP and RSP are closely
related<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. In other words, scapula
stability exercise (SSE) that controls scapular position and movement can place thoracic
cage to neutral position and return abnormal neck alignment due to head forward flexion to
right position through muscle interactions in neck and shoulder. Treatment methods using SSE
are currently being studied for neck stability, alignment and pain reduction<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>A bodyblade is an effective tool for static and dynamic muscle strengthening of shoulder
and a dynamic response treatment tool that produces force proportionately with the
resistance of active vibration stimulus and is clinically used in many cases<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. It produces 151N by 4.5&#x02005;Hz proper
vibration and resistant vibration stimulus that requires 270 muscle contractions a
minute<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The exercise using a bodyblade is an open kinetic exercise but resistant vibration stimulus
produces resistance from distal to proximal body segment causing proprioceptive sense
facilitation by co-contraction and eccentric contraction that can be obtained from closed
kinetic exercise followed by dynamic stabilization of muscles<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. A bodyblade can be applied with various kinetic chain exercise
patterns but most previous studies only analyzed direct and partial effect such as shoulder
stability<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup> and core muscle
stabilization<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. So far, there are few
studies about the effect of actively induced resistant vibration stimulus.</p><p>Therefore, this study was to analyze the effect of SSE using a bodyblade on neck angle
improvement in patients with FHP proving the effect of the resistant vibration stimulus on
neck and shoulder disorder to provide effective and efficient treatment method and offer
basic data for physical therapy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study was conducted with the patients who were diagnosed with forward head posture
(FHP) and visiting or hospitalized in H hospital in Suncheon city, Jeollanam-do Province,
South Korea from Nov 2015 to the end of Jan 2016. All patients were informed of purpose and
method of the study prior to participation according to the ethical standard of the
Declaration of Helsinki. The patients were randomly divided into the bodyblade exercise
group (experimental group, n=12) and conventional physical therapy group (comparing group,
n=12).</p><p>FHP patients who have craniovertebral angle (CVA) of less than 52&#x000b0; and have cranial
rotation angle, (CRA) of more than 143&#x000b0; were selected. Those who had congenital spinal
deformity, spinal or shoulder surgery, nervous system problems, performed regular neck or
shoulder exercise and could not perform natural head posture (NHP) during FHP measurement
were excluded. Dominant arm of every patient was right side. <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>General characteristics of the subjects</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Experimental group (n=12)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Control group (n=12)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Gender (male/female)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1/11</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4/8</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (years)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">21.0 &#x000b1; 4.2<sup>a</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">25.4 &#x000b1; 10.1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Height (cm)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">163.8 &#x000b1; 5.6</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">165.1 &#x000b1; 7.2</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Weight (kg)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">61.3 &#x000b1; 10.3</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">58.7 &#x000b1; 8.0</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><sup>a</sup>Mean &#x000b1; SD.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap> shows general characteristics of the patients.</p><p>Bodyblade (Classic, Mad Dogg Athletics, USA), an elastic pole exercise tool with 122&#x02005;cm in
length, 0.68&#x02005;kg, 4.3&#x02005;cm in width, was applied to the experimental group. When you grasp the
rubber grip in the middle of the blade shaped pole and shake the pole, vibrations occurs
with constant frequency and velocity at both ends of the pole. For training task, intensity,
duration and frequency, two types of exercises that can improve FHP according to previous
study were conducted<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. For basic
posture, the patients were standing in anatomic position with feet shoulder width and knee
joint slightly flexed.</p><p>Exercise task (I); Grabbing the center of the pole with both hands with shoulder joint
flexed to 180&#x000b0; in overhead position with the pole perpendicular to the floor and oscillation
exercise in the sagittal plane. Exercise task (II); Grabbing the center of the pole with
both hands with shoulder joint flexed to 90&#x000b0; with the pole parallel to the floor and
oscillation exercise in the transverse plane. Also, the exercises were defined in a random
order. The exercises were conducted 3 times a week for 6 weeks, which were 18 sessions in
total. Foursets of each session, 3-minute exercise and 5-minute break, were conducted.</p><p>As conventional physical therapy, both groups received 20-minute hot pack, 15-minute
transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) and 5-minute ultrasound therapy in the
pain area; back of the neck and shoulder.</p><p>For FHP change measurement, CVA and CRA were measured. The patient relaxed and placed arms
on the sides of the body while comfortably standing in the NHP and reached to self-balance
posture (SBP). PROTEUS XR/A (GE Healthcare Co, USA) was used as diagnostic imaging device
from the lateral side of the patient. CVA and CRA were measured with the seventh cervical
vertebra, tragus and lateral canthus connected in a straight line. They were measured twice
to calculate mean value. Smaller CVA and greater CRA increase FHP level<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Delsys-Trigno Wireless EMG System (Trigno EMG Sensor, Delsys Inc., Boston, MA, USA) was
used to measure surface electromyography (sEMG) which was used to analyze muscle activity
change in neck and shoulder relating to FHP and RSP. For sEMG data, electrodes were attached
halfway between mastoid and manubrium of sternum for sternocleidomastoid muscle (SCM),
halfway between the seventh cervical vertebra and acromioclavicular joint for upper
trapezius (UP), and to muscle at the back of the center line of axilla at the fifth or sixth
rib height for serratus anterior (SA). The electrodes were attached to only dominant arm
muscles (right-side).</p><p>Delsys EMG Works Acquisition was used to analyze the data. Sampling rate of EMG signals was
set to 2,000&#x02005;Hz and frequency bandwidth for noise rejection of EMG was set as 20&#x02013;450&#x02005;Hz. The
collected EMG signals of each muscle were analyzed with root mean square (RMS).</p><p>For measuring posture for reference voluntary contraction (RVC), height adjustable bar was
set in front of the patient. The patient maintained humerus and elbow joint straight in
sitting position with forearms in neutral position and held 1&#x02005;kg dumbbell in hands with back
of hands side up. EMG signals were measured 3 times with shoulder joint flexed to 90&#x000b0; while
wrist joint touching the bar for 15 seconds. EMG signals during 5 seconds in the middle of
each trial were normalized as mean value to obtain RVC. All EMG data are expressed as
percentages of the RVC (%RVC).</p><p>The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was performed with the measured values to verify normalization.
To compare the results of both groups before and after the experiment, a paired t-test was
conducted. To compare the differences between both groups before and after the experiment,
an independent t-test was conducted. The significance level was set at &#x003b1;=0.05 and SPSS ver.
18.0 software was used for statistical processing.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p><xref rid="tbl_002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title>Comparison of changes in muscle activity and FHP angle between the groups</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="3" align="center" valign="middle" colspan="1">Variable</th><th colspan="2" align="center" rowspan="1">Experimental group</th><th colspan="2" align="center" rowspan="1">Control group</th></tr><tr><th colspan="2" rowspan="1"><hr/></th><th colspan="2" rowspan="1"><hr/></th></tr><tr><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pre-test</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Post-test</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pre-test</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Post-test</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">sEMG (%RVC)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">SCM</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">46.5 &#x000b1; 5.8<sup>a</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">36.83 &#x000b1; 6.1*&#x02020;</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">49.3 &#x000b1; 4.6</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">46.7 &#x000b1; 4.6</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">UT</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5.2 &#x000b1; 0.9</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3.6 &#x000b1; 0.5*&#x02020;</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.8 &#x000b1; 0.8</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.5 &#x000b1; 0.7</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">SA</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10.5 &#x000b1; 1.3</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">16.5 &#x000b1; 2.0*&#x02020;</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">11.0 &#x000b1; 0.8</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">11.1 &#x000b1; 0.8</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">FHP (&#x000b0;)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CVA</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">48.2 &#x000b1; 3.0</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">56.8 &#x000b1; 2.5*&#x02020;</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">49.5 &#x000b1; 1.4</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">50.7 &#x000b1; 2.9</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CRV</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">150.7 &#x000b1; 5.3</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">142.9 &#x000b1; 4.2*&#x02020;</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">147.7 &#x000b1; 4.6</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">147.2 &#x000b1; 5.2</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><sup>a</sup>Mean &#x000b1; SD. sEMG: surface electromyography; FHP: forward head posture;

vibration stimulus to control neck and shoulder muscle activity and stabilize shoulder, with
forward head posture (FHP) patients and measure changes in CVA and CRA to analyze FHP
improvement.</p><p>Weon et al. reported that FHP excessively increases muscle activity of UP<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thigpen et al. showed that, in comparison
with ideal posture, FHP causes SA muscle activity decrease and trapezius overwork during
upper extremity evaluation<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. SCM,
superficial neck muscle, muscle activity should be minimized for FHP improvement<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Muscle activity was measured using sEMG
after bodyblade exercise and there was a significant decrease in SCM and UP and there was a
significant increase in SA in this study. This result occurred because vibration stimulus
less than 50&#x02005;Hz produced during bodyblade exercise induced tonic vibration reflex on muscle
and tendon activating proprioception feedback<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,
<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. Lister et al. showed that bodyblade
training increases sense of position, movement and shoulder joint stability and decreases
pain and physical symptoms from shoulder joint instability<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Thigpen et al. showed that posture change due to FHP changes scapular movement and muscle
activity when raising hand over head<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. For FHP evaluation method, Harman et al.
used CVA and CRA as test inspector and analyzed FHP changes. This study also used CVA and
CRA in standing position to measure FHP<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. CVA significantly increased as 56.8 &#x000b1; 2.5&#x000b0; and CRA significantly
decreased as 142.9 &#x000b1; 4.2&#x000b0; after bodyblade intervention. Generally, CVA scale shows that CVA
less than 50&#x000b0; accompanies pain and CRV more than 145&#x000b0; is considered as abnormal range<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>As a result of this study, resistant vibration stimulus by bodyblade controlled shoulder
muscle activity and stabilized scapula followed by neck stability. This result occurred
because of &#x003b1;-motor neuron mobilization increase during vibration stimulus, neuromuscle
control, global muscle strengthening and proprioception feedback<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. Rehabilitation program such as bodyblade exercise which
activates whole kinetic chain of proximal and distal muscles will show more effective
improvement and should be considered when clinically choosing neck and shoulder disease
rehabilitation program in the future.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Chiu</surname><given-names>TT</given-names></name><name><surname>Ku</surname><given-names>WY</given-names></name><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>MH</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>A study on the prevalence of and risk factors for neck
