children because with the birth of a baby, life will
head toward another path. In contrast, in the case
of infertility, serious psychological problems may
be faced by partners (whether male or female) (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>).
Although in recent years infertile couples have
greater opportunities to bear offspring due to advances
in medical science and various fertility
methods (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>), this situation, as a tense crisis, influences
different life aspects of infertile couples
(<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). For most people, children are the meaning of
life and constitute an important part of their identity.
Multiple researches on infertile couples that
yearn for biological babies have shown that these
couples experience tension in a deep, distressed
manner (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). The medical definition of infertility is
as follows: after one year of usual sexual activity
without contraception if the woman is either not
pregnant or fails to become pregnant, she is considered
infertile (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).</p><p>Infertility brings about detrimental psychological
effects (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) that include reduced self-confidence,
disordered self-image, and impairment of masculine
and feminine identities (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Some researchers believe that infertility is a challenging experience
which leads to problems in marital life (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p><p>Marital adjustment is a changing process that includes
four aspects of couples&#x02019; performance as a joint
life: i. Marital life satisfaction, ii. Commitment to
marriage, iii. Agreement and unanimity in marital life,
and iv. Manifestation and expression of couples&#x02019; emotions
and feelings within the family (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Couples who
agree with each other are relatively satisfied with their
marital life and express satisfaction with their partner&#x02019;s
personality habits, enjoy companionship with
their family and friends, solve problems together, and
are highly satisfied with their marital and sexual life
(<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). One of the biggest problems that influence one&#x02019;s
personal and social life is sexual satisfaction which
plays a crucial role in personality development. Just
like other fundamental motivations of human beings,
sexual motivation and desire constitute an inevitable
part of their biological, psychological, and social natures.
The quality with which this a biological need is
met plays a very important role in personal and social
health, thereby achieving relaxation and comfort (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).
Couples&#x02019; degree of satisfaction with sexual relations
and ability to take pleasure in and give pleasure to
one another is called sexual satisfaction. Gratification
from sexual relations is one of the important factors of
marital life satisfaction, and those with greater sexual
satisfaction considerably report a better life related to
those without sexual satisfaction (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).</p><p>A desirable sexual relation can increase the possibility
of fertility. Furthermore, infertility, in turn, can
influence couples&#x02019; sexual relations. It is thought that
psychosexual disorders in infertile couples are more
prevalent than other couples (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Infertility leads to
increased sexual disorders, maladjustment, reduced
sexual satisfaction and sexual activity times (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Infertility
influences one&#x02019;s sense of self, sexual identity,
self-confidence, and body-image, it inevitably impacts
sexual relations, the importance of sexual relations,
and sexual desire along with satisfaction (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).
Researches show that men and women react differently
toward infertility.</p><p>Gender is an important factor in assessing differences
between men and women regarding the stress
of infertility and sexual satisfaction. Duration of infertility
and the reason and type of infertility are among
important factors of sexual and marital satisfaction of
infertile couples. Besides age, marriage length, education,
income, and social class have been stated in
different resources as factors that influence infertile
couples&#x02019; sexual and marital satisfaction (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Infertility
leads to couples&#x02019; reduced sexual satisfactions
(<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Anxiety and loss of self-confidence, shame, and
depression that result from infertility harm infertile
people&#x02019;s sexual performance. Moreover, diagnosis,
examination and treatment of infertility affect their
sexual satisfaction (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Dyer et al. (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) have reported
that dissatisfaction with sexual relations, stress and
planning for sexual relations, and lack of sexual selfesteem
in infertile women have the highest impact on
their sexual satisfaction. Additionally, since women
have reported that they only think about having a
baby while having a sexual relation, thus this concern
leads to increased stress (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).</p><p>Infertile couples experience tremendous stress at
the first phase of treatment regarding their sexual
activity, especially sexual desire and sexual arousal.
Women suffer more than men. Therefore, doctors
must pay attention to sexual problems of couples
in order to prevent a vicious cycle which may
decrease the possibility of pregnancy and cause
permanent disorder to their sexual relations (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>).</p><p>The relationship between infertility and sexuality
can be seen from two angles: i. Infertility as a cause or
ii. Infertility as a result of sexual dysfunction. However,
sexual disorders are considered as minor reasons
for infertility as approximately 5% of all infertile
cases result from sexual disorders (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). In addition,
men&#x02019;s sexual disorders include chronic erection dysfunctions
and non-ejaculation while the only sexual
disorder in women in terms of infertility is vaginismus
(<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Since the label of infertility is worrisome,
sexual intercourse can lose its spontaneity (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>).</p><p>Examination and treatment of infertility in traditional
social interactions leads to a high level
of psychological distress that directly affects couples&#x02019;
marital and sexual relations (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>-<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). The
clinical effect and impact of this disease on couples&#x02019;
overall health, daily performance, social interaction
and marital relations, and quality of life
is partly underestimated (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>).</p><p>In the examination of an infertile couple, it is
highly important to note that emotional factors, as
sexual disorders attributed to emotional factors,
may lead to infertility. Emotions have a key role in
the infertile couples&#x02019; relations and must be given
special attention. Therefore, one can use emotionally
focused couples therapy (EFT-C) that consists
of 9-20 short-term, structured sessions. This therapy is both a branch of couple&#x02019;s therapy and regards
emotions as a treatment axis. This treatment
addresses relational disorders and maladjustment
and encourages people to talk about and discuss
their emotions. From the EFT-C point of view, the
center of marital distress is created and continued
by negative affection and attachment injuries (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>).</p><p>In EFT-C, it is assumed that conflict in marital life
occurs when spouses fail to meet each other&#x02019;s attachment
needs for security, safety, and satisfaction. In
other words, disturbed marital relations are suggestive
of the couples&#x02019; failure in establishing relations associated
with a safe attachment pattern. By not meeting
each other&#x02019;s attachment needs, these spouses experience
secondary emotional responses such as anger,
hostility, vengeance, or feelings of guilt.</p><p>Secondary emotional responses are also manifested
in avoidant aggressive behaviors, which may
ultimately lead to the creditor-creditor or avoidanceavoidance
models. These inflexible interactional
models which also fuel conflict occur repeatedly because
spouses desperately want their genetic attachment
needs to be met. Unfortunately, partners&#x02019; efforts
to get the spouses&#x02019; attention are not made properly.
Consequently, the partners are forced into relations
that lead to continued failure of attachment needs
(<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Accordingly, EFT-C seeks to solve couples&#x02019;
problems by focusing on their emotional relationships.
The change process of EFT-C has been specified
in three phases that include: i. Prevention from
development of a vicious cycle; ii. Reconstruction of
interactional situations and iii. Consolidation and integration
(<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Therefore, the present study attempts
to explain whether EFT-C can increase the adjustment
of conflicting infertile couples that suffer from low
sexual satisfaction.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials-methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>This was a quasi-experimental study that used preand
post-tests on two groups, control and sample.</p><p>To test the hypothesis of research, that is the rejection
of null hypothesis (Ho) and the acceptance
of (HA), values of 0.05 and 0.01 were used for alpha.
In other words, for the level of significance,
probability of error was determined to be less than
P&#x0003c;0.05 or P&#x0003c;0.01 and if greater than 0.05 it was
considered to be non-significant.</p><p>We assessed subjects&#x02019; demographics after which
they were measured before conducting the independent
variable (EFT-C) as a pretest. Then, we administered
EFT-C to each couple in the experimental
group over a period of 10, 120 minutes sessions
in accordance with Johnson&#x02019;s model (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Subjects
were subsequently re-evaluated (post-test).</p><p>The statistical population of the study included
couples who visited infertility centers during 2013
and were identified by obstetricians and gynecologists
as infertile. Couples were living with each
other for at least 10 years. Individuals (men and
women) completed the marital adjustment and
sexual satisfaction questionnaires.</p><p>In this research, purposive sampling was used
whereby 30 couples (60 subjects) were selected
and randomly assigned to two groups, sample and
control. Each group consisted of 15 couples who
had marital maladjustment and low sexual satisfaction.
Inclusion criteria for the study were marital
conflict and low sexual satisfaction in infertile couples,
interest in couples therapy sessions, present
for all treatment sessions, having at least a high
school level of education, no significant acute mental-
physical disorders as self-reported in the demographic
characteristics questionnaire, and loss
of fertility after 10 years of marital life. Exclusion
criteria included lack of marital conflicts and high
sexual satisfaction in infertile couples, non-participation
in all stages of measurement and intervention,
having a significant acute mental-physical
disorder through the self-reported demographic
characteristics questionnaire, primary school level
of education, and infertility less than 10 years. All
participants expressed consent to participate.</p><p>In order to analyze data, we used descriptive
statistical methods that measured the mean, maximum
and minimum standard deviation. Analysis
of covariance was adopted using SPSS version 18
in the inferential section.</p><sec><title>Research tools</title><sec><title>Questionnaire of demographic characteristics</title><p>This inventory included factors of age, sex, educational
level, occupation, income level, and cause
of infertility, period of infertility, quantity of surgeries,
date of last surgery, history of attending
psychological or counseling sessions, as well as
histories of any chronic physical or psychological
disorders (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Spanier&#x02019;s Dyadic Adjustment scale</title><p>This scale is constituted of 32 questions based on a
Likert scale of responding which measures the total
score of marital adjustment in a range of 0 to 15. Individuals
who score 101 or less according to Spanier,
are deemed as maladjusted and those with higher
scores are supposed to be well-adjusted. In a study
by Hasan shahi (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>), well-adjusted couples had an
average score of 114.7 &#x000b1; 17.8 while the average score
for maladjusted couples was 70.7 &#x000b1; 23.8. Spanier categorized
the data into four subscales of marital satisfaction,
dyadic consensus, dyadic cohesion, and affectional
expression with evaluated validities of 0.94,
0.90, 0.81 and 0.73 respectively. The entire scale had
a validity of 0.96. Reliability was estimated to be
0.86 according to Pearson&#x02019;s correlation coefficients
between Locke-Wallace Marital Adjustment Scale
and Spanier&#x02019;s scale (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Index of Sexual Satisfaction</title><p>This scale was developed by Hudson et al. and
revised by Javidi (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). In 1981 it contains 25 questions
with a 5-point Likert response scale (1=never,
2=rarely, 3=sometimes, 4=most often, 5=always).
This scale evaluates sexual satisfaction in two aspects
of physical satisfaction and emotional satisfaction.
The dimension of physical satisfaction includes
sexual behaviors and sexuality whereas the emotional
aspect includes intimacy and quality of sexual relations.
Hudson believes that this scale assesses sexual
satisfaction through the intensity and extent of sexual
components. Internal consistency of this test by Cronbach&#x02019;s
alpha coefficient was calculated to be 0.92.
Studies have indicated that this questionnaire is significantly
related to scales designed to measure similar
constructs. The correlation coefficient of this scale
with the Marital Satisfaction questionnaire was 66%
(<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). This was the first time this scale was used in
Iran. Hence, we assessed the psychometric properties
from two aspects, reliability and validity. The alpha
value for the entire scale was calculated to be 0.88 and
for emotional satisfaction this value was 0.90. The alpha
value of the sexual behavior subscale was 0.84,
for sexuality it was 0.78, sexual intimacy was 0.87,
and quality of sexual relations was 0.74. The reliability
coefficient for sexual satisfaction by the method of
split-half was calculated to be 0.85 and the Spearman
revised coefficient was 0.92 (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> points out
the treatment protocol used in this study, this protocol
is emotionally-focused therapeutic approach, which
have been provided to the couple during 10 sessions.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Ethical consideration</title><p>
In order to observe ethical considerations, in this
study, the researchers made a great importance
to the confidentiality and preserving the couples&#x02019;
dignity. In addition, since the emotionally-focused
treatment training has been effective in experiment
group, the researchers also carried out such training
for members of the control group in their training
sessions after the completion of their work.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The demographic description of the sample is
provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">table 2</xref>. There were 30 participants of
both genders. The maximum and minimum frequencies
in terms of educational level were 19
(31.7%) individuals with diplomas and 10 (11.7%)
people with secondary school certificates. The average
age of participants was 33.8 &#x000b1; 5.03 years.</p><p>First, we used the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.
The data was approved as normal for all variables
(P&#x0003e;0.05). There was no significant difference between
groups in the pre-test subscales of marital
adjustment and sexual satisfaction.</p><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref> shows no significant difference between
groups in marital adjustment and sexual satisfaction
(P&#x0003e;0.05). Therefore both groups were the
same at the pre-test stage. According to <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">table 2</xref>,
it could be inferred that no significant difference
existed between groups in the pre-test sexual satisfaction
subscales (P&#x0003e;0.05).</p><p>According to the covariance analysis test results
in the dimensions of marital adjustment, there was
a significant difference between the pre- and posttests
in terms of couples satisfaction, couples correlation,
couples agreement, expression of love,
and sexual satisfaction (physical and emotional,
P&#x0003c;0.001).</p><p>In order to compare average sexual satisfaction
of the sample group with the control group at the
pretest stage, we statistically compared the two independent
means. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test
was also employed to assess normal distribution of
the variable of sexual satisfaction which, according
to the results, was confirmed (P=0.599 and Z
K-S=-0.526). Thus, comparison of two population
means is practicable. <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref> shows the results of

equality of the variances in the sample and control
groups was corroborated (P&#x0003e;0.05). Therefore, use
of covariance analysis was permitted. The results
of covariance analysis related to comparison of
mean scores of studied dimensions in the sample
and control groups are shown below.</p><p>As <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">table 2</xref> shows, there was a statistically significant
difference between the groups (P&#x0003c;0.001).
Thus, EFT-C positively affected sexual satisfaction
and marital adjustment in infertile couples. The
effective percentage of intervention was: dyadic
satisfaction (86%), dyadic cohesion (92%), dyadic
consensus (90%), affectional expression (90%),
physical sexual satisfaction (82%) and emotional
sexual satisfaction (90%0, which indicated the efficacy
of EFT-C.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Findings of the present study were consistent
with related studies. In different studies (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>-<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>)
it was found that infertile couples did not have
a clear sign and regardless of men&#x02019;s sexual role,
obtained a higher score in the sexual satisfaction,
sexuality, and orgasm items of the questionnaire.
A comparison of the results of Experimental
and control groups in terms of sexual
arousal, satisfaction, lust, and orgasm, suggested
that the experimental group was weaker than
the fertile control group. Sexual life of infertile
couples was poor due to infertility. In his study
entitled "Sexual Disorders in Infertile Couples",
Wischmann (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>) concluded that sexual dysfunction,
as the factor of reluctance to have children,
was relatively abnormal. Instead, temporary sexual
disorders in couples with infertility affected
women more than men due to diagnostic complications
and pharmacotherapy. Counseling for
couples with unfulfilled desires to have children
should include clear, appropriate clarification of
sexual and gender disorders.</p><p>Findings of this research corresponded with the
results of a study by Greil et al. (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>) as well as
another research by Martins et al. (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Greil et al.
(<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>) declared that EFT could have significant positive
and constructive effects on the relationship of
couples and their satisfaction with life which might
have declined due to infertility. Greil et al., through
a meta-analysis, stated that a variety of psychological
interventions could improve both life quality
and relationship of infertile couples. The single
difference between these methods was the size of
the effect. Couples therapy surpassed the other interventions
in this respect. This achievement could
be attributed to the fact that couples therapy during
the intervention points out at the same time.</p><p>Tie and Poulsen believed that EFT was influential
in the promotion of couples&#x02019; marital adjustment.
After intervention, the relationship of
couples improved and they expressed increased
satisfaction from their spouses when compared to
the past. Marital disputes significantly decreased
and an upturn was observed in marital adjustment.
The results of Tie and Poulsen&#x02019;s research have
been confirmed by the present study. Dyadic consensus
is one the aspects of marital adjustment.
Increase in this area denotes growth of dyadic consensus
(<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>).</p><p>Bodur et al. (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>) measured the effect of marital
adjustment in infertile couples on stress related to
infertility. This study included 104 couples with
primary and/or secondary infertility and 44 fertile
couples as the control group. Women in infertile
groups reported more psychological symptoms
and decreased marital adjustment than men in infertile
groups, but there was no significant difference
between partners in the control group regarding
the aforementioned parameters. In general,
infertile couples had decreased marital adjustment
and increased depression and anxiety levels. Nevertheless,
if infertile couples were mentally supported
and received service from social systems,
their marital adjustment would increase and psychological
symptoms disappear.</p><p>Barani Ganth et al. (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>) reported that fertile
couples were more satisfied with their marital life
than infertile. The effect of infertility on women&#x02019;s
satisfaction appeared more concerning compared
to men. Infertility in women has been shown to
lead to a life with low marital satisfaction.</p><p>Jalil and Muazzam (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>) found a significant relationship
between emotional intelligence and marital
satisfaction in both groups. A comparison of
both groups showed that fertile women with higher
emotional intelligent had greater levels of marital
adjustment. On the contrary, infertile women with
lower emotional intelligent suffered from poorer
marital satisfaction.</p><p>Moura-Ramos et al. (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>) showed that contextual
factors such as socioeconomic status and urban
or rural residence impacted affective anxiety
in infertile couples. An Investigation into marital
relationships in infertile couples showed that male
infertility did not any negative effect on the marital
relationship.</p><p>In Austria, Drosdzol and Skrzpulec (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>) evaluated
sexual and marital Interactive responses in infertile
couples which showed that marital relations
of infertile women were less than fertile women.
As a result, the former were more prone to marital
disorders than fertile women.</p><p>Mira (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>) investigated the effect of EFT-C on
knowledge, competence, emotional processing,
and self-compassion of 76 participants. The results
showed that knowledge and competence of
participants in the experimental group increased
as a result of therapy. He also stated that a significant
relationship existed between competence
and the emotional process of individuals as well
as self-compassion. Javidi et al. (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>) investigated
the long-term effect of EFT-C on knowledge, competence,
self-compassion, and secure attachment.
Results showed the effectiveness of EFT-C in increasing
knowledge, competence, self-compassion,
secure attachment, and personal interactions.</p><p>Pinto-Gouveia et al. (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>) investigated the efficacy
of protective emotion-regulation training
toward adjustment in infertile patients. They reported
that infertile couples had problems with
expression of emotions and mutual understanding
of their partners&#x02019; feelings which were notably
resolved by training in emotion-regulation strategies.
After intervention, couples had great success
in affectional give and take with improvement in
their marital adjustment (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). Javidi et al. (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>)
indicated that EFT-C could significantly increase
sexual satisfaction of couples.</p><p>Finally, it can be said that EFT-C trains couples to
correct their behavior through increasing security
and support, availability, response to the spouse&#x02019;s
need and creating safe behaviors, methods of increasing
intimacy and relationships, learning
proper communication skills, and establishment of
desirable sexual relations.</p><p>This study has regarded sexual satisfaction as an
important factor for controlling daily emotions. In
explaining the reason for the increase in couples&#x02019;
sexual satisfaction due to EFT-C, it can be said that
this therapy teaches couples to reveal the important
problems of their life to their spouses, receive
a positive response from spouses. In addition, they
can also increase their verbal and non-verbal interactions,
show sexual self-expression including
touching, hugging, and kissing, express their
thoughts, feelings, needs and tendencies, and have
more physical closeness. Considering that sexual
relation is among the most important matters in
marital life and acts as the emotional barometer in
relations, it can reflect couples&#x02019; satisfaction with
other aspects of the relationship. Thus, it is a good
scale of the overall health of couples&#x02019; relations.</p><p>Use of this treatment plan can help to increase
couples&#x02019; sexual satisfaction and intimacy, leading
to improved overall relations for couples.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This treatment approach can increase adjustment
and sexual satisfaction in couples. Results
from this research can create a clear and practical
outlook for counselors, psychotherapists, and
family therapists. The results can provide couples
with desirable applied and empirical guidance for
creating self-esteem and detection, and revision of
inconsistency in their way of giving messages to
each other, their communication patterns and, as a
whole, human growth which consequently reduces
marital conflicts and increases adjustment. The results
of the emotional sexual satisfaction dimension
were consistent with those reported by Huppelschoten
et al. (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>).</p><p>EFT-C, through concentrating on the emotional
relationship, manages to solve couples&#x02019; problems.
Accordingly, marital disputes that result from
emotional problems and insecure attachment can
be addressed by EFT-C. Sexual dissatisfaction generally
appears in the form of complaining, blame,
or rebuke and extremely endangers attachment.
The sexual relationship is more than intercourse
and is a way to achieve harmony and create positive
emotions which thereby strengthens attachment
(<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). Application of this therapeutic plan can
promote sexual satisfaction of couples and their
intimacy.</p><p>By taking into consideration the effects of EFT-C
on marital adjustment and sexual satisfaction, we
propose that additional research should investigate which technique from the EFT-C approach has the
highest level of effectiveness.</p><p>As infertility has negative effects on marital satisfaction,
it is recommended that necessary training
be provided in fertility clinics to lessen social
and psychological stress of clients and increase
their marital adjustment. Since familial disputes
are the most important cause for separation between
infertile couples, training in marital relationships
can prevent couples from divorcing and
instead, reinforce their family&#x02019;s foundation.</p><p>Constraints of the study included the number
of questionnaires and large numbers of questions
which made the respondents tired. Additionally
there was no follow-up due to participant refusal.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors whole heartedly thank all families,
