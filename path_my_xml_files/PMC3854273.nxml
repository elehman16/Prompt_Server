After Ethics Committee approval and patients' informed consent, the drugs were compared in 40 adult and 40 elderly patients scheduled for elective surgery under TIVA with tracheal intubation who were randomized to receive a single bolus dose of 0.15&#x02005;mg/kg cisatracurium or 0.9&#x02005;mg/kg rocuronium. The time of onset of maximum depression, duration of action, and recovery index time were measured and recorded for each patient and variability is reported as means &#x000b1; standard deviation. Time of onset was significantly shorter for rocuronium than cisatracurium for the adult and elderly groups (P = 0.000), but the variability of cisatracurium was significantly greater compared with rocuronium for the same age groups (93.25 <italic>vs</italic> 37.01&#x02005;s in the adult group and 64.56 <italic>vs</italic> 33.75&#x02005;s in the elderly group; P = 0.000). The duration of the effect in the elderly group receiving rocuronium was significantly longer than in the elderly group receiving cisatracurium, and the variability of the duration was significantly greater in the rocuronium group than in the cisatracurium group. Mean time of recovery was significantly longer for the elderly group receiving rocuronium than for the elderly group receiving cisatracurium (P = 0.022), and variability was also greater (P = 0.002). Both drugs favored good intubating conditions. In conclusion, cisatracurium showed less variability in these parameters than rocuronium, especially in the elderly, a fact that may be of particular clinical interest.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Neuromuscular relaxant</kwd><kwd>Rocuronium</kwd><kwd>Cisatracurium</kwd><kwd>Variability</kwd><kwd>Elderly</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="1"/><table-count count="1"/><ref-count count="19"/><page-count count="5"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p id="para2">Adequate control of the duration and quality of neuromuscular blockade (NBD) during surgery is essential for safe and successful surgery, but incomplete recovery of neuromuscular function can endanger patients, decrease the sensitivity to hypoxia, augment the risk of lung complications, cause aspiration, upper airway obstruction, visual trouble, and dysphagia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B01">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B02">2</xref>), and also slow the throughput of patients in the operation room by increasing the time of resuscitation.

We wondered if the duration of action and variability are greater for rocuronium than for cisatracurium. Since the variability of the onset and duration of the effect of the two drugs has not been compared in the elderly population under total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA), the aim of this study was to compare the pharmacodynamic parameters following the administration of a single dose of 0.15&#x02005;mg/kg cisatracurium and 0.9&#x02005;mg/kg rocuronium to elderly patients, with special attention paid to the variability of these parameters.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><p id="para6">The study was approved by the local Ethics Committee (Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan University) and was conducted on 80 adult patients: 40 adult (18-64 years) and 40 elderly (&#x02265;65 years) patients, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I-II scheduled for elective general surgery under TIVA with tracheal intubation, muscle relaxation and mechanical ventilation.

The acceleration transducer used to monitor neuromuscular function was placed on the volar side of the distal phalanx of the thumb with no preload to the thumb. The arm was cushioned and supported to allow unrestricted movement of the thumb. Every 12&#x02005;s, neuromuscular transmission was monitored as the evoked response of the adductor pollicis muscle to a supramaximal train of four (TOF) electrical stimulation (0.2-ms square wave at 50&#x02005;mA at a frequency of 1&#x02005;HZ). When the response after TOF was zero, direct laryngoscopy was initiated followed by tracheal intubation. The conditions for intubation were recorded according to the scales published by Claudius and Viby-Mogensen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>).

</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="para17">Postoperative residual neuromuscular blockade is an important event that may contribute to postoperative pulmonary complications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Thus, the ideal muscle relaxants should provide a more predictable recovery from their neuromuscular block. This characteristic is particularly relevant when treating elderly patients. The present study demonstrated a significantly smaller variability in the duration and recovery time of cisatracurium compared to rocuronium in adult and elderly subjects.</p><p id="para18">In the present study, the onset time of the effect of equipotent doses (0.9 and 0.15&#x02005;mg/kg) was significantly shorter with rocuronium than with cisatracurium. Rocuronium is a relatively low-potency, intermediate acting NBD, which is commonly used during anesthesia. It is taken up principally by the liver and excreted in the bile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). The main advantage of rocuronium is the rapid onset of neuromuscular blockade, which has led to its use in conditions where succinylcholine is relatively or absolutely contraindicated. An inverse relationship between molar potency and onset time of neuromuscular blockade has been shown for nondepolarizing NBDs of both long and intermediate duration. A rapid onset of action is characteristic of drugs with low potency, so the onset time of rocuronium is significantly shorter compared with cisatracurium. Another report suggested that rocuronium possesses an unusually high affinity for presynaptic sites compared to other nondepolarizing NBDs. Perhaps this is another reason for the rapid onset of the effect of rocuronium. In the elderly population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>), when somebody at risk of aspiration (unconsciousness, intestinal obstruction, etc.) needs rapid intubation, rocuronium is a very good alternative for a rapid onset of neuromuscular blockade.</p><p id="para19">However, the duration and recovery index were significantly longer in the elderly group compared with the adult group receiving rocuronium. Furthermore, the corresponding variability in the elderly rocuronium group was significantly greater compared to the adult group. Age-related changes occur in the neuromuscular junction, but Matteo et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>) found that there is no alteration of the sensitivity of the acetylcholine receptor with increasing age. However, with increasing age the change of function of vital organs may influence the pharmacokinetics of neuromuscular blocking drugs. Although the patients we studied had no abnormal renal and liver function, subclinical age-related changes may have existed. For example, a reduction in cardiac output, decreased hepatic and renal blood flow, smaller liver mass, and lower glomerular filtration rate may decrease the rate of elimination of neuromuscular blocking agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Thus, the differences in distribution and elimination of NBDs via organ-dependent elimination in the elderly have been suggested to be likely explanations for the prolonged offset time and the corresponding variability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>).</p><p id="para20">Whereas the duration of action and spontaneous recovery increased with rocuronium in elderly patients, these parameters were comparable for adult and elderly patients treated with cisatracurium. In elderly patients, the variability in the duration of action and spontaneous recovery after the last drug dose was significantly greater for rocuronium than for cisatracurium. This result may correlate with the elimination of the two drugs: the organ-dependent elimination of rocuronium and the organ-independent elimination of cisatracurium.</p><p id="para21">It has been well documented that the clearance and plasma half-life of rocuronium are prolonged with normal aging. This has not been the case with cisatracurium. Cisatracurium is one of the stereoisomers that make up atracurium, and Hofmann elimination may have a greater role in the elimination of cisatracurium than in the elimination of atracurium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B07">7</xref>). Thus, for the elderly patients cisatracurium was a good choice, with similar and constant duration and recovery index between the adult and the elderly populations. The anesthesiologist could make sure of the postoperative safety of patients and the rapidity of throughput of patients in the operation room because of its more predictable behavior.</p><p id="para22">The onset of the action of cisatracurium was slower than that of rocuronium. This difference has been explained by the slower biophase equilibration, resulting in a delayed and reduced peak concentration of cisatracurium at the effector site, but in our study there was no significant difference in onset between adult and elderly patients receiving cisatracurium. Sorooshian et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>) suggested that the onset of the effect of cisatracurium was marginally rapid in young patients compared to elderly patients, and the primary factor was a reduced rate of biophase equilibration in the elderly (being reduced to 0.060/min in the elderly as compared to 0.071/min in the young).</p><p id="para23">We observed a comparable duration of action of and recovery from neuromuscular block in adult and elderly patients receiving cisatracurium in contrast to a prolonged offset in the elderly after rocuronium. Furthermore, cisatracurium showed less variability in these parameters than rocuronium, especially in the elderly where this may be of particular clinical interest. However, the variability of the onset time for the two age groups was greater for cisatracurium than for rocuronium. This point still needs further research.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="B01"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Igarashi</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Amagasa</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Horikawa</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Shirahata</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Vecuronium directly inhibits hypoxic neurotransmission of the rat carotid body</article-title><source>Anesth Analg</source><year>2002</year><volume>94</volume><fpage>117</fpage><lpage>122</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">11772812</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B02"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Baillard</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Gehan</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Reboul-Marty</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Larmignat</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Samama</surname><given-names>CM</given-names></name><name><surname>Cupa</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Residual curarization in the recovery room after vecuronium</article-title><source>Br J Anaesth</source><year>2000</year><volume>84</volume><fpage>394</fpage><lpage>395</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">10793602</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B03"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Maybauer</surname><given-names>DM</given-names></name><name><surname>Geldner</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Blobner</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Puhringer</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>Hofmockel</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Rex</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Incidence and duration of residual paralysis at the end of surgery after multiple administrations of cisatracurium and rocuronium</article-title><source>Anaesthesia</source><year>2007</year><volume>62</volume><fpage>12</fpage><lpage>17</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">17156221</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B04"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Cammu</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>De Witte</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>De Veylder</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Byttebier</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Vandeput</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Foubert</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Postoperative residual paralysis in outpatients versus inpatients</article-title><source>Anesth Analg</source><year>2006</year><volume>102</volume><fpage>426</fpage><lpage>429</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16428537</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B05"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Fuchs-Buder</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Eikermann</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>[Residual neuromuscular blockades.
