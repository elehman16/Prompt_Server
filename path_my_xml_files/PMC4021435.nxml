The progression of the disease is associated with recurrent exacerbations that may lead to decline in lung function, quality of life and exercise capacity while increasing the risk for mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Cachexia and muscle atrophy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] are critical extra-pulmonary manifestations of COPD. It is well established that skeletal muscle function (strength and endurance) and structure (fiber quality, capillary density and metabolic capacity) are altered in patients with COPD <italic>i.e.</italic> shifted towards a decreased oxidative capacity of the muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. In addition, it was shown that the anabolic-catabolic ratio is shifted towards the catabolic state of the muscle, which is accompanied by ischemia-related apoptosis injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>Pulmonary rehabilitation improves exercise performance, dyspnea, and quality of life, reduces the effects of acute exacerbations and prolongs the interval between exacerbations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Current guidelines recommend pulmonary rehabilitation for all stages of COPD but do not explicitly recommend it during an acute exacerbation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The central components of rehabilitation are exercise and strength training. It is hypothesized that the expression of the transcription factor peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor-&#x003b3; coactivator 1&#x003b1; (PGC1-&#x003b1;) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] is relevant for the reconstitution of body strength by exercise training. PGC1-&#x003b1; stimulates expression of FNDC5, a membrane protein that is cleaved and secreted as a newly identified hormone called Irisin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The upregulation of PGC1-&#x003b1; has been shown to decrease inflammation and increase angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>Whole body vibration (WBV) is a novel exercise training modality performed on a vibrating platform that moves in sinusoidal oscillations, during which static and dynamic exercises can be performed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. A randomized clinical trial has demonstrated greater improvements in a number of exercise tests in the group of COPD patients (GOLD stages III and IV) trained on the WBV platform compared to a group that was conventionally trained [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>In the past decades research described pathological features of COPD patients which included lung tissue remodeling, fibrosis, pulmonary and systemic inflammation, lung vascular remodeling, and angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. For that reason, we also evaluated putative beneficial effect of standard physiotherapy programme complemented with WBV relative to standard physiotherapy programme by measuring serum markers of angiogenesis (ICAM-1, VEGF and ACE) and apoptosis (gelsolin, soluble Fas Ligand/TNFSF6, soluble Fas (CD95)/TNFRSF6).</p><p>We conducted a proof of concept study in the form of a randomized clinical trial, in which we added WBV training to conventional physiotherapy in a group of patients hospitalised for a COPD exacerbation and compared this group to COPD subjects that only underwent conventional physiotherapy. The goal was to evaluate if WBV training is safe and improves exercise capacity and quality of life, and whether putative improvement is associated with measurable changes in circulating levels of irisin, a recently described hormonal marker of muscle activity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Patients and study design</title><p>COPD patients hospitalized due to severe COPD exacerbations at our hospital between November 2010 and July 2012 were asked for their interest and informed voluntary consent to participate in our clinical trials.

The randomization was performed by a third party (a statistician from the sleep laboratory of the University of Marburg). A computer generated list was used to produce envelopes that were stored in a locked room. The investigator who wanted to include a patient called the statistician, reported the patient&#x02019;s identification number and received the allocation to one of both treatment groups.</p><p>Group 1 was a standard physiotherapy programme (Control group, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;20: 5 min mobilisation, 5 min passive movement, and 10 min respiratory exercises), group 2 was the standard programme complemented with sessions on the WBV device (WBV group, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;20; Galileo&#x02122;, Novotec Medical, Pforzheim, Germany). Physiotherapy consisted of mobilisation to bedside and stand, respiratory therapy and passive muscle movements. In the WBV group additional training was performed in a supervised manner 3&#x000d7;2 min/day on the vibrating platform. The patient stood with bended knees on the platform according to published recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The side-alternating movements of the device cause muscle contractions on the entire flexor and extensor chain of muscles in the legs and the trunk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Both training programmes started at the day of study inclusion (the same day or the day after the patient`s admission to the hospital). Details on the training procedures can be found in the Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Table S1.

We found that WBV improved exercise capacity and quality of life. In addition, there was an increase in serum levels of PGC1-&#x003b1; and irisin, i.e. muscle activity markers that may be induced by the exercise.</p><p>A growing body of literature has reported benefit of WBV for patients with cystic fibrosis, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] multiple sclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] and stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. To date, trials regarding efficacy of WBV in patients with COPD are scarce. Results from two studies investigating the effects of WBV therapy in patients with stable COPD showed a significantly greater improvement in the 6MWT, and a significant decrease in maximum oxygen desaturation during the 6-MWT than compared to patients in control group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>There is a major medical need to improve treatment of patients hospitalized for COPD exacerbations. So far these patients are treated primarily with drugs &#x02013; bronchodilators, steroids and antibiotics. Recently, studies have been published that evaluate muscle training concepts during exacerbations. Troosters et al. evaluated resistance training and demonstrated improvement of the 6MWD by a median of 34 m after patient discharge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. In a small pilot study (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;15), Abdeallaoui et al. tested neuromuscular electrostimulation and concluded that neuromuscular stimulation is effective in counteracting muscle dysfunction and decreasing oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. So far, there are no published data analyzing the effects of WBV in patients with COPD exacerbations. With this as a background, we aimed to quantify the clinical benefit of WBV therapy in a group of patients hospitalised for a COPD exacerbation.</p><p>We were able to demonstrate that the addition of WBV therapy to a physiotherapy regimen enhances exercise capacity and quality of life. Specifically, we observed a strong effect on 6MWD, which increased by 95.55&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;76.29 m. The magnitude of the 6WMD improvement was comparable to that described by Pleguezuelos et al. (81.2 m) in the stable phase of the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>Interestingly, 19/20 patients in WBV group (compared to 9/19 in the control group) improved 6MWD by more than 35 m, which is considered as a minimal clinical important difference (MCID) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Furthermore, 16 out of 20 WBV patients (compared to 12 out of 19 in the control group) displayed improvements in SGRQ of 4 or more units. So far, only one study investigated the beneficial effects of WBV on quality of life in COPD patients and found no difference between WBV and control groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. We guess that the differences between our and previous results could be attributed to the nature of vibration, intensity, and time or amplitude of vibration performance. Due to the paucity of data only preliminary recommendation exist on the practical approach to WBV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>When comparing WBV to standard physiotherapy alone (Control) we had to notice that standard physiotherapy only led to very minor improvements. It is well known that the peripheral muscle strength decreases during an hospitalization of COPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] Furthermore, a very recent overview states that convincing evidence for the effectiveness of physiotherapy during a hospitalized exacerbation of COPD is missing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] and the recent BTS guidelines on COPD and pulmonary rehabilitation do not cover that topic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. The marginal improvements raise the question on what ground patients were discharged. However, regarding QoL and discharge it has to be acknowledged (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>: Figure S2) that also patients in the control group improved the symptom subdomain of the SGRQ but did not show an overall improvement. As the decision to discharge a patient is mainly depended on symptoms it seems reasonable why patients had been discharged despite having a worse overall QoL score.</p><p>The mechanism of vibration stimulus is not wholly understood; however, it is hypothesized that vibration increases fluid flow, activates muscle spindles, and increases osteogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. It is suggested that some of the best-recognized effects of exercise on muscle are mediated by the transcriptional coactivator PGC1-&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. PGC1-&#x003b1; is induced in muscle by exercise and stimulates mitochondrial biogenesis, angiogenesis and provides resistance to muscular dystrophy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The benefits of elevated muscle expression of PGC1-&#x003b1; are believed to go beyond the muscle tissue itself. For example, transgenic mice with mildly elevated muscle PGC1-&#x003b1; are resistant to diabetes and have a prolonged life-span [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. PGC1-&#x003b1; stimulates expression and secretion of hormone irisin, which causes an increase in total body energy expenditure and resistance to obesity-linked insulin-resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Hence, irisin reflects benefits of exercise and muscle activity.</p><p>We found that clinical improvements in the WBV group paralleled with a marked increase in serum levels of PGC1-&#x003b1; and irisin, the systemic markers linked to muscle physiology. It is important to point out that although the net exercise time was short; we still were able to observe changes in circulating levels of PGC1-&#x003b1;/irisin. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the suggested connection between physical exercise training and the PGC1-&#x003b1;/irisin pathway is supported by the findings from a randomized clinical trial.</p><p>When compared to controls, the WBV group also showed a pronounced decrease of serum levels of IL-8 whereas levels of angiogenesis markers, such as ICAM-1, VEGF, and ACE, and apoptosis markers, such as gelsolin, soluble Fas Ligand/TNFSF6, soluble Fas (CD95)/TNFRSF6), did not differ. We cannot say whether the effect of WBV on the IL-8 levels results from a direct modulation of chemokine production by vibration, or if this modulation is secondary to an improvement in muscular properties. Better muscular activity could lower inflammation and result in decreased production of proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines, a possibility that, however, has not yet been properly investigated.</p><p>Notably, WBV therapy was well tolerated by the exacerbated COPD patients and no adverse effects were noted during the training program. It was discussed that exercise training during acute exacerbation of COPD may accelerate systemic inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Despite these worries, no increase in serum levels of acute phase proteins, such as CRP and AAT, was found in the WBV training group relative to controls.</p><p>This randomized clinical trial has some limitations. First, it was a single centre study, and only 49 patients were randomized. Due to the severity of the disease, especially for the first time point (inclusion), some patients were not able to perform the 6-MWD. To eliminate a potential bias, we calculated the intra-individual effect by setting the admission value to 3 m, which was the lowest values that was obtained by the study. This maximises the effect in the control group. Nevertheless, the inter-group difference in the 6MWD increase was still significant in a favour of WBV (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.009) (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S6">6</xref>: Figure S4). Although the assessment of the SGRQ and CAT did not yield identical results, the deltas of SGQR and CAT correlated significantly with each other (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.53; p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001), demonstrating good agreement. We did not perform a sham procedure; therefore the patients were not blinded for the allocation. Finally, muscle biopsies before and after WBV therapy would provide a major insight in the muscle metabolism, vascularisation and inflammation.</p><p>We conclude that WBV is safe, feasible and may exhibit positive effects on clinical parameters (exercise capacity, quality of life) in COPD patients hospitalized due to an exacerbation of their underlying disease. Since the addition of WBV to common exercise training increases the physical activity and enhances circulating levels of the hormone irisin in exacerbated subjects with COPD, it is possible that this training modality within a short timeperiod improves muscle activity, attenuates inflammatory pathways, and improves quality of life. Larger studies are needed to define optimal intensity and duration of WBV as well as to investigate its possible long-term effects.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Whole body vibration exercise in hospitalised COPD patients did not exhibit adverse events and induced clinically significant benefits regarding exercise capacity and health-related quality of life.
