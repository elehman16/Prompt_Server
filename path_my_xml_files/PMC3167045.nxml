Proof-of-concept studies must provide a strong bridge between mechanistic, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies, and confirmatory studies for efficacy. These studies often have designs for effects of new interventions on a single primary outcome. Since a small sample size (of up to 350 patients) has insufficient power for clinically significant treatment targets (such as dyspnea relief or cardiovascular death), many proof-of-concept studies address surrogate endpoints so as to have adequate power. However, positive effects on such surrogate endpoints (e.g., wedge pressure, BNP) may not translate into obvious clinical benefit in later studies. For instance, if an efficacious intervention does not affect a surrogate this will lead to a false-negative proof-of-concept study result and may lead to abandoning the intervention and not pursuing the intervention in confirmatory studies. On the other hand, ineffective interventions may have apparent positive effects on surrogates (false-positive) leading to unnecessary confirmatory studies in which the true lack of efficacy is discovered after years of futile effort [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Consequently, the selection of endpoints for proof-of-concept studies has become a major challenge in acute heart failure (AHF) research.</p><p>A possible solution to this dilemma is to design proof-of-concept studies to explore whether a therapy demonstrates consistent indications of a possible clinical benefit for multiple endpoints that are relevant to the disease. If an intervention&#x02019;s effect is examined on six endpoints&#x02014;for instance, symptoms, recurrent disease, readmission, death, quality of life and functional improvement&#x02014;having a positive effect on one of them (for example, symptoms only) and no effect on the other endpoints may represent a chance finding and not a real beneficial effect. If, on the other hand, the intervention improves symptoms, reduces disease recurrence and re-admissions and improves quality of life, the probability that all these beneficial effects are the result of chance and not a real benefit of the intervention is low. Subsequent studies can then confirm the therapy&#x02019;s potential benefit.</p><p>We have investigated the value of this approach in the Preliminary study of RELAXin in Acute Heart Failure (Pre-RELAX-AHF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The purposes of this study were to assess the potential clinical efficacy of the new intervention, to choose a dose from among four active doses for further study, to assess the distributions of the endpoints, and to re-assess the sample size needed for a subsequent confirmatory study. Although the protocol identified primary and secondary endpoints, the analysis plan recognized that the sample size did not provide adequate power to detect statistically significant differences, and so the overall pattern of results was to guide the dose selection for the subsequent confirmatory study. In the main study manuscript [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], a consistent, U-shaped dose response was described across multiple endpoints recognized as treatment targets in AHF, but given the modest sample size, many of their <italic>P</italic> values were not statistically significant at the traditional two-sided 0.05 level. In this paper, we examine the usefulness of a method, called a permutation criterion, for quantitatively evaluating the totality of the data for evidence of efficacy and for choosing among multiple doses.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>A permutation criterion, also known as a re-randomization criterion, is a statistical method based on the distribution of all possible results when treatment groups are reassigned to subjects. A permutation sample is generated by taking the observed data for each subject, and randomly re-assigning the treatment group to the subjects in the same ratio as in the original sample. This procedure is then repeated multiple times to obtain many permutation samples. The statistical assessments of interest are generated for each permutation sample. If the treatment has an effect, then one would expect the observed pattern of results to occur rarely among these re-randomized samples. Fisher&#x02019;s exact test, with which many researchers are familiar, is a permutation test for a single dichotomous endpoint.</p><p>In a proof-of-concept study with multiple endpoints, criteria can be established for evidence of efficacy and for choosing a dose. A possible criterion for evidence of efficacy can be based on <italic>P</italic> values from univariate pairwise comparisons of each dose with placebo for all candidate endpoints; e.g., positive &#x02018;trends&#x02019; with one-sided <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.10 (equivalent to two-sided <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.20 favouring active drug) for the majority of the endpoints is applicable, and its occurrence by chance can have assessment across permutation samples. The dose with the most positive trends among the endpoints could be the selected dose. With this criterion, the number of positive trends in each dose group is calculated, and the proportion of permutation samples with that number or more positive trends is computed. This proportion represents the probability of obtaining at least the observed number of positive trends by chance alone. Thus, no adjustment for multiple endpoints is needed, as the single global null hypothesis that all nine endpoints for each dose are no different or worse than placebo is being assessed (with a single associated permutation <italic>P</italic> value) against the alternative of a preponderance of results in favour of at least one dose. The criterion for dose selection may be further restricted, for example, by further requiring nonnegative trends (one-sided <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;0.90, equivalent to two-sided <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.20 favouring placebo).</p><p>Pre-RELAX-AHF was a parallel-group, randomized, dose-ranging study in 234 patients with AHF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00520806). Patients with dyspnea, pulmonary congestion, elevated BNP or NT-pro-BNP, mild to moderate renal impairment, and systolic blood pressure &#x0003e;125&#x000a0;mmHg were randomly assigned within 16&#x000a0;h of presentation to 48&#x000a0;h of continuous IV infusion of placebo, or 10, 30, 100, or 250&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/kg/day relaxin in a 3:2:2:2:2 ratio. The study complied with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by appropriate ethics committees. All patients gave written, informed consent prior to study participation. Five randomized subjects were not treated with study drug and were excluded from the analyses. Subject self-report of dyspnea and physician-assessed heart failure signs and symptoms were recorded at 6, 12, and 24&#x000a0;h, daily through day 5, and at day 14 following randomization. Subjects were contacted at days 30 and 60 to obtain rehospitalization information and vital status and at day 180 to ascertain vital status. This proof-of-concept study was conducted to determine whether a confirmatory study for IV relaxin was warranted in this patient population, and, if so, to identify a dose, to select endpoints, and to provide a basis for sample size calculations. The pattern of results across nine clinical outcomes was evaluated with one-sided <italic>P</italic> values &#x0003c;0.10 in favour of active treatment considered indicative of potential efficacy.

Of the 4 doses studied, this dose group was the only group to meet the criterion of a majority of endpoints with one-sided <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.10 favouring relaxin compared to placebo; it had the greatest number of favourable endpoints with one-sided <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.10 (6 of 9), and it had no unfavourable result with a one-sided <italic>P</italic> value&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;0.90. Through a permutation criterion, we have shown that the probability of observing such an extreme number of favourable trends in any dose group by chance alone is &#x0003c;1%. Thus, it is unlikely that the observed effect on clinical endpoints for the 30&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/kg/day dose is a chance finding. We conclude that 30&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/kg/day relaxin has potential clinical efficacy in the treatment of AHF, and so its effects on dyspnea relief and 60-day mortality and morbidity&#x02014;endpoints found to be responsive to therapy in this proof-of-concept study&#x02014;are being assessed in an ongoing RELAX-AHF-1 confirmatory study.</p><p>Dose selection and proof of activity are often based on a surrogate endpoint (such as a biomarker) for which a study with small sample sizes can have insufficient power. However, such a surrogate endpoint may not be predictive of the drug&#x02019;s effect on clinical outcomes in a confirmatory study. Reliance on a single, primary, surrogate outcome measure in proof-of-concept studies may lead to decisions that would not be confirmed, including false-positive results driven by an effect of the intervention on the surrogate but no activity on the disease, false-negatives and the abandoned development of potentially beneficial therapies, or in the selection of an inappropriate dose for further study. A novel approach that has been recently incorporated into the design of cardiovascular clinical trials is to examine multiple clinical outcomes for evidence of a drug&#x02019;s activity and worthiness for further evaluation.</p><p>Several studies have evaluated multiple clinical endpoints, but the approach taken in integrating results across these multiple endpoints has varied. One approach is to assign a score to each subject by assigning values based on results over the endpoints. For example, in the African-American Heart Failure Trial (AHeFT), subjects were assigned a rank score from &#x02212;6 to +2 based on weighted values for all-cause mortality, first heart failure rehospitalization, and quality of life score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. This ranked composite outcome was then used as the primary outcome for comparing treatment groups. A similar criterion has been proposed for use in trials of mechanical circulatory support devices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], and in AHF studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In the end, the risks of the therapy must be weighed against the potential benefit, and an advantage of the ranked individual outcome is that the risks and benefits to the individual patient are incorporated in the criterion. The disadvantage of such an approach, however, is in the difficulty interpreting the criterion: several different outcome combinations could result in the same score, and a therapy might affect some components in one direction and others in a different direction. Simpler, three-category ordered outcomes (success, unchanged, failure) have been used in several AHF programs, including the REVIVE studies evaluating levosimendan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and the PROTECT studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] evaluating rolofylline. In designing such criteria, individual components must be chosen and weighted such that a favourable score reflects benefit outweighing risk to a meaningful degree.</p><p>Another potentially useful approach in exploratory studies where the most sensitive endpoint to the therapy is unknown is to analyse multiple endpoints individually and look for consistency of results across the endpoints. For example, in the design of the CUPID study, researchers considered as evidence of efficacy &#x0201c;improvement&#x0201d; (two-sided <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.2 for an endpoint with favourable point estimates for other endpoint(s) within the domain) in 2 of 5 efficacy &#x02018;domains&#x02019; on a study-level, or two-sided <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.2 on a subject-level composite outcome of success/unchanged/failure based on improvement in at least one efficacy endpoint without worsening on any others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. They estimate the probability of a &#x02018;false-positive&#x02019; given this approach to be &#x0003c;0.10 assuming a lack of correlation among the domains.</p><p>Other approaches involve computation of a global statistic across multiple endpoints. A multivariate test such as Hotelling&#x02019;s <italic>T</italic><sup>2</sup> allows comparison of groups regarding multiple endpoints simultaneously, but can be insensitive to situations in which individual endpoints are not statistically significant, but the pattern of results suggests efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. O&#x02019;Brien [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] suggested a global rank-sum-type test, based on a simple or weighted sum of ranks across the individual endpoints. This method is powerful only if the treatment effects on all endpoints are in the same direction. This limitation could be handled with a step-down approach to testing each individual endpoint given rejection of a global null hypothesis of no effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], or through weighting of the individual endpoints in an attempt to create an overall benefit-to-risk measure.</p><p>The permutation criterion described here allows an assessment of multiple endpoints simultaneously with consideration of the direction of the treatment effect. The method is flexible, and can be adapted to examine different hypotheses. In Pre-RELAX-AHF, we have computed a multiplicity adjusted <italic>P</italic> value based on the number of endpoints with favourable trends, given the observed data including the correlation structure, allowing an informed decision regarding the role of chance in the findings. Results of the RELAX-AHF-1 study will either confirm or refute the efficacy of the selected relaxin dose on primary and secondary endpoints chosen from among those in the proof-of-concept study.</p><p>A common misconception is that evaluating several clinical outcomes simultaneously increases the probability of a false signal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Although it is true that the probability of obtaining at least one &#x0201c;positive&#x0201d; result from a long list of potential variables is higher than the nominal <italic>P</italic> value used for each of the multiple outcomes, requiring demonstration of multiple concurrent effects does not necessarily increase the likelihood of a chance finding. Assuming independence (or no correlation) among the clinical outcomes of interest, the probability of observing the pairwise comparison of a dose and placebo for one of nine endpoints significant at the traditional, one-sided 0.025 level by chance alone would be 0.184, while the chance of observing at least six of nine positive trends (with one-sided <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x02264;&#x000a0;0.10) versus placebo in would be 0.000064. As the correlation between the endpoints increases, the chance of observing multiple concomitant trends becomes higher. If the nine variables were very highly correlated (e.g., all correlations &#x02265;0.9), the chance of observing six of nine positive trends (one-sided <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.10) would approach 0.15 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], while if they were perfectly correlated (all correlations&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1.0) the probability would be 0.10. The value calculated for the present study (0.0017) is higher than one would expect if all the endpoints were independent reflecting a modest correlation among the variables. Therefore, observing six of nine positive trends in Pre-RELAX-AHF is not likely to be the result of either a chance finding or that these were basically six expressions of identical phenomena highly correlated with each other.</p><p>We have applied this approach to the Pre-RELAX-AHF database retrospectively. Although the endpoints examined are recognized as important endpoints in AHF studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], the nine endpoints selected and the analytic method for examining them concurrently were not identified prospectively; thus, the proposed approach should be considered untried. The approach could be applied prospectively when designing future studies by identifying the endpoints to be examined and the criteria for evidence of efficacy and dose selection a priori. The acceptable false-positive rate should be chosen, and then power calculations conducted to determine the number of subjects needed. Once the study is completed, results observed in the study population should be compared against the criteria chosen for evidence of effect and dose selection, and permutation <italic>P</italic> values computed for the observed results. Each of these design elements is considered in further detail below.</p><sec id="Sec5"><title>Choice of endpoints</title><p>When designing these studies, endpoints should be included that would be appropriate for a confirmatory study. While surrogate endpoints might be included in addition to clinical endpoints as evidence of effect in a proof-of-concept study, these endpoints would probably not be selected as primary endpoints in a confirmatory study. One should also consider that the more endpoints examined, the lower the probability of observing a majority of favourable trends by chance alone. For example, if the endpoints selected were uncorrelated, the probability of at least four of seven positive trends by chance alone is 0.0027, while for at least five of nine, it is 0.00089. As described above, correlation among the endpoints reduces the ability to determine effects by observing multiple trends and is analogous to reducing the number of endpoints, thus increasing the probability of observing multiple positive trends by chance alone. Therefore, endpoints should be selected that are not too highly correlated with one another. However, this may introduce a dilemma since it may not be known a priori which endpoint within a &#x02018;domain&#x02019; might be most sensitive to the treatment. One example is dyspnoea relief which could be measured using either a Likert scale where the patient compares their symptoms to baseline or a visual analogue scale where the patient rates their symptoms at each point in time and effects could be measured either at 6 and 24&#x000a0;h or over 5&#x000a0;days. A possible solution is to compute an overall <italic>P</italic> value within each domain, and then proceed with the evaluation of potential efficacy across domains as described here for individual endpoints.</p><p>Once the proof-of-concept study is complete, the choice of endpoints as primary in the confirmatory study must be guided by both statistical and other concerns. Endpoints with favourable results in the proof-of-concept study would seem to have a higher probability of demonstrating a treatment effect than untested ones or ones without evidence of effect. Choosing the endpoints with the lowest <italic>P</italic> values must be balanced, however, with study objectives. For the RELAX-AHF-1 study, two primary endpoints were chosen from among those tested in the proof-of-concept study: moderately or markedly better dyspnea reported on the Likert scale at 6, 12, and 24&#x000a0;h; and the area under the change in dyspnea visual analogue scale score from baseline to day 5. Although these were not the two endpoints with the lowest <italic>P</italic> values in Pre-RELAX-AHF, the confirmatory study is designed primarily to evaluate relaxin&#x02019;s effect on dyspnea relief, and a positive finding for either of these endpoints would likely support regulatory approval for this indication.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Choice of criteria for evidence of efficacy and dose selection</title><p>A criterion for acceptance of proof of concept illustrated here was a simple majority of endpoints favouring the test treatment and with a positive trend at the one-sided 0.10 level. A criterion for evidence of effect based on a majority of endpoints has been accepted in other research fields. For example, the ACR20 composite endpoint in rheumatoid arthritis defines a responder as a patient who has at least five of seven endpoints with at least 20% improvement, although this criterion is applied to individual patients within a group rather to comparisons between two groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The <italic>P</italic> value for a comparison between two groups represents a standardized effect size that accounts for sample size. For a continuous endpoint with equal sample sizes in the two groups, one-sided <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x02264;&#x000a0;0.10 corresponds to <inline-formula id="IEq1"><alternatives><tex-math id="M1">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

With 50 subjects per group, one-sided <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x02264;&#x000a0;0.10 corresponds to <italic>d</italic>&#x000a0;&#x02265;&#x000a0;0.256&#x02014;a small effect size with potential clinical relevance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>Other criteria for evidence of efficacy could be constructed, for example, by accepting &#x02018;positive trends&#x02019; on surrogate markers but requiring that clinical endpoint(s) demonstrate positive trends as well. The choice of criterion should be driven by consideration of an acceptable false-positive rate which could be estimated through simulations taking into account the correlations among the chosen endpoints and assuming no treatment effect. After the study is completed, the permutation <italic>P</italic> value can be calculated using the observed results with actual correlation structure.</p><p>The dose selection criterion for the confirmatory study suggested here was to choose the dose with the most favourable trends. It might be possible in a proof-of-concept study for more than one dose group to satisfy the criterion demonstrating potential efficacy. If one dose group was not clearly superior to the other, both doses could be explored further in the confirmatory study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Power and sample size considerations</title><p>How many subjects to include in proof-of-concept studies is an important consideration. With the approach described here, the power obtained to detect a majority of endpoints with positive trends is greater than that required for each individual endpoint. If the endpoints were independent, 65% power for each of nine endpoints would provide approximately 83% power to detect five of nine favourable trends. Of course, higher correlations among the endpoints may result in less power than that calculated assuming independence. To estimate power correctly for such studies, one should assume somewhat higher correlations than expected and strive to include more rather than fewer patients. Power calculations can be achieved through simulations which preferably should be based on real data from previous programs rather than theoretical assumptions. This underlines the importance of sharing data freely among different stake holders in research.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Limitations</title><p>Balancing apparent efficacy and potential safety concerns may not be possible through purely statistical methods. The method described in this paper is a novel approach to assessing potential activity of new therapies, but shares the limitation with other statistical approaches that safety concerns may in some cases be related to single or very few extreme events that do not approach statistical significance. Hence, final decisions on whether a new therapy should be further explored must involve clinical judgment balancing efficacy and safety.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Examination of consistency of findings across multiple clinical endpoints in a proof-of-concept study may be useful in identifying efficacious therapies, and in selecting a dose from among several tested. The permutation method described allows a determination of the role of chance in these findings. In this retrospective analysis, application of this method to the Pre-RELAX-AHF proof-of-concept study shows that the multiplicity adjusted <italic>P</italic> value for observing at least 6 of the 9 AHF endpoints examined with a one-sided <italic>P</italic> value&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.10 favouring active treatment in one of 4 dose groups by chance alone was &#x0003c;1%. These data and analyses have been used to design the ongoing RELAX-AHF-1 confirmatory study, which will assess the efficacy of the selected relaxin dose primarily in relieving dyspnoea and secondarily in reducing morbidity and mortality in AHF patients. The merit of the approach described requires confirmation through prospective application in designing future proof-of-concept studies.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Jill El-Khorazaty, Michael Hussey, and Daniela Sotres for their review and helpful comments.
