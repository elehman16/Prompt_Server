The aim of this randomised control trial was to determine the efficacy of two structured lifestyle interventions, differing in dietary macronutrient content, on insulin sensitivity and body composition in adolescents. We hypothesised that a moderate-carbohydrate (40-45% of energy), increased-protein (25-30%) diet would be more effective than a high-carbohydrate diet (55-60%), moderate-protein (15%) diet in improving outcomes in obese, insulin resistant adolescents.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Obese 10<bold>&#x02013;</bold>17 year olds with either pre-diabetes and/or clinical features of insulin resistance were recruited at two hospitals in Sydney, Australia.

The intervention included regular contact with the dietician and a supervised physical activity program. Outcomes included insulin sensitivity index measured by an oral glucose tolerance test and body composition measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry at 12&#x000a0;months.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Of the 111 adolescents recruited, 85 (77%) completed the intervention.

Results from several studies indicate that a weight loss diet with increased protein and reduced carbohydrate may increase body fat mass loss, attenuate loss of fat free mass (FFM) and improve lipid profile and glucose homeostasis, compared with a conventional high carbohydrate, low fat diet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. It is speculated that protein is superior to carbohydrate in promoting satiety as well as dietary induced thermogenesis, with no unfavourable health implications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In addition, high carbohydrate diets may lead to higher post prandial glucose and insulin spikes, placing increased demands on beta cell function and exacerbating insulin sensitivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However, improved outcomes with an increased protein diet are not consistently reported. A recent systematic review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] identified three randomised control trials (RCT), conducted in highly controlled environments, two were in residential camps [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and the other in a boarding school [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], comparing increased protein to isoenergetic standard protein diets in obese children; none reported differences in weight loss, cardiometabolic risk, or glycaemic status between diets. However, there is a paucity of trials in free-living overweight or obese adolescents.</p><p>We undertook an RCT, known as Researching Effective Strategies to Improve Insulin Sensitivity in Children and Teenagers (RESIST), with the aim of determining the effectiveness of a moderate-carbohydrate, increased protein diet compared to a high carbohydrate diet on insulin sensitivity in adolescents with pre-diabetes and/or clinical features of insulin resistance treated with metformin. We hypothesised that the moderate-carbohydrate, increased-protein diet would be more effective than the high-carbohydrate diet in improving insulin sensitivity, body composition and metabolic profile. The six month results have been previous published and in contrast to our hypothesis, demonstrated no significant differences in weight loss or metabolic profile between dietary groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The aims of this manuscript are to describe the changes in whole body insulin sensitivity index (ISI), derived from an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), and in body composition, measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), after 12&#x000a0;months of intervention.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><p>This study was a 12&#x000a0;month parallel RCT which took place at The Children&#x02019;s Hospital at Westmead (CHW) and Campbelltown Hospital, Sydney, Australia.

Pre-diabetes and clinical features including acanthosis nigricans, also improved, particularly in adolescents who lost weight (BMI % 95<sup>th</sup> centile) and/or total body fat %. ISI also increased significantly; however, the magnitude of difference between baseline and 12&#x000a0;months was small and may not be clinically significant. In contrast to our hypothesis, that adolescents randomised to a moderate-carbohydrate, increased-protein diet would have better outcomes compared to the high-carbohydrate diet, the diets had no differential effect on any outcome measure, at any time point. These results are consistent with three other RCTs in overweight and obese adolescents that investigated the effect of varying protein content compared with control diets on weight loss in residential settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] but in contrast to those from a recent systematic review of RCTs in overweight and obese adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. To our knowledge, there is only one study, the Diogenes study, which has shown a beneficial effect of increasing the protein in the diet, particularly when coupled with a low glycaemic diet, on both body fat and cardiometabolic markers in children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. There are a number of reasons why the results may differ from our study and others, including study design; in the Diogenes study <italic>families</italic> were randomised, not children and the focus was children at risk of obesity and weight maintenance, not obese children and weight loss.</p><p>The lack of effect between diets in our study may be due to poor compliance. Many participants had difficulty in achieving the macronutrient goals of the prescribed diet and the mean difference in protein intake was marginal (&#x0003c;2% of energy). However, the results remained unchanged in post-hoc analysis of those who were able to meet the targets. Our study was undertaken in a real-life setting and it is not evident if lack of compliance is a consequence of inadequate protein targets or a consequence of readily available high carbohydrate snack foods.</p><p>The specific effect of metformin therapy on outcome measures in our study is not clear. The beneficial effects of metformin therapy combined with lifestyle interventions in adolescents with clinical features of insulin resistance are well documented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. However, results from the largest randomised, placebo controlled trial of metformin alone, on weight and metabolic markers in 150 obese adolescents with hyperinsulinemia and/or pre-diabetes, indicated no significant change in ISI after three and six months of metformin therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. There are no RCTs which have compared lifestyle interventions to metformin therapy alone in adolescents. We speculate that it is the <italic>combined</italic> effect of metformin therapy and lifestyle intervention which resulted in weight loss and improved glycaemic status in our study. It should also be noted that the improvement in ISI occurred during puberty, a time when insulin sensitivity is expected to decrease irrespective of body composition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p><p>The magnitude of total fat % loss after the 12&#x000a0;month intervention was small (&#x02212;2.4%), although similar to other studies examining the impact of dietary and exercise interventions in obese adolescents and children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. However, we may have expected many of the participants to be increasing body fat as part of normal growth and development during puberty [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]; the number of children who were pre-pubertal (Tanner stage 1 and 2) decreased from 30.9% to 15.1% over the 12&#x000a0;months. Loss of total fat% was not associated with resolution of dyslipidemia or lowering of blood pressure; previous studies have reported mixed results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p><p>Limitations of the study including the use of ISI to measure glycaemic status, proxy measures of dietary compliance (24&#x000a0;hour recalls) and non-blinding of participants and dieticians. Lack of baseline dietary intake meant that we were unable to determine whether intake was altered by either dietary intervention. However, both groups lost similar amounts of weight, indicating that the energy deficit is likely to be similar in both diet groups. Another limitation was that metformin adherence was not measured at 12&#x000a0;months, hampering our interpretation of the effect of lifestyle compared to metformin therapy.</p><p>A strength of the study was the retention rate. After the six month intensive lifestyle intervention, including regular dietary counselling, food hampers to support the prescribed diet, a three month supervised physical activity program and email support, we retained 88% of those recruited. After 12&#x000a0;months, the last six months being a maintenance phase with regular, but limited contact with health professionals, we retained 77%. The challenges of recruitment and retention of adolescents have been previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Most (77%) adolescents that dropped out reported lack of interest, highlighting that one program does not suit everyone and alternative approaches to managing adolescents with insulin resistance/pre-diabetes are required. Food preferences are personal; dietary modification may need to be individualised.</p></sec><sec id="Sec33" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Reduced energy intake, combined with physical activity and assisted by metformin, is likely to be the mainstay for improving insulin sensitivity in this large RCT, completed in a challenging developmental stage. We were unable to demonstrate that the two study diets had differential effects on ISI, body composition or BMI, at any time point. This finding and the improvement in acanthosis nigricans, as a clinical indicator of insulin resistance suggest that a prescribed reduced energy diet is the important intervention message rather than diet composition for overweight and obese adolescents at risk of type 2 diabetes.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-list><def-item><term>FFM</term><def><p>Fat free mass</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RCT</term><def><p>Randomised control trial</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RESIST</term><def><p>Researching Effective Strategies to Improve Insulin Sensitivity in Children and Teenagers</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OGTT</term><def><p>Oral glucose tolerance test</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BMI%95 centile</term><def><p>BMI expressed as a percentage of the 95th centile</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ISI</term><def><p>Insulin sensitivity index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DXA</term><def><p>Dual energy x-ray absorptiometry</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CHW</term><def><p>The Children&#x02019;s Hospital at Westmead</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ALT</term><def><p>Alanine aminotransferase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GTT</term><def><p>Gamma-glutamyl transferase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FMI</term><def><p>Fat mass index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FFMI</term><def><p>Fat free mass index</p></def></def-item></def-list></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>SPG, LAB, MN, CTC, KC designed the research.
