This has been largely attributed to a deficit in &#x003b2;-cell mass ranging from &#x0223c;40 to 65% compared with nondiabetic individuals (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). However, the functional impairment in insulin secretion often exceeds the extent of the &#x003b2;-cell deficit (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>), suggesting additional impairments in &#x003b2;-cell function. A number of functional abnormalities, including abnormal proinsulin processing or disturbances in the entero-insular axis have been suggested to contribute to the dysfunctional regulation of insulin release in patients with type 2 diabetes (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). In addition to these factors, there is good evidence for a reduction of glucose-induced insulin secretion with chronic hyperglycemia (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Thus, when glucose-induced insulin secretion was determined in a large number of individuals presenting with different ranges of fasting glycemia, the early response was largely diminished at glucose levels &#x0003e;115 mg/dL (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Furthermore, inducing chronic hyperglycemia in nondiabetic individuals by means of exogenous glucose infusion has led to a depletion of insulin secretion after &#x0223c;3 days (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), and insulin secretion from isolated human islets was found to be markedly diminished after chronic exposure to high glucose concentrations (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). On that basis, induction of &#x003b2;-cell rest by temporary inhibition of insulin exocytosis has been suggested as a therapeutic concept to restore glucose-induced insulin secretion (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). In line with such reasoning, temporary inhibition of insulin exocytosis using potassium-channel openers has normalized the subsequent glucose-induced insulin secretion in diabetic animals as well as in humans (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), and exogenous insulin supplementation has led to improvements in endogenous insulin secretion in patients with type 2 diabetes (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Furthermore, a continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion regimen in overtly hyperglycemic patients with type 2 diabetes has led to marked improvements in glucose-induced insulin secretion, whereas the insulin response to glucagon stimulation was unchanged by the intervention (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). It is noteworthy that a large study using a transient period of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion or multiple daily insulin injections in newly diagnosed patients with type 2 diabetes has demonstrated persistent improvements in the acute insulin response to glucose even 1 year after the short-term intervention (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). However, because in most previous studies insulin secretion before and after the respective interventions was determined at different glucose levels, it is difficult to distinguish whether the observed improvements in insulin secretion were primarily the result of the chronic reduction in hyperglycemia or of the acute differences in glycemia at the time of the experiments. In addition, the effects of long-acting insulin analogs on endogenous insulin secretion have not yet been specifically examined.</p><p>Therefore, the current study was designed to examine <italic>1</italic>) whether basal insulin treatment of hyperglycemic patients with type 2 diabetes improves first- and second-phase insulin secretion in response to glucose, and if so, <italic>2</italic>) whether this was attributable to the chronic improvements in glycemia or the acute differences in fasting glucose levels during the experiments.</p><sec id="s5"><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><sec id="s6"><title>Study protocol</title><p>The study protocol was approved by the ethics committee of the medical faculty of Ruhr University Bochum before the experiments (registration no. 3231-FF) as well as the German federal regulatory authorities (Bundesinstitut f&#x000fc;r Arzneimittel und Medizinprodukte [BfArm]).

We report that chronic administration of basal insulin over 8 weeks results in improvements in first- and second-phase insulin secretion, even under conditions of identical fasting glucose levels. In contrast, acute normalization of fasting glycemia by a 3-h intravenous insulin infusion reduced C-peptide levels during an IVGTT.</p><p>The effects of exogenous insulin treatment on endogenous insulin secretion have previously been examined under various conditions (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). However, in most of these studies, continuous intravenous or subcutanoues insulin administration regiments have been applied, and the treatment duration was typically rather short. Furthermore, in the current study, glucose-induced insulin secretion has for the first time been examined with and without prior adjustment of fasting glycemia. By these means, it was possible to examine the effects of chronic insulin replacement on &#x003b2;-cell function independent of differences in baseline glucose levels. It is arguable that an oral glucose challenge would have represented a more physiological challenge than intravenous glucose administration. However, insulin secretion after oral glucose ingestion is also largely affected by changes in gastric emptying, intestinal glucose absorption, and incretin hormone secretion. Therefore, in the current study, intravenous glucose administration was chosen.</p><p>It is noteworthy that acute normalization of first- and second-phase insulin secretion has previously been reported after an overnight infusion of the incretin mimetic exenatide in patients with type 2 diabetes (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). The current study now demonstrates that improvements in insulin secretion can also be elicited with a basal insulin treatment regimen, even in the absence of a direct insulin secretagog.</p><p>The present findings are consistent with the concept that chronic hyperglycemia leads to a functional reduction of insulin secretion via depletion of insulin secretory granules. Indeed, a number of studies have demonstrated a gradual reduction of insulin secretion with increasing fasting glucose levels (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), and mechanistic studies have suggested a replenishment of the insulin granule stores, leading to an improvement of glucose-induced insulin secretion after reduction of hyperglycemia (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Consistent with this, exposure of isolated human islets to chronic hyperglycemia has led to a reduction in the mean islet insulin content and a loss of first-phase insulin secretion, and these defects could be restored by temporarily inhibiting insulin exocytosis using a potassium channel opener (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). In a similar fashion, overnight inhibition of insulin secretion using somatostatin has caused marked improvements in subsequent insulin secretory responses to glucose stimulation in patients with type 2 diabetes (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). The present as well as some previous studies extend this concept by demonstrating that a functional &#x003b2;-cell rest cannot only be induced by direct inhibition of insulin exocytosis but also by reducing the secretory demand on the &#x003b2; cells through chronic insulin supplementation. Another important mechanism that might have contributed to the improvements in insulin secretion in this study is a reduction of gluco- and potentially lipotoxicity. Along these lines, a number of studies have provided compelling evidence that chronically elevated concentrations of glucose or free fatty acids can impair &#x003b2;-cell function through the generation of reactive oxygen species (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). In turn, exogenous administration of antioxidant drugs and overexpression of antioxidant enzymes in &#x003b2; cells have led to significant improvements in &#x003b2;-cell function (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Therefore, it appears likely that the insulin treatment intervention in this has also reduced the detrimental effect of gluco- and lipotoxicity on &#x003b2;-cell function.</p><p>The improvements in endogenous insulin secretion after 8 weeks of glargine therapy provide a rationale for the use of basal insulin treatment regiments in patients with type 2 diabetes. Thus, whereas exogenously administered insulin acts primarily at the peripheral tissue level, the improvements in endogenous insulin release increase postprandial insulin secretion. Furthermore, because endogenous insulin is secreted directly from the islets into the portal venous circulation, the improvements in &#x003b2;-cell function are likely to result in additional improvements in &#x003b1;-cell function and hepatic glucose production (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). In line with such reasoning, Linn et al. (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) have recently demonstrated reductions in glucagon secretion as well as hepatic glucose release after a single dose administration of two different basal insulins at bedtime. These findings may explain why basal insulin treatment regimens often lower not only fasting but also postprandial glycemia.</p><p>The current study may also be interpreted in support of the postulate that the impairments in glucose-induced insulin secretion in patients with type 2 diabetes result from a combination of defects in &#x003b2;-cell mass and function. In fact, it is very unlikely that &#x003b2;-cell mass changes significantly over an 8-week study period, suggesting that the abnormalities in glucose-induced insulin release are at least partly attributable to the detrimental effects of chronic hyperglycemia on &#x003b2;-cell function.</p><p>Even though a forced insulin titration regimen was used in this study, the majority of patients failed to achieve the desired fasting glucose concentration range of &#x0003c;100 mg/dL. This might be partly explained by the large day-by-day fluctuations in fasting glycemia, partly caused by the lack of accuracy of finger-stick glucose measurements, which have prevented further up-titration of the insulin dose in a large number of patients. Thus, all 14 patients had reached fasting glucose levels of 100 mg/dL or less at least once during the insulin treatment period, but only one patient presented with glucose levels within the target range at the final day of the insulin treatment period. Furthermore, the presently examined group of patients with type 2 diabetes was rather obese and presumably insulin-resistant. As a consequence, a mean insulin dose of 59 IU per day was necessary to reduce fasting glycemia from 180 to 118 mg/dL. However, the failure to completely normalize fasting hyperglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes appears to be consistent with both clinical practice and previous clinical studies (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) and provides a rationale for adding complimentary treatment options, such as short-acting insulin (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) or incretin-based therapies (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), if normoglycemia cannot be achieved with basal insulin alone. The improvement in &#x003b2;-cell function through the normalization of fasting hyperglycemia might particularly favor the combination of basal insulin with glucagon-like peptide-1&#x02013;based drugs, which act by glucose dependently activating endogenous insulin release.</p><p>In conclusion, chronic supplementation of long-acting basal insulin improves glucose-induced endogenous insulin secretion in hyperglycemic patients with type 2 diabetes, whereas acute exogenous insulin administration lowers the &#x003b2;-cell response to glucose administration. These data provide a rationale for basal insulin treatment regiments in hyperglycemic patients with type 2 diabetes.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><p>Clinical trial reg. no.
