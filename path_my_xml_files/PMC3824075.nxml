The current study was designed to pilot test a brief, widely inclusive, local access format of ACT in a UK primary care setting. Seventy-three participants (68.5% women) were randomized to either ACT or treatment as usual (TAU). Many of the participants were aged 65 years or older (27.6%), were diagnosed with fibromyalgia (30.2%) and depression (40.3%), and had longstanding pain (median = 10&#x000a0;years). Standard clinical outcome measures included disability, depression, physical functioning, emotional functioning, and rated improvement. Process measures included pain-related and general psychological acceptance. The recruitment target was met within 6 months, and 72.9% of those allocated to ACT completed treatment. Immediately post treatment, relative to TAU, participants in ACT demonstrated lower depression and higher ratings of overall improvement. At a 3-month follow-up, again relative to TAU, those in ACT demonstrated lower disability, less depression, and significantly higher pain acceptance; d&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;.58, .59, and .64, respectively. Analyses based on intention-to-treat and on treatment &#x0201c;completers,&#x0201d; perhaps predictably, revealed more sobering and more encouraging results, respectively. A larger trial of ACT delivered in primary care, in the format employed here, appears feasible with some recommended adjustments in the methods used here (Trial registration: ISRCTN49827391).</p></sec><sec><title>Perspective</title><p>This article presents a pilot randomized controlled trial of ACT for chronic pain in a primary care setting in the United Kingdom.

Generally the evidence for CBT for chronic pain is supportive.<xref rid="bib4 bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4,22</sup></xref> However, the benefits of CBT for chronic pain are not as large and general as they could or should be, including only small effects on disability.<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr"><sup>37</sup></xref> Some improvement in the CBT approach may be needed.</p><p>It is has been suggested that researchers stop testing package treatments that essentially attempt to treat the many problems of chronic pain with many methods in combination.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> There are calls to focus on therapeutic mechanisms, or processes, and moderators, the answers to the questions of how treatment works and for whom.<xref rid="bib4 bib15 bib23 bib37" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4,15,23,37</sup></xref> There are also calls for approaches that include more comprehensive and integrative theoretical modes.<xref rid="bib9 bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9,11</sup></xref></p><p>Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT)<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> is a form of CBT that may help advance the field of chronic pain management. ACT is not a package-based approach&#x02014;it is process focused, primarily including a therapeutic process called psychological flexibility. Psychological flexibility is the ability to either engage in a behavior pattern or change a behavior pattern depending on one's goals and what the situation affords, in a context of interacting cognitive and direct, noncognitive, influences on behavior.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> Psychological flexibility includes 6 constituent processes: acceptance, present-focused awareness, values, cognitive defusion, self-as-observer, and committed action. ACT is comprehensive, encompassing both healthy and unhealthy psychological processes; integrative; and theoretically based. It focuses on behavior change and on any manipulable influences that can be applied in changing behavior, incorporating influences based in emotional experiences, thoughts, beliefs, and social context. ACT is based on an extension of operant theory that includes a model of cognition and cognitive regulation of behavior, called relational frame theory, and on a philosophy of science called functional contextualism.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref></p><p>There are now at least 5 randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) of ACT related to chronic pain that support its efficacy.<xref rid="bib2 bib27 bib34 bib35 bib36" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2,27,34-36</sup></xref> A wide variety of formats of delivery have been tested but none of these were specifically designed for high-efficiency screening and wide inclusion, for recruitment and delivery in primary care in the UK, over a short time frame, and in a group treatment context. The only ACT-based treatment tested within the UK National Health Service is a high-intensity interdisciplinary model, including more than 90&#x000a0;hours of treatment time, delivered in a specialty hospital setting.<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref></p><p>The purpose of this study was to pilot test a brief version of ACT for chronic pain in a primary care setting, in a small RCT.

Specific power calculations were not a part of the planning of the study; hence, the primary focus was not on testing predictions for specific, significant outcome effects. The overall objective here was to test key trial methods to plan for a larger study, to gather data for future power calculations, and to consider ways to enhance the treatment or the methods for studying it.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1"><title>Method</title><sec id="sec1.1"><title>Trial Design</title><p>This study included a randomized pilot trial of group treatment for people with chronic pain recruited from general practice. After baseline assessment, participants were randomized to ACT plus treatment-as-usual (TAU) or TAU alone (1:1) based on computer-generated random numbers. The allocation was not concealed from the participants, treatment providers, or the researcher; however, assessment and data entry were conducted blind to allocation. Posttreatment assessment was conducted within 2 weeks of treatment completion (with parallel assessment of those in the TAU group) and at a 3-month follow-up. Sample size was determined on a plan to recruit between 8 and 12 participants for each of 3 ACT groups. A total sample of 60 participants was the target. This study was approved by the regional research ethics committee (reference: 09/H0107/99) and National Health Service Research and Development committee at the Royal National Hospital for Rheumatic Diseases in Bath.</p></sec><sec id="sec1.2"><title>Recruitment</title><p>Participants for this study were recruited from general medical practices in the southwest of England. These practices were recruited through the regional Primary Care Research Network. The practices expressing interest included 119,000 registered patients, and the individual practice list sizes ranged from 5,300 to 13,000. Recruitment was conducted over a period of 2 months in each of 3 separate areas in the southwest primarily during the first quarter of&#x000a0;2012.</p><p>Potential participants at each of the practices were identified through record searches applying the inclusion criteria. Inclusion in the study required persistent pain of longer than 3&#x000a0;months' duration, a pain-related consultation with the general practitioner (GP) in the past 6&#x000a0;months, significant pain-related distress and disability, consistent analgesic medications use, ability to communicate in English, and age 18&#x000a0;years or older. Those needing further medical tests or procedures, or with conditions expected by the GP to interfere with participation in the treatment, were excluded.</p><p>Potential participants meeting eligibility criteria were sent an invitation letter, trial information sheet, consent form, and screening questionnaire by their GPs (N&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;481). Participants who wished to take part returned their signed consent forms and the screening questionnaire to the research team by post and were screened for eligibility (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;102). Twenty-nine potential participants were excluded at this stage, 22 for not meeting criteria. Seven did not provide consent. Seventy-three potential participants were randomized to ACT (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;37) or treatment as usual (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;36).

Most were women (68.5%) and white British (97.3%). Most were married or living with a partner (65.7%); 12.3% were unmarried, 11.0% divorced, 11.0% widowed. They had completed a mean of 12.4&#x000a0;years of education (SD&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;4.2). The median pain duration was 10.0&#x000a0;years, range 1.5&#x02013;50.0&#x000a0;years. The primary locations of pain included low back (37.0%); lower extremity (23.3%); neck (15.1%); all over (13.7%); or other (10.9%). Participants reported wide-ranging and mostly multiple pain-related diagnoses. The most frequently mentioned diagnosis was fibromyalgia (32.0%). Only 9.6% were working full time outside the home. The largest proportion of participants (31.0%) was not working because of pain, and another 8.2% were working part time because of pain. The remaining participants were retired (27.4%); working as homemakers (16.4%); or other (7.4%).

It emphasizes experience-based methods, metaphor, and exposure and de-emphasizes lecturing and information-giving. Before the start of treatment, all participants were telephoned by the treatment provider for a very brief introduction and to begin to build some rapport. Treatment was provided by 1 of 2 trained clinical psychologists (L.M.M. and another), each with more than 5 years of experience in treatment for chronic pain and ACT. The format of treatment included 4 sessions, each 4 hours long, delivered 3 sessions one week and 1 session a week later. The content of the treatment was designed so that all of the primary treatment processes were introduced during the first 3 sessions and session 4 was focused on review and further enhancing the processes. Hence, any participant attending at least 3 sessions was considered to have had exposure to all of the key processes. The actual allocated group sizes at the 3 separate locations were the treatment was provided were 12, 12, and 13 participants. All sessions were conducted during afternoon hours in GP practices that were local to the participants. Treatment consistency and fidelity were maintained by use of a treatment manual, and all sessions were audiotaped for later analysis (not reported here).</p></sec><sec id="sec1.6"><title>Treatment as Usual</title><p>Participants in the control arm were asked to follow their usual treatments, including any new treatments their GP or their other doctors might wish, during their time in the study. Medication changes and medical visits were then assessed at follow-up.</p></sec><sec id="sec1.7"><title>Analyses</title><p>Initial data analyses examined the participants in the 2 treatment conditions for baseline differences on background, treatment outcome, and treatment process variables. Then a series of analyses of covariance were calculated, with the outcome and process variables at posttreatment and follow-up as the dependent variables and the baseline values as covariates. To assess whether there was some influence tied to the 3 varying locations where recruitment and treatment were done, the location of treatment (and therefore treatment groups) was included as a factor to test whether there was such an effect in the data. Following the significance tests, for each of the mean comparisons at posttreatment and follow-up, between-group effect sizes, Cohen's d, were calculated based on posttreatment and follow-up means and pooled SDs. Group outcome differences in the categorical PGIC and medication use variables were examined with chi-square. The clinical outcome and process measures were analyzed in 3 separate ways. First, all available data were submitted to the between-group analyses, regardless of number of treatment sessions attended. Next, an intention-to-treat (ITT) approach to these same analyses was used with imputation of missing data by last value carried forward. Finally, only those who were regarded as receiving a full treatment experience were compared, again, to the control condition. All significance tests were 2-tailed and alpha was set at <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;.05, given the pilot nature of this project.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>Attendance and Data Adherence</title><p>Thirty-three (89.2%) of the 37 participants allocated to the ACT condition attended at least 1 session.

Twenty-seven participants (72.9%) attended 3 or 4 sessions and were regarded as having a complete treatment experience. Eighteen participants (48.6% of those allocated to ACT) attended all 4 sessions of ACT. Thirty-one (83.8% of the 37 participants allocated to ACT) provided data at posttreatment, and 28 (75.7% of those allocated) provided data at follow-up. In the TAU condition, 27 participants (75.0% of those allocated to TAU) provided data conjointly with the completion of the ACT treatment, and 28 (77.7%) provided data at the 3-month follow-up.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><title>Preliminary Analyses</title><p>Comparisons using independent groups t-tests of those who provided outcome data showed that the ACT and TAU conditions did not differ on age, education, duration of pain, number of comorbid medical conditions, number of physicians seen in the past due to their pain, or number of times they had seen their GP for pain in the past 3 months, as assessed at baseline. They also did not differ on baseline disability, depression, physical or emotional functioning from the SF-36, acceptance of pain, or psychological acceptance, all <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;.05.</p><p>Analyses of the group and location effect, across the 14 posttreatment and follow-up analyses involving mean comparisons, revealed 2 significant interactions of the treatment condition effect and this location effect. One of these involved immediate posttreatment disability, F(2, 50)&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;3.57, <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;.036, and the other involved depression at follow-up, F(2, 48)&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;3.31, <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;.045. In the first case, inspection of the data showed that 1 of the locations yielded both a relatively high disability score in the TAU group and a relatively low score for the ACT group at posttreatment. The direction of differences between the TAU versus ACT conditions did not differ across locations, nor did the magnitude of posttreatment disability scores across the 3 ACT groups, F(2, 28)&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1.71, <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;.20.

In terms of secondary outcomes, there was a significant posttreatment effect on PGIC, with 53.3% of those in the ACT condition reporting overall improvement whereas in the TAU group the number was 25.0%. There was no significant group difference on emotional functioning from the SF-36. Most patients' pain medication stayed the same in both groups during the treatment interval.

The setting, recruitment strategy, and the brief treatment format had not been previously tested and the present study was designed to see if an RCT could be conducted with these elements. In this trial, we demonstrated successful recruitment of the targeted number of participants, greater than 60, in a short period of 2 months at each of 3 locations; 73% in the ACT condition were regarded as having received the complete treatment, and more than 75% of the total sample randomized were retained at follow-up.</p><p>Power calculations were not done nor were formal predictions of significant treatment effects made during the design of this study. With this proviso in mind the ACT condition did produce a number of significant treatment effects compared to the TAU condition, on depression and patient-rated improvement at posttreatment and on disability, depression, and pain acceptance at the 3-month follow-up. Effect sizes for the significant effects were small for depression immediately post treatment, and medium for disability, depression, and acceptance of pain at follow-up.</p><p>Analyses done on an ITT basis or focused only on those who were regarded as completing treatment provide distinctly differing views of the trial results. The ITT analyses showed significant effects in favor of ACT for disability and depression but only nonsignificant marginal effects for acceptance of pain and emotional functioning. Only a marginal nonsignificant effect for disability remained at follow-up. Analyses excluding participants who missed 2 or more of the 4 sessions, so-called completer analyses, showed more positive results, including significantly better results for the ACT condition in comparison to the TAU condition on disability, depression, pain acceptance, and emotional functioning at posttreatment, and disability, depression, and pain acceptance at follow-up. Significant between-group effect sizes were small to medium at posttreatment and medium at follow-up. It should be clarified that the sample size of this RCT is small compared to trials designed to produce more definitive results.<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> These results ought to be seen as preliminary. The positive results from the completer analyses compared to ITT particularly call for further investigation of the variables that identify who completes and who does not complete treatment, how to improve engagement, and whether it is possible to identify those who achieve poor results regardless.</p><p>There are a number of other preliminary RCTs of ACT for chronic pain,<xref rid="bib2 bib27 bib35 bib36" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2,27,35,36</sup></xref> and at least 1 larger trial comparing ACT to more traditional CBT (N&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;114).<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref> There are also nonrandomized, partly controlled, or pilot studies,<xref rid="bib10 bib20 bib31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10,20,31</sup></xref> a reanalysis of treatment outcome focused on older adults,<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> and several effectiveness studies,<xref rid="bib16 bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16,29</sup></xref> including 1 showing good outcomes at 3 years posttreatment.<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> The present study is consistent with the previous ones in providing support for ACT and in providing a basis for more ambitious or more focused studies. It differed from the earlier studies in that it was conducted exclusively within primary care in the United Kingdom, with very liberal inclusion criteria, with no face-to-face assessment or screening, and unlike some of the earlier RCTs it included group delivery. It was also significantly briefer in the number of sessions and in total treatment hours compared with some previous group-based treatments, particularly those conducted in the United Kingdom.<xref rid="bib16 bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16,20</sup></xref></p><p>It may appear unnecessary to conduct or present more preliminary trials of ACT. However, the planning and application for funding the current study began in 2008, a time when there were significantly fewer publishes studies. Certainly the unique features in the design of the current treatment represent, including its base in UK primary care, its 4-session format, and its minimal screening, provide a way to examine the robustness and generality of the treatment model.</p><p>There are some inconsistencies in our current results that may provide a basis for improvement in later trials. Unexpectedly, participants in the TAU condition demonstrated increases in disability and depression, especially at follow-up. These changes contribute to the observed between-group effects on these outcomes. Perhaps even more unexpectedly, they also demonstrated a remarkable increase in acceptance of pain, a change that reduced the between-group effect. The posttreatment effect on acceptance of pain was small. This is inconsistent with our previous studies, where effects on acceptance of pain were large and among the largest achieved in comparison to other outcome and process variables.<xref rid="bib16 bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16,29</sup></xref> Likewise, we produced only small nonsignificant effects on our measure of general psychological acceptance, among the smallest of all those observed, and small or inconsistent effects on the physical and emotional functioning scales of the SF-36. In future studies, with treatment formats similar to the one used here, treatment providers may need to intensify the methods applied to pain-related and psychological acceptance or devote more time to these.</p><p>The sample of participants encountered in this study was more chronic, more complex, and more diverse than expected. There were highly disabled participants who had failed previous psychological treatments with a higher intensity than the treatment provided here. It is clear that the SF-36 scales in particular produced highly variable scores. There were some participants with extremely limited mobility&#x02014;2 participants attended in wheelchairs. In the future, it may improve the outcome of trials of a similar treatment format to narrow the range of disability among the participants, add a physical rehabilitation piece to the psychology treatment methods for those with higher physical disability, and perhaps to screen out those who had already failed higher-intensity treatments of a similar type. A screening visit with a treatment provider, rather than solely paper-based screening as done here, could certainly help to screen out some cases where there is a high likelihood that the treatment will not meet their needs. This is normal in actual clinical practice. Finally, there were engagement challenges, particularly in the 27% of participants in the ACT condition who did not participate in a full treatment experience. This trial was not resourced to address engagement as is sometimes done in specialty treatment centers, such as with additional one-to-one sessions with some participants. On the other hand, this treatment was designed for high accessibility and for efficient delivery, and this was achieved, albeit with the result that some individuals may have received less than optimal results.</p><p>In previous results from this same sample, it was shown that participants in the ACT groups found the treatment credible and found participating in the study acceptable.<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> It was also found that some participants experienced greater pain or fatigue, or found the sessions too lengthy. Even though this was not the majority, it was nonetheless a significant minority. This is somewhat a conundrum as ACT actually operates by including unwanted psychological experiences in treatment delivery so that the ways that these can create barriers to daily functioning can be examined directly and so that new patterns of behavior can be shaped and rehearsed in the context of treatment. Certainly the group delivery mode and the limited one-to-one relationship between the therapist and each participant place some limits on how a treatment provider can reverse avoidance patterns that occur in treatment sessions, and seek to loosen the grip of thoughts and beliefs that participants hold tightly. Finally, even though we attempted to ease the burden of participation by designing a 4-session treatment, the 4-hour session length and the total treatment time remain a considerable burden and certainly will not suit some people's circumstances. These are challenges for continuing treatment development.</p><p>The present study obviously has a number of limitations both as a pilot and especially as a test of ACT. First, it is no more than a pilot for a pragmatic trial, as there was no active treatment comparison condition. This type of design does not allow specific statements about the efficacy of ACT. The region of the country and the specific GP practices involved represent a selected sample, and it is not clear that similar results will be obtained in other regions and other practices. The clinical outcome results for disability and depression were not echoed in effects on physical and emotional functioning. Even given the limited statistical power here, this means that either the treatment is failing in some specific way or the SF-36 is not sensitive to specific treatment results. We did learn that some of the participants struggled with the wording in some of the items of the SF-36, particularly the distance implied by a &#x0201c;block,&#x0201d; a concept not commonly used in the United Kingdom, and the notion of &#x0201c;full of pep.&#x0201d; In the future, a change in this measure or in the treatment is advisable. Finally, as a small RCT without registered trial unit support, it was not powered for a definitive result and certainly there are potential sources of bias that are uncontrolled. Although data were gathered and entered blind and analyses were supervised by a statistician (G.J.T.), they were not all conducted blind to treatment condition, for example.</p><p>In summary, further larger-scale trials of ACT for chronic pain, such as in primary care and in the United Kingdom, appear feasible and are recommended, with a few adjustments from the methods used here. Significant treatment effects for disability, depression, and pain acceptance may be achievable, including perhaps medium-sized effects after a short follow-up interval of 3 months. We hypothesize that a number of factors may have reduced treatment impact, and perhaps greater attention to these can be incorporated in future trials. It seems possible, based on comparisons with previous results, that 1 or more of the following modifications could improve outcomes: intensifying the methods to produce results on acceptance, especially general psychological acceptance; recruiting a more homogeneous sample in their current functioning; excluding those who failed previous treatments; including a face-to-face assessment prior to the start of treatment; including a physical exercise component; and/or allowing one-to-one sessions for patients with engagement difficulties.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref1"><person-group
