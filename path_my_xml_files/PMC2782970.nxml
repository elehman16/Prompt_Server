Thereafter, they shifted to the other diet for 4 more weeks. At the end of each period, plasma glucose, insulin, lipids, and lipoprotein fractions (separated by discontinuous density gradient ultracentrifugation) were determined on blood samples taken at fasting and over 6 h after a test meal having a similar composition as the corresponding diet.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS</title><p>In addition to a significant decrease in postprandial plasma glucose, insulin responses, and glycemic variability, the high-carbohydrate/high-fiber diet also significantly improved the primary end point, since it reduced the postprandial incremental areas under the curve (IAUCs) of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, in particular, chylomicrons (cholesterol IAUC: 0.05 &#x000b1; 0.01 vs. 0.08 &#x000b1; 0.02 mmol/l per 6 h; triglycerides IAUC: 0.71 &#x000b1; 0.35 vs. 1.03 &#x000b1; 0.58 mmol/l per 6 h, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05).</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>A diet rich in carbohydrate and fiber, essentially based on legumes, vegetables, fruits, and whole cereals, may be particularly useful for treating diabetic patients because of its multiple effects on different cardiovascular risk factors, including postprandial lipids abnormalities.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>The clinical and scientific relevance of postprandial lipid abnormalities is based on the evidence of their association with a higher cardiovascular risk as recently shown by the results of two large prospective studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Patients with type 2 diabetes have more pronounced postprandial dyslipidemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>), and this may account, at least in part, for their higher rate of cardiovascular diseases, not explained by hyperglycemia and the classic cardiovascular risk factors alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>).</p><p>Despite the clinical relevance of postprandial lipid alterations, there is little scientific evidence on the potential therapeutic interventions able to correct these abnormalities. If we consider that humans spend most of their time in the postprandial condition and that all the lipid alterations in this state greatly outnumber those occurring in fasting conditions, diet is the natural approach to correct postprandial abnormalities. However, while it has been repeatedly demonstrated that dietary treatment in type 2 diabetic patients is able to improve glucose control and blood lipids at fasting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>), there are few data on the effects of various diets on postprandial lipemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). The Mediterranean diet is generally recommended as a useful nutritional tool for the prevention of cardiovascular disease because it is able to act positively on the main cardiovascular risk factors, including excess body weight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). However, the two main components of the Mediterranean diet&#x02014;olive oil rich in monounsaturated fat and foods rich in carbohydrate and fiber&#x02014;traditionally found in association in the Mediterranean diet of some decades ago are now often considered in opposition. In particular, a diet rich in carbohydrate is considered less effective on fasting lipid metabolism than one rich in monounsaturated fat (MUFA), as it induces higher plasma triglycerides concentrations (22%) and lower HDL cholesterol levels (4%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>); these untoward effects, however, can be avoided by selecting carbohydrate rich foods with high fiber content and a low glycemic index (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>).</p><p>It can be hypothesized that a diet containing these kinds of foods may be more beneficial on postprandial lipid metabolism compared with a MUFA-rich diet, which, given the higher fat content, could induce a postprandial increase in triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, especially of exogenous origin.</p><p>On the basis of this working hypothesis, the aim of this intervention study was to evaluate in type 2 diabetic patients the effects on postprandial lipemia and glucose metabolism (both in everyday life conditions and after a standard test meal) of two diets&#x02014;one moderately rich in carbohydrate, rich in fiber, and with a low glycemic index and the other relatively low in carbohydrate and rich in MUFA.</p><p>Because adipose tissue, mainly through its lipolytic activities, is considered as having a pivotal role in the buffering of lipid flux in the postprandial period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>), a further goal of our study was to evaluate the activities of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) after consumption of the two diets as possible mechanisms of different effects on postprandial lipid metabolism.</p><sec><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><p>A total of 19 type 2 diabetic patients were enrolled in the study, after giving their written informed consent. There was one dropout because of concomitant family problems; therefore, 12 men and 6 women, aged 59 &#x000b1; 5 years (means &#x000b1; SD), concluded the study. Patients were slightly overweight (BMI 27 &#x000b1; 3 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), in satisfactory blood glucose control (A1C 6.9 &#x000b1; 0.7%) on diet alone (<italic>n</italic> = 13) or diet plus metformin (<italic>n</italic> = 5), and with normal fasting plasma lipid levels. They were all sedentary and did not change their physical activity level throughout the study. The protocol was approved by the Federico II University Ethics Committee.</p><sec><title>Sample size</title><p>Based on differences in the postprandial responses of triglycerides in the chylomicrons and VLDL fractions between diabetic and control subjects (0.7 mmol/l per 6 h, SD 0.85 mmol/l) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>), we considered as clinically relevant a 30% difference between the two treatments of the primary end point (postprandial incremental area of triglycerides content in chylomicrons and VLDL fraction). To detect this difference with an 80% power at a <italic>P</italic> value of 5% (two-tailed), 13 patients had to be studied.</p></sec><sec><title>Study design</title><p>The study was performed according to a randomized crossover design. After a run-in period of 4 weeks, during which patients were stabilized on their own diet, they followed, in alternate order, two isoenergetic diets, each for 4 weeks. One diet was relatively rich in carbohydrate, rich in dietary fiber both of soluble and insoluble type, and with a low glycemic index; the other was rich in MUFA, relatively low in carbohydrate, low in dietary fiber, and with a relatively high glycemic index (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). The glycemic load of the high-carbohydrate/high-fiber diet was lower than that of the high-MUFA diet (155 vs. 205). The other components of the two diets, in particular, the saturated fat content, were similar (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Calories and nutrients of the diets were calculated from tables of food composition of the Italian Institute of Nutrition using the MetaDieta software (Meteda s.r.l., Ascoli-Piceno, Italy). The main components of the two diets were as follows: <italic>1</italic>) a portion of legumes four times a week, one serving of pasta twice a week, and one serving of parboiled rice once a week; two servings of vegetables and two fruits per day; and whole-grain bread for the high-carbohydrate/high-fiber diet and <italic>2</italic>) white bread, a serving of potatoes, rice, or pasta each twice weekly; a serving of pizza once a week; and use of vegetables and fruits low in fiber for the low-carbohydrate diet (a weekly meal schedule for both dietary treatments is shown in an online appendix, Tables S1 and S2, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/cgi/content/full/dc09-0266/DC1">http://care.diabetesjournals.org/cgi/content/full/dc09-0266/DC1</ext-link>).</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Composition of the two isoenergetic diets recommended and followed by the patients</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead valign="bottom"><tr><th rowspan="2" colspan="1"/><th align="center" colspan="2" rowspan="1">High-carbohydrate/high-fiber diet<hr/></th><th align="center" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Low-carbohydrate/high-MUFA diet<hr/></th></tr><tr><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Recommended</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Followed</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Recommended</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Followed</th></tr></thead><tbody valign="top"><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Total energy (kcal/day)</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">1,918</td><td align="char" char="&#x000b1;" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1,874 &#x000b1;

This effect was observed in experimental conditions, i.e., after a standard test meal, but also in everyday life, where there was a 30% reduction of plasma triglycerides 3 h after lunch, despite the well-known high day-to-day triglyceride variability (20% in our data).</p><p>Moreover, our results confirm that this kind of diet is to be preferred to a diet low in carbohydrate and rich in MUFA for its effects on:</p><p><italic>1</italic>) Postprandial blood glucose control, with lower peaks in the first part of the postprandial period. This blunted postprandial profile implies a reduced variability of blood glucose levels (almost halved in our study), considered so important in the prevention of cardiovascular disease in diabetic patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>), as well as a lower risk of late postprandial hypoglycemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>).</p><p><italic>2</italic>) Postprandial insulin levels, which are significantly reduced concomitantly with the presence of lower blood glucose levels, suggesting an improvement in insulin action.</p><p><italic>3</italic>) LDL cholesterol levels, significantly reduced also in normocholesterolemic type 2 diabetic patients, reinforcing the data already obtained in patients with higher LDL cholesterol levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). This result, which may be considered of small entity (a 9% reduction), is, instead, important from a clinical point of view considering the need to constantly lower LDL cholesterol values, especially in type 2 diabetic patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>).</p><p>The only drawback of the diet rich in carbohydrate and fiber is the lower levels of fasting HDL cholesterol obtained compared with the diet low in carbohydrate and rich in MUFAs. Moreover, it is important to underline that any intervention able to reduce LDL cholesterol levels generally leads also to a reduction in HDL cholesterol. Furthermore, a previous study has shown that the decrease in HDL cholesterol after a low-fat/high-carbohydrate diet is limited to HDL<sub>3</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>), which is the HDL subfraction with less antiatherogenic properties.</p><p>Our results emphasize the clear importance of the quality of carbohydrate, beside that of their amount (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Indeed, the few studies that have so far looked at the effects of high-carbohydrate versus high-MUFA diets on postprandial lipid metabolism compared diets rich in MUFA with diets rich in carbohydrate, but not in dietary fiber, and with a low glycemic index (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>).</p><p>How can the two dietary approaches act on the postprandial response of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins? We looked at the possible effects of the two diets on lipolysis in adipose tissue, considering the crucial role of this tissue in partitioning the postprandial lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). However, both LPL and HSL activities were not different at the end of either diet. This suggests that the two diets might act on other sites, particularly on those involved in the absorption of dietary fatty acids and cholesterol and the production of chylomicrons and VLDL, not only through their nutrient composition but also for their different combination of foods and for the presence of other components. On the one hand, since low-carbohydrate/high-MUFA diets are richer in the amount of fat, which is one of the main determinants of postprandial lipid response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>), they may induce a higher absorption of dietary fatty acids, which would result in a higher intestinal production of chylomicrons. On the other hand, since the high-carbohydrate/high-fiber diet is at the same time rich in carbohydrate and dietary fiber, it may act in different ways, i.e., by slowing down gastric empting; reducing the absorption of glucose, cholesterol, and fatty acids; and, finally, reducing the intestinal production and secretion of chylomicrons, as suggested by studies performed both in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Moreover, since the high-carbohydrate/high-fiber diet also reduces postprandial plasma glucose and insulin, it is likely that both effects may reduce de novo lipogenesis, which is stimulated by glucose and insulin levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>) and may be particularly relevant in type 2 diabetic patients, where it accounts for 25% of VLDL synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). Moreover, our high-carbohydrate diet, being rich in fiber, also induced an improvement in insulin resistance, as suggested by the lower insulin-to-glucose ratios, which is relevant given the well-known key role played by insulin resistance in determining postprandial lipoprotein abnormalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>).</p><p>Clinical relevance of our results lies on the fact that postprandial lipemia is, according to recent prospective studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>), an independent cardiovascular risk factor. On the basis of these studies, a difference in postprandial triglycerides of 0.25 mmol/l such as that observed between our two diets could mean a reduction in cardiovascular risk of &#x0223c;25%. It has to be underlined that our results have been obtained with a nonpharmacological intervention comparing two diets both recommended and in individuals with quite low lipid levels.</p><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>Participants in our study were type 2 diabetic patients in relatively good blood glucose control, with quite normal plasma lipid levels, who already used a diet relatively rich in carbohydrate and fiber. Therefore, we cannot extrapolate our results to all type 2 diabetic patients. However, it has to be considered that a similar type of high-carbohydrate/high-fiber diet induced similar, if not better, results on blood glucose control and fasting lipid metabolism in type 2 diabetic patients not in satisfactory blood glucose control and with hyperlipidemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Another point to be stressed is the length of the intervention: although 1 month for each diet cannot be considered a long-term experiment, it is certainly sufficiently long enough to induce changes in glucose and lipid metabolism.</p><p>In conclusion, a diet relatively high in carbohydrates, rich in dietary fiber, with a relatively low glycemic index and a low glycemic load, essentially based on consumption of legumes, vegetables, fruit, and whole cereals, may be particularly useful for the treatment of type 2 diabetic patients on the basis of its multiple effects on different cardiovascular risk factors, including postprandial lipid abnormalities.</p></sec></sec>
