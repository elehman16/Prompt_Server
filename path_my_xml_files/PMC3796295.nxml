The parent-reported frequency of nail biting did show similar results as to the mean length of nails assessment in long term.

The prevalence of nail biting in primary school boys and girls is 20.1% (95% confidence interval 15.9 to 24.2) and 24.4% (95% confidence interval 20.1 to 28.7), respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0002">2</xref>). Nail biting is not associated with gender (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0002">2</xref>). Also, there is not any preference for biting of any finger nails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0001">1</xref>).</p><p>Children with nail biting might be punished for their behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0001">1</xref>). Moreover, nail biting can have medical consequences such as the damage of nail beds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0003">3</xref>), temporomandibular dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0004">4</xref>), and giardia infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0005">5</xref>).</p><p>Adults with nail biting usually bite their nail in the two conditions of boredom and frustration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0006">6</xref>). Randomized controlled pharmacological therapy for the treatment of nail biting is rarely conducted. The efficacy of N-acetylcysteine is limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0007">7</xref>). Another study indicated that clomipramine is more effective than desipramine hydrochloride (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0008">8</xref>).</p><p>There are some published studies about the role of behavior therapy for treatment of nail biting. A study examined the role of wearing a non-removable wristband to quit nail biting. It was less effective than the aversion-based method, but it decreased nail biting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0009">9</xref>). Another study showed that a self-help technique was more effective than progressive muscle relaxation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0010">10</xref>).</p><p>The concept of habit reversal is suggested by Azrin et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0011">11</xref>). The effect of habit reversal has been reported in several studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0013">13</xref>). In addition, both mild aversion and competing response therapies improve nail length. However, the competing response improves it more than mild aversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0014">14</xref>).</p><p>Nevertheless, another study reported that the efficacy of mild aversion is more than competing response for treating nail biting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0015">15</xref>). Meanwhile, no study included nail biting behavior exclusively in children. Some other studies investigated whether social support should be included for habit reversal. While some authors reported that social support is not necessary to be included (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0016">16</xref>), others opposed it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0017">17</xref>). Habit reversal includes different parts; and competing response is part of habit reversal.</p><p>Anxiety, stress, loneliness, and inactivity are reported as the etiological factors for nail biting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0018">18</xref>). Moreover, nail biting is reported as a co-morbid problem in some psychiatric disorders such as tic disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0019">19</xref>). Those with nail biting have lesser prosocial abilities. Also, there is a marked trend for association of nail biting and emotional problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0002">2</xref>). A study including a clinical sample of children and adolescents with nail biting reported that many of these children suffer from co-morbid psychiatric disorders. The rates of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (74.6%), oppositional defiant disorder (36%), and separation anxiety disorder (20.6%) were considerably high (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0020">20</xref>). Moreover, nail biting can guide us for a better pharmacological management of psychiatric problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0021">21</xref>). Meanwhile, mental health of children with nail biting as a covariate factor has not been considered in previous studies for its treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0013">13</xref>).</p><p>In addition to mental health of children with nail biting, parent's mental health is also considerable. More than half of the mothers and 45.9% of the fathers of a clinical sample of children with nail biting had at least one psychiatric disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0020">20</xref>). Given that habit reversal needs the involvement of parents, parental mental health should be considered in any intervention. No previous published study included these covariates.</p><p>Moreover, previous studies included very small samples size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0022">22</xref>). The other study included 9 participants in each group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0013">13</xref>). Furthermore, some studies investigated the habit reversal in adults rather than children and adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0023">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0025">25</xref>). All of these items justified the need to investigate the effects of habit reversal behavior therapy to treat nail biting in children and adolescents. Moreover, no published study has compared habit reversal training and object manipulation training for the treatment of nail biting.</p><p>The aim of this study was to determine whether habit reversal training is effective for the treatment of nail biting behavior in the community sample of children and adolescents with nail biting. This study also aimed to examine whether object manipulation is effective for the treatment of nail biting in short and long term, and to find whether object manipulation is as effective as habit reversal training for the treatment of nail biting. Finally, in this study, we tried to survey whether the acceptability of object manipulation training and habit reversal training is different.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S0001"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec id="S20002"><title>Study Design and Participants</title><p>This study was a parallel, three group, randomized, controlled trial, with outcomes evaluated up to three months after the onset of intervention for children and adolescents. We announced our study to schools in Shiraz, Iran.</p><p>After contacting schools, the nail biting children and adolescents and their parents were invited to contact us for participation in a clinical trial. Two hundred ninety nine parents contacted us, and they were all invited to participate in our study. However, only 91 children and adolescents referred to the clinic at the set date. To participate in the study, the subjects must have been without any serious medical condition such as epilepsy, and psychiatric disorders (psychosis, bipolar disorder, substance misuse disorder). Moreover, being able to attend appointments was necessary. Nail biting had to be chronic and severe enough to cause observable damage or emotionally distressing to the individual. Moreover, children and adolescents or their parents should have requested any intervention for the treating nail biting behavior. Those with mild transient nail biting or those whose nail biting started after taking any medication were excluded. Participation in any current psychological therapy or pharmacotherapy for nail biting was another exclusion criterion. All the patients were examined medically by one of the researchers (A.B.).</p><p>Providing written informed consent for assessment and entry into the trial was required. The Ethics Committee of Shiras University of Medical Sciences approved the study.</p><p>After obtaining the consent form, the children and adolescents were randomly allocated to treatment groups. Participants and therapists were not masked to treatment allocation and it was also impractical to mask the research assessor. The primary outcome was rated by a researcher (A.B.). Parents reported the frequency of their children's nail biting behavior.</p></sec><sec id="S20003"><title>Procedures</title><p>Assessments were undertaken at baseline, 4 weeks, and 12 (post-therapy) weeks after the onset of intervention. There were only two assessments in the waiting-list group (Baseline and week 8). The research assessor assessed them face-to-face in the clinic through the evaluation of nails' length. The parents reported the frequency of nail biting, completed parent-reported version of SDQ. As it was impractical to mask the research assessor to treatment allocation after randomization, we also included parent reported frequency of nail biting to keep the observer bias to a minimum. One of the researchers (A.G.) trained another researcher (A.B.) until he was deemed competent to provide trial treatments. All of the children and adolescents were trained by one researcher (A.B.).</p></sec><sec id="S20004"><title>Interventions</title><p>There were three groups of Habit Reversal Treatment group (HR) (n = 30), Object manipulation group (n = 30), and wait-list or control group (n = 31) in this study. All the three groups were assessed at baseline. However, both HR and Object manipulation groups received intervention while the wait-list group did not receive any intervention. The children in the wait-list group were assessed in two sessions. They were not followed up for the last session of the assessment.</p><p>HRT and Object manipulation training groups were educated in the first session of the intervention. There was a booster session after one month.</p><p>HR treatment was conducted according to a protocol provided by Woods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0026">26</xref>). In this protocol, the possible functions of nail biting as well as the feelings experienced before, during and after nail biting were identified. According to this protocol, habit reversal includes awareness training, competing response training, and social support training. These trainings were conducted in a 30-minute session. In fact, the next sessions were booster sessions to monitor the progress and develop solutions to problems which occurred during the implementation of the intervention. In awareness training, children were trained to recognize their nail biting behavior and its warning signs. For competing response, children were trained to exhibit a behavior which was incompatible with nail biting immediately after the occurrence of nail biting or one of its warning signs. They were asked to hold a pencil or a toy with their hands. Finally, a person was identified to support children to increase their treatment compliance, and remind their competing response, and reward them for their compliance.</p><p>This group of children was trained for all the items reported for HR training. They were trained to play with something (such as a toy, pencil) instead of biting their nail. In fact, nail biting was replaced by playing with something. All other parts including awareness training and social support were similar to habit reversal treatment group. In fact, the object manipulation condition and HR condition were identical. However, children in object manipulation condition manipulated an object instead of doing a competing response.</p></sec><sec id="S20005"><title>Measurements</title><sec><title>Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire</title><p>Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) is a well-known questionnaire for screening psychiatric symptoms in children and adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0027">27</xref>).

This confirms that HR is an effective treatment for the management of nail biting for the community sample -of children and adolescents. Moreover, nail length increased during the trial in both groups of intervention while the mean length of nails in the wait-list group decreased during the trial. It is consistent with and supports the results of Woods et al.'s study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0013">13</xref>). However, there is a lot of covariate factors considered in the current study that were not considered in the study by Woods et al. (1999). Moreover, the study by Woods et al. (1999) was conducted on children with thumb sucking. Only some of their participants had nail biting problem. In addition, we did not find any study on the effect of object manipulation on nail biting behavior. Therefore, the current study seems to be unique.</p><p>Regarding our second aim, the obtained results showed that object manipulation was more effective than wait-list in short term. Moreover, object manipulation significantly decreased nail biting in long term. However, the number of children who completely stopped nail biting was very close to each other. Therefore, further studies with longer duration are recommended.</p><p>Our third aim was to compare the effectiveness of object manipulation training and habit reversal training. The results showed that, in long term, both object manipulation training and habit reversal training are significantly effective for treating nail biting behavior. However, habit reversal training is more effective than object manipulation training.</p><p>Concerning our aim to understand the acceptability of object manipulation training and habit reversal training, the current results showed no significant difference between the two groups regarding their acceptability.</p><p>However, the drop-out rate was higher in the object manipulation group than the habit reversal group.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that included a considerable large sample of children and adolescents with nail biting. It also considered the covariate factors including mental health of children and their parents. Emotional score, hyperactivity score, conduct score, pro-social score, and peer problems score were not associated with groups. Moreover, no study investigated the possible role of object manipulation for the treatment of nail biting. However, further studies with larger sample size are recommended.</p></sec><sec id="S0016"><title>Limitations</title><p>In this study, the assessor was not blind to the groups. However, it does not seem to be a fatal flaw. We measured the length of nail which is not the subject of assessor bias. However, future studies may consider a second assessor. This study included children and adolescents from a community sample. Therefore, generalization of these findings to other communities or clinical samples is not warranted. In addition, further studies with longer duration are recommended. Furthermore, it is not clear whether treating concurrent psychiatric problems in children with nail biting leads to stopping nail biting.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="S0017"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Habit reversal more than object manipulation increases the mean length of nails in long term.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This study was the post graduate thesis of Dr. Amir Bazrafshan toward the Iranian board of psychiatry.
