overground gait training (CGT) and a gait trainer with partial body weight support (GTBWS)
on spatiotemporal gait parameters of patients with hemiparesis following chronic stroke.
[Subjects and Methods] Thirty stroke patients were alternately assigned to one of two
treatment groups, and both groups underwent CGT and GTBWS. [Results] The functional
ambulation classification on the affected side improved significantly in the CGT and GTBWS
groups. Walking speed also improved significantly in both groups. [Conclusion] These
results suggest that the GTBWS in company with CGT may be, in part, an effective method of
gait training for restoring gait ability in patients after a stroke.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Gait training</kwd><kwd>Spatiotemporal gait parameters</kwd><kwd>Stroke patients</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Most hemiplegic patients who have suffered from stroke experience a restriction of their
mobility in the home and in the community, particularly in terms of walking
independently<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. The restoration of gait
ability is an important goal in the process of therapy for stroke patients because gait is
such a significant element in achievement of functional independence<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Characteristically, stroke patients suffer from deficits in
their functional ambulation capacity, balance, walking velocity, cadence, stride length,
temporal gait pattern, and muscular activity pattern<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Generally, stroke patients show decreased walking velocity, which
results in a decreased paretic stance phase and an increased paretic swing phase. In
addition, stroke results in an asymmetric spatiotemporal gait pattern. An increase in gait
velocity without improvements in symmetry suggests that compensatory strategies are retained
and amplified<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. In this regard, Mumman
noted that the biggest loss after a stroke is gait ability and that a hemiplegic patient
shows selective ability to regulate and coordinate the movement disorder, which results in a
slow gait velocity and lower extremity compensation movement on the non-affected side<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Perry suggested that a hemiplegic patient
manifests a short stride length and slow gait velocity as a result of damage to the joints
and the regulation function of the muscles, both of which are necessary for normal gait.
Among the several indicators relating to gait, gait velocity is a useful indicator
representing clinical trends, the quality of the gait, and the degree to which the gait
velocity function is abnormal in both hemiplegic and normal patients. Also, velocity is easy
to measure and is closely related to the patient&#x02019;s clinical condition<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Specifically, stroke patients suffer from deficits in their
functional ambulation capacity, balance, walking velocity, cadence, stride length, temporal
gait pattern, and muscular activity pattern. Normal gait is smooth and symmetric, but the
hemiplegic gait has been described as slow and asymmetric<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Among the assessment methods commonly used to characterize walking
in patients with hemiplegia, measurement of temporal and spatial parameters is generally
considered the easiest to perform and the most clinically relevant<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Temporal gait measures
include velocity, cadence, step length, stride length, individual phase durations and
proportions, and symmetry ratios<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Recent investigations have shown that walking speed is linked to a greater extent with
non-hemiplegic limb stance and swing than with hemiplegic limb stance and swing<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. This correlation is not surprising, given
the significant change in the gait cycle of the weight-bearing non-hemiplegic leg as a
result of weakness in the hemiplegic leg<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Training with a gait trainer and partial body weight support is relatively effective for
repetitive practice of the gait cycle and restoration of gait ability in acute, subacute,
and chronic hemiparesis patients and healthy adults<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Stroke patients treated using this training method have exhibited
improvements in walking ability, and a newly developed gait trainer is as effective as
treadmill therapy with partial body weight support (BWS), while also requiring less input
from a therapist<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. According to a recent
study by Werner et al., treadmill training with body weight support resulted in improvements
in functional ambulation classification (FAC), gait velocity, and Rivermead scores in
subacute, non-ambulatory stroke survivors<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. In another study, subjects with chronic stroke symptoms showed an
increase in their 10&#x02005;m walking time, Berg Balance Scale score, and step length as a result
of either BWS treadmill or overground ambulation training<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. A similar study conducted recently on 25 subjects including both
healthy patients and stroke patients involved a three-week program to compare the effects of
treadmill training on the ambulation of stroke survivors in the early stages of
rehabilitation. It was found that treadmill training was more effective than conventional
gait training for improving some gait parameters such as functional ambulation, stride
length, percentage of the paretic single stance period, and gastrocnemius muscular
activity<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. An electromechanical gait
trainer is an effective alternative to treadmill therapy, as it provides weight support on
both sides and intense gait rehabilitation after stroke<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. The machine can simulate the stance and swing phases in a highly
physiological manner, and ropes attached to the harness control the movement of the center
of mass in a phase-dependent manner<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.
However, the gait trainer also offers severely disabled hemiparetic subjects the possibility
of training with a highly symmetrical gait-like movement involving favorable facilitation of
the relevant anti-gravity muscles; the effort required by therapists is simultaneously
reduced<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. In this study, we
investigated to confirm the effects of conventional overground gait training (CGT) and the
effects of a gait trainer with partial body weight support (GTBWS) in stroke patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The participants of this study include 30 hemiplegic patients (twenty-two males and eight
females) who had a stroke diagnosis and were receiving admission or outpatient treatment in
P rehabilitation center. The subjects were alternately assigned to either the conventional
overground gait training (CGT) group or the electrical gait training group using the gait
trainer with partial body weight support (GTBWS). As part of a four-week gait training
intervention, the CGT group and GTBWS group received a 30-minute conventional overground
gait training session and five daily physical therapy treatments per week. During this
intervention, the GTBWS group received a total of 30 gait training sessions using an
electromechanical gait trainer, each session lasting 20 minutes. The GTBWS group involved
ambulating on a motor-driven treadmill (Gait Trainer 2<sup>&#x02122;</sup> analysis system, Biodex
Medical Systems, Inc., Shirley, NY, USA) adjusted to the subject&#x02019;s comfortable walking
speed. Gait trainer training (harness-supported treadmill walking training) focuses on
straight trunk and limb alignment with proper weight shifting and weight bearing on to the
hemiplegic limb during the loading phases of gait, as well as stepping to advance the limb
forward<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Treadmill velocity was
adjusted to a comfortable cadence and stride length. The vertical and horizontal movements
of the center of mass in the pelvis were controlled by ropes attached to the harness, and
these varied depending on the phase of gait<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. The physiotherapist sat in front of the
patient and gently shifted the paretic knee into extension during the stance phase, thus
preventing knee hyperextension thrust or knee collapse. Physical assistance with tasks such
as setting the paretic limb, controlling the knee, helping with hip and trunk erection, and
shifting body weight was provided according to individual needs<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. The body weight support (BWS) group was provided with up
to 30&#x02013;40% BWS at the beginning of training, and the percentage of BWS was progressively
increased or decreased according to the subjects&#x02019; gait pattern and ability to walk<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. In order to figure out the clinical outcomes, ambulation ability was
assessed using the functional ambulation classification (FAC) and walking speed to quantify
the changes. In addition, the gait trainer analysis system was used to quantify the changes
in spatiotemporal gait parameters such as walking speed, walking cycle, stance phase on the
affected side, stride length on the affected side, and symmetry index of stance phase and
stride length. The 10-m walking velocity test was used to quantify changes in gait ability.
Each of the following measures was carried out three times to evaluate variations: 1) FAC
and walking speed, 2) spatiotemporal gait parameters, 3) symmetry index of the stance phase
and stride length, and 4) 10-m walking velocity test. In this way, the average study values
were measured and evaluated before and after the research. Pre- and post-intervention
assessments were carried out by physiotherapists, who were blind to the group placement of
the subjects. The FAC distinguishes six levels of required support during gait training. It
was performed using the walking aid recommended by the treating therapists and without
orthoses<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. The FAC has been reported
by many previous research studies to be valid, reliable, and capable of offering valuable
measures of hemiplegic gait quality<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. While the subject walked 13 m, the researcher measured a 10-m
section using a stopwatch, omitting 1.5&#x02005;m at both the start and end points<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. To determine walking velocity and assess
safety and stability, the patients were asked to walk 10&#x02005;m at their maximum speeds.
Measurement of gait velocity is a highly valid and reliable test method in that it shows the
gait ability and functional training ability of a stroke patient<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. Patients used a quadripod or walking cane during
measurements. In this study, the average of three values measured consecutively was used as
the measurement value to determine gait ability before and after the study. The gait trainer
used in the study helped the participants observe their feet touching the ground in real
time on a monitor through shadow images. This device is able to compare the gait velocity
(meters/sec), gait cycle (cycles/sec), and symmetric index (%) of the stance phase and the
swing phase through a histogram using normal category values. The gait trainer was designed
by Werner et al. to stimulate gait phases in a symmetric manner with stance and swing phase
ratios of 60% to 40%, respectively. These ratios are based on a normal walking speed, and
gait training is aimed at training patients after a stroke to attain as close to a normal
gait pattern as possible by the end of their rehabilitation programs<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. The vertical and horizontal movements of the center of
mass are controlled in a phase-dependent manner by a rope attached to a harness and
connected to a gear system. A pulley can relieve part of the body weight. Body weight is
partially supported to compensate for paresis of the affected lower limb, and this support
is reduced as soon as the patient can take his or her full weight. The clinical criteria for
this are the ability of the patient to extend his/her hips and the ability to carry weight
sufficiently on the affected lower limbs<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. The gait training personnel using the system must read a set of
instructions concerning data processing and should be knowledgeable about gait mechanics and
stroke rehabilitation. Spatiotemporal measures are calculated for each patient using the
GAITRite software, which allows velocity, step time, step length, and step width to be
measured. Step time, length, and width are averaged for the left and right limbs separately.
Values are then averaged across all steps for each patient<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. In this study, the participants were allowed to observe the
training process on the monitor with the shadow image removed for accurate measurement. The
collected data were tested in a Kolmogorov-Smirnov examination using SPSS version 20.0. In
the results, the assumption of a normal distribution was satisfied, and outcomes were
expressed as the mean &#x000b1; standard error. An independent t-test was used to compare
participants between the groups, and a paired t-test was conducted to compare the
participants before and after the treatment. The statistical significance level was set at
&#x003b1;=0.05. The protocol for the study was approved by the Committee of Ethics in Research of
the University of Yongin, in accordance with the terms of Resolution 5-1-20, December 2006.
Furthermore, all volunteers or their next of kin provided informed consent for participation
in the study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p><xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Clinical characteristics of the hemiplegic stroke patients</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Variable</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CGT group</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">GTBWS group</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (yrs)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">37.7 &#x000b1; 4.5</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">44.2 &#x000b1; 3.9</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Gender</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" style="padding-left:10pt" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Male (%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">12 (80.0)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10 (66.7)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" style="padding-left:10pt" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Female (%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3 (20.0)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5 (33.3)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Height (cm)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">170.1 &#x000b1; 2.2</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">168.5 &#x000b1; 2.1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Weight (kg)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">65.1 &#x000b1; 2.4</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">68.0 &#x000b1; 3.5</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Caused of disease</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" style="padding-left:10pt" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Infarction (%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">11 (73.3)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">12 (80.0)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" style="padding-left:10pt" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Hemorrhage (%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4 (26.7)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3 (20.0)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Affected side</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" style="padding-left:10pt" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Right (%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">9 (60.0)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7 (46.7)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" style="padding-left:10pt" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Left (%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6 (40.0)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8 (53.3)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Time post stroke (mo)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">19.9 &#x000b1; 3.3</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">20.5 &#x000b1; 6.2</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">K-MMSE (score)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">26.3 &#x000b1; 3.7</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">27.3 &#x000b1; 3.2</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>All data are presented as the mean&#x000b1;SE.

ambulation abilities, spatiotemporal gait parameters, and symmetry index when they are used
for gait training in chronic stroke patients. This study is a valuable guide to gait
parameter assessment, and treadmill training with partial body weight support is a promising
new approach to gait rehabilitation after stroke<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. Ambulation ability, walking speed, and gait parameters in chronic
stroke patients were improved following the use of a gait trainer with partial body weight
support and conventional overground gait training as measured using the FAC, walking speed,
spatiotemporal gait parameters, symmetry index of the stance and stride phases, and 10-m
walking velocity test. Recent studies have reported interrelationships in terms of these
parameters<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. Hesse and Werner noted that patients should try to walk fast on a
treadmill, thereby facilitating the relevant weight-bearing muscles and improving gait
efficieney<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. It has also been asserted
that speed alone is an effective indicator of the degree of gait abnormality and that no
element is more important than velocity in measuring hemiplegic gait<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Other studies not only emphasize the nature of the
relationship between gait speed and other temporal and spatial gait parameters but also the
association between walking speed and symmetry in patients with stroke-induced
hemiplegia<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Many studies have indicated that these assessments represent an
adequate analysis of hemiplegic gait parameters and that the assessment results concur with
those of previous studies evaluating gait trainer systems as a means of restoring gait
ability and its related parameters in patients with chronic stroke effects<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.
In the present study, FAC and walking velocity were employed as useful indicators for making
decisions regarding comprehensive gait parameters in chronic hemiplegic patients. It was
found that FAC and walking speed correlate with improvements in the gait parameters. In a
group comparison, both the CGT and GTBWS groups showed significant improvement in terms of
stride length on the affected side. The present study examined the effects of treadmill
training on the ambulation of stroke survivors in the early stages of rehabilitation. The
results of recent studies indicate that treadmill training without weight support is
feasible and well tolerated by subjects with hemiparesis, even in the early stages of gait
rehabilitation<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Hesse and Werner
studied four weeks of physiotherapy and gait trainer therapy and showed that they resulted
in a relevant improvement of gait ability in all subjects. Velocity, cadence, and stride
length improved significantly<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. A study
of Frankenberg et al. showed that walking velocity improved significantly over time in both
their groups and that gait ability improved<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the present study, the group comparison revealed that patients
in both groups attained a significantly higher gait ability level. In another study, gait
training of 50 subjects using treadmill gait training with body weight support (BWS) was
compared with gait training of 50 subjects using treadmill gait training without body weight
support (no-BWS) to assess clinical outcome measures for stroke patients<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. The results showed that after six weeks,
the BWS group scored significantly higher than the no-BWS group for functional balance,
motor recovery, overground walking speed, and overground walking endurance<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. It should be noted that gait trainer
training is no more time-consuming than conventional overground gait training<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. The limitation of conventional overground
gait training as a daily routine in the present study was the effort required by therapists
in assisting the gait of severely affected subjects by controlling paretic knee, hip, and
trunk movement. A physiotherapist was required to assist patients with movement on the gait
trainer. Therefore, a gait trainer with BWS may supplement gait therapy by enabling
repetitive practice of gait-like movement without excessive effort on the part of
therapists<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Also, the gait trainer in
the present study was more effective with regard to restoration of functional ambulation
ability, walking speed, and the gait spatiotemporal variables and symmetry index of the
stance phase and stride length. The gait trainer with BWS training applied in the present
study is more significant in terms of FAC, walking speed, and spatiotemporal gait parameters
compared with conventional overground gait training. According to recent studies, treadmill
training is easy to incorporate during conventional treatment, since unlike a weight support
system, it is no more time-consuming or taxing for the therapist than overground training.
Other studies have suggested that the gait trainer enables repetitive practice of a
gait-like movement by nonambulatory or ambulatory subjects without excessive work on the
part of therapists<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. In this study, the
major advantage of the gait trainer with BWS is that it requires less effort by a therapist
than conventional therapy. Further scientific studies should be carried out focusing on
improvement of gait characteristics and ambulation ability in hemiplegic patients<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>.
In addition, greater numbers of participants and longer treatment times, including a
follow-up, should be used to validate the results of this study.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Eich</surname><given-names>HJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Mach</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Werner</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Aerobic treadmill plus Bobath walking training improves
