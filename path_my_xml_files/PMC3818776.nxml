exercise on postural balance of chronic stroke patients. [Subjects] A total of 67 stroke
patients were assigned either to a horseback riding simulator exercise group (HEG, n=34)
or a mat exercise group (MEG, n=33). [Methods] The subjects exercised three times per week
for 8 weeks. Static balance ability was determined by eyes open balance (EOB) and eyes
closed balance (ECB), which was measured using a Kinesthetic Ability Trainer Balance
system. Dynamic balance was evaluated using the Berg balance scale (BBS). [Results] EOB
and ECB significantly decreased and BBS had significantly increased after the intervention
in the HEG and the MEG, and ECB decreased and BBS increased significantly more in the HEG
than in the MEG. [Conclusion] Horseback riding simulator exercise is more effective than
mat exercise for improving the ECB and BBS of stroke patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Horseback riding simulator exercise</kwd><kwd>Postural balance</kwd><kwd>Stroke</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Patients with postural adjustment disorder have impaired balance and posture. In these
patients, abnormal delivery of sensory information greatly influences postural sway and
muscle activity, causing disability in activities of daily living and interfering with
treatment interventions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Diverse rehabilitation programs are available for functional improvement and balance
recovery for hemiplegic patients. Among these, horseback riding is a treatment that focuses
on three areas: physical rehabilitation, psychological treatment, and the development of
social skills. The treatment uses kinesociological movement and different walking patterns
such as walk, trot, and riding trot, and nature-friendly characteristics. Physical therapy
and psychological treatment approaches are employed to correct the horseback rider's posture
and to improve the function of the tendons, ligaments, the cardiopulmonary system, and blood
circulation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, horseback riding
therapy itself presents some difficulties as a treatment due to location, costs, and risks.
One solution to these difficulties is the horseback riding simulator, which allows simulated
horseback riding in a fixed space, and this exercise is possible anytime.</p><p>And riding on a simulator assists A horseback riding simulator simulates the rhythmic
movement of a horse, the development of equilibrium, flexibility, and whole-body muscles
while improving the balance and postural adjustment normal and disabled people<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Studies of proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation, Bobath, sling, and ball exercises have
examined improvements in the postural balance of stroke patients, but research on the
effects of horseback riding simulators is lacking. The aim of the present study was,
therefore, to examine the potential benefits of exercise using a horseback riding simulator
on the postural balance of chronic stroke patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This experiment included 67 stroke patients hospitalized at D hospital in Daejeon, Korea.
All subjects read and signed consent forms, in accordance with the ethical standards of the
Declaration of Helsinki. The possibility of natural recovery was minimized by selecting only
patients whose onset of stroke was at least 6 months prior to the experiment. No patient had
diabetes, heart disease, or orthopedic problems and their Korea-mental mini state
examination score was 24 or higher. The subjects were able to walk independently for more
than 15 minutes. All subjects listened to an explanation of the purpose of this study and
exercise method and voluntarily participated in the experiment.</p><p>They were able to maintain a standing position independently for more than 30 seconds and
could walk in doors continuously for more than 30&#x02005;m independently. Also, they had no
problems with walking due to orthopedic surgery or impairment, a Modified Ashworth Scale
stiffness 2 or less and a lower extremity muscle strength measured as F or higher in the
Manual Muscle Test.</p><p>The subjects were divided into a horseback riding simulator exercise group (HEG, n=34, 18
males and 16 females) and a mat exercise group (MEG, n=33, 18 males and 15 females). The
subjects' average age, height, and weight were 56.09&#x000b1;7.22&#x02005;years old, 166.05&#x000b1;7.47&#x02005;cm, and
62.91&#x000b1;7.93 Kg, respectively, for the HEG, and 51.55&#x000b1;8.27&#x02005;years old, 169.55&#x000b1;8.40&#x02005;cm, and
67.05&#x000b1;8.38 Kg, respectively, for the MEG.</p><p>Stroke was the result of cerebral infarction in 15 subjects and cerebral hemorrhage in 19
subjects in the HEG, and cerebral infarction in 16 subjects and cerebral hemorrhage in 17
subjects in the MEG. The onset of stroke was between 7 and 12 months prior to the experiment
in 19 patients, and more than 15 months prior in 15 subjects in the HEG. In the MEG, the
onset of stroke was between 7 and 12 months prior to the experiment in 20 patients and more
than 13 months prior in 13 patients. Both groups received exercise treatment three times per
week for 8 weeks and received ordinary physical therapy 6 times per week. A physical
therapist with more than 10&#x02005;years of clinical experience administered the exercise
programs.</p><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title> The mat exercise program</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Program</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Trunk Stabilization Exercise Using the Upper Extremities- Place a

those of a real horse (FORTIS, Korea). The simulator had 100 different exercise programs.
Since the subjects were patients, course number 71 was selected as it did not include abrupt
rhythm and had a comfortable up and down and forward and backward rhythmic movement (the
distance between up and down was 52 m/min, the distance between forward and backward was 39
m/min, the number of up and down rhythmic movements was 90 to 100 times, the number of
forward and backward rhythmic movements was 90 to 100 times, and the rhythm distance was 65
m/min). Course number 74 was also selected as it had a large up and down and forward and
backward rhythmic movement, which has a good exercise effect on the neck, shoulders, trunk,
abdomen, thighs, and legs (distance between up and down was 73 m/min, distance between
forward and backward was 40 m/min, the number of up and down rhythmic movements was 95 to
105 times, the number of forward and backward rhythmic movements was 95 to 105 times, and
the rhythm distance was 98 m/min). The exercise was administered for a total of 35 minutes,
three times per week. Each course was administered for 15 minutes and the subjects rested
for five minutes after a course. The exercise speed was set at a medium speed (50%), which
was not fast when compared to the designated rhythmic speeds of the horseback riding
simulator. The risk of falling was minimized by equipping the subjects with an automatic
stop device.</p><p>The MEG performed a trunk stabilization exercise using a mat for 35 minutes (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The trunk stabilization exercises were
performed using the lumbar spinal stabilization exercise methods developed by Norris<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref><sup>)</sup> and Richardson and Jull<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. The exercise session lasted 35 minutes in total, and
warm-up and cool-down exercises were performed for five minutes at the beginning and the end
of the exercises, respectively. Programs 1 through 3 were repeated 10 times per set and a
total of three sets were completed.</p><p>Static balance was measured using a Kinesthetic Ability Trainer (KAT) Balance system (KAT
2000 Breg Inc., USA) and the center of pressure sway was recorded The moving platform of the
KAT Balance System is supported at the central point on a small pivot. The stability of the
plate is regulated by an air pressure cushion between the platform and the floor. When the
cushion is inflated, the platform is stabilized, and when the cushion is deflated, the
platform becomes very unstable. A tilt sensor installed in front of the platform records the
degree of tilt of the platform from the reference point at a rate of 18.2 times per second
on a computer. In this experiment, the distance between the center of the plate and the
subjects' center of pressure sway was measured in each test to calculate the Balance Index
(BI). The BI is an index of a subject's ability to maintain his or her body close to the
central point of the platform; so that a low BI score indicates a better balance sense. The
subjects maintained a distance of 5&#x02013;6&#x02005;cm between their heels and stood comfortably on the
moving platform. Eyes open balance (EOB) and eyes closed balance (ECB) were measured three
times for 30 seconds each time and the average values were calculated. Dynamic balance prior
to and after the intervention was evaluated using the Berg balance scale (BBS).</p><p>The data were statistically processed using SPSS 12.0 for Windows. The paired t-test was
used to examine within group changes after the intervention and the independent t-test was
employed to examine between-group changes. The significance level was chosen as at
&#x003b1;=0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><table-wrap id="tbl_002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title> Comparison between the groups in terms of balance ability</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Parameter</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Group</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pre</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Post</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="2" colspan="1">EOB (BI)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">HEG<sup>*</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">559.97&#x000b1;107.76</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">551.29&#x000b1;107.82</td></tr><tr><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">MEG<sup>*</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">565.61&#x000b1;123.62</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">552.61&#x000b1;95.18</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="2" colspan="1">ECB (BI)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">HEG<sup>*</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1,412.29&#x000b1;230.40</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1,274.20&#x000b1;152.62<sup>&#x02020;</sup></td></tr><tr><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">MEG<sup>*</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1,453.82&#x000b1;195.33</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1,375.97&#x000b1;179.87</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="2" colspan="1">BBS (score)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">HEG<sup>*</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">36.86&#x000b1;3.63</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">42.27&#x000b1;4.85<sup>&#x02020;</sup></td></tr><tr><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">MEG<sup>*</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">37.74&#x000b1;3.75</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">40.91&#x000b1;3.14</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>EOB: eyes open balance, ECB: eyes closed balance, BBS: Berg Balance Scale, HEG: horse

standing balance, and voluntary adjustment of the affected side lower extremity, as well as
their sense of joint position and the existence or non-existence of joint contracture<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Lee and Jeong<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that when 20
normal adult female students performed horseback riding simulator exercises, the muscle
strengths in their thighs and waists were greatly improved. Therefore, since horseback
riding simulator exercises improve the muscle strengths in the thigh and lumbar regions, as
well as trunk stabilization, the aim of the present study was to examine the effects of
horseback riding simulator exercises on the balance ability of stroke patients.</p><p>Devienne and Guezennec<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref><sup>)</sup> in a study of 20
normal females, noted that horseback riding exercise increased the strength of their knee
flexor and the quadriceps femoris muscles. Quint and Toomey<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref><sup>)</sup> observed that horseback riding significantly increased the range of
forward and backward passive tilt, of a study on 13 children with cerebral palsy. Choo<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref><sup>)</sup> conducted a horseback riding program for
children with cerebral palsy for 3 months and reported positive influences on their static
and dynamic equilibrium.</p><p>Back et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref><sup>)</sup> noted that 40 subjects who
exercised on a horseback riding simulator had greater increases in the strength of the
biceps brachii, transverse abdominis, abdominal oblique, and adductor longus muscles than
when they jogged. Lee and Jeong<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref><sup>)</sup>
reported that horseback simulator exercise increased muscle strengths in the femoral and the
lumbar areas of 20 normal female students. Cho et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref><sup>)</sup> noted that horseback riding simulator exercise was effective at
improving postural balance ability and proprioceptive sense in a study of 30 normal adults.
Kuczy&#x00144;ski and S&#x00142;onka<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref><sup>)</sup> conducted
horseback riding simulator exercise for 25 cerebral palsy children for 12 weeks, and
observed a significant improvement in their left and right balance ability.</p><p>The balance ability test administered in the present study showed that balance ability
after the intervention had improved in both the HEG and MEG, which indicates that both
horseback riding and mat exercises are effective at improving postural balance. However,
greater improvements after the exercise were observed in the HEG than in the MEG in ECB and
BBS. This finding is consistent with the results reported by Hammer et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref><sup>)</sup> who conducted horseback riding simulator
exercise for 11 multiple sclerosis patients and observed improvements in their BBS.
Similarly, Beinotti et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref><sup>)</sup> conducted
horseback riding exercise for 20 stroke patients and observed enhancement of their gait and
balance abilities. Cho et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref><sup>)</sup> reported
that horseback riding simulator exercises were effective at improving postural balance
ability and proprioceptive sense, while Nashner and Peter<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that proprioceptive sense&#x02013;improving exercises elicited a
larger improvement in postural sway when the eyes were closed. In the present study, ECB
showed significant differences between the groups after the intervention, indicating HEG's
proprioceptive senses improved more than MEG's proprioceptive senses; whereas, EOB did not
show a significant difference. When horseback riding simulator exercise is performed by
chronic stroke patients, increases in the major muscles of the upper and lower extremities
and trunk, and improvements in proprioceptive sense ovserved, indicating that the subjects
are better able to maintain their balance and equilibrium.</p><p>Horseback riding rehabilitation is one of many diverse treatment methods for patients with
neurological damage and utilizes the gait of a horse. The horse's rhythmic movement
stimulates the patients and aids them to improve posture and balance, and has a treatment
effects that include reduced muscle tone, improved trunk adjustment, and enhanced
equilibrium responses and autonomic reflexes. However, horses are costly and horseback
riding is a sport that is not easily accessible to most ordinary people. In addition, stroke
patients are less likely to have an opportunity to do this sport. Horseback riding lacks
recognition as a form of rehabilitation, facilities for horseback riding rehabilitation, and
professional therapists. However, a horseback riding simulator exercise that mimics
movements of a horse can be used as a therapeutic substitute for functional improvement of a
patients' balance ability.</p><p>The limitations of the present study are that the number of subjects was too small to allow
generalization of the results, and no follow-up evaluation was conducted to determine the
long-term effects of horseback riding simulator exercise. In addition, muscle strength,
rigidity, senses and gait ability were not examined prior to and after the exercise.
Therefore, further research is needed on the effects of horseback riding exercise on muscle
activities of the trunk and the lower extremities of stroke patients.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Hlavacka</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>Horak</surname><given-names>FB</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Somatosensory influence on postural response to galvanic
