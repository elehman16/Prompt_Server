The distinct efficacy and safety profile of this class of drugs provides a novel approach for add-on therapy in the event of failure of other antidiabetic agents. The GLP-1 receptor agonists currently available include twice-daily and once-weekly formulations of exenatide and a once-daily formulation of liraglutide, thus providing a broad scope for tailoring therapy to individual patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>).</p><p>Lixisenatide is a selective once-daily prandial GLP-1 receptor agonist (6&#x02013;9) that was approved by the European Medicines Agency in February 2013 for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. The 20-&#x000b5;g once-daily dose was previously shown to provide the best balance of glucose-lowering efficacy and gastrointestinal tolerability in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with metformin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). More recently, lixisenatide 20 &#x003bc;g once daily given as monotherapy was shown to significantly improve HbA<sub>1c</sub> and provide a pronounced effect on postprandial plasma glucose (PPG) in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with lifestyle intervention alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>).</p><p>The efficacy and safety of once-daily morning (prebreakfast) administration of lixisenatide (and twice-daily morning/evening dosing in early studies) have been evaluated in previous clinical studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>).

The study consisted of a 2-week screening period and a 1-week run-in, followed by a 24-week double-blind treatment phase. This was followed by a placebo-controlled extension of at least 52 weeks primarily collecting long-term safety data, plus a 4-week posttreatment follow-up after treatment discontinuation (not reported here). The primary objective of the study was to assess the efficacy of lixisenatide once daily (subcutaneously injected in the morning prior to breakfast) in terms of HbA<sub>1c</sub> reduction over 24 weeks versus placebo. Assessment of lixisenatide once daily administered prior to the evening meal was the main secondary objective.</p><p>The study was approved by the institutional review boards or ethics committees and was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice guidelines. All patients provided written informed consent to participate in the trial. A data monitoring committee supervised the conduct of the study by an ongoing review of unblinded safety and main efficacy parameters. An allergic reaction adjudication committee (ARAC) performed blinded assessment of potentially allergic or allergic-like reactions. The study was registered with <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="ClinicalTrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> (NCT00712673).</p><sec id="s2"><title>Participants</title><p>The study population included patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on metformin with a dose of at least 1.5 g/day for at least 3 months (HbA<sub>1c</sub> 7&#x02013;10% [53&#x02212;86 mmol/mol]). The main exclusion criteria included the following: use of oral or injectable glucose-lowering agents other than metformin within 3 months prior to the time of screening; fasting plasma glucose (FPG) at screening &#x0003e;13.9 mmol/L (250 mg/dL); history of unexplained pancreatitis, chronic pancreatitis, pancreatectomy, stomach/gastric surgery, or inflammatory bowel disease; history of metabolic acidosis, including diabetic ketoacidosis, within 1 year prior to screening; previous allergic reaction to any GLP-1 agonist; and clinically relevant history of gastrointestinal disease, with prolonged nausea and vomiting during the previous 6 months.</p><p>Participants were randomized to one of four treatment arms: lixisenatide or placebo injection in the morning or lixisenatide or placebo injection in the evening (3:1:3:1). Patients were stratified by HbA<sub>1c</sub> values (&#x0003c;8.0/&#x02265;8.0% [&#x0003c;64/&#x02265;64 mmol/mol]) and BMI (&#x0003c;30/&#x02265;30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) at screening.

The main secondary end point was HbA<sub>1c</sub> reduction for the evening injection arm.</p><p>Secondary end points included baseline to week 24 assessment of the following variables: <italic>1</italic>) the percentage of patients achieving HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x0003c;7.0% (&#x0003c;53 mmol/mol) or &#x02264;6.5% (&#x02264;48 mmol/mol); <italic>2</italic>) change in FPG; <italic>3</italic>) change in body weight; <italic>4</italic>) change in 2-h PPG and glucose excursion after a standardized breakfast meal test (morning injection arms only); <italic>5</italic>) &#x003b2;-cell function assessed by homeostasis model assessment-B (HOMA-B); and <italic>6</italic>) the percentage of patients who required rescue medication. The standardized breakfast meal challenge test consisted of a 600-kcal liquid meal (400 mL of Ensure Plus; Abbott Nutrition, Columbus, OH; composed of 53.8% carbohydrate, 16.7% protein, and 29.5% fat) and was performed 30 min after drug administration at baseline and week 24 (morning arms only).</p><p>Safety and tolerability assessment included treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs), symptomatic hypoglycemia, local tolerability at the injection site, allergic or allergic-like reactions, suspected pancreatitis, and safety laboratory. The safety population was defined as all randomized patients who took at least one dose of study treatment. For the purpose of this study, symptomatic hypoglycemia was defined as symptoms of hypoglycemia with an accompanying blood glucose &#x0003c;3.3 mmol/L (60 mg/dL) and/or prompt recovery with oral carbohydrate, intravenous glucose, or glucagon injection. Severe symptomatic hypoglycemia was defined as symptomatic hypoglycemia that required the assistance of another person, and that was associated either with a plasma glucose level &#x0003c;2.0 mmol/L (36 mg/dL) or, if no plasma glucose measurement was obtainable, with prompt recovery with carbohydrate, intravenous glucose, or glucagon injection.</p><p>Rescue medication was considered if all the fasting self-monitored plasma glucose values in three consecutive days exceeded the prespecified limit, in which case the patient contacted the investigator and a central laboratory FPG measurement (and HbA<sub>1c</sub> after week 12) was performed. Threshold values were FPG &#x0003e;15.0 mmol/L (270 mg/dL) from baseline to week 8, FPG &#x0003e;13.3 mmol/L (240 mg/dL) from week 8 to 12, and FPG &#x0003e;11.1 mmol/L (200 mg/dL) or HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x0003e;8.5% (&#x0003e;69 mmol/mol) from week 12 to 24. After confirmation of the need for rescue, sulfonylureas were the first option (unless contraindicated when another rescue medication, but not a GLP-1 agonist or dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor, could be added). Short-term use (up to 5 days at maximum) of insulin therapy (e.g., due to acute illness or surgery) was not considered to be rescue therapy.</p><p>The status and concentration of antilixisenatide antibodies were determined at four time points during the main 24-week treatment period (baseline and weeks 2, 4, and 24) using a validated assay (Biacore).</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>The primary efficacy variable was analyzed using an ANCOVA model with treatment arms (morning injection lixisenatide and placebo; evening injection lixisenatide and placebo), randomization strata for screening HbA<sub>1c</sub> and BMI, and country as fixed effects and using the baseline HbA<sub>1c</sub> value as a covariate. In the ANCOVA model, the morning and evening injection placebo arms were included as separate treatments but combined as one group when presenting results and making comparisons using the appropriate contrast. A last observation carried forward approach was used to account for missing data by taking the last available postbaseline on-treatment HbA<sub>1c</sub> measurement as the HbA<sub>1c</sub> value at week 24.

From a baseline HbA<sub>1c</sub> of &#x0223c;8.1% (65 mmol/mol), lixisenatide led to a decrease of &#x02013;0.9% (&#x02013;9.8 mmol/mol) (morning injection) and &#x02013;0.8% (&#x02013;8.7 mmol/mol) (evening injection) versus &#x02013;0.4% (&#x02013;4.4 mmol/mol) with placebo (primary end point) at 24 weeks. Approximately 40% of patients who received lixisenatide morning or evening injection achieved an HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x0003c;7.0% (&#x0003c;53 mmol/mol) compared with &#x0223c;20% of those who received placebo.</p><p>The HbA<sub>1c</sub> reductions reported for lixisenatide in this study are largely consistent with those seen in studies with other GLP-1 receptor agonists added to metformin monotherapy, even if an unexpectedly large placebo effect induced a smaller placebo-subtracted difference. In a 30-week study, twice-daily exenatide was shown to reduce HbA<sub>1c</sub> by 0.8% (8.2&#x02013;7.4%; 8.7 mmol/mol [66 to 57 mmol/mol]) using the highest dose of 10 &#x000b5;g twice daily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Studies with once-daily liraglutide (1.2&#x02013;1.8 mg) have achieved HbA<sub>1c</sub> reductions of up to 1.5% (16.4 mmol/mol) (8.4&#x02013;7.2% [68 to 55 mmol/mol] with 1.2 mg liraglutide; 8.4&#x02013;6.9% [68 to 52 mmol/mol] with 1.8 mg liraglutide) in this setting over 26 weeks, albeit from slightly higher baseline HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). The HbA<sub>1c</sub> reductions in the current study are also very similar to preliminary reports from other phase III studies involving add-on lixisenatide (once-daily prebreakfast) in patients insufficiently controlled on metformin monotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). In particular, in patients uncontrolled on metformin, add-on treatment with lixisenatide once daily was shown to be noninferior to exenatide twice daily at reducing HbA<sub>1c</sub> over 24 weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>).</p><p>Both lixisenatide arms demonstrated a statistically significant reduction from baseline to week 24 in FPG compared with placebo. Treatment with lixisenatide also provided a marked improvement in postprandial glycemic control, as shown by the &#x0223c;6 mmol/L decrease in 2-h PPG and 5 mmol/L decrease in glucose excursion in the morning injection arm. This marked improvement in PPG appears to be a highly consistent finding in studies with lixisenatide to date, including when used as a monotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). The pronounced effect of once-daily lixisenatide on PPG when used in combination with agents that primarily target fasting glucose (e.g., basal insulins) may provide useful clinical benefits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>).</p><p>The improvements in glycemic control reported here were accompanied by a significant improvement in &#x003b2;-cell function based on HOMA-B, which is consistent with preclinical mechanistic findings with lixisenatide and other GLP-1 receptor agonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Insulinotropic effects are believed to contribute, alongside glucagonostatic effects, to the ability of GLP-1 receptor agonists to reduce endogenous glucose production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). Postprandial glucose-lowering effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists, on the other hand, appear to be mediated mainly via slowing of gastric emptying, an effect that may be more prominent in shorter-acting agents, which may induce less tachyphylaxis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>).</p><p>Mean body weight decreased by &#x0223c;2 kg in the lixisenatide treatment arms at week 24, which can be considered as clinically relevant and beneficial for patients, and is in the same range as what is usually observed with other GLP-1 receptor agonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). Nevertheless, the difference compared with placebo was not significant. An analysis of the data did not reveal a reason for the body weight reduction observed in the placebo group; it was not related to specific investigational sites or countries or to specific baseline characteristics.</p><p>Furthermore, lixisenatide was well tolerated with a predictable AE profile consistent with previous studies of lixisenatide as well as other GLP-1 receptor agonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). As expected for a GLP-1 receptor agonist, mild and transient nausea and vomiting were the most commonly reported and only notable treatment-emergent AEs. Hypoglycemia frequency was slightly higher in the lixisenatide groups versus placebo but remained low with no cases of severe hypoglycemia. One of the key finds of the current study is that, in addition to the significant improvement in glycemic control provided by both the morning and evening administration of lixisenatide, the two regimens were comparable in terms of tolerability. Furthermore, the presence of antilixisenatide antibodies did not have any impact on the efficacy, safety, or tolerability of treatment.</p><p>Preliminary and published data from other studies with lixisenatide suggest that it is an effective, well-tolerated therapy when administered once daily before breakfast as either monotherapy or as an add-on to oral agents (e.g., metformin and/or sulfonylureas) or insulin-based treatment regimens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>), and is noninferior to twice-daily exenatide as an add-on to metformin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). The results of the current study further demonstrate that administration of lixisenatide once daily before the evening meal can also provides an effective and well-tolerated treatment option for patients insufficiently controlled on metformin monotherapy. The option to choose either morning or evening administration increases flexibility of lixisenatide dosing to suit individual patient lifestyles. It has been suggested that hyperglycemia associated with the morning meal represents an early defect that can be resistant to oral glucose-lowering therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>), which would make it a particularly relevant target. However, for patients who typically have a large evening meal, evening dosing may be a more appropriate option. The GLP-1 receptor agonist liraglutide is also administered once daily and can be dosed at any time; however, it appears to be less effective than exenatide and lixisenatide at controlling postprandial glycemia and exerts its effects on HbA<sub>1c</sub> via more pronounced effects on FPG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>).</p><p>In this study, the reduction in body weight was &#x02013;2.0 kg with lixisenatide compared with &#x02013;1.6 kg in the placebo group. The placebo-subtracted difference was inferior to that observed in other studies in the GetGoal program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). The reason for this effect is not known and not related to specific patient populations or countries, as suggested from subgroup analyses. The study also has the limitation that it was not planned to perform a daily glucose profile in these patients insufficiently controlled on metformin, and we cannot therefore conclude to what extent the effect of lixisenatide declines after morning or evening injections. Finally, it was not planned to compare the efficacy of morning versus evening injections of lixisenatide but only to compare each regimen with placebo. Therefore, no direct comparisons between morning and evening lixisenatide administration can be drawn from these data, as the study was not powered to detect differences between these two groups. A further limitation of this study was that the effect of lixisenatide on evening meal PPG using a standardized meal test was not conducted. Although this was not investigated, we hypothesize that improvements similar to those observed at the breakfast meal with morning lixisenatide administration would have been seen. It should also be noted that there is evidence from early studies with prebreakfast lixisenatide that PPG control can extend beyond the morning meal to subsequent meals, although with diminishing effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, in patients with type 2 diabetes uncontrolled on metformin, add-on treatment with lixisenatide once daily, given in a morning or evening dosing regimen, significantly improved glycemic control over 24 weeks and was well tolerated. Lixisenatide improves both fasting and prandial glycemia with a pronounced prandial effect. The results suggest that either morning or evening administration of lixisenatide once daily can provide an effective treatment option with similar levels of tolerability in this setting, thus providing patients with the flexibility to suit their lifestyle.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><p>Clinical trial reg. no.
