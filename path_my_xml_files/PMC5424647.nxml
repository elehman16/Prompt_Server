A new vaccine, modified Vaccinia Ankara virus expressing antigen 85A (MVA85A), was designed to enhance the protective efficacy of BCG.

We actively followed up infants every 3 months for up to 37 months. The primary study outcome was safety (incidence of adverse and serious adverse events) in all vaccinated participants, but we also assessed efficacy in a protocol-defined group of participants who received at least one dose of allocated vaccine. The primary efficacy endpoint was incident tuberculosis incorporating microbiological, radiological, and clinical criteria, and the secondary efficacy endpoint was <italic>M tuberculosis</italic> infection according to QuantiFERON TB Gold In-tube conversion (Cellestis, Australia).

More infants who received MVA85A than controls had at least one local adverse event (1251 [89%] of 1399 MVA85A recipients and 628 [45%] of 1396 controls who received the allocated intervention) but the numbers of infants with systemic adverse events (1120 [80%] and 1059 [76%]) or serious adverse events (257 [18%] and 258 (18%) did not differ between groups.

The region has a population of about 290&#x02008;000 people and an annual birth cohort of about 7000 babies.

We enrolled healthy infants, aged 4&#x02013;6 months and who had received BCG (Danish 1331, Statens Serum Institut, Denmark) within 7 days of birth. Infants had to have received all age-appropriate routine immunisations, and two doses of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine at least 28 days before study vaccination (amended to 14 days during enrolment). All infants had to be HIV ELISA negative, QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-tube test (QFT; Cellestis, Australia) negative, and have had no substantial exposure to a patient with known tuberculosis. The <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref> contains the study protocol.</p><p>The trial was approved by the University of Cape Town Faculty of Health Sciences Human Research Ethics Committee, Oxford University Tropical Research Ethics Committee, and the Medicines Control Council of South Africa.

Doses were prepared and labelled in masked syringes by an unmasked study pharmacist. An independent statistician prepared the randomisation schedule. The parents or legal guardians of study participants, study staff administering vaccinations or undertaking follow-up clinic assessments, and laboratory staff were masked to intervention group assignment.</p></sec><sec id="cesec50"><title>Procedures</title><p>The study design included specific cohorts for specialised analyses, but all participants were followed up for assessment of efficacy and incidence of serious adverse events. Peripheral blood for routine haematological and biochemical tests was taken at screening and on day 7 and day 28 after vaccination in an initial safety cohort of at least 330 infants (study group 1). We assessed immunogenicity in three subsequent cohorts of up to 60 participants with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot analysis (study group 2), an intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) assay for peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMCs) counts (study group 3), and a whole blood ICS assay (study group 4). We enrolled remaining infants into a fifth cohort (study group 5). PBMCs obtained from all infants before and after vaccination were cryopreserved for future correlates analyses. We did QFT testing at screening, day 336, at the end of study visit, and for infants admitted to a dedicated study ward for investigation for tuberculosis.<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref></p><p>We obtained data for incidence of solicited and unsolicited local (injection site) and systemic adverse events reported by parents or guardians on diary cards for 7 days after vaccination and by direct questioning by study staff for 28 days after vaccination. We also obtained data for serious adverse events throughout follow-up by active surveillance. Adverse events were assessed by the trial investigators and serious adverse events were assessed by the trial investigators and a local medical monitor, acting on behalf of the sponsor, to determine relation to vaccination. The trial investigators and local medical monitor were masked to intervention group throughout the trial. The safety monitoring committee (SMC) did not determine the association or severity of the adverse events. When the last infant in the safety cohort completed day 84, the SMC reviewed unmasked safety data to determine if a pattern of adverse events related to MVA85A or other safety concerns existed so as to advise on further enrolments. The SMC also conducted a second unmasked analysis-by-group safety and risk review after the 1000th infant completed their visit at study day 84.</p><p>We actively followed up infants every 3 months to identify any signs, symptoms, or exposure that merited further investigation. Participants who had a persistent cough, failure to thrive, weight loss crossing a major centile band, QFT or tuberculin skin test conversion, household tuberculosis contact, or any other condition causing investigator concern were admitted to the study ward. Standardised investigations involved assessments with chest radiography, tuberculin skin test, QFT, HIV-ELISA, two consecutive early morning gastric lavage samples, and two induced sputa. Gastric lavage and sputum samples underwent auramine smear microscopy, GeneXpert MTB/RIF (Cepheid, USA; routinely from January, 2011, onwards), and MGIT (Becton Dickinson, Sparks, USA) liquid culture and sensitivity testing. Positive samples were speciated by PCR. We developed a hierarchy of three disease endpoint definitions. Endpoint 1 (<xref rid="box1" ref-type="boxed-text">panel 1</xref>) and endpoint 2 (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 49</xref>) were based on the presence of specific clinical, radiological, and microbiological findings.<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> Endpoint 2 (which included all infants who met endpoint 1 criteria) had marginally less stringent criteria to define tuberculosis infection and household exposure. Endpoint 3 included all participants placed on treatment for tuberculosis by a health professional. This approach allowed objective case classification without the need for an adjudication committee.</p><p>The endpoint of infection with <italic>M tuberculosis</italic> was defined as conversion to a positive QFT test at any time during follow-up. We assessed rates of QFT conversion 1 year after vaccination and at end of study in those participants not previously started on anti-tuberculous treatment.</p><p>We measured immunological sensitisation to <italic>M tuberculosis</italic> antigens, suggesting <italic>M tuberculosis</italic> infection, by QFT during screening, 1 year after vaccination, and at the close-out visit. We obtained blood samples from study groups 2&#x02013;4 for immunogenicity analyses 7 days before vaccination and 7 days or 28 days after vaccination. We assessed immunogenicity with an ex-vivo interferon &#x003b3; enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot assay, together with PBMC and whole blood ICS assays done as previously described.<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> Further details of the methods are available in the <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="cesec60"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>The primary study outcome was safety in all vaccinated participants (safety population), including all solicited, unsolicited, and serious adverse events. We compared the proportion of participants with at least one such adverse event in the placebo and MVA85A groups with Fisher's exact test, and we calculated two-sided exact 95% CIs for proportions of individual events within treatment groups. We did immunogenicity analyses for all vaccinated participants enrolled in study groups 2&#x02013;4. Statistical analyses were prespecified in a statistical analysis plan, signed off prior to study database lock and unmasking of data (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>).</p><p>The primary efficacy outcome was incidence of endpoint 1 and the secondary efficacy outcome was infection with <italic>M tuberculosis</italic>. Endpoints 2 and 3 were exploratory efficacy outcomes. All efficacy analyses were based on the per-protocol population, consisting of all randomly allocated participants who received at least one dose of study vaccine as randomised, and who had no major protocol deviations.</p><p>The primary statistical method for analysis of endpoint 1 was vaccine efficacy, defined as 1 minus the estimated hazard ratio based on a Cox regression analysis of time to first diagnosis of endpoint 1. The Cox model contained one indicator variable for treatment group. To investigate the potential effect of variable follow-up times, we also did this analysis with a predefined cutoff of 2 years after vaccination. Analysis of endpoint 1 also included time (months) to initial tuberculosis diagnosis from day of vaccination in each treatment group with the Kaplan-Meier estimate of the survival function by treatment group, and the exact binomial method to estimate vaccine efficacy and its corresponding 95% CI (Clopper-Pearson with mid-p adjustment) conditional on the total number of events. We included participants with more than one diagnosis (eg, a diagnosis of tuberculosis endpoint 2 that was subsequently diagnosed as endpoint 1) in analyses separately for each diagnostic level. For the analysis of secondary and exploratory efficacy endpoints, no adjustment for multiplicity was done. We regarded a two-sided p value of less than 0&#x000b7;05 as significant. Summaries were presented for all cases reported during the study, and also, all cases with a diagnosis during the first 2 years of individual follow-up.</p><p>For efficacy analyses, we based the sample size calculation on the primary efficacy endpoint of tuberculosis (endpoint 1). We assumed a cumulative tuberculosis incidence of 3% after a median of 18 months' follow-up in the placebo group,<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> with an estimated 7&#x000b7;5% loss to follow-up.<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> Thus, 1392 participants per intervention group would provide a 90% chance of detection of a 60% reduction between the intervention and control groups based on a two-sided log-rank test at a significance level of 0&#x000b7;05. We implemented a 6 month extension to the planned follow-up to achieve the target case accrual.</p><p>For safety analyses, the sample size of 1392 participants receiving MVA85A would provide a greater than 75% chance of observing an adverse event that had an approximately one in 1000 actual rate of occurrence.</p><p>The trial was registered with the South African National Clinical Trials Register on Nov, 4, 2008 (DOH-27-0109-2654), and with <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov" id="interref3">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> on July 31, 2009, number <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="ctgov:NCT00953927" id="interref4">NCT00953927</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec id="cesec70"><title>Role of the funding source</title><p>Aeras was the trial sponsor.

During follow-up, 510 (37%) of 1395 recipients of placebo and 507 (36%) of 1399 recipients of MVA85A were admitted to the study ward for investigation.</p><p>MVA85A induced an Ag85-specific T-cell response as measured by ex-vivo interferon &#x003b3; enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (median 136 spot-forming cells per million PBMCs, IQR 87&#x02013;362; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">figure 2</xref>).

Frequencies of antigen-specific Th1 cells observed in infants with MVA85A were up to a tenth of the frequencies noted in adults.<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></p><p>Our efficacy trial was undertaken in infants. However, this group is not responsible for most transmission of <italic>M tuberculosis</italic>. Thus, MVA85A could potentially protect adolescents or adults against pulmonary tuberculosis, in view of the fact that immunologically immature infants do not respond as well to this vaccine as adults do. MVA85A could also potentially have high efficacy in people of all ages against severe forms of tuberculosis, including pulmonary tuberculosis, without preventing infection or mild forms of disease. A high efficacy against severe disease could be masked in a trial that predominantly detects mild forms of tuberculosis. The sample size of a trial powered to detect only severe or disseminated disease would be prohibitively large. The safety and immunogenicity of MVA85A alone in infants exposed to HIV is currently being assessed.<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> BCG-specific Th1 and Th17 responses were recently shown not to correlate with risk of tuberculosis in infants after BCG vaccination.<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> Whether a substantially greater magnitude of response, a response that is qualitatively different, or a completely new immunological response would be necessary for protection is unclear. In our study, frequencies of BCG-primed Ag85A-specific T cells detected before MVA85A vaccination were very low or undetectable (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">figure 2</xref>). Conversely, adults and adolescents have significantly higher Ag85A-specific responses before vaccination,<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> which might be an important factor in the stronger responses induced by MVA85A in older individuals. MVA85A was designed to boost BCG-primed responses, and the low frequencies of BCG-induced cells in infants might restrict the immunogenicity, and potentially the efficacy, of MVA85A in this age group. Ongoing assessment of study samples for potential correlates of risk might also yield important insights into why MVA85A did not confer protection in this trial and could add to the design and assessment of the next generation of tuberculosis vaccine candidates. Identification of immune correlates of protection would greatly aid vaccine design and assessment. However such correlates can only be identified in trials in which efficacy was shown. Identification and optimisation of animal models that accurately predict efficacy in human beings is also needed. Other efficacy trials of new HIV and malaria vaccines have reported early but waning efficacy.<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> In this trial, a post-hoc analysis of distribution of case accrual in the first year suggested a possible early effect on disease that merits further study of route of administration, regimen, and dosing strategies with MVA85A and other vaccines.</p><p>Despite concerns about potential immunopathology induced by new tuberculosis vaccines,<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> we noted no evidence for this effect. The high incidence of respiratory and gastrointestinal serious adverse events recorded in this trial reflects the known burden of childhood morbidity in this community.<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> High numbers of unrelated serious adverse events should be expected in clinical trials in infant populations in developing countries.

The overall safety profile supports modified Vaccinia Ankara virus as a suitable vector for infant vaccination strategies.</p><p>The high incidence of disease noted in our study was comparable to the high rates noted in previous trials.<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> We noted no confirmed cases of disseminated tuberculosis (two cases of tuberculous meningitis met the definition for endpoint 2) and no deaths from tuberculosis, supporting our previous observation that disseminated and severe tuberculosis are uncommon in a setting of modern trials with active surveillance, effective isoniazid prophylaxis, and effective anti-tuberculous treatment.<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> The high overall rate of <italic>M tuberculosis</italic> infection noted in this trial (349 [13%] of 2792) suggests a high level of exposure and transmission in this community. This infection burden suggests that <italic>M tuberculosis</italic> infection might be a suitable endpoint for future trials of new tuberculosis vaccines that aim to prevent infection and subsequent disease. Because BCG is regarded as less effective for prevention of infection than prevention of disease, our finding that MVA85A did not prevent infection is unsurprising and should be interpreted separately from the findings about efficacy against disease. We recognise that QFT has not been validated as a diagnostic test for <italic>M tuberculosis</italic> infection in infants and young children; however, a previous study<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> done by our group showed good correlation between QFT and the tuberculin skin test.</p><p>Our study showed that a large efficacy trial of a new tuberculosis vaccine in a high-burden setting is feasible with a stringent and objective case definition that incorporated the primary elements proposed in a recent consensus statement.<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref> We have also shown that standardised investigation for tuberculosis with multiple respiratory sampling, microbiological confirmation of disease, and masked expert panel review of digital radiograph images is feasible in a developing country setting where tuberculosis vaccine efficacy trials are likely to be done. We recognise that there is no gold standard definition of childhood tuberculosis,<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33</sup></xref> but we believe that the hierarchal endpoint definition used in this trial is robust and might be suitable for future tuberculosis vaccine trials.</p><p>Cohort retention was very high in this trial, and no evidence was noted that the rate of loss to follow-up had a differential effect on case accrual. Similarly, exclusion of three enrolled infants in the per-protocol analysis did not affect the results.</p><p>In conclusion, MVA85A was well tolerated, modestly immunogenic but unable to confer significant protection against tuberculosis or <italic>M tuberculosis</italic> infection. The information gained from the successful execution of this study will aid the planning of future trials and vaccination strategies. Substantial global efforts to develop an improved vaccine against tuberculosis must continue.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="bibl10"><title>References</title><ref

However the absence of efficacy noted, despite studies in animals suggesting potential for efficacy and evidence of immunogenicity in previous clinical trials, was unexpected and suggests that the present parameters for selection of tuberculosis vaccine candidates might be inadequate. The relatively weak immunogenicity we noted in this study makes it difficult to conclude whether a higher magnitude response (ie, one that is qualitatively different or a completely new immunological mechanism) will be required for a protective vaccine. Lessons learnt from this trial, including trial design, execution, and vaccine selection, will be of enormous importance to the broader specialty of vaccine development.</p></boxed-text></floats-group></article>
