Participants were recruited from primary care, as general practitioners (GPs) usually serve as the first point of contact in healthcare. Patients in this setting often need initial information on their health problem and treatment options, which can be provided in PIMs. Academic training practices, practices in cooperating networks and publicly registered GPs in the areas of Freiburg, Hamburg, Oberhausen-M&#x000fc;lheim-Duisburg and Leipzig were invited to participate in the study.</p><p>Further information can be found in the published study protocol<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> and the study registration at the German Register for Clinical Trials (DRKS00004241).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Inclusion and exclusion criteria</title><p>Adult primary care patients with a Turkish, Polish, Russian or Italian migration background, and with indications of unipolar depressive disorder (International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10): codes F32.xx, F33.xx, F34.1) or non-specific chronic low back pain (ICD-10 codes: M54.5, M54.8, M54.9), based on clinical diagnosis, were eligible for inclusion in our randomised trial.

<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> To be eligible, patients had to identify themselves with their non-German origin. To ensure a high external validity of the study, exclusion criteria were kept to a minimum.

<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Information on prevalence, diagnoses and prognosis, treatment options and responsibilities of different healthcare providers was given. To exclude the influence of potentially confounding factors other than culture, we focused on developing high-quality materials that were suitable for migrants based on aspects other than culture (eg, comprehensibility, length and reading level). The final brochure consisted of 12 pages, and included figures, pictures and illustrative case examples. For the control group (CG), a high-quality translation of the German version of the PIMs was administered, using the forward&#x02013;backward translation procedure.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Patients in the intervention group (IG) received the culture-sensitive PIMs, which were based on the translated version and included adaptations for the respective migration background. The adaptations were based on the results of four separate focus groups, one for each migration background.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> In these focus groups, the cultural appropriateness of the translated materials was discussed. Focus group participants had to have one of the four relevant migration backgrounds and live in Germany. They also had to be able to read and write in German and in the language of the country of their origin. The group discussions were audio recorded, transcribed, analysed using qualitative methods and adapted based on the qualitative results. Cultural adaptations primarily focused on presentation; the core information remained unchanged and patients in both groups received evidence-based information in their native language (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2016012008TB1">tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2016012008TB2">2</xref>).

Eligible patients were invited to participate by the GP and received information on the study after the consultation (&#x02212;T<sub>1</sub>, enrolment). Written informed consent was obtained by the GP. To ensure comprehensibility of the information, translated consent forms were used. GPs then handed out a sealed envelope (T<sub>0</sub>, allocation) containing the PIM and a questionnaire. By using sealed envelopes, it was ensured that both GPs and patients were blind to the group allocation. The content of the envelopes (standard translated vs culturally adapted PIMs) was centrally randomised by a computer-based algorithm with a 1:1 allocation ratio, and stratified by physician, illness and migration background with varying block sizes. The random allocation sequence was generated by the trial statistician and prepared by the research team (whose members were not directly involved in patient recruitment). Concomitant care was not restricted in any way.

Acculturation was also shown to be responsible for the aforementioned difference in effectiveness between Polish and Russian patients (the Polish patients were better acculturated than the Russian ones), turning the effect of migration background non-significant (p&#x0003e;0.10) when added to the model (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">supplementary materials</xref> for details).</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SM1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/bmjopen-2016-012008.supp1</object-id><label>Supplementary data</label><p><inline-supplementary-material id="ss1" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2016-012008supp.pdf" content-type="local-data"/></p></supplementary-material></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this trial, we investigated the effects of cultural adaptation of high-quality translations of PIMs. While both versions were rated to be of high subjective usefulness, the adapted material was judged to be significantly more useful than the translated version after reading the PIM, which was handed out by the GP after the consultation. However, this difference decreased over time and was not statistically significant after 8&#x02005;weeks or 6&#x02005;months. The initial difference was mainly driven by differences on the emotional subscale. Further effects on clinical outcomes or quality of life were not found.</p><p>A central limitation of our study is that the USE had been developed and validated in German. The translations used in this study had been conducted using the forward&#x02013;backward method and had been pilot tested by people with migration backgrounds using the think-aloud method. However, an investigation of the psychometric properties of the translated version is still lacking. Another limitation is that all outcomes were questionnaire-based and therefore subjective. However, given that GPs and patients were blinded with regard to study group, an expectation bias seems unlikely. Another limitation is the clinical heterogeneity of the sample. We decided to include patients from various migrant groups, with illness at various stages and with no restrictions relating to duration of residency in Germany. These differences may have diluted the intervention effects. Nevertheless, this heterogeneity improved the recruitment potential and is likely to have increased the external validity of the results. Similar limitations exist regarding the study intervention. Given the fact that we developed eight different versions of culture-adapted PIMs, which included versions for depression and chronic low back pain for four different migration backgrounds, the effects for some of the secondary outcomes may have been diluted. On the other hand, we used the same procedure to develop all culturally adapted materials.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> The level of comparison is therefore the effect of culturally adapted materials in patients with migration backgrounds living in Germany and suffering from a potentially chronic illness. Moderator analyses supported the assumption of functional equivalence of the intervention across migration backgrounds and illnesses, but also suggested that the superiority in usefulness of the adapted over the standard materials is likely to be substantially larger in patients with a low rather than a high level of acculturation.</p><p>The key strength of this study is the high internal and external validity. By applying a central randomisation procedure, using a computer-based algorithm with varying block sizes and by providing patients with the PIMs and questionnaire in sealed envelopes, allocation bias seems unlikely. The use of sealed envelopes, to blind patients and GPs with regard to study group allocation, was carried out to prevent performance bias. The statistician was also blind to patient group allocation when primary analysis was performed, to ensure objectivity. These measures ensured a high internal validity.</p><p>The involvement of a large number of primary care practices in four different regions of Germany, the evaluation of four migrant groups and two different illnesses, as well as the broad inclusion criteria, ensured a high external validity of the results. The dropout rate was lower than expected and a systematic dropout is unlikely. In consideration of the low rate of refusal to participate in the study and the low dropout rate, we conclude that acceptance of our intervention was high in our sample. However, we cannot conclusively determine the representativeness of our sample. The sample seems to be older and contain a higher proportion of women than the general population with a migration background.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Since patients with chronic low back pain and depression are usually older and predominantly female, these differences may be caused by the illnesses investigated and the recruitment setting. The mean duration of residency (&#x0223c;20&#x02005;years) is not unusual for people with a migration background in Germany.</p><p>Our study adds new insight to the importance of cultural sensitivity in healthcare provision. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first trial to examine the effects of cultural adaptation of PIMs beyond high-quality translation. Although there is a growing literature on the effects of culture-sensitive interventions in general,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>
<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> studies have not usually been able to prevent performance bias (by blinding patients and GPs with regard to study group allocation). Moreover, language and other cultural aspects often confound interpretation. These two limitations did not apply to this trial.</p><p>Differences in usefulness of the PIMs found right after the consultation (T<sub>1</sub>) were largely consistent over different study regions, illness type, migration backgrounds and level of symptom severity, although the moderation analyses are likely to have been underpowered to a certain degree. Nevertheless, we were able to demonstrate a large and stable moderating effect of acculturation with potentially far-reaching implications. Even if the identified effect is on average rather small (Cohen's d of 0.18), the pragmatic nature of the trial and high heterogeneity of the sample and interventions should be taken into account. Under these conditions, an effect has to be quite robust to cause a detectable difference. Moreover, the comparator (ie, the high-quality translation) should be considered an active control, which may additionally limit the size of the effect detected. In addition, the migrant groups in our study had a long history of migration and cultural exchange. Indeed, most of the patients in our sample had been living in Germany for nearly two decades, which may also have limited the size of the effects observed. The superiority of culturally adapting patient information materials is very likely to be considerably larger in patients with a lower level of acculturation, as suggested by our moderator analyses. Differences in usefulness of the PIMs diminished over time (T<sub>2</sub>, T<sub>3</sub>), which is probably caused by a decrease in intervention effect over time. We did not detect any effect on symptom severity or quality of life. Written PIMs are a useful adjunct to physician consultation and advice, and translation of PIMs is often the first step towards achieving culture-sensitive healthcare.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Our study has important practical implications, as we found reliable evidence that cultural adaptation of PIMs, compared with only high-quality translation, has additional benefits. The cost of adaptation, per PIM, was about &#x020ac;7500 in our study. Since PIMs can easily be reprinted and distributed, the costs of adaptation are marginal when produced in high print runs. Given the high potential to reach large numbers of patients at low cost, even a small effect may be clinically significant. Cultural adaptation should therefore be considered as a possible option to improve quality when developing PIMs for migrants, and clinicians should be encouraged to use them in their consultations, especially for migrants with low levels of acculturation.</p><p>Since we did not standardise the oral consultation, it seems highly likely that the effects of this face-to-face interaction masked the effect of the cultural adaptation. To detect effects of symptom severity or quality of life, a more standardised setting would probably be required. The provision of culturally adapted materials seems a promising way of improving PIMs for people with a migration background, particularly in the group of recent immigrants with low levels of acculturation.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank the physician network Qualit&#x000e4;tsnetz Oberhausener &#x000c4;rzte e.V.
