The horses were resident at the study site as part of the research herd. Other than being led into the stalls for subjective behaviour assessment one week prior to the start of the study, horses were not acclimatised to the stalls. Grass and alfalfa hay was fed ad libitum during data collection, and water was provided in buckets every 4&#x000a0;h. Wood shavings were used as bedding in the stalls. During overnight data collection herd mates were kept in adjacent paddocks in direct view of the front of the jet stalls to reduce group separation stress.

One of each gender pair of horses was randomly assigned to either a treated or untreated stall and monitored overnight in two experimental blocks of a 2&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;3 design. The first block consisted of three consecutive nights followed by a five day rest period.

These stalls avoid potential fire alarm concerns associated with air conditioning units of climate-controlled stalls, however ventilation and microclimate could be affected by application of mesh around the stalls for protection against vectors. The outside temperatures in the present study were within or lower than a guideline range for transport of horses (10&#x02013;21&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C), while the RH was higher than the recommended range (45&#x02013;50%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], as expected for the overnight study conditions. Similarly, the outside and jet stall temperatures in the present study were within or lower than corresponding cargo hold and jet stall temperature ranges reported during air transit of horses, and the outside and jet stall RH was similar or higher than reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Marked differences in study conditions and the type of jet stall utilised limit direct comparison of microclimate between the present and the cited studies, however.</p><p id="Par42">In order to better assess the impact of the mesh on microclimate, the differences computed between treated and untreated jet stall microclimate and outside climatic variables were analysed as outside conditions, which were highly correlated with those inside the jet stalls, varied daily making comparisons of differences more appropriate than actual values [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. In the present study, while the temperature in the treated stall was consistently higher than the outside temperature, likely associated with retention of metabolic heat produced by the horses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] and low overnight outside temperatures, the treated stall/ outside temperature difference was only significantly higher than untreated stall/ outside difference at one time point. The difference between the treated stall/ outside RH also did not differ significantly from the untreated stall/ outside RH. In fact, the treated stall RH was consistently lower than the outside RH despite anticipated evaporative heat loss which would be expected to increase RH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. These findings support no increased risk to thermoregulation with application of the HDPE mesh to a jet stall as compared to an untreated stall under similar climatic conditions.</p><p id="Par43">While a thermal index limit of 28&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C is specified for equine competition there is currently no defined value to prevent equine thermal stress during equine transport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] and further research has been recommended to improve thermal environment and ventilation of equine transport systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. In the absence of data under more extreme environmental conditions for similar jet stalls protected with HDPE mesh, opening of the mesh flaps adjacent to stall ventilation points (e.g. above the front and back ramps) to promote ventilation is recommended as a precautionary measure if hot or humid environmental conditions arise during the transport process, such as during stopovers with exposure to ambient air [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Opening the mesh of stalls located at the rear of an aircraft first is recommended based on the temperature and RH gradient in the cargo hold whereby the stalls at the rear experience warmer, moister conditions, especially when the aircraft is stationary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Furthermore, it is recommended that jet stall microclimate be monitored regularly during the transport process, particularly under more extreme environmental conditions when mesh protection is used. As emergency opening of the mesh to promote ventilation could increase risk of exposure to AHSV vectors, additional methods of protection such as insecticides or repellents applied to horses in the stalls or insecticidal aerosols sprayed in the cargo hold is advised.</p><p id="Par44">Overnight housing in the treated jet stall had no significant effect on clinical variables compared to housing in an untreated stall. Horses were assessed under stationary jet stall field conditions in the present study which precluded confounding factors associated with air transport, such as loading into the aircraft, take off, turbulence, landing and unloading. Increased heart rates have been reported during these transitional events with return to resting values during level flight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].

In contrast to monitoring of adrenocortical function by measurement of plasma and salivary cortisol, which reflect acute changes in cortisol release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], FGM concentrations reflect only marked or prolonged increases in cortisol release with a lag time of about 24&#x000a0;h related to species-specific intestinal passage time in horses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In the present study, which was limited to investigating the effects of stationary housing in a jet stall, no significant difference from baseline was detected in FGM concentrations, neither was there a significant difference between treatment groups. These findings, which are supported by the clinical variable data, indicate that stationary housing in an untreated jet stall or one protected with alphacypermethrin-treated HDPE mesh under temperate climate conditions is not associated with a significant stress response in horses. The earlier and higher peak in FGM concentrations for horses housed in the treated stall warrants further investigation in a larger cohort, however, but may be associated with other factors, e.g. mesh-associated impaired visual contact with herd mates compounding a herd group disruption effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p id="Par46">Although caution is advised in practical application of the study findings based on the recognised study limitations including a stationary jet stall investigated under temperate field conditions, relatively low number of horses of varying breed, age, gender and temperament enrolled, and lack of a control group not housed in a jet stall, the findings support the safety of the HDPE mesh applied to comparable jet stalls under similar climatic conditions. Other meshes shown to protect housed horses against biting midges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] could be investigated in a similar fashion.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par47">Alphacypermethrin-treated HDPE mesh applied to jet stalls housing horses had no adverse effect on jet stall microclimate, clinical variables or stress indicators of horses housed in the stalls under temperate climatic conditions.
