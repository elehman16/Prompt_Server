</p><p>The current study examined the impact of increased gastric pH on systemic exposure to evacetrapib, whose solubility is pH dependent.

The treatment of healthy subjects with omeprazole likened the gastric environment to that of conditions similar to others with achlorhydria (Table&#x000a0;S1).

Each subject participated in a screening visit, two dosing periods, and a poststudy follow&#x02010;up visit. Subjects were admitted to the clinical research unit on day 1 and remained resident until completion of period 2. In period 1, subjects received a single oral dose of evacetrapib 130&#x000a0;mg on day 1 followed by 7&#x000a0;days of pharmacokinetic sampling. In period 2, an oral dose of omeprazole 40&#x000a0;mg (Kremers Urban Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Princeton, NJ) was administered once/day on days 8&#x02013;20, with a single oral dose of evacetrapib 130&#x000a0;mg administered 2&#x000a0;hours after the omeprazole dose on day 14. Omeprazole 20&#x000a0;mg/day achieves maximal acid suppression within ~4&#x000a0;days,<xref rid="phar1778-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">11</xref> and the effect of a 40&#x02010;mg dose was expected to follow a similar time course. Therefore, the second dose of evacetrapib was administered 6&#x000a0;days after the first omeprazole dose to ensure that subjects had attained maximal suppression of gastric acid secretion. Subjects were discharged on day 21 and returned for a follow&#x02010;up visit at least 14&#x000a0;days after the last dose of evacetrapib in period 2.</p></sec><sec id="phar1778-sec-0011"><title>Subjects</title><p>Eligible subjects included healthy men and women not of childbearing potential, 18&#x02013;65&#x000a0;years of age, with a body mass index of 18.0&#x02013;32.0&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>.

The ZepHr recorder was set up and calibrated according to the manufacturer's instructions. Then the recorder and probe were connected to the AirFLOW Sphincter Locator, and the sphincter locator was pumped up to ~7.5 psi. The nasogastric probe was then inserted to ~60&#x000a0;cm so that the probe's infusion port was below the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) and in the stomach. Pressure on the recorder screen was set to zero. The probe was then pulled back in 1&#x02010;cm increments while observing the pressure and pH on the recorder screen. As the locator infusion port entered the LES, there would be an increase in pressure to a two&#x02010;digit positive number. After identifying the high pressure of the LES, the probe was advanced ~5&#x000a0;cm so the pH sensor was positioned ~10&#x000a0;cm below the LES. The probe was taped in position, and pH was recorded for ~15&#x000a0;minutes prior to administration of evacetrapib on days 1 and 14.</p></sec><sec id="phar1778-sec-0013"><title>Bioanalysis and Pharmacokinetic Assessments</title><p>Blood samples were collected for pharmacokinetic analysis of evacetrapib before and 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, and 168&#x000a0;hours after the evacetrapib doses were given on days 1 and 14. Plasma samples were analyzed for evacetrapib by using a validated liquid chromatography with the tandem mass spectrometric method at Covance Laboratories Inc. (Madison, WI). The lower and upper limits of quantification were 1.00 and 1000&#x000a0;ng/ml, respectively. The interassay accuracy, defined as the closeness of the mean value obtained by the method to the actual nominal value of the analyte and expressed as a percent, ranged from &#x02212;2.9 to 1.5% during validation. The interassay precision, defined as the closeness of repeated individual measures of the analyte and expressed as the coefficient of variation, ranged from 2.9 to 6.4% during validation. Both precision and accuracy measures met the predefined acceptance criteria consistent with regulatory guidances,<xref rid="phar1778-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">14</xref>, <xref rid="phar1778-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref> thus confirming the robustness of the bioanalytical assay.</p><p>The potential for omeprazole to interfere with evacetrapib in the bioanalytical assay was assessed at an omeprazole concentration of 650&#x000a0;ng/ml. There was no significant interference in the chromatographic regions of interest for evacetrapib, indicating that the evacetrapib method had acceptable selectivity in the presence of omeprazole.</p><p>Pharmacokinetic parameter estimates for evacetrapib were calculated by using standard noncompartmental methods of analysis using WinNonlin software, v.6.2.1 (Pharsight Corp., Mountain View, CA). The primary parameters for analysis were area under the concentration versus time curve (AUC) from time zero to the last time point with a measurable concentration (AUC<sub>0&#x02013;tlast</sub>); AUC from time zero extrapolated to infinity (AUC<sub>0&#x02013;&#x0221e;</sub>); maximum observed drug concentration (C<sub>max</sub>); and the time to reach maximum concentration (T<sub>max</sub>). The AUC was calculated by using a combination of the linear and logarithmic trapezoidal methods (linear&#x02010;log trapezoidal rule). The linear trapezoidal method was applied up to T<sub>max</sub>, and then the logarithmic trapezoidal method was used after T<sub>max</sub>. The minimum requirement for the calculation of AUC was the inclusion of at least three consecutive plasma concentrations above the lower level of quantitation, with at least one of these concentrations following C<sub>max</sub>. The C<sub>max</sub> and T<sub>max</sub> were reported from visual inspection of the concentration versus time curve. The apparent terminal elimination half&#x02010;life (t<sub>1/2</sub>), apparent clearance, and apparent volume of distribution during the terminal phase were also estimated. The t<sub>1/2</sub> was calculated, when appropriate, based on the apparent terminal log&#x02010;linear portion of the concentration&#x02013;time curve. The start of the terminal elimination phase for each subject was determined by visual inspection and generally was the first point at which there was no systematic deviation from the log&#x02010;linear decline in plasma concentrations. The t<sub>1/2</sub> was estimated only when at least three concentrations were available for its calculation in the terminal phase. Descriptive statistics, including geometric mean and coefficient of variation (CV), were calculated.</p></sec><sec id="phar1778-sec-0014"><title>Safety Assessments</title><p>Safety was assessed by monitoring treatment&#x02010;emergent adverse events, physical examinations, vital sign measurements, 12&#x02010;lead electrocardiograms (ECGs), and clinical laboratory evaluations.

There were no clinically meaningful findings in safety assessments from clinical laboratory parameters, vital sign measurements, or 12&#x02010;lead safety ECGs for individual subjects during the study that were considered related to the study drugs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="phar1778-sec-0023"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study determined the effect of increased gastric pH on the pharmacokinetics of evacetrapib in healthy subjects. Seven doses of omeprazole 40&#x000a0;mg once/day increased mean gastric pH values across all subjects by 2.80 and increased the geometric LS mean AUC<sub>0&#x02013;&#x0221e;</sub> and C<sub>max</sub> of evacetrapib by 15% and 30%, respectively. Given the range of the 90% CIs for AUC<sub>0&#x02013;&#x0221e;</sub> and C<sub>max</sub>, the magnitudes of these increases are comparable. For both pharmacokinetic parameters, the upper bound of the 90% CI of the ratio of geometric LS means exceeded 1.25 but was less than 2, indicating a weak interaction according to U.S. Food and Drug Administration guidance.<xref rid="phar1778-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">17</xref>
</p><p>The study's objective was to determine the effect of increased gastric pH on the pharmacokinetics of evacetrapib, not to determine the specific effect of concomitant omeprazole treatment on evacetrapib's pharmacokinetics. Omeprazole was the tool used to increase gastric pH, but because omeprazole did not accomplish this in every subject, it diluted the effect of omeprazole in the analysis across all subjects that included the subjects who did respond. To better evaluate the objective, given the poor response to omeprazole in some subjects, a subgroup analysis was conducted that included only the 22 subjects whose gastric pH was 3.0 or lower on day 1 and 4.0 or higher on day 14. By these criteria, each subject in the analysis had a pH increase of at least 1.0, and, in fact, the analysis included all subjects who had a pH increase of at least 1.0 except for one subject, whose pH increased from 6.1 at baseline to 7.3 on omeprazole. In this subpopulation, mean gastric pH increased by 4.15 during 7&#x000a0;days of omeprazole treatment, and geometric LS mean AUC<sub>0&#x02013;&#x0221e;</sub> and C<sub>max</sub> of evacetrapib increased by 22% and 35%, respectively. These increases were similar to the respective 15% and 30% increases across all subjects, which indicates that the analysis across all subjects was not significantly influenced by including subjects who did not respond well to omeprazole. Despite the small mathematical differences in the two analysis groups, the overall effect is a minimal increase in evacetrapib exposure.</p><p>Several steps were taken to determine accurate gastric pH measurements for individual subjects during the study. After positioning the probe using the AirFLOW Sphincter Locator, gastric pH measurements were collected using the ZepHr Monitoring System and averaged over 15&#x000a0;minutes. This system is used clinically for measuring pH in the lower esophagus during gastric reflux episodes, and it was adapted in this study to measure pH in the stomach. The ZepHr System uses a thin flexible probe that is more comfortable and less likely to coil compared with standard nasogastric tubes often used for monitoring gastric pH. To ensure that pH measurements were being collected in the stomach, a three&#x02010;tiered approach was used to confirm placement of the probe. First, the sphincter locator allowed identification of increased pressure at the LES so that the pH probe could be positioned about 10&#x000a0;cm below it, well into the stomach. Although positioning the pH probe using the AirFLOW Sphincter Locator takes slightly longer, it did not appear to cause additional discomfort to the subjects. Second, the pH gradient from the esophagus to the stomach was assessed on the recorder as the device was inserted. The pH gradient was most obvious in period 1 but was still present after 7&#x000a0;days of omeprazole administration in period 2. Lastly, the length of the pH probe at the nose was recorded for each subject at the time of pH recording in each period. The probe length at the nose after insertion in period 2 was compared with that of period 1 because this is unlikely to change significantly for individual subjects if the probe is placed similarly. Using these three methods to confirm proper placement into the stomach ensured that valid pH measurements were recorded for both periods.</p><p>Subjects were kept at the clinical research unit for the duration of the study to ensure compliance with study restrictions and dose administration. While in the clinical research unit, subjects were given standardized meals and were fasted prior to pH measurements and evacetrapib dosing to minimize any effect of dietary variations between treatments. The recommended dose of omeprazole 20&#x000a0;mg once/day achieves maximal acid suppression within about 4&#x000a0;days, and the 40&#x02010;mg omeprazole dose used in this study was expected to have a similar effect. Therefore, the evacetrapib dose administered on day 14 after the seventh dose of omeprazole was given after maximal suppression of gastric acid secretion had been attained.</p></sec><sec id="phar1778-sec-0024"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Increased gastric pH during treatment with omeprazole 40&#x000a0;mg once/day increased evacetrapib AUC<sub>0&#x02013;&#x0221e;</sub> and C<sub>max</sub> by 15% and 30%, respectively. For both parameters, the upper bound of the 90% CI of the ratio of geometric LS means exceeded 1.25 but was less than 2, indicating a weak interaction. The effect of increased gastric pH on evacetrapib pharmacokinetics would not be expected to be clinically relevant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data"><caption><p>
