From a neurophysiological perspective, two distinct peripheral and spinothalamic pathways have been described for itch transmission: a histaminergic pathway and a nonhistaminergic pathway mediated by protease-activated receptors (PAR)2 and 4. The nonhistaminergic itch pathway can be activated exogenously by spicules of cowhage, a tropical plant that releases a cysteine protease named mucunain that binds to and activates PAR2 and PAR4.</p></sec><sec><title>Purpose</title><p>This study was conducted to assess the antipruritic effect of a novel over-the-counter (OTC) steroid-free topical hydrogel formulation, TriCalm<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, in reducing itch intensity and duration, when itch was induced with cowhage, and compared it with two other commonly used OTC anti-itch drugs.</p></sec><sec><title>Study participants and methods</title><p>This double-blinded, vehicle-controlled, randomized, crossover study recorded itch intensity and duration in 48 healthy subjects before and after skin treatment with TriCalm hydrogel, 2% diphenhydramine, 1% hydrocortisone, and hydrogel vehicle, used as a vehicle control.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>TriCalm hydrogel significantly reduced the peak intensity and duration of cowhage-induced itch when compared to the control itch curve, and was significantly superior to the two other OTC antipruritic agents and its own vehicle in antipruritic effect. TriCalm hydrogel was eight times more effective than 1% hydrocortisone and almost six times more effective than 2% diphenhydramine in antipruritic action, as evaluated by the reduction of area under the curve.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>TriCalm hydrogel has a robust antipruritic effect against nonhistaminergic pruritus induced via the PAR2 pathway, and therefore it could represent a promising treatment option for itch.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>antipruritic treatment</kwd><kwd>nonhistaminergic pruritus</kwd><kwd>head-to-head comparison</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Itch has been reported as the most frequent complaint in the dermatology clinic.<xref rid="b1-ccid-8-223" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> In 1660, Hafenreffer defined itch as an &#x0201c;unpleasant sensation that elicits the desire or reflex to scratch.&#x0201d;<xref rid="b2-ccid-8-223" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> For a long time, the neural mechanisms underlying the transmission of itch remained elusive. In the last decade, the pathophysiology of itch has been intensively investigated and significant progress has been made in understanding its cellular and molecular mechanisms. Itch is classified as acute or chronic. According to the International Forum for the Study of Itch, acute pruritus is defined as an itch lasting less than 6 weeks, while chronic pruritus is an itch persisting for 6 or more weeks.<xref rid="b1-ccid-8-223" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b3-ccid-8-223" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Chronic itch is a complex multifactorial phenomenon that may arise primarily from skin diseases, such as atopic dermatitis or psoriasis, but it is not confined solely to dermatological conditions.<xref rid="b1-ccid-8-223" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b4-ccid-8-223" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Pruritus is associated with a marked reduction in quality of life and has been reported to be as debilitating as chronic pain.<xref rid="b5-ccid-8-223" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b8-ccid-8-223" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> If left untreated, pruritus can lead to skin damage through the self-perpetuating, counterproductive itch&#x02013;scratch cycle, and to severe sleep impairment, mood disturbances, and poorer performance at work and/or school.<xref rid="b9-ccid-8-223" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Unfortunately, pruritus is particularly difficult to treat. To date, there are no target-specific treatments available for itch, and antipruritic therapies are only somewhat effective, since they do not always successfully address the underlying cause.<xref rid="b1-ccid-8-223" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b9-ccid-8-223" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Currently, the medications used to treat itch include antihistamines, opioid receptor agonists or antagonists, corticosteroids, and in severe cases, antidepressants. These agents provide some degree of itch relief; however, no complete resolution is attained in most cases.<xref rid="b10-ccid-8-223" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Corticosteroid therapy may be effective, but its use is limited due to its dose- and time-dependent side effects, including risk of adrenal axis suppression, skin atrophy, tachyphylaxis, striae, rosacea-like symptoms, perioral dermatitis, acne, and purpura.<xref rid="b11-ccid-8-223" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b14-ccid-8-223" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> According to expert opinion, new substances and classes of antipruritic drugs are needed urgently.<xref rid="b10-ccid-8-223" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p><p>It has become increasingly clear that current antihistamines, which are of benefit in treating itch of allergic causes (such as immediate hypersensitivity reactions), are mostly ineffective in controlling the itch associated with diseases such as atopic eczema or psoriasis.<xref rid="b15-ccid-8-223" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="b16-ccid-8-223" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> This suggests that nonhistaminergic mechanisms are predominantly involved in pruritus. Current neurobiological models of itch transmission recognize the existence of distinct peripheral and central neural pathways that transduce histamine-based and nonhistamine-based forms of itch.<xref rid="b15-ccid-8-223" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b19-ccid-8-223" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></p><p>One of the nonhistaminergic pathways that has been elucidated recently is the cowhage itch pathway.<xref rid="b20-ccid-8-223" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> As postulated from the pioneering work of Shelley and Arthur almost 60 years ago,<xref rid="b21-ccid-8-223" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> the cowhage plant releases a cysteine protease named mucunain, which binds to and activates protease-activated receptors PAR2 and PAR4.<xref rid="b20-ccid-8-223" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> The PAR2&#x02013;mediated itch pathway has been implicated in the pathophysiology of pruritus in atopic eczema.<xref rid="b19-ccid-8-223" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="b22-ccid-8-223" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Therefore, cowhage itch has been proposed as a valuable experimental model for itch in humans.<xref rid="b23-ccid-8-223" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b26-ccid-8-223" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> The cowhage itch model, using cowhage spicules, has been employed to study the efficacy of various topical antipruritic formulations.<xref rid="b26-ccid-8-223" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b28-ccid-8-223" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> In a study performed in healthy subjects, as well as in patients with atopic dermatitis, we have demonstrated that, in comparison with the classical model using histamine, cowhage itch is a robust, reliable, and reproducible experimental model that is highly effective to induce an acute and transient itch.<xref rid="b23-ccid-8-223" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Typically, after the application of spicules, cowhage itch has an onset time of about 30&#x02013;90 seconds, peaks after 90&#x02013;120 seconds, and lasts for approximately 6&#x02013;8 minutes. In a previous study, we utilized cowhage itch to compare the antipruritic efficacy of TriCalm<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> hydrogel with two other antipruritic topical agents: 2% diphenhydramine and 1% hydrocortisone.<xref rid="b26-ccid-8-223" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></p><p>This study was conducted to test the antipruritic effect of the steroid-free topical hydrogel formulation, TriCalm hydrogel, in reducing itch intensity and duration, when itch was induced with cowhage spicules. TriCalm hydrogel is an over-the-counter (OTC) topical formulation designed to alleviate skin irritation (itching, burning, or stinging sensations). We compared the ability of this topical agent to relieve skin irritation (its antipruritic efficacy) with topical 2% diphenhydramine and 1% hydrocortisone, and with its own hydrogel vehicle.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec sec-type="methods|subjects"><title>Study design and subjects</title><p>This study employed a double-blinded, vehicle-controlled, randomized, crossover design. Adult men and women between 18 and 50 years of age were included in this study if they were in general good health and had no disease that could impair evaluation of itch or pain perception (such as peripheral neuropathy). The exclusion criteria included current or recent use (within 1 week prior to study initiation) of oral or topical analgesics (such as antihistamines, opioids, and neuroleptics) or other medications known to interfere with itch or pain perception; use of emollients on the forearms on the day of the study, or use of medicated topical preparations on the forearms for the week prior to the study; history of neuropathy-causing diseases, such as uremia; history of uncontrolled thyroid disease; uncontrolled diabetes mellitus or diabetic neuropathy; and allergy to any of the study medications.</p><p>The study was performed in accordance with the current version of the Declaration of Helsinki (52nd WMA General Assembly, Edinburgh, Scotland, 2000). The trial was conducted in agreement with the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines on Good Clinical Practices (GCP). All subjects provided written informed consent to participate in the study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="intro|methods|subjects"><title>Demographics and characteristics of study participants</title><p>Forty-eight subjects, including 20 men and 28 women between 19 and 50 years of age (mean &#x000b1; standard deviation: 35.0&#x000b1;10.1 years) were tested. Of a total of 49 subjects screened, one participant did not fulfill study criteria. Subjects were free to withdraw from the study at any time without giving a reason; however, no subjects withdrew from the study. The results were analyzed in 47 healthy subjects, as one data set from one subject was not included in the analysis due to an exceedingly atypical, prolonged itch response (in excess of 40 minutes).</p></sec><sec><title>Cowhage itch induction</title><p>Itch was induced by the application of 40&#x02013;45 cowhage spicules, which were counted under a magnifying lens and then were rubbed into the subject&#x02019;s skin by a study investigator, as we described previously.<xref rid="b23-ccid-8-223" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> The spicules were rubbed gently in a circular motion within a 16 cm<sup>2</sup> square area of skin, for 45 seconds. A sterile gauze perforated in a rectangular shape matching the 4&#x000d7;4 cm treatment area was used to cover the surrounding skin and prevent the spicules from stimulating the skin outside the designated area. At the conclusion of each experiment, when itch had subsided, the spicules were removed using adhesive tape (Scotch<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>; 3M, St Paul, MN, USA).</p></sec><sec><title>Antipruritic agents tested</title><p>Treatments administered consisted of TriCalm hydrogel; hydrogel vehicle of TriCalm; 2% diphenhydramine; and Cortizone-10<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, containing 1% hydrocortisone. TriCalm hydrogel is an OTC product manufactured by Cosmederm Bioscience, Inc. (San Diego, CA, USA) containing as the active ingredient aluminum acetate 0.2%. Cortizone-10 (Rite Aid, Camp Hill, PA, USA) was purchased as an OTC product from a local Rite Aid pharmacy. A lotion containing 2% diphenhydramine was compounded by La Vita Pharmacy (San Diego, CA, USA) to avoid the alcohols used in the formulation of a commercially available OTC Benadryl<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (diphenhydramine), and other, flavored, ingredients such as menthol, that could affect the &#x0201c;blinding&#x0201d; process and may have interfered with the study&#x02019;s outcome (since these ingredients are counterirritants that can have an effect on itch perception). A pretreatment design was used, ie, topical agents were applied to the skin and left in place for 15 minutes prior to itch induction in order to minimize differences in penetration rates and pharmacokinetics for the agents tested.</p></sec><sec><title>Application of cowhage spicules and topical antipruritic agents</title><p>Cowhage spicules and topical antipruritic agents were applied in the following sequence. First, itch was induced with cowhage as a control in the absence of any treatment, on the upper side of the volar aspect of the right forearm, on a 16 cm<sup>2</sup> (4&#x000d7;4 cm) square area. Then, randomized applications of topical 2% diphenhydramine, 1% hydrocortisone, TriCalm hydrogel, and hydrogel vehicle were performed on four other rectangular areas of the same size, two each on the right and left forearms. After 15 minutes of pretreatment with the test agents, the excess (unabsorbed) amount was removed using a paper towel. Cowhage spicules were subsequently applied in the same fashion as for the control, in four distinct experiments. The assignment of treatment on the four skin areas followed the crossover randomization scheme known as the Williams single, wherein the four sequences of applications were repeated in every four subjects in such a way that every test site received a topical agent just once, and the order of application was changed for the next participant, with a repetition period of 4. This design was selected to avoid order effects and a potential pairing selection bias of the same test area with the same agent. Each experiment using a different topical agent was separated from the subsequent one by a break of 20 minutes, counted from the moment when itch subsided in the previous step.</p><p>Cowhage itch was recorded for its full duration (in seconds) until it resolved completely. The starting point (t<sub>0</sub>) for collection of ratings coincided with the moment when cowhage application was stopped. Using a numerical 10 cm visual analog scale (VAS), from 0 (no itch) to 10 (maximum unbearable itch), itch intensity was assessed every 15 seconds until itch sensation had completely subsided for all conditions. Spicules were left in place until experiments were concluded and itch ratings completely and stably returned to 0 (until three consecutive zeros were recorded). Area under the curve (AUC) was calculated from the temporal profile curves of itch ratings as a function of time.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All statistical analyses were performed using PASW<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> 18.0 software (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) with statistical significance threshold set at <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05. The peak VAS itch ratings, AUC, and the overall duration for each treatment arm and the cowhage itch control were compared using a mixed model and were post hoc corrected by the Bonferroni method.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Effect of treatments on peak itch intensity, itch duration, and total itch perceived (AUC)</title><p>Data were obtained from the cowhage itch arm alone in the absence of any treatment (control) and with TriCalm hydrogel, topical 2% diphenhydramine, 1% hydrocortisone, and hydrogel vehicle on four other rectangular areas of the same size, two each on the right and left forearms.
