Vildagliptin achieves prolong and almost complete DPP-4 inhibition, resulting in the extension of meal induced increases in GLP-1 and gastric inhibitory peptide over 24 hours. GLP-1 and gastric inhibitory peptide increase the sensitivity of the &#x003b1;- and &#x003b2;-cells to glucose, which is accepted as their major mechanism of action (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).</p><p>However, vildagliptin brings about changes that would not be predicted from its actions in the pancreas. It decreases postprandial triglyceride levels and decreases lipolysis as assessed in vivo by palmitate dilution more than can be accounted for by change in plasma insulin concentration (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). This could result in a decrease in liver triglyceride concentration. Vildagliptin has also been shown to increase glucose utilization, as assessed during a two-step hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp at the high insulin dose (80 mU), and this could potentially be secondary to a reduction in liver fat (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Whether hepatic lipid metabolism is specifically affected has not been examined, and there is no information on any modulation of liver triglyceride concentration.</p><p>The present randomized, placebo-controlled study was designed to examine the possible effects of vildagliptin on hepatic steatosis and insulin sensitivity. To minimize any indirect metabolic effects due to a large change in ambient plasma glucose levels, people with type 2 diabetes well controlled on metformin alone were studied.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Patients and Methods</title><sec><title>Study protocol</title><p>A single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study was conducted. Forty-four patients with type 2 diabetes and glycated hemoglobin (HbA<sub>1c</sub>) &#x02264; 7.6%, who were treated with metformin, were randomized equally to the DPP-4 inhibitor vildagliptin (50 mg twice a day) and placebo. Two patients from the vildagliptin-treated group (one with multiple myeloma, and the other with atrial fibrillation related to chest infection) and three patients from the placebo group (one with marked deterioration in glycemic control, another with metastatic prostate cancer, and a third who withdrew consent) were withdrawn. None of these events were thought to be drug related.</p><p>Each participant attended one screening visit (wk &#x02212;4; ie, 4 weeks before baseline assessments) for assessment of inclusion/exclusion criteria. Measurement of liver triglyceride and peripheral and hepatic insulin sensitivity and anthropometric tests were carried out at the Magnetic Resonance Centre on three occasions, each separated by at least 3 days. Randomization to vildagliptin or placebo was then carried out. Each person attended for eight additional visits over the 6-month period of treatment with vildagliptin 50 mg twice a day or placebo. Thereafter, measurements of liver triglyceride and peripheral insulin sensitivity and anthropometric tests were repeated. To permit judgment on the metabolic significance of any changes in liver triglyceride levels, a group of individuals with normal glucose tolerance defined by World Health Organization criteria were matched for age, weight, and sex with the randomized patients with type 2 diabetes and studied (n = 14).</p><p>The study was approved by the Newcastle and North Tyneside 2 Research Ethics Committee and was registered on the database of clinical trials (ClinicalTrials.gov, ID no. NCT01356381).</p></sec><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Subjects</title><p>Subjects with type 2 diabetes (28 males and 16 females; HbA<sub>1c</sub>, 6.4 &#x000b1; 0.1%); with a mean duration of diabetes of 5.7 &#x000b1; 0.7 years were studied. All were taking metformin and no other oral hypoglycemic agent. None were taking insulin. A group of normal glucose-tolerant subjects with no first-degree relative with diabetes, matched for age, weight, and body mass index, were recruited as controls to provide comparative data. Normal glucose tolerance was demonstrated in all control subjects by a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (mean fasting plasma glucose, 5.3 mmol/L; 2-h plasma glucose, 5.5 mmol/L). The characteristics of both groups are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>. Informed written consent was obtained from all volunteers.

Data were acquired using a three-point Dixon method (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) with three gradient-echo scans acquired with adjacent out-of-phase and in-phase echoes during a 17-second breath hold (repetition time/echo time/averages/flip angle = 50 ms/3.45, 4.60, 5.75 ms/1/5&#x000b0;). A matrix size of 160 &#x000d7; 109 and with a field view of 400&#x02013;480 mm according to volunteer size was used. The fat and water contributions of the magnetic resonance imaging signal were separated using an in-house program written in MATLAB, with the triglyceride content in the images expressed as a percentage of the total signal from fat and water in each pixel. The interscan Bland-Altman repeatability coefficient has previously been reported as 0.5% (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). The polygon tool in the imaging software Image J (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) was used to define regions of interest within the homogenous liver parenchyma on five separate slices of each scan, clearly avoiding contamination of data from blood vessels, the gall bladder, or any peripheral tissue so that regions of interest solely represented intrahepatic triglyceride. The five slice measurements were then averaged.</p></sec><sec><title>Euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp and endogenous glucose production</title><p>On the patient's arrival at the study center, an 18-gauge cannula was inserted into a wrist or hand vein. This hand was placed in a hand-warming device and heated to 55&#x000b0;C to achieve arterialization of the venous blood samples. A second cannula was inserted into the antecubital vein of the contralateral arm for infusion of [6&#x02032;6&#x02032;-<sup>2</sup>H] glucose (98% enriched; Cambridge Isotope Laboratories). Basal hepatic glucose production (HGP) was calculated during the last 30 minutes of the basal period (&#x02212;180 to 0 min), and clamp HGP was calculated during the final 30 minutes of the clamp period (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Plasma glucose was clamped at 5.5 mmol with an insulin infusion rate of 40 mU m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, and whole-body insulin sensitivity was determined during the last 30 minutes of the 180-minute clamp (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). To prevent marked fluctuations in plasma [6&#x02032;6&#x02032;-<sup>2</sup>H] glucose atom percentage excess, glucose clamping was carried out using 10% dextrose enriched with the isotope as previously reported (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Whole-body glucose and lipid oxidation was measured before and between 120 and 150 minutes of the clamp using a Quark RMR indirect calorimeter (Cosmed). The equations upon which the calculations are based are not made available by the manufacturer and, although in widespread use, may be subject to error. Protein oxidation was calculated using previously validated assumptions and was not measured (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>).

The repeatability of the Bodystat 1500 machine was assessed for a single volunteer on 10 different occasions. The intraindividual coefficient of variation was 6.0%. Waist and hip circumferences were measured with a nondistensible tape measure with subjects in a relaxed standing position. The waist was defined as the midpoint between the lower edge of the rib cage superiorly and the anterior superior iliac spine inferiorly. The hip circumference was taken to be at the level of the greater trochanter.

Although the patient group was selected to have well-controlled type 2 diabetes and the change in plasma glucose levels was expected to be modest, HbA<sub>1c</sub> fell from an average of 6.5 to 6.0% in the group receiving vildagliptin. However, there was no change in insulin sensitivity as assessed by the euglycemic (5.5 mmol/L) hyperinsulinemic (40 mU insulin min<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) clamp.</p><p>The mechanism underlying both the discovery and development of DPP-4 inhibitors was the GLP-1-mediated enhancement of pancreatic islet function (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). The GLP-1-mediated action brings about increased sensitivity of both &#x003b1;- and &#x003b2;-cells to glucose. However, vildagliptin has been observed to cause changes that suggest additional metabolic effects. Specifically, the rate of appearance of palmitate (ie, lipolysis) was found to be decreased, and lipid oxidation was also decreased during a euglycemic clamp study (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). During fasting, almost 80% of triglyceride in the very low-density lipoprotein secreted from the liver derives from adipose tissue (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). The rate of de novo lipogenesis rises sharply with increasing extent of liver fat accumulation and accounts for over a 3-fold greater contribution to plasma triglyceride in subjects with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). It was therefore important to quantify the effect of DPP-4 inhibition upon ectopic fat in liver because this organ is central to lipoprotein homeostasis and whole-body lipid metabolism.</p><p>The present study has demonstrated a substantial fall in fasting liver triglyceride concentration during vildagliptin treatment, with levels becoming similar to that of the nondiabetic control group. The major influence on liver triglyceride is body weight, and weight and percentage body fat decreased to only a modest degree on active treatment. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> illustrates the lack of a temporal relationship between change in body weight and change in liver fat. Additionally, by applying the observation of Tiikkainen et al (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) that a 1-kg loss of body weight at steady state is associated with a decrease in liver fat of approximately 0.58%, the highly statistically significant fall in liver fat on vildagliptin therapy remained (1 mo, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .01; 3 mo, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .01; 6 mo, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .001). The extent of the fall in liver triglyceride was clinically significant, as reflected by the reduction in plasma ALT and also by the correlations between the decreases in liver triglyceride and those of both plasma ALT and fasting plasma glucose. The improvement in liver triglyceride was less than that reported for thiazolidinedione therapy (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). The mechanism underlying the fall in liver triglyceride on vildagliptin therapy must be considered. Either fat oxidation must have increased or the balance between net hepatic storage and export must have changed. The most likely explanation is a substantial decrease in storage due to the previously observed decrease in fasting lipolysis and fatty acid supply to the liver (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). De novo lipogenesis was not assessed in this study, but overall a modest increase in this process would account for the lower plasma glucose levels in the face of no decrease in HGP and would still be consistent with the observed change in hepatic triglyceride concentration. No change in whole-body lipid oxidation was observed. Hepatic export of lipid is unlikely to have increased given the 13% fall in plasma triglyceride concentration and given the results from a previous study that showed no effect of vildagliptin treatment on postprandial triglyceride levels secondary to reduced flux of lipoproteins from the liver (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>).</p><p>It is known that the GLP-1 receptor is expressed on human hepatocytes (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), and a direct effect of increased GLP-1 levels is feasible. GLP-1 agonist therapy is known to decrease hepatic triglyceride levels in ob/ob mice (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), and DPP-4 inhibitors have been shown to reduce liver fat in obese mice models (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Furthermore, DPP-4 inhibition prevents fatty liver developing during overfeeding of both wild-type and glucokinase-deficient mice (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). In the latter study, it was also demonstrated that fatty acid synthase expression was decreased. However, caution is required in drawing mechanistic information from studies on rodents that, unlike humans, are able to synthesize fatty acids from glucose in adipocytes (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>)</p><p>Overall, blood glucose control improved on vildagliptin, as reflected by HbA<sub>1c</sub> falling into the nondiabetic range and fasting plasma glucose falling by 0.9 mmol/L. These results are particularly noteworthy given the very low baseline HbA<sub>1c</sub> of patients included in the study (mean, 6.4%) because oral hypoglycemic agents in general have effects directly proportional to initial blood glucose levels. Mean HbA<sub>1c</sub> was normalized after 24 weeks of treatment with vildagliptin 50 mg bid (twice a day). Of note, the vildagliptin treatment effect on HbA<sub>1c</sub> seen in this study is very robust when compared to previous data (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). In the present study, vildagliptin was added to stable metformin therapy, and it is possible that this is relevant to the extent of normalization of blood glucose levels. However, improvement in glucose control itself is unlikely to have had a direct effect upon liver fat levels, as shown by observation of no change in liver fat levels during metformin or sulfonylurea therapy (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>).</p><p>Basal HGP was not changed by vildagliptin treatment, and this confirms previous observations during both vildagliptin and sitagliptin therapy (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). In contrast, in a single-dose, postmeal, and overnight study (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>), there was on average 0.3 mg/kg/min less HGP in the vildagliptin group relative to the placebo group from the beginning of the dinner meal until the next morning. The lack of improvement in fasting HGP despite a fall in liver fat must be considered. This may relate to the very well-controlled type 2 diabetes under study because HGP in diabetes has been observed to decline to nondiabetic levels below a plasma glucose of approximately 8 mmol/L (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Further work is required to evaluate the effect of vildagliptin on HGP during a low, physiological increase in insulin concentrations such as occurs after meals, especially because an increase in suppression of HGP under these circumstances would be predicted by the decrease in hepatic triglyceride. It must be noted that the clamp insulin levels were optimal to measure peripheral rather than hepatic insulin sensitivity.</p><p>Treatment with vildagliptin added to metformin over 6 months resulted in a 1.6-kg weight loss vs baseline. While overall treatment with DPP-4 inhibitors is weight neutral, it was previously reported (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>) that from a similarly low baseline level of glycemia, as in the present study (baseline mean HbA<sub>1c</sub>, 6.6%), vildagliptin therapy reduced body weight by 1.1 kg over a 2-year period (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Furthermore, examination of weight as a function of fasting plasma glucose in a pooled analysis of &#x0003e; 2000 patients demonstrated that a negative calorie balance occurred in those with glucose levels below the renal threshold (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>).</p><p>Limitations of the present study must be considered. Examination of whole-body insulin sensitivity by conducting euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamps at a range of insulin concentrations would have been ideal. Similarly, detailed examination of hepatic insulin sensitivity within the physiological range of insulin concentrations would be of interest in relation to the substantial decrease in hepatic triglyceride. Finally, because the starting mean hepatic triglyceride level in the vildagliptin group was by random chance higher than that of the placebo group, it is important to be sure that the observed change was not merely a tendency to the mean. To exclude this possibility, when subjects were pair-matched between the groups for baseline liver triglyceride level with values within 0.2%, 12 pairs were identified, and the vildagliptin-treated levels fell over the 6-month period (6.29 &#x000b1; 1.01 to 4.06 &#x000b1; 0.61; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .02), whereas there was no change on placebo (6.35 &#x000b1; 1.03 to 6.57 &#x000b1; 1.57; <italic>P</italic> = .73).</p><p>In summary, this study has demonstrated that a clinically significant change in hepatic triglyceride levels is achieved on vildagliptin therapy and that this is unrelated to the small change in body weight.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group content-type="abbreviations"><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations:
