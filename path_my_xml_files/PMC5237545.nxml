A previous Healthy Beginnings Trial using a nurse-led home visiting program has demonstrated that providing mothers with evidence-based advice can improve maternal practice regarding obesity prevention, and can reduce Body Mass Index (BMI) in the first few years of life. However, the costs for scale-up of home visiting limit its population reach. This trial aims to determine the efficacy of Communicating Healthy Beginnings Advice by Telephone (CHAT) to mothers with infants in improving infant feeding practices and preventing the early onset of childhood overweight and obesity.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>We propose a 3-arm randomised controlled trial (RCT) with a consecutive sample of 1056 mothers with their newborn children in New South Wales (NSW) Australia. Pregnant women who are between weeks 28 and 34 of their pregnancy will be invited to participate in the CHAT trial. Informed consent will be obtained, and after baseline data collection, participants will be randomly allocated to the telephone intervention, text messaging intervention, or the control group. The intervention comprises telephone consultations or text messages, together with 6 intervention packages being mailed at specific times from the third trimester of pregnancy until 12&#x000a0;months post birth. The main trial outcome measures include a) duration of breastfeeding, b) timing of introduction of solids, c) nutrition behaviours, physical activity and television viewing, and d) weight and BMI z-score at 12 and 24&#x000a0;months, e) cost-effectiveness, as well as f) feasibility and acceptability of the interventions.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The results will ascertain whether early intervention using telephone consultation or text messaging together with staged mailed intervention resources can be feasible and effective in improving infant feeding practices, physical activity and reducing children&#x02019;s BMI in the early years of life.

In Australia, approximately 20% of children at 2&#x02013;3 years of age are overweight or obese [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. It has now become evident that excess weight and fast weight gain in young children are associated with overweight later in life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Obesity in pre-school aged children has a high risk of progressing to obesity in later childhood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and potentially into adulthood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The adverse health consequences of childhood obesity are well documented internationally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], and in Australia obesity in very young children is associated with increased healthcare utilization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. There was a call for greater efforts being made to prevent childhood obesity in the early years, and even before birth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Indeed, a 2013 Lancet editorial argued that prevention, through educating mothers about both nutritional and environmental exposures of in-utero and during early life is an important strategy in the prevention of non-communicable diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>Of the many factors contributing to early onset of childhood obesity, research has found that infant feeding practices, including breastfeeding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and the timing of the introduction of solids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] as well as children&#x02019;s eating habits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and television (TV) viewing time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] are among the most modifiable. Infant feeding practices can affect both child eating behaviours and adult eating habits later in life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. It was concluded by a systematic review that obesity-related behaviours can be influenced positively in a range of settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>Over recent years, there has been an increasing number of research studies on developing and implementing early obesity interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In 2012, we completed the Healthy Beginnings Trial (HBT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], which was the first randomised controlled trial (RCT) to test the effectiveness of an early childhood obesity intervention during the first 2 years of life. Briefly, HBT is a staged, home-based early intervention, designed to improve family and behavioural risk factors for childhood obesity. The intervention involved home visits by an early childhood nurse, with an initial visit at late pregnancy, and then seven visits at 1, 3, 5, 9, 12, 18 and 24&#x000a0;months after birth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. This early intervention was effective in reducing children&#x02019;s body mass index and reducing TV viewing at age 2&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], as well as improving infant feeding practices including breastfeeding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. However, the economic evaluation of the HBT showed that the early obesity prevention through home visits was only moderately cost-effective, with the cost of home visiting potentially limiting the level of population reach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Hence, other new, low cost and high uptake approaches need to be explored.</p><p>Over the past 10&#x000a0;years, evidence has emerged rapidly regarding the use of Short Message Service (SMS) and telephone consultation in health promotion interventions, health service delivery and promotion of health behaviour change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Telephone consultation often employs a motivational interviewing approach and aims to set goals, build skills and knowledge, and address barriers as well as manage anxiety and stress which may act as barriers to health behaviour change. The SMS is used to reinforce knowledge, prompt use of behaviour change strategies (e.g., goal setting, problem solving, overcoming barriers) and allow users to seek support for management of problems in real time. Telephone-delivered interventions have shown a moderate effect for promoting healthy lifestyles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], while SMS-delivered interventions have positive short-term behavioural outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] with strong evidence supporting the value of integrating text-messaging interventions into public health practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. To date, few published studies have examined the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of telephone- or SMS- delivered intervention in promoting healthy infant feeding practices and obesity-protective behaviours in the early years of life. The evidence to date shows that telephone- or SMS- delivered interventions hold promise as an alternative delivery model for the Healthy Beginnings<sup>&#x000a9;</sup> early intervention program (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.healthybeginnings.net.au/">http://www.healthybeginnings.net.au/</ext-link>) to mothers with newborns, at lower cost and with greater population reach.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Aims</title><p>The CHAT trial aims to evaluate the efficacy of using SMS or telephone support, plus mailed written intervention materials developed through the HBT, to deliver a staged intervention based upon the principles of the successful HBT intervention. The proposed study design is an RCT with three arms (including mailed HBT intervention materials plus telephone support; mailed HBT intervention plus SMS; and usual care) starting in the 3rd trimester of pregnancy and continuing until the child is 12&#x000a0;months.

To detect a difference in mean BMI z-score of 0.29 units between each intervention group and the control at age 2&#x000a0;years, a sample size of 264 per arm is needed, using an estimated SD of 1.19, based on the HBT data. Allowing for a 25% drop-out (based on HBT), a sample size of 352 per arm will be needed, which will also give enough power to detect differences in secondary outcomes (i.e. a difference of 0.3 in mean number of daily serves of fruit or vegetables).</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Registration and randomisation</title><p>Information collected from the registration form will be entered into a password-protected database.

The development of SMS messages and telephone support guidance will emphasise skills development, problem solving, and identify strategies to overcome barriers. The intervention will also provide psychosocial support to alleviate mothers&#x02019; concerns, stress and anxiety. We will employ two Child and Family Health nurses (also referred as intervention/research nurses in this paper) to deliver the telephone support or SMS intervention.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Key messages and main contents of the staged early interventions</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Time</th><th>Main issues/key messages</th><th>Main contents</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>3rd trimester</td><td>Breastfeeding and/or formula<break/>&#x0201c;Breast is best&#x0201d;</td><td>Breastfeeding guidelines; health benefits of breastfeeding and strategies to overcome barriers associated with breastfeeding</td></tr><tr><td>1&#x000a0;month</td><td>Breastfeeding and/or formula<break/>&#x0201c;Breast is best&#x0201d;<break/>&#x0201c;Tummy time is fun&#x0201d;<break/>&#x0201c;No solids for me until 6&#x000a0;months&#x0201d;</td><td>Rapid response to women with problems initiating breastfeeding after childbirth, especially women who delivered by caesarean section; advice on establishment of breastfeeding pattern; management of problems; &#x0201c;tummy time&#x0201d; for babies</td></tr><tr><td>3&#x000a0;months</td><td>Breastfeeding and/or formula<break/>Timing of Introduction of solids<break/>&#x0201c;Tummy time is fun&#x0201d;<break/>&#x0201c;No solids for me until 6&#x000a0;months&#x0201d;</td><td>Advice on establishment of breastfeeding patterns; management of problems; &#x0201c;tummy time&#x0201d; for babies; introduction of solids after 6&#x000a0;months; encourage mothers going back to work to continue breastfeeding</td></tr><tr><td>5&#x000a0;months</td><td>Timing of Introduction of solids<break/>Tummy time<break/>&#x0201c;No solids for me until 6&#x000a0;months&#x0201d;</td><td>Reinforce breastfeeding pattern; management of problems; &#x0201c;tummy time&#x0201d; for babies; introduction of solids from 6&#x000a0;months; encourage mothers going back to work to continue breastfeeding</td></tr><tr><td>9&#x000a0;months</td><td>Food serving size, cup feeding/Introduction of cow&#x02019;s milk<break/>&#x0201c;Only water in my cup&#x0201d;</td><td>Encourage sustained breastfeeding; advice on balanced infant feeding, quantity and variety of fruits and vegetables; encourage active play and motor skills development; avoiding TV viewing, introduce cup feeding</td></tr><tr><td>12&#x000a0;months</td><td>Healthy food choices (no food rewards)/Active Play/TV time<break/>&#x0201c;I eat a variety of fruit and vegetables every day&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;Healthy eating for whole family&#x0201d;</td><td>Encourage sustained breastfeeding; advice on balanced infant feeding, quantity and variety of fruits and vegetables; encourage active play and motor skills development; avoiding TV viewing</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap>
</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Intervention arm 1 (SMS)</title><p>We will purchase a 2-way SMS service that allows for some interactivity between mothers and intervention nurses. Following a mailed stage-specific intervention resource, mothers in this intervention group will be sent text messages to their mobile phone automatically at a predetermined time (10&#x000a0;am&#x02013;1&#x000a0;pm) and twice a week for 4&#x000a0;weeks. The frequency and time of SMS are based on our pilot study. The messages will provide information/advice, motivation/reinforcing and prompting (messages), psychosocial support for healthy infant and child feeding and lifestyle as outlined in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. A bank of standardised but personalised (i.e. participant&#x02019;s name) text messages will be developed and pilot tested according to the key infant milestones/stages as outlined. The typical length of the message will be &#x0003c;160 characters. The 2-way SMS service will also receive and save text messages from participating mothers in an excel spreadsheet which will be reviewed daily except for weekends and public holidays. Common questions will be answered by return SMS within 24&#x000a0;h (except weekends) by a research nurse.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Intervention arm 2 (telephone support)</title><p>Mothers in this intervention group will also receive 6 staged intervention packages by mail followed by a phone call from the research nurse within 1&#x02013;2 weeks. At each telephone contact, the nurse will spend approximately 30&#x000a0;min with the mother to go through the mailed intervention resources and discuss the issues or concerns raised by the mother. A telephone support guidance and manual will be developed based on existing materials, containing a checklist to ensure that all information is covered. Telephone calls will follow a tailored principle, and a framework that reinforces information in the resource packages, helps set goals, works with mothers to develop action plans to achieve goals, deals with barriers and problem solving.

We will also collect mother&#x02019;s pre-pregnancy height and weight, gestational weight gain and whether gestational diabetes was diagnosed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>At 6 months</title><p>We will ask mothers about their infant feeding practices including breastfeeding duration and timing of the introduction of solids. For example, mothers will be asked &#x0201c;Is &#x02018;child&#x02019; currently being breastfed?&#x0201d; If they answered &#x0201c;no&#x02019;, they are further asked &#x0201c;Including time of weaning, what is the time &#x02018;child&#x02019; is breastfed?&#x0201d; Mothers will be also asked &#x0201c;At what age is &#x02018;child&#x02019; first given solid foods regularly?&#x0201d; We will also collect information on &#x0201c;tummy time&#x0201d; (a colloquial term used to encourage parents to ensure that their babies spend time in the prone position) and parent-child interaction.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>At 12 months</title><p>We will collect breastfeeding information as the primary outcome. Other secondary outcomes will include cup usage, bottle at bedtime, and food for reward as well as play time and activities. We will also collect length and weight of the child recorded in the Personal Health Record (also known as the &#x02018;Blue Book&#x02019;). In addition, we will send a brief online survey monthly via email to all mothers for the first 12&#x000a0;months, so mothers can record their child&#x02019;s growth milestones and important events of relevance (i.e., breastfeeding, timing of introduction of solids, &#x0201c;tummy time&#x0201d; and cup usage) and weight gain.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Outcomes at 24 months</title><p>The primary outcome is the child&#x02019;s BMI z-score. Secondary outcomes include child&#x02019;s screen time (including TV) and fruit and vegetable consumption as well as other eating habits (e.g. intake of &#x0201c;extra foods&#x0201d;, and having a meal in front of the TV), active play time and several maternal outcomes: dietary behaviours, TV viewing time, physical activity and knowledge and confidence about obesity prevention.

The FFQ includes serves of fruit and vegetables; frequency of eating snack foods (biscuits, cakes, donuts, muesli bars, potato crisps), and cups of soft drinks/cordials, juice, and water, and frequency of eating in front of the TV and having food as reward.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Screen time and outdoor play time</title><p>Mothers will report the total time their child spends on screen activities (including watching TV) or outdoor play time per day in a usual week using a set of validated questions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Mothers&#x02019; nutrition and physical activity</title><p>Mothers&#x02019; own dietary behaviours and physical activity will be assessed using questions sourced from the NSW Health Survey Program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] which we have used previously in HBT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Data analysis</title><p>All outcomes will be compared between each of the intervention groups and the control group. All analyses will be conducted by &#x02018;intention to treat&#x02019;, which will include all the participants who are randomised, according to their group assignment, regardless of their later status, including noncompliance, protocol deviations, withdrawal, and anything that happens after randomisation. For continuous variables, such as BMI or BMI z-score, means will be compared using <italic>t</italic>-tests. For categorical variables such as percentages of children using a cup, chi-squared tests will be used. Survival analysis will be used for breastfeeding duration: Kaplan-Meier curves will be used to estimate median breastfeeding duration and log-rank tests will be used to compare median breastfeeding duration between groups; Cox proportional hazards regression will be used to compare the hazard ratio for stopping breastfeeding between groups.</p><p>Mean BMI-, weight- and length-for-age z-scores at 12 and 24&#x000a0;months will be calculated using WHO Anthro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. For comparisons between the groups we will take two steps as we used in the original HBT; firstly, unadjusted and complete-case analysis will be conducted and secondly, adjustment for important covariates or potential confounding factors will be conducted when appropriate. Multiple imputation by chained equations will be used to impute missing values. The effect of loss to follow-up will be assessed by comparing complete-case and multiple imputation analyses.</p></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Assessor blinding</title><p>Outcome data at 6 and 12&#x000a0;months will be collected by a market survey company using CATI, and outcome data at 24&#x000a0;months will be collected by RAs not involved in intervention implementation.

This approach is similar to that used in the original HBT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Analysis of costs</title><p>We will collect data prospectively on the costs to deliver each intervention program during the first 2 years of life (including the 2-way SMS service, or telephone calls, staff time, training, mail-outs, and any other intervention resources). We will include the cost of all resources needed to reproduce each intervention, but will exclude the research and development costs of the study. Both fixed costs and variable costs will be identified, thus allowing estimation of total budget required to deliver a scaled up program. The reference year for the analysis will be 2016; all costs in dollars will be indexed to that year using the Health Price Index. All costs and effects will be appropriately discounted. Market prices will be used as appropriate for the cost of all intervention materials.</p></sec><sec id="Sec31"><title>Outcomes for CEA</title><p>The key outcome measures including breast feeding duration and BMI will be used to assess the cost-effectiveness of each intervention compared with usual care. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios will be calculated in terms of the incremental cost: a) per additional infant breastfed to 6&#x000a0;months and 12&#x000a0;months; and b) per unit reduction in BMI z-score at 12 and 24&#x000a0;months. Using the mean costs and the mean health outcomes in each arm of the trial, the incremental cost per unit outcome of each intervention compared to usual care will be calculated and results will be plotted on a cost-effectiveness plane. In order to reflect the variation in mean costs and outcomes, bootstrapping will be used to estimate joint uncertainty in these variables, and to calculate the confidence intervals around the incremental cost effectiveness ratio. One-way sensitivity analysis will be conducted around key variables, and a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve will determine the probability of being cost-effective at different willingness to pay thresholds.</p></sec><sec id="Sec32"><title>Pilot and process evaluation</title><p>Prior to the trial commencement, the intervention materials including mailed intervention packages, telephone support guidance and SMS messages will be developed and pilot tested with intervention nurses and mothers in the community. The intervention nurses and RAs will be trained according to the protocol. At the recruitment stage of study participants RAs will record their recruitment process using field notes. The intervention nurses will document all aspects of their contact (SMS or telephone support) with the families, and provide regular reports to the investigators on questions and issues arising. Information on the number and duration of telephone calls and SMS messages received by participants, data on recruitment, study retention and intervention acceptability will be recorded. We will routinely conduct quality control audits on records and, each quarter, we will conduct in-depth interviews with 5% of the sample to ensure families are satisfied with the processes, and to identify any other issues that may emerge.</p></sec><sec id="Sec33"><title>Evaluation of the feasibility and acceptability</title><p>We will conduct in-depth interviews or focus groups with some participants to assess program satisfaction, and to identify any issues that may emerge as well as to gather their feedback on the intervention acceptance. In addition, qualitative interviews will be conducted with stakeholders and representatives from the main organisations involved in the trial to gain a better understanding of their experience of the project implementation, acceptability, and barriers and enablers to effective delivery and suggestions for improving the program to be delivered in the broader community.

However, current evidence of effective early interventions is scarce. Early obesity prevention strategies that are proven to be effective, sustainable and having a broad population reach with low cost have yet to be developed.</p><p>In this proposed study we aim to translate the successful evidence from the HBT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] and evidence from effective telephone- or SMS-delivered health promotion interventions into scaled-up obesity prevention practice. We aim to demonstrate that communicating the Healthy Beginnings advice to mothers with newborns by telephone or SMS can be feasible, effective and cost-effective, which can lead to a low-cost, broad-reach and sustainable program for promoting healthy infant feeding and preventing early onset of childhood obesity. This CHAT trial can inform policy makers of efficient and effective ways of using resources for achieving population reach and equality through its mass reach capability.</p><p>The project will determine whether: 1) a staged early intervention starting from the antenatal period can improve infant feeding practices, child diet quality, screen time and physical activity, and therefore child BMI in the first years of life; and 2) a mobile phone SMS intervention or telephone support is a well-accepted, cost-effective and viable strategy for disseminating knowledge, and promoting healthy behaviour, to mothers living in various geographical locations. If the interventions prove to be successful, we anticipate immediate public health benefits and policy/practice recommendations for preventing the early onset of childhood obesity, which will provide an urgently needed model for population-based, low-cost childhood obesity prevention programs.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This is a partnership project funded by NSW Ministry of Health.
