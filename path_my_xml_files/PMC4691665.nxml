Within the 27 Member states of the European Union, 340&#x02005;000 people were diagnosed with colorectal cancer in 2012 and about 150&#x02005;000 people died because of it.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Among 5.4 million Finns, the corresponding figures are approximately 2500 people diagnosed with colorectal cancer and more than 1000 deaths every year. The incidence of colorectal cancer increased for decades while mortality was stable among men and decreased among women since the 1970s.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p><p>Colorectal cancer screening aims to reduce the mortality of the disease by discovering the cancer at an early, asymptomatic stage, to enable more effective and less invasive treatment. Screening with a faecal occult blood test (FOBT) has been shown to reduce mortality from colorectal cancer in a number of randomised screening studies.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4&#x02013;7</xref> In a Cochrane review,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> the combined results of these studies showed a 16% reduction in the relative risk of colorectal cancer mortality. Three of these studies<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> used biennial screening and showed an average of 15% relative risk reduction in colorectal cancer mortality. The reduction in mortality was seen in all three trials even though there was large variation in the design, such as the age of the target population, screening intervals, attendance rate and length of follow-up. Also, the cost-effectiveness of colorectal cancer screening has been modelled in a number of studies, in various countries, using different screening tests and strategies.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9&#x02013;15</xref> Based on the available evidence, the Council of the European Union already, in 2003, recommended the implementation of a population-based screening programme for colorectal cancer to the EU Member States.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p><p>In Finland, colorectal cancer screening started in 2004 as a population-based randomised study. The idea was to launch a new screening programme in such a way that it can be reliably evaluated. The target population of screening is men and women aged 60&#x02013;69&#x02005;years, based on the fact that the incidence of and mortality from colorectal cancer increase after 60&#x02005;years of age.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> The municipalities responsible for providing health services in Finland can voluntarily join the programme, and the number of piloting municipalities has increased from 22 (of 444) in 2004 to 153 (of 336) in 2012. The target population in these municipalities was randomised at an individual level within municipality, birth year and in sex specific blocks, to screening and control groups. Owing to the gradual expansion of the programme as a randomised health services study,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> the effects of the ultimate national screening programme on the allocation of health care resources can be evaluated as a part of routine health service.</p><p>The aim of this article was to estimate the difference in the use of hospital resources between those invited and the controls in the Finnish colorectal cancer screening programme within the first screening round.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>When the Finnish colorectal cancer screening study was launched, a national screening centre was established in the city of Tampere, at the local cancer society, to deal with the invitations, responses and recommendations for referrals, and to analyse the faecal samples. FOBT kits (Hemoccult; Beckman Coulter, USA) are posted to those offered screening along with a letter of invitation to participate in the programme and advice on how to take the sample. The kits are also returned by post. If any traces of blood are found in the sample, the person is referred to a contact nurse in their home municipality, for further examinations. Diagnostic confirmation, treatment and follow-up of people who screened positive are conducted within the normal health services at the local level and are paid for mostly by the home municipality of the participant being screened. Those in the control arm are identified but not contacted. The control population receives routine health services available in Finland.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p><p>All individuals (n=246&#x02005;079) who were randomised to the colorectal cancer screening (n=123&#x02005;149) or control (n=122&#x02005;930) groups during years 2004&#x02013;2009 were identified and their data on healthcare resource use were gathered from the Finnish Hospital Discharge Register (FHDR). The follow-up of each individual was from the beginning of the year of randomisation up to the end of the next calendar year (two full years). The study period was 2004&#x02013;2010.</p><p>For those randomised during the years 2004&#x02013;2009, healthcare utilisation data on all gastrointestinal-related hospital-based outpatient visits and inpatient episodes of care were gathered on the year of randomisation and the following year. The data were restricted by ICD-10 codes that were related to gastrointestinal symptoms: C15-C26; D12 and K00-K93. Colonoscopies performed during those visits and episodes in hospitals were also examined, including procedure codes UJF32, UJF34 and UJF45. Colonoscopies performed in primary healthcare (including the screening colonoscopies) are not included in the analysis for either the screening or the control group.

The FHDR has total (legislative) coverage of all inpatient care provided at university, general and psychiatric hospitals or primary care health centres, as well as treatment in military and prison wards and private hospitals, since 1969. Each record contains data on several variables, such as personal identity number, age at admission, gender, hospital identifier code, admission and discharge dates, reason for admission (ICD-10 code since 1996), and diagnostic and treatment activities. The register includes data on clinical procedures from 1986 onwards and the current coding system for procedures has been in use since 2004. The data on hospital outpatient visits have been collected since 1998 with some limitations and they are considered to be comparable from 2006 onwards. The completeness and accuracy of the FHDR has been reviewed to be good. Data on outpatient services at the primary care level (general practitioner visits, etc) are available from 1994 onwards at aggregate level.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>

Slightly more people in the screening group than in the control group had at least one hospital-based outpatient visit (7.8% vs 7.4%) or inpatient episode (3.9% vs 3.8%). In total, the screening group had 4914 more cumulative outpatient visits and 1357 more inpatient episodes than the control group. The proportions of test-positive people with at least one outpatient visit (26.0% vs 7.0%) or with at least one inpatient episode (8.3% vs 3.3%) were clearly higher than those of people with a negative FOBT result.</p><p>The difference in use of hospital resources between the screening and control group is reliably comparable. The setting of the Finnish colorectal cancer screening programme makes it possible to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of screening in a randomised, yet real-world healthcare setting. Any possible systematic errors within the Finnish Hospital Discharge registry will be equally present in both groups.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Limitations of the study</title><p>One limitation of the study is the lack of primary care data. Resources used at the primary healthcare level, either by the screening or the control groups, were not registered at FHDR during the study years. Small municipalities with inadequate resources refer patients to hospital for the primary colonoscopy. Other municipalities have their own endoscopy units and their primary colonoscopies are not included in our data. In both cases, if any further examination or treatment (eg, removal of large polyps, suspicious cancer) is necessary, the patient is referred to the secondary healthcare. From earlier work,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> we know that 90% of the test-positives complied to colonoscopy, which means that approximately 2650 primary colonoscopies should be added to the figures of the screening group reported here. However, the lack of data on primary healthcare concerns both, and no comprehensive data are available on possible colonoscopies or other diagnostics at the primary healthcare level in the control group or non-attenders. According to national care guidelines,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> the primary investigation for symptomatic patients is endoscopy (not FOBT) and thus controls also have access to primary care endoscopy. The difference in use of primary healthcare services between the two groups can only be speculated, but it is likely that the proportional differences based on FHDR data should indicate any overall differences.</p><p>A major concern in FOBT screening and resource use has been the possible increase in the number of diagnostic procedures, mainly colonoscopies, and our study confirms this. In the UK, Price <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> reported an increase of 21&#x02013;31% in the number of hospital colonoscopies due to FOBT screening, but a simultaneous increase was also seen in the demand for symptom-based colonoscopies. In Australia, it has been estimated that a biennial FOBT would result in five times more colonoscopies than the option of no screening.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> In our study, a total of 930 more hospital colonoscopies were conducted for the screening group than for the control group, resulting in a 53% increase in hospital colonoscopies. The proportion of people with at least one colonoscopy was slightly higher in the screening group than in the control group (1.5% vs 1.3%). In particular, patients with a positive FOBT result seemed to increase the probability of hospital resource use, including colonoscopies, compared to those with a negative FOBT or to those who did not attend the screening. This implies that an abnormal finding in the screening results in a number of colonoscopies while without screening, the control group will receive only one diagnostic colonoscopy based on the symptoms, without FOBT.</p><p>Based on the present study, it is, however, impossible to say whether the increase is only temporary. For example, Thiis-Evensen <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> showed that, with a 9-year observation period after a screening colonoscopy, the screening group had 50% fewer usual-care distal endoscopic examinations than the control group. Furthermore, Seeff <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> have argued that if all of the potential endoscopic capacity existing in the USA was used for organised colorectal cancer screening, the unscreened population could be screened within 1&#x02005;year using the FOBT and colonoscopy for those with a positive test result. For example, follow-up after polypectomy is carried out at more frequent intervals than recommended. In comparison, many published estimates of colonoscopies in cost-effectiveness analyses are reported only for different screening strategies, while the alternative of &#x02018;no systematic screening&#x02019; is often left out or assumed to be zero.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>

After that, the confounding effect of the second screen is introduced, presuming that the effects of the first and second round are different. In the Finnish CRC screening programme, everyone in the screening group will receive an invitation to screening also during the second round, regardless of the screening result in the first round. The long term evaluation is thus not that straightforward and may include a source of bias.</p><p>In conclusion, colorectal cancer screening using the FOBT seems to slightly increase the volume of hospital outpatient visits, inpatient episodes and hospital colonoscopies in Finland.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to acknowledge Jouni Rasilainen (the National Institute for Health and Welfare) for his effort in defining and collecting data.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> NM and MH were involved in study concept and design of the screening programme.
