The number of people affected by the disease, coupled with escalating costs to the economy, highlights the pressing need to improve the quality of care and services available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The development of user-friendly, clinically effective therapeutic interventions delivered by carers could improve cognition and quality of life for people with dementia, and help carers be involved in worthwhile and enjoyable activities. The Department of Health, the National Health Service (NHS) Executive, research charities and funding bodies suggest that the key to developing interventions and treatments that successfully address the needs of service users, and produce results that will impact clinical practice is to involve them in clinical research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>Group CST is an evidence-based psychosocial intervention for people with dementia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Studies evaluating the effectiveness of CST consistently report that CST can improve cognition and quality of life for people with dementia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Clinically and cost-effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], CST is recommended by the National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], the NHS Institute for Innovations and Improvements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. An extended programme of maintenance CST (14 sessions over 7&#x000a0;weeks plus a further 24 weekly sessions), developed and evaluated in a large scale randomized controlled trial, showed improvements in quality of life for people with dementia at 6&#x000a0;month follow up and further cognitive benefits for people on cholinesterase inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. CST groups are being integrated into NHS services nationally, and further research is underway into the implementation of CST and maintenance CST in practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, for those unable to participate in groups due to local service constraints, personal preference, or health or mobility issues, an individualised carer-led version of CST would be beneficial.</p><p>The current study is part of a Health Technology Assessment (HTA) funded randomized clinical trial aiming to develop and evaluate iCST for dementia. With guidance from experts in dementia, including service users, healthcare professionals and academics, the CST and maintenance CST programmes were adapted to create a 25&#x000a0;week long structured programme of mentally stimulating activities designed to be delivered at home by family carers. A set of materials including a manual, activity workbook and toolkit were created for the programme.</p><p>The principles of the Medical Research Council (MRC) framework [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] were applied in the development of the iCST intervention and materials. This study describes the consultations with carers and people with dementia, which were carried out in accordance with Phase 1 (modelling) of the MRC guidelines. The purpose of the modelling phase was to gain insight into perceptions of mental stimulation from the point of view of carers and people with dementia, to ensure the intervention materials were easy to use, clear, and appropriately tailored to the needs of people with dementia and their carers, and to assess the feasibility of the programme.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Design</title><p>Semi-structured interviews and focus groups were selected as complimentary qualitative methods to assess the feasibility of the iCST programme, and the quality of the first draft of the materials produced. People with dementia and carers were consulted separately as well as collaboratively, to ensure both parties could express their opinions and outline their preferences for the programme, which may be disparate according to their role and needs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. A discussion guide was developed prior to the focus groups and interviews. The guide included open questions designed to promote discussion around mentally stimulating activities in general terms, and more focused questions that invited specific responses to the iCST materials provided at the sessions (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Discussion of practical issues (eg: &#x02018;How long should sessions last?&#x02019;) constituted a key part of the guide produced. The guide was altered slightly for the groups and interviews with people with dementia, as these sessions were intended to be more focused on trying the activities than the practicalities of delivering the programme.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>

The organizations recruited for focus groups if they were able to provide a venue, and interviews if they did not have the facility to host a group.</p><p>The organizations made initial contact with carers and people with dementia who were suitable and interested in the research activities, typically approaching them during support groups, or during memory clinic appointments. The research team then contacted consenting dyads to confirm their eligibility and determine their availability for a local focus group, or negotiate a convenient time for an interview. People were eligible to participate if they had a diagnosis of mild to moderate dementia (meeting the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 4<sup>th</sup> Edition [DSM-IV] criteria &#x00026; score of 10 or above on the Mini Mental State Examination [MMSE]) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], were able to communicate and understand communication, and able to provide informed consent to take part in a discussion group or interview, and were living in the community. Carers were eligible to participate if they were currently caring for a person with dementia.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Procedure</title><sec id="Sec6"><title>Focus groups</title><p>Of the nine groups planned, six were conducted; two with carers, three with people with dementia, and one with both carers and people with dementia. Each group was attended by two members of the research team, one of whom took on the role as facilitator and led the group discussion, and the other observed the group and made notes to supplement the audio data collected. The discussions were conducted in a semi-structured style guided by a series of pre determined focus points and questions (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). During the session, participants were invited to appraise and interact with a selection of sample materials from the programme including manuals, activity workbooks and toolkit items. Each session lasted approximately 90&#x000a0;minutes in total.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Individual interviews</title><p>Ten interviews were planned and conducted. People with dementia and their carers were interviewed separately. The interview with the person with dementia was conducted first to allow the carer time to appraise a set of sample materials. Typically each interview lasted 30&#x02013;45 minutes. Interviews with people with dementia involved completing two iCST activities, specific feedback about their enjoyment and comprehension of the activities, and a general discussion about perceptions of, and needs for a home based programme of mentally stimulating activities. The main aims of the carer interviews were to identify any practical issues that might affect the delivery of the programme, and to gather data about the quality and appropriateness of the activities and manuals, which would inform the development of further drafts of the materials (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Ethical considerations</title><p>Information sheets for carers and people with dementia were approved by the Multi-centre Research Ethics Committee (ref no.10/H0701/71). All participants received the information sheets a minimum of 24&#x000a0;hours before the scheduled research activities in accordance with Good Clinical Practice guidelines. At the beginning of each session, researchers reiterated information about the procedure and aims of the groups and interviews and offered participants the opportunity to raise any queries. People with dementia were in the mild to moderate stages of dementia, and thus were deemed able to provide informed consent for participation.</p><p>Written consent was obtained on the day of the research activity. Continuing assent was established by informing participants that they were free to leave the group or terminate their interview at any time if they wished. All participants were also specifically asked for permission to record the session using a dictaphone.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Analyses</title><p>Inductive thematic analysis techniques were employed in the coding and analysis of the data gathered. Data driven analysis strategies involve detailed readings of the raw data, from which concepts, themes, or models are derived based on the interpretation of those analysing the data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. This approach was best suited to the aim of the groups and interviews, which was to gather descriptive exploratory data concerning perceptions of the first drafts of the iCST materials. The transcripts were examined in conjunction with the field notes, which were used to clarify any points recorded as &#x02018;inaudible&#x02019; in the transcripts, and any comments, which required further contextual information in order to be understood. Excerpts of text were extracted from the transcripts and used as labels for categories emerging from the data (eg: &#x02018;potential difficulties&#x02019;). Two researchers analyzed the data independently, entering the categories and supporting quotes from the transcripts into a spreadsheet. They then compared results and collaboratively reviewed any excerpts that could be coded to more than one category to reach consensus over their category placement. Throughout the analysis, the categories were continually refined to identify the themes most relevant to our evaluation objectives. Data from the groups and interviews was collated, then examined further by source (carers and people with dementia) to identify any variations in views. No specialist software was used to perform the data analyses.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Of the total sample of 52 participants; 14 carers and 18 people with dementia took part in the focus groups, and 10 carers and 10 people with dementia participated in the interviews.

Puzzles (eg: crosswords, jigsaws) were also a popular suggested activity, along with games such as cards and dominoes. People with dementia said that reading the newspaper keeps the mind stimulated. However, a carer commented that activities with a visual or auditory element were more worthwhile than just sitting and reading.</p><p>Watching TV was mentioned by people with dementia as a way of keeping up to date.

Some carers pointed out that if sessions were any longer, they would be too tiring for the person with dementia. Incorporating rest breaks was suggested if the carer felt the person was bored or tired. By contrast, some carers were concerned that 20&#x02013;30 minutes would not be a sufficient amount of time in which to complete the activities.</p><p>Carers expressed a preference for a more pragmatic approach to scheduling activities. They placed emphasis on having the freedom to do sessions when they felt like it, rather than setting specific times during which they must be completed. Carers&#x02019; perceptions of the session structure varied. Whilst some carers acknowledged the advantage of sessions being delivered in a consistent and structured way, others indicated they may not adhere to the structure outlined in the programme.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Theme 4: Quality of the materials</title><p>The response to the first draft of the iCST manual and activity workbook was overwhelmingly positive. Carers felt that both manuals were clearly laid out and written in a way that was easy for them to understand.

Carers and people with dementia responded positively to the first drafts of the iCST manual and activity workbook, particularly the clarity of the language, range of ideas, and professional look of the materials. Feasibility issues, such as finding time to do the sessions, were identified and possible solutions offered by participants. This gave the research team an idea of the support carers will need in delivering the programme, as well as an understanding of likely reasons for non-adherence.</p><sec id="Sec20"><title>Mentally stimulating activities</title><p>Carers and people with dementia emphasized the importance of being mentally active, attributing a wide range of cognitive, emotional, and functional benefits to taking part in mentally stimulating activities. This reflects the notion of &#x02018;use it, or lose it&#x02019; proposed by Swaab [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The emotional impact of mentally stimulating activities was also highlighted. Carers felt that being mentally stimulated could improve quality of life and have a positive impact on mood. People with dementia placed emphasis on the need for meaningful activity in order to retain their sense of self, and provide continuity between &#x02018;now&#x02019; and other stages in their life. These findings are consistent with those of Phinney, Chaudhury &#x00026; O&#x02019;Connor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] who suggested that people garner meaning from involvement in activities in 3 ways: the pleasure and enjoyment of their experience, the feeling of belonging, and the ability to retain a sense of autonomy and identity. The significance of meaningful activity is also stressed by older adults without dementia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. However, the experience of dementia may mean that involvement in activity becomes more challenging. In particular &#x02018;independent&#x02019; involvement, which was acknowledged by people with dementia and carers in this study, who noticed an increased reliance on others to provide opportunities and support in engaging in meaningful activities.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Feasibility of delivering a programme of mental stimulation at home</title><p>Much of the data gathered from carers about the feasibility of the programme was focused on practical issues that might arise whilst delivering the activities. Largely, their receptiveness to delivering the programme appeared to be determined by whether practical issues were viewed as insurmountable barriers or difficulties that could be overcome.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Time</title><p>Carers stressed the need for the programme to be flexible. Certainly, providing care often reduces the time available for other activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The impingement on time caused by occupying a caring role, and how well it is managed may lead to perceptions of role conflict and overload [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The recommended duration and frequency of iCST sessions was based on the intervention schedule of a home-based carer led programme of reality orientation evaluated by Onder <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and consultations with people with dementia and carers prior to the development of iCST. However, adherence to this intervention was not measured, thus it is difficult to use the study as a model to assess the feasibility of the proposed iCST intervention schedule. Further information about the feasibility of the proposed duration and frequency of sessions will be obtained from a field testing phase.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Impact of Caregiver Burden (CB)</title><p>The perception of the feasibility of delivering the programme may be determined by the experience of CB. The functional level of the person with dementia, the extent of care provided, and the care-giving context have been identified as potential predictors of CB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Consideration of the care-giving context and its impact on CB may reveal why a minority of carers felt the iCST programme was not feasible, and additionally, why several carers suggested it would be more suitable if delivered by a professional.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Impact of family dynamics</title><p>Some carers were doubtful they would be able to engage their relative in a programme of activities at home. An understanding of the role relationship between the care-giver and the care recipient may provide insight into this belief. Pruchno, Burant &#x00026; Peters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] suggest that family histories influence the interactions between the carer and care recipient. The personalities of the carer and cared for can also impact these interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The dyad develops expectations for the care-giving role, which define the basic parameters for the appropriateness of certain care tasks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Delivery of a therapeutic intervention by a family member may not be deemed appropriate by the family member themselves, or their relative with dementia, or both based on their expectations. In this study the &#x02018;appropriateness&#x02019; of a family carer delivering the programme was questioned by carers, but by contrast people with dementia welcomed the idea. It remains to be seen how the programme will be received by the dyad in practice and this is likely to depend largely on the context of the relationship, and perhaps the person with dementia&#x02019;s understanding of the purpose of the programme.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Skill base of the carer</title><p>Several studies have demonstrated that family carer led interventions are feasible and can yield positive outcomes for the carer including improvements in well being [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], and reduction in depressive symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], as well as improved cognition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] for the person with dementia. These findings suggest that, contrary to the opinions expressed by some carers in the focus groups and interviews, interventions can be delivered by family members. With adequate training, accessible materials and a support system in place, it will be possible to equip carers with the skills they require to deliver the iCST intervention.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Formal structure of sessions</title><p>Carers discussed the idea of adapting the session structure so that it would feel more &#x02018;natural&#x02019;, anticipating a formal session would not be appealing to their relative. Prospectively, this data indicates we may expect issues around intervention fidelity in the field-testing phase of the trial. Intervention fidelity can be defined as &#x02018;the adherent and competent delivery of an intervention by the interventionist as set forth in the research plan&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Adopting the &#x02018;Technology Model of Intervention Fidelity&#x02019; whereby the intervention package includes a manual, training, and incorporates regular monitoring of the interventionist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] may increase the likelihood of carers implementing iCST as specified in the treatment protocol.</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Methodology strengths</title><p>Focus groups and interviews were selected as complementary methods of data collection to gather data with both depth and breadth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. An advantage of implementing a combination of methods, is that we were able to gather data from carers and people with dementia with a range of experiences efficiently, and supplement the emergent opinions and comments with in depth data gathered from the interviews [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Furthermore, it is thought that the use of a combination of qualitative methods can give more accurate and reliable response to research questions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Methodology limitations</title><p>A limitation of the focus group data gathered about iCST activities from people with dementia is that the activities were carried out in a setting bearing no resemblance to the intended intervention. However, an advantage of carrying out interviews is that the activities could be tested in a one-to-one capacity, which gave us a more representative insight into the quality and the appropriateness of the activities. As described earlier (see &#x02018;<xref rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec">methods&#x02019;</xref>), three of each type of focus group (person with dementia, carer, and collaborative) were planned, however only six were carried out due to time constraints. At times the general outlook and perceptions of the carers participating in each of the focus groups were notably different. A further carer group may have been useful to moderate some of the more conflicting opinions expressed. However, when the data gathered from the 10 individual interviews was considered alongside the data from the focus groups, it appeared that many points were reiterated by multiple participants, indicating adequate data saturation.</p><p>Across all of the focus groups, at times it was difficult for the moderators to keep the carers and people with dementia &#x02018;on topic&#x02019;. In the people with dementia groups this may have occurred because focus group discussions rely on short-term memory and verbal communication, which are typically impaired [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Some carers saw the groups as an opportunity to share experiences or &#x02018;complaints&#x02019; about their caring role in general. Experience of this issue was also reported by Qazi, Spector &#x00026; Orrell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], and appears to be a common limitation in qualitative methods involving service users. The problem of deviation from the questions in the topic guide also occurred in the interviews. Despite this, a substantial amount of informative data was gathered overall by means of both qualitative methods, so the impact of instances of lack of meaningful data was minimal. According to Morgan &#x00026; Kreuger [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] and Morgan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], the quality of data gathered can be attributed to factors such as choice of relevant questions, and appointment of qualified moderators in the data collection. Certainly in this case, the topic guide should have been more closely followed, and perhaps more experienced moderators selected to perform the interviews, as these errors compromised the data quality in some cases.</p><p>The groups could have been more ethnically diverse, with a majority of attendees being of a white ethnic background. The data was used to inform the development of the second draft of the manual, thus the activities included in the programme and materials included in the activity workbook may not have cross-cultural appeal. However, in line with work on group CST, it is likely that cultural adaptation would be needed for different groups.</p></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>The development of iCST within the context of current research</title><p>Previous studies by Moniz-Cook <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], Quayhagen &#x00026; Quayhagen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] and Onder <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] have been influential in the development of the iCST programme. The intervention piloted by Moniz-Cook <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] consisted of active training in memory management including, cognitive stimulation, orientation, and counselling with psycho-educative elements. Due to the multi-component nature of the intervention it is difficult to determine exactly how the cognitive stimulation element contributed to the positive outcomes reported. However, given that iCST is a well-defined programme cognitive stimulation alone, the impact of participation for people with dementia and carers will be more directly measurable. Although the intervention tested by Onder <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] was structured and manualised, no formal measures of adherence were collected, thus the level of treatment fidelity could not be established. The potential risk of failure to adhere to the intervention as specified in the protocol is that any potential benefits of participation may be compromised or underestimated. In order to maximize treatment fidelity, plans to collect detailed adherence data at frequent intervals have been built into the design of the iCST trial to ensure the intervention is delivered as intended. Finally, the iCST trial will benefit from having a larger sample of participants than the previous studies identified.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec30" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The proposed idea of an individualised, home based programme of CST and the sample materials presented were well received by both carers and people with dementia. The focus groups and interviews yielded valuable insight into the feasibility of the programme. Carers&#x02019; estimations of feasibility appeared to be shaped by their preconceptions about iCST and the anticipated experience of delivering an intervention. These preconceptions, especially those focusing on difficulties or negative outcomes, could create barriers in the delivery and effective implementation of the programme. The findings of the groups and interviews were valuable in that they identified these potential barriers at an early stage. The next phase in the trial will be to field test the programme prior to a large scale RCT in accordance with the guidelines outlined in the MRC Framework.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-list><def-item><term>APA</term><def><p>American Psychiatric Association</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CB</term><def><p>Caregiver burden</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CST</term><def><p>Cognitive Stimulation Therapy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DSM-IV</term><def><p>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4<sup>th</sup> Edition)</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HTA</term><def><p>Health Technology Assessment</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>iCST</term><def><p>Individual Cognitive Stimulation Therapy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Maintenance CST</term><def><p>Maintenance Cognitive Stimulation Therapy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MRC</term><def><p>Medical Research Council</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NELFT</term><def><p>North East London Foundation Trust</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NHS</term><def><p>National Health Service</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NICE</term><def><p>National Institute of Clinical Excellence</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RCT</term><def><p>Randomised Controlled Trial</p></def></def-item></def-list></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>LY prepared the manuscript based on a chapter of her PhD thesis.
