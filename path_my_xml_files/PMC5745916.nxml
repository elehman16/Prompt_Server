In particular, patients with cancer of the upper gastrointestinal tract (GIT) have an increased risk for malnutrition-associated, postoperative complications. Malnutrition weakens the immune system, which in turn increases the risk for infections and impaired wound healing. In addition, postoperative hypermetabolism leads to an increased energy and protein demand, which can result in or contribute to malnutrition of these vulnerable patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In patients with adenocarcinoma of the stomach or the esophago-gastric junction staged cT2 cN+ cM0 up to cT4 cN+ cM0, neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) followed by the oncological resection of the tumor is the standard therapy concept in Germany [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The PERCOG trial aims to resolve the question if supportive parenteral nutrition during the NACT of these patients can decrease the incidence of postoperative complications following the oncological tumor resection. Reporting of postoperative complications in surgical trials is often non-standardized and thus results are difficult to assess and compare between trials. Therefore, the chosen primary endpoint of the PECOG trial is the Comprehensive Complication Index (CCI), which includes all types of postoperative complications independent of their severity and has been shown to be more sensitive than other existing morbidity endpoint [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Previous trials</title><p id="Par31">Several studies previously investigated the effect of preoperative nutritional interventions on the postoperative outcome after abdominal surgery. However, their results are not unequivocal. A multicenter cohort study of 512 patients showed that preoperative supportive nutrition significantly reduced the risk of postoperative complications after abdominal surgery in patients at risk for malnutrition (Nutritional Risk Score [NRS 2002]&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;5) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In these patients, the preoperative nutrition intervention also significantly reduced the length of postoperative hospital stay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Many other studies did include only small patient numbers and/or showed methodological flaws and/or did not investigate clinically relevant endpoints. In a meta-analysis of 13 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), preoperative parenteral nutrition reduced the rate of postoperative complications about 10% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. However, the included trials differed substantially in included indications, operations, and endpoints. In another meta-analysis of 26 RCTs, it was shown that preoperative lipid-free parenteral nutrition reduced the rate of postoperative complications in malnourished patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. However, the definitions of malnutrition in the included studies varied largely. A systematic review and meta-analysis of the Cochrane Group also showed that preoperative parenteral nutrition of malnourished patients reduced the risk for severe postoperative complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Significantly, only three RCTs were included in this meta-analysis, since all other trials failed to fulfil the required quality of reporting. Finally, another systematic review of 41 trials (including non-RCTs) did not support these results. Even if a slightly reduced rate of postoperative complications was observed in the group of patients receiving preoperative parenteral nutrition, it failed to achieve statistical significance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In addition, several studies investigated the question, which surgical patients could especially benefit from preoperative nutritional support. Results from two older trials suggest that patients with malignancies of the upper GIT could especially benefit from preoperative nutritional support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. These results were confirmed by a more recent RCT, in which the subgroup of patients with malignancies of the GIT showed the most significant effect of the preoperative nutritional support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par32">In conclusion, the existing evidence implies that preoperative parenteral nutrition can reduce the rate of postoperative complications after surgery for malignancies of the upper GIT. This group of patients is exposed to an increased risk of malnutrition because of the reduced food intake due to the anatomical location of the tumor, as well as nausea and loss of appetite, which are frequently caused by the NACT. Therefore, many of these patients experience clinically relevant loss of weight during NACT.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Objective</title><p id="Par33">This multicenter clinical RCT aims to improve the general condition of patients with non-metastasized gastric cancer or cancer of the esophago-gastric junction during NACT by supportive parenteral nutrition, in order to decrease the postoperative CCI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The results of the PERCOG trial will provide high-level evidence for clinical recommendations regarding the use of preoperative supplemental parenteral nutrition and provide all participating patients the opportunity of an improved treatment.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec6"><title>Trial sites</title><p id="Par34">The PERCOG trial will be conducted in at least four surgical departments (university hospitals), all of which are members of the German surgical trial network (CHIR-<italic>Net</italic>) and have previously participated in multicenter trials within this network.

</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Randomization and blinding</title><p id="Par40">Before inclusion in the trial, a GCP-certified investigator will perform the screening and detailed information of patients and will obtain their written informed consent. A member of the study team will perform randomization after completion of study visit 1. An online tool of the Munich Center of Clinical Trials (<italic>M&#x000fc;nchner Studien Zentrum</italic> [MSZ]) will be used to generate the allocation sequence. This online tool uses pre-defined randomization lists, which will be created block-wise at the Institute of Medical Statistics and Epidemiology of the TUM. Basic characteristics of the patient and day of randomization must be documented on the printed randomization sheets. Subsequently, randomization sheets must be stored away from the patient records and trial documents to assure blinding. To ensure observer blinding, the assessment of primary and secondary outcomes will be performed by medical doctors, which are not otherwise integrated in the conduct of the trial and blinded to the group allocation of participants. Observers will be surgeons of spatially separated participating study centers, specifically trained in the assessment of the CCI. The observer training has to be documented on a separate training log. The observers will receive the patient&#x02019;s surgical file only. Before sending the file, it has to be verified that this file contains data on the postoperative treatment only and no data that allow conclusions about the pre-surgical supportive treatment. All patient-related data and data concerning the study intervention have to be blanked out. The oncological file, in which the study specific treatment is documented, will not be available to the independent observers. To ensure blinding, the observers will not perform patient visits but assess the CCI on basis of the surgical file only. Blinding of patients is not feasible. Unblinding of the local principal investigator is permissible if significant hazards for individuals&#x02019; safety or welfare occur.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Interventions</title><sec id="Sec13"><title>Experimental intervention</title><p id="Par41">In the experimental group, patients will receive supportive parenteral nutrition containing 600&#x000a0;kcal per day via a central line (e.g. intravascular port system) in addition to their regular enteral nutrition. The enteral nutrition will be documented in a specific &#x0201c;nutrition diary.&#x0201d; For the parenteral nutrition, multi-chamber-bags containing amino acids, glucose, and lipids have to be used. On demand, vitamins, electrolytes, and micronutrients (trace elements) can be added. The choice of product is left to the local home care service and is not bound to a specific manufacturer. If the patient is unable to achieve his daily calorie requirement by enteral nutrition, the missing calories will be added to the 600&#x000a0;kcal of parenteral nutrition. A dietary assistant or a member of the study team will recalculate the daily calorie requirement once weekly, in the framework of the routine clinical evaluation during the NACT. The daily calorie requirement is calculated as follows:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par42">women: 25&#x000a0;kcal/kg of the ideal body weight (IBW)</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par43">men: 30&#x000a0;kcal/kg of the IBW</p></list-item></list>
</p><p id="Par44">The daily supportive parenteral nutrition will start with the first day of preoperative chemotherapy until the day of surgery. The administration will be effectuated by qualified nurses and can take place at the patient&#x02019;s home if an ambulatory home care service is organized. The beginning of the supportive nutritional therapy will be documented in the electronic case report form (eCRF). In addition, the home care service will record the administration on a separate log.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Control intervention</title><p id="Par45">The control group will not receive any supportive parenteral nutrition during the preoperative chemotherapy. The enteral nutrition will be documented in a specific &#x0201c;nutrition diary,&#x0201d; since it cannot be ruled out that the control group patients will increase their calorie intake due to the participation in this trial. To ensure that patients in the control group are not at risk for malnutrition during the chemotherapy, the NRS 2002 screening will be repeated at study visit 4. If patients are not able to cover&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;25&#x02013;50% of their daily calorie requirement by enteral nutrition alone, they will be provided with additional supportive parenteral nutrition as well.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Permitted and not permitted medication(s)/treatment(s)</title><p id="Par46">No additional study-specific treatments will be performed within the trial. If indicated for medical reasons, all kinds of medication are permitted during the trial. Postoperative medication with adverse effects on the immune system (e.g. corticoids and other immunosuppressive agents) will be recorded in the eCRF.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Risks</title><p id="Par47">Except for the administration of the parenteral nutrition in the experimental group and the survey of questionnaires, no additional study-specific examinations or interventions outside of the clinical routine will be applied. No additional risks for study patients are anticipated, since parenteral nutrition represents a clinically established standard method and all products are approved for this indication in Germany (in-label). Parenteral nutrition during chemotherapy of malnourished patients is explicitly recommended by current clinical guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The implantation of a central venous port system is required for the application of the preoperative chemotherapy. The blood samples will be taken during clinical routine evaluation of chemotherapy toxicity. The surgical procedure will be performed according to local standards. Adverse effects of parenteral nutrition include a slightly increased risk of port system infections. Therefore, only qualified personnel will perform the administration of parenteral nutrition in the PERCOG trial. This mildly increased risk is outweighed by the potential benefit of reduced postoperative complications by supportive parenteral nutrition, which has already been demonstrated in intensive care unit (ICU) patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The individuals&#x02019; safety is ensured by regular study visits, enforcing GCP guidelines. Furthermore, according to AMG, each patient will be provided with insurance coverage for any potential harms from trial participation. The study will be planned, conducted, and analyzed according to all relevant national and international rules and regulations (AMG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], ICH-GCP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], Declaration of Helsinki [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]).</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Outcome measures</title><p id="Par48">The primary efficacy endpoint of this trial is the absolute value of the CCI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] on postoperative day 30, after the oncological resection.

If control group patients fail to meet 25&#x02013;50% of their calorie demand by enteral nutrition alone, parenteral nutrition will be initiated according to the procedures in the experimental group.</p><p id="Par58">At study visit 5, before the surgical procedure, the duration, dosage, and end-date of NACT will be documented. In addition, ECOG score, AEs/SAEs, anthropometric data, and nutrition diaries will be assessed. A physical exam will be performed and routine laboratory values checked for anomalies. Furthermore, the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire will be re-assessed. Documented parameters of the surgical procedure (visit 6) include the type and duration of the surgical procedure performed, as well as any intraoperative complications. Postoperatively, the local study personnel will perform three study visits on which physical exams will be performed, routine laboratory values checked, and all postoperative complications documented. Visit 8 on the day of hospital discharge additionally includes documentation of the length of ICU stay and the pathology report of the tumor (TNM stage). On visit 9, the primary endpoint will be assessed by independent observers, according to the procedures explained earlier. All postoperative complications, their duration, and severity will be documented according to the Clavien Dindo classification and subsequently used for the calculation of the CCI. In addition, a physical exam will be performed and the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire reassessed.</p><p id="Par59">To promote complete follow-up, patients who will already have been discharged from the hospital by the time of the study visits will be compensated for any travel expenses necessary to ensure participant retention. If, however, the patient is unable to attend visit 9 due to postoperative treatment in a rehabilitation facility or for other medical reasons, a standardized protocol for evaluation and documentation will have to be filled out by the treating physician.</p><p id="Par60">At the end of the clinical study, all study-relevant data must be archived for at least ten years. Patient identification lists and patient files will be separately retained in the respective study sites. The infrastructure and the personnel for the data management will be provided by the Data Management Center at the MSZ, a member of the German Network of Coordinating Centers for Clinical Trials (<italic>Koordinierungszentren f&#x000fc;r Klinische Studien</italic> [KKS]). The eCRFs are checked for completeness, plausibility, and correctness at entry. The investigator is responsible for the accuracy and verifiability of each entry. Validating programs as well as individual inspection of data through the MSZ will ensure completeness, validity, and plausibility. Each remaining question or missing response is documented through data clarification requests, to which the investigator is obliged to respond as quickly as possible.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Access to data and dissemination of results</title><p id="Par61">Only the sponsor, personnel authorized by the sponsor, and the trial statistician will have access to the final dataset. Limited access for local investigators will be regulated in the Clinical Trial Agreement. After completion of the clinical study, the coordinating principal investigator will prepare a multicenter manuscript of the study results for publication in a reputable scientific journal. Authorship eligibility will be regulated in the Clinical Trial Agreement. The publication of the principal results from any single-center experience within the trial is not allowed until the preparation and publication of the multicenter results.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Monitoring</title><p id="Par62">Monitoring will be performed by the MSZ, an institution experienced in the monitoring of multicenter, surgical RCTs, in order to guarantee high quality of the study conduct and data retrieval. Monitoring will be carried out in accordance with ICH-GCP guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Monitors will visit all participating centers on a regular basis, starting with an initiation visit at each site. Furthermore, close-out visits are planned for each center. A monitoring manual describing the scope of the monitoring activity in detail will be provided. The monitor is authorized to compare trial documents and original data in adherence to data protection rights. The investigator provides direct access of patient&#x02019;s documents/original source data to the monitor at any time. The monitor will also have regular contact to all participating centers and the sponsor. Furthermore, as part of quality assurance according to GCP, the sponsor and the competent health authorities have the right to audit/inspect the trial sites and any other institutions involved in the trial.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Safety evaluation and reporting of adverse events</title><p id="Par63">All AEs/SAEs from the moment of randomization until the last study visit have to be assessed, documented, and reported by the local clinical investigator or designated sub-investigator. Postoperative complications and surgical complications do not have to be documented as AE/SAE, but will be documented according to the Clavien Dindo Classification (visits 7&#x02013;9). During preoperative chemotherapy (visits 2&#x02013;5), changes of laboratory parameters that are expected because of the underlying illness and that are graded&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;3 according to CTCAE v4.03 do not have to be reported as AEs.</p><p id="Par64">SAEs have to be reported within 24&#x000a0;h and will be classified by intensity, outcome, and causality. Exceptions are: (1) hospital treatment planned before inclusion in the study; (2) planned admission to the hospital for NACT; and (3) hospital admissions because of the underlying disease as long as they are not because of an aggravation of the disease.</p><p id="Par65">All SAEs will be subject to a second assessment by a designated person who will be independent from the reporting investigator and the trial sponsor. According to AMG and GCP regulations, the ethics committee and the competent federal health authority will be informed of all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) and all SAEs resulting in death or being life-threatening. Safety reports resuming all AE/SAEs have to be compiled regularly by the principal investigator to reassess the risk&#x02013;benefit analysis.</p><p id="Par66">If a female participant gets pregnant during the trial, the investigator has to report the pregnancy to the sponsor within 24&#x000a0;h after becoming aware of it.
