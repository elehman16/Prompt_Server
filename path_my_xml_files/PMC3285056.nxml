In young, otherwise healthy patients laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) is the treatment of choice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. In elderly patients with major comorbidity and seriously ill patients, especially those already admitted to an intensive care unit, percutaneous cholecystostomy (PC) seems preferable since acute LC in these patients can result in serious morbidity (up to 41%[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]) and mortality (up to 4.5%[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]). But there is a remaining subgroup of patients who can be defined as "high risk patients" based on their comorbidity or disease severity but do not fit in either of the two afore-mentioned categories.</p><p>Both LC and PC are often used in this subgroup of patients but clear selection criteria for either treatment are lacking and a number of questions regarding the safety and efficacy of PC remain.</p><p>In the Dutch guidelines for the treatment of gallstone disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] PC is indicated as a useful treatment option in patients deemed unfit for surgery but it is left open to discussion whether routine use of PC has additional value over antibiotic treatment in the therapy of ACC in the general population. Little evidence is provided to support this statement.</p><p>Most studies in the current literature addressing PC as a therapeutic option in ACC in high risk patients are retrospective with limited population sizes. Success rates are fairly high, but mortality rates of PC (range 4-12.7%[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]) are higher than those for LC. This could be attributed to selection bias as it is to be expected that those patients treated with PC were in a worse clinical condition than those treated with LC.</p><p>A systematic review conducted in 2007[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] analyzed the safety and efficacy of PC in elderly and critically ill patients. The review identified no clinical trials comparing PC with LC and the included studies were mostly retrospective and involved small patient populations. With a success rate of 91% in patients with confirmed ACC and a procedure related mortality of 0.4% results of PC seemed promising. The overall mortality was 12.7% and the overall complication rate was reported to be 6.2%. Complication rates were not included in more than half of the studies thus leading to an underestimation of the actual complication rate.</p><p>We performed a retrospective review of all patients undergoing PC for acute calculous cholecystitis between January 2009 and June 2010 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. A total of 27 patients were included with a median age of 83 years. PC was performed because of either comorbidity/age or duration of symptoms. The success rate was 92.6% (N = 25) but the complication rate was 22.2% (N = 6). The overall mortality rate was 14.8% (n = 4) and the procedure related mortality rate 3.7% (N = 1). With a mean follow-up of eight weeks three patients developed recurrent cholecystitis and four patients underwent an interval cholecystectomy.</p><p>Current literature and data from our own clinical experience fail to answer the question which therapy is the best option in ACC in high risk patients. At present both treatment strategies are used in this patient category and the preference and expertise of the responsible surgeon or the general opinion within the hospital usually determines the choice of treatment.</p><p>The CHOCOLATE trial is designed to assess which treatment modality is best suited for high risk patients with ACC, with the aim to prove superiority of the laparoscopic cholecystectomy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Design</title><p>The CHOCOLATE trial is a randomised controlled, open, parallel, superiority multicenter study.

Secondary approval was obtained from all local ethics committees in the participating centres.</p><p>Patients will give oral as well as written informed consent prior to randomisation.</p><p>The CHOCOLATE trial is registered in the Dutch Trial Register with identification number NTR2666.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Statistical aspects</title><sec><title>Sample size calculation</title><p>The rates for the primary endpoint: major morbidity, re-intervention and mortality for PC were 6.2, 13.1 and 12.7% respectively in the review and 22.2, 18.5 and 14.8% in our own series. We believe that the 6.2% complication rate in the review is an underestimation of the actual rate, but our own value of 22.2% was based on a retrospective, selected group of patients to undergo PC mostly because of their comorbidity. In these patients the complication rate may very well be higher than in the intended population of the CHOCOLATE trial. We therefore chose to combine both complication rates and use the mean value for our sample size calculation: 14.2%.</p><p>Morbidity rates for LC in high risk patients vary greatly in current literature and are mainly based on small, retrospective populations. Mortality rates are described to be around 4.5%. In our own series the complication rate was 13.6% and the mortality rate was 4.3%.</p><p>Our endpoint comprises major complications and mortality. These rates cannot be simply added to each other since mortality is in most case associated with major complications. We therefore chose to add intervention rates and complication rates and add up a hypothetical 1% for mortality to ensure that no cases positive for the primary endpoint were missed.</p><p>A decrease of the primary endpoint from 28.3% (PC group) to 14.6% (LC group) with power 80%, alpha two-sided 5%, Fisher exact, two proportions, 1:1 randomization can be demonstrated by randomizing 2 &#x000d7; 140 patients (PS Power and Sample Size Calculations, version 2.1.30, February 2003). With an expected loss to follow up of 1%, a total of 284 patients will have to be included in the trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Descriptive statistics</title><p>Dichotomous data and counts will be presented in frequencies. Continuous data will be presented in means with a standard deviation or median value with a range.</p></sec><sec><title>Analyses</title><p>All patients will be analysed according to the intention to treat approach. Baseline balance will be assessed based on the following patient factors: APACHE-II score, sex, age, duration of symptoms, previous abdominal surgery and previous biliary history. A significant difference (p-value &#x0003c; 0.05) in any of these factors between the two treatment groups will be considered to be an imbalance, the most important factors being APACHE-II score and age. Although we do not expect this to occur, results within the treatment groups will be stratified according to APACHE-II score and age to assure reliable results.</p><p>For nominal data the Chi-Square test will be used. For continuous data and counts the independent sample t-test or one-way ANOVA will be used.</p><p>In the interim analysis (after one year) the occurrence of the primary endpoint will be compared between the two treatment groups. After the one year follow up of the last patient is completed primary as well as secondary outcomes will be analyzed and compared.</p><p>Results will be presented as odds ratios with a corresponding 95% confidence interval. A two-tailed P &#x0003c; 0.05 is considered statistically significant.</p></sec><sec><title>Premature termination of the study</title><p>The results of the interim analysis performed after the first year of inclusion will be evaluated by the independent DSMB. The primary endpoint will be monitored for benefit or harm using a restricted procedure (Whitehead, 1997), designed according to the sample size characteristics as described in the protocol. The Peto approach will be followed meaning that the study will only be stopped for beneficial effects in case of a p-value &#x0003c; 0.001.</p><p>Safety monitoring will be performed specifically for mortality with a two-sided type I error (&#x003b1;) of 0.05. A relative risk of &#x02265; 2 will be considered reason to advise to terminate the trial.</p><p>The trial will not be stopped for futility, the reason being that this is the first randomized controlled trial on this subject and treatment policy will be based on this trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Feasibility</title><p>The CHOCOLATE trial was registered in the Dutch Trial Register on December 27<sup>th </sup>2010. Approval from the medical ethical committee was obtained on January 20<sup>th </sup>2011 and the first patient was randomised on February 23<sup>rd </sup>2011. Presently local approval by the ethical committees has been obtained in 15 participating centres and six more centres have already been invited tot participate in the study.

Current literature does not provide an answer to the essential question which is the better therapy: LC or PC? The CHOCOLATE trial is designed with the aim to determine superiority of the LC.</p><p>The best design for a therapeutic trial is a randomised placebo-controlled, double-blind study but considering the different interventions used in the CHOCOLATE trial design is not feasible and therefore a randomised open comparative design was chosen.</p><p>It is generally accepted that in young, otherwise healthy patients LC is the treatment of choice for ACC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. In elderly patients with major comorbidity or seriously ill patients PC seems preferable. A subgroup of patients remains which on the basis of co-morbidity or disease severity can be defined as higher risk patients but cannot be assigned to either of the mentioned categories. In this subgroup of patients it remains unclear from which treatment option they will benefit the most with the least risks. The definition of this subgroup was set by a multicentre, multidisciplinary expert panel. A number of imaginary case scenarios including age, comorbidity, vital signs and laboratory findings on presentation were presented to the panel. Subsequently the panel was asked which therapy (LC or PC) they would choose for their patient and whether either one would be contra-indicated. Multiple scoring systems were evaluated by the panel and the APACHE-II score proved the best system to discriminate between patient groups. There was consensus that patients scoring &#x0003c; 7 should undergo emergency LC, and patients scoring &#x0003e; 14 were to have PC. In patients scoring between 7 and 14, opinions differed and no consensus was reached regarding which treatment was better, resulting in the inclusion criterion of the APACHE-II score of 7-14.</p><p>We incorporated the condition that all LC patients need to be operated on by or under supervision of a laparoscopically experienced surgeon to ensure that all patients receive the best possible treatment. A previous study demonstrated significantly higher conversion rates in LC for ACC when the surgery was performed by non-laparoscopic surgeons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].
