Jaeschke et al define the MCID as &#x0201c;the smallest difference in score in the domain of interest which patients perceive as beneficial and which would mandate, in the absence of troublesome side-effects and excessive cost, a change in the patient&#x02019;s management.&#x0201d;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-copd-4-245">14</xref> For example, the St. George&#x02019;s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), used to measure health status in COPD patients, has been validated and is used extensively in COPD. For the SGRQ, a change of 4 units (from a 100 point scale) is considered the MCID.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-copd-4-245">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-copd-4-245">16</xref> There is currently no MCID identified for a change in exacerbations of COPD; however, the occurrence of a single exacerbation is implicitly meaningful in terms of its clinical and cost impact and subsequent outcomes. It can therefore be argued that it is inappropriate to determine an MCID for exacerbations.</p><p>Interventions that reduce the risk of experiencing an exacerbation or reduce the frequency of exacerbations would be expected to have a consequent desirable impact on morbidity, health care costs and possibly on mortality. To date, several interventions have been proposed as potentially reducing exacerbations of COPD.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-copd-4-245">1</xref> However, the recognition of a positive effect does not necessarily translate into a broad recommendation for maintenance use to prevent or reduce exacerbations. The effect must be balanced with the known safety profile of the intervention and the clinical relevance of the effect.</p><p>An analysis of trials in the clinical development of tiotropium allows the opportunity to examine the relationship between exacerbation and other relevant outcomes and whether the concept of an MCID could be applied to exacerbations of COPD. Tiotropium is an inhaled anticholinergic for the treatment of COPD that leads to a minimum of 24-hour bronchodilation with once-daily dosing. This sustained bronchodilation is thought to be a result of the prolonged dissociation half-life from the muscarinic M<sub>3</sub> receptor (approximately 35 hours).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-copd-4-245">17</xref> Previously reported clinical trials of 1-year and of 6-months duration have demonstrated that tiotropium improves lung function, dyspnea, exercise tolerance and health status.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-copd-4-245">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-copd-4-245">22</xref> In addition, tiotropium trials have shown consistent effects on reducing exacerbations of COPD.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-copd-4-245">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-copd-4-245">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-copd-4-245">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-copd-4-245">24</xref> The objective of the present report is to use the data from two 1-year tiotropium vs placebo-controlled clinical trials<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-copd-4-245">18</xref> to examine the relationship of frequency of exacerbations and other outcomes relevant to COPD such as the St. George&#x02019;s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), and the transition dyspnea index (TDI).

The major inclusion and exclusion criteria for the trials were designed to include patients with stable COPD, exclude those with asthma, and exclude those with potentially unstable, serious co-morbid conditions that would interfere with either the interpretation of the results or the ability of the patient to complete studies of 1 year duration.</p><p>During the treatment period, all patients who participated in these one-year studies, including those randomized to placebo, were permitted to take their previously prescribed respiratory medications for COPD with the exception of long-acting beta-adrenergic agonists (LABAs) and inhaled anticholinergic agents. All patients were provided with a short-acting beta-agonist (albuterol) to use as-needed for rescue relief of symptoms. Patients were permitted medications to treat exacerbations as medically indicated.

Tiotropium improved mean FEV<sub>1</sub> in patients in all categories of frequency of COPD exacerbations (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-copd-4-245">Table 1</xref>).

With tiotropium, the percent change from baseline (calculated as percent of mean change from baseline versus mean baseline) in FEV<sub>1</sub> was +12.6%, +12.0%, +2.1% and +8.9% for exacerbation frequencies of 0, 1, 2, &#x0003e;2, respectively. The placebo group showed a reduction in FEV<sub>1</sub> at all frequencies of COPD exacerbations. In the placebo group, increasing frequency of exacerbations was generally associated with a higher rate of decline over one year. In the placebo group, the percent change from baseline in FEV<sub>1</sub> was &#x02212;3.4%, &#x02212;3.4%, &#x02212;5.7% and &#x02212;6.7% for exacerbation frequencies of 0, 1, 2, &#x0003e;2, respectively.

Furthermore, we wanted to evaluate if the clinical relevance of a reduction in exacerbations in patients participating in controlled clinical trials could be determined. In the present analysis the frequency of exacerbations was shown to be directionally associated with changes in spirometry, dyspnea, and health status of the patient&#x02019;s COPD. Our data suggest that reductions in the frequency of exacerbations rates of 4.4% to 42.0% were associated with meaningful changes in questionnaire based instruments.</p><p>Based on the significant health care costs, and increased morbidity and mortality related to exacerbations of COPD,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-copd-4-245">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-copd-4-245">4</xref> it could be argued that any reduction in exacerbations is meaningful. Examination of the relationships of exacerbations with patient-related outcomes is worth in understanding the clinical impact of a reduction or increase in frequency of exacerbations. While the associations of exacerbations with other outcomes are recognized, it is not proven in a clinical trial that a change in the frequency of exacerbations has an impact on other outcomes that can be considered meaningful. Knowledge of such associations with exacerbations could help to determine the threshold at which a therapeutic intervention is warranted. For example, an extremely small (eg, 1%) decrease in exacerbations may be statistically significant but not of sufficient clinical importance to justify prescription of an intervention based on costs, side effects and other considerations (ie, efficacy or lack of efficacy on other endpoints). In this study we are showing that the reduction of patient&#x02019;s COPD exacerbation is also associated with an impact in patient-related outcomes.</p><p>In the consideration of any analysis attempting to define clinically important changes, the definition of an exacerbation needs to be clear and regarded as meaningful. The specific definition of COPD exacerbations in published clinical trials has varied, although in general the definitions fall within the framework proposed by a consensus definition published in 2000 as follows: &#x0201c;a sustained worsening of the patient&#x02019;s condition, from the stable state and beyond normal day-to-day variations that is acute in onset and necessitates a change in regular medication in a patient with underlying COPD.&#x0201d;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29-copd-4-245">29</xref> The definition is consistent with the American Thoracic Society and European Respiratory Society definition published in 2004 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30-copd-4-245">30</xref> and the revised GOLD statement.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-copd-4-245">1</xref> There are essentially three components of a definition for exacerbations: a) an implied minimal time frame of the event (ie, day-to-day), b) a degree of change in respiratory symptoms (ie, beyond normal variations, acute in onset), and c) a statement that an intervention is required (ie, change in regular medication).</p><p>There have been relatively few studies looking at the relationship between COPD exacerbations and quality of life in patients with COPD. Seemungal and colleagues showed that exacerbations were more frequent in patients with frequent previous exacerbations (odds ratio = 5.5, <italic>P</italic> = 0.001). Using the median number of exacerbations, patients were classified as infrequent exacerbators (0&#x02013;2) or frequent exacerbators (3&#x02013;8). SGRQ total score was significantly worse in frequent exacerbators (mean difference 14.8, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). In multiple regression analyses, exacerbation frequency was strongly correlated with SGRQ total score and component scores. Conners and colleagues evaluated quality-of-life outcomes in their study of patients hospitalized with acute exacerbations of COPD.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-copd-4-245">10</xref> At 6 months patients were interviewed about their activities of daily living, and 54% required assistance with at least one activity of daily living and 49% considered their health status to be fair or poor. No analysis was conducted on the relationship between readmissions and perceived quality of life.</p><p>Both of the aforementioned investigations support the concept that COPD exacerbations have a negative effect on quality of life in patients with COPD. This association suggests that quality of life is impaired not only in patients who are hospitalized for acute exacerbations of COPD, but also in patients who experience frequent exacerbations that are treated in the ambulatory care setting. Hence, while a survival benefit might be expected from a reduction in COPD exacerbations requiring hospitalization, an improvement in quality of life might be an anticipated outcome of a reduction in overall exacerbations, including those that do not require hospitalization. The present analysis corroborates the hypothesis that exacerbations impact health-related quality-of-life and demonstrates that interventions that reduce exacerbations are associated with improvements in quality of life.</p><p>Donaldson et al evaluated the relationship between exacerbation frequency and decline in lung function in 109 patients (mean age 68.1 years, mean FEV<sub>1</sub> 1.00 (0.7&#x02013;1.3 L) recruited from outpatient clinics in the UK.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31-copd-4-245">31</xref> The mean exacerbation rate was 2.92 exacerbations/year; patients with &#x02265;2.92 exacerbations per year were considered frequent exacerbators; those with &#x02264;2.92 exacerbations per year were considered infrequent exacerbators. FEV<sub>1</sub> data were evaluated over 4 years in 16 frequent exacerbators compared with 16 infrequent exacerbators. In this subgroup, frequent exacerbators were younger (median age 61.6 vs 71.5 years, <italic>P</italic> = 0.03) and a higher number of frequent exacerbators were current smokers (9/16 vs 1/16 respectively). The mean rate of decline in FEV<sub>1</sub> in the total cohort was 36 mL/year. The mean rate of decline in FEV<sub>1</sub> per year was greater in the frequent compared with infrequent exacerbators (40.1 ml/year vs 32.1 ml/year, respectively, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). The present study supports the contention that exacerbations can accelerate the loss of lung function over time and suggests that such changes may possibly be modified by interventions reducing exacerbations; however, it is recognized that firm conclusions cannot be drawn from the present analysis given the relatively short time of study (1 year) and the retrospective nature of the analysis.</p><p>In considering an MCID for exacerbations, we recognize that the present retrospective analyses has several limitation and do not establish a precise association of the frequency or severity of exacerbations with a MCID in a given dyspnea or health status instrument. A limitation to the present analysis is that there was no adjustment for potential confounders such as FEV<sub>1</sub>. In addition, based on the published literature, there is no precedent for establishing a clinically meaningful reduction in COPD exacerbations and it is not the purpose of the present analyses to state that this should be a prerequisite for evaluating interventions. It should also be noted that MCID metrics designed from health status are not generally considered appropriate to apply to a clinical outcome such as exacerbations. MCID is a metric established to confer meaning to patient-reported outcome scales that have no intrinsic meaning (eg, quality of life scales from 0 to 1). It is reasonable to consider that it is inappropriate to seek an MCID for an outcome for which any occurrence is meaningful and has significant associated clinical impact and cost consequence. Nevertheless, this type of analysis was considered in the present manuscript because of the historic difficulty in establishing the cumulative impact of exacerbations and hence the value of their avoidance. It remains reasonable to contend that given the overall consequences of exacerbations on patients with COPD and the lack of treatments that reduce the frequency of exacerbations, an intervention that repeatedly has shown positive effects should be considered highly desirable.</p><p>In summary, clinical data suggest that an increased frequency of exacerbations is associated with worsening quality of life, and a more rapid decline in spirometry over time. Our analysis demonstrated a wide range of changes in the frequency of exacerbations that were associated with clinically meaningful changes in clinical outcomes. The present post-hoc analysis should be viewed cautiously. More data from large databases are required to continue to explore the issues raised in the present discussion.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclosures</bold></p><p>Dr Anzueto had full access to all study data and takes responsibility for data integrity and accuracy of data analysis.
