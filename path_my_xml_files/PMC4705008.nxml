A secondary benefit of these devices is the opportunity for investigators to objectively track adherence to physical activity goals across weeks or even months, rather than relying on self-report or a small number of accelerometry wear periods. The use of consumer trackers for continuous monitoring of adherence has considerable potential to enhance physical activity research, but few studies have been published in this rapidly developing area.</p></sec><sec sec-type="objective"><title>Objective</title><p>The objective of the study was to assess the trajectory of physical activity adherence across a 16-week self-monitoring intervention, as measured by the Fitbit tracker.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Participants were 25 overweight or obese, postmenopausal women enrolled in the intervention arm of a randomized controlled physical activity intervention trial. Each participant received a 16-week technology-based intervention that used the Fitbit physical activity tracker and website. The overall study goal was 150 minutes/week of moderate to vigorous intensity physical activity (MVPA) and 10,000 steps/day; however, goals were set individually for each participant and updated at Week 4 based on progress. Adherence data were collected by the Fitbit and aggregated by Fitabase. Participants also wore an ActiGraph GT3X+ accelerometer for 7 days prior to the intervention and again during Week 16.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The median participant logged 10 hours or more/day of Fitbit wear on 95% of the 112 intervention days, with no significant decline in wear over the study period. Participants averaged 7540 (SD 2373) steps/day and 82 minutes/week (SD 43) of accumulated &#x0201c;fairly active&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;very active&#x0201d; minutes during the intervention. At Week 4, 80% (20/25) of women chose to maintain/increase their individual MVPA goal and 72% (18/25) of participants chose to maintain/increase their step goal. Physical activity levels were relatively stable after peaking at 3 weeks, with only small declines of 8% for steps (<italic>P</italic>=.06) and 14% for MVPA (<italic>P</italic>=.05) by 16 weeks.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>These data indicate that a sophisticated, direct-to-consumer activity tracker encouraged high levels of self-monitoring that were sustained over 16 weeks. Further study is needed to determine how to motivate additional gains in physical activity and evaluate the long-term utility of the Fitbit tracker as part of a strategy for chronic disease prevention.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>Clinicaltrials.gov NCT01837147; http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01837147 (Archived by WebCite at http://www.webcitation.org/6d0VeQpvB)</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>exercise</kwd><kwd>health behavior</kwd><kwd>health promotion</kwd><kwd>Internet</kwd><kwd>mHealth</kwd><kwd>motor activity</kwd><kwd>physical activity</kwd><kwd>technology</kwd><kwd>women</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Physical inactivity is related to increased risk of several chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease, stroke, Type 2 diabetes, and cancer [<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Yet when assessed using objective measures, only 2-3% of middle aged and older US women are achieving physical activity levels consistent with the national recommendations [<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Web-based technologies, including body-worn sensors and smartphone apps that utilize the phone&#x02019;s onboard accelerometer, are among the most promising approaches to create scalable interventions for this serious public health problem. Analyses of theory-driven diet and physical activity interventions have shown that the component most strongly associated with successful behavior change is self-monitoring when used in combination with at least one additional self-regulatory technique (eg, goal setting, review of previously set goals, frequent behavioral feedback) [<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>-<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Numerous off-the-shelf trackers are now available, many of which align well with these proven behavioral change techniques. These devices, when used within a theory-driven intervention, may therefore provide an efficient way to enable participants to improve self-regulation and adopt healthy behaviors. These trackers and apps have the added benefit of allowing investigators to obtain detailed, real-time feedback on participants&#x02019; activity level and adherence to specific physical activity goals.</p><p>Few published studies have examined the use of accelerometer-based trackers as intervention tools, particularly with regard to the aggregation and analysis of tracker data as a measure of adherence. One such device, the Fitbit, has been shown to be usable and valid for physical activity monitoring [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Published studies using the Fitbit as an intervention tool include 3 single-arm studies [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>-<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and 1 randomized trial among older adults [<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. This study reports in detail the adherence of women assigned to use a clip-on Fitbit tracker as part of a low-touch physical activity intervention. Main study outcomes have been reported previously [<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Participants</title><p>Participants were 25 postmenopausal, overweight or obese women assigned to a 16-week low-touch, Fitbit-based intervention as part of a randomized controlled trial.

Each participant&#x02019;s Fitbit was linked to the Fitabase analytics system (Small Steps Labs, San Diego, CA, USA), which enabled the investigators to remotely monitor physical activity. Fitabase daily totals for steps and intensity-specific minutes of physical activity (PA) were downloaded at the end of the study.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Intervention</title><p>Participants received a Fitbit One physical activity tracker, which clips to the waistband or bra or can be placed in a front pants pocket. An internal accelerometer measures motion which is then aggregated into physical activity data. Summary information (eg, steps) is available on the tracker itself and data are wirelessly uploaded to a personalized website that displays daily steps, minutes/day of activity, and a graph showing the temporal pattern of physical activity during the day and over time (eg, weeks or months).</p><p>To minimize potential barriers to navigating the technology, the project coordinator (1) set up the Fitbit account and tracker for each participant, (2) demonstrated how to download and install the Fitbit software, (3) trained the participant on the website&#x02019;s self-monitoring and self-regulation features, and (4) provided the participant with an intervention handbook with study goals, information on building self-regulation skills, and detailed instructions (including screenshots) on how to install the Fitbit software. The study coordinator guided the participant through an initial goal setting process for moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity (MVPA) and steps and helped her develop a specific plan to achieve those goals. Study goals were 150 minute/week of MVPA and 10,000 steps/day; however, individual goals could be higher or lower. At Week 4, participants received a telephone call to evaluate progress, provide feedback, and update their personalized goals to establish targets for the remaining 12 weeks of the study. The study coordinator was logged into the participant&#x02019;s Fitbit account during the call, enabling her to view an objective assessment of the participant&#x02019;s progress to facilitate the goal setting process.</p></sec><sec><title>Data Analysis</title><p>Analyses were completed using SAS 9.4.

Two additional areas where research is needed are (a) studies testing the use of physical activity sensors for promotion and/or monitoring of physical activity within the health care setting and (b) additional validation studies examining the accuracy of consumer-based sensors compared with standard research measures (eg, ActiGraph) across population subgroups and for different intensities and types of physical activity. Furthermore, new models of the Fitbit and other trackers now include features such as heart rate and global positioning systems (GPS) sensors, which provide additional opportunities for assessing objective, intensity-related data on physical activity adherence. The fast pace of product development and evolution will continue to present new opportunities and challenges for behavioral mHealth research and intervention science.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>Funding provided by the National Cancer Institute (1R03CA168450).
