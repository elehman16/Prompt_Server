In 2010, we developed and implemented a core-competency&#x02013;based COE Diploma program (CC), in lieu of one based on learning objectives (LO). This study assessed the effectiveness of the core-competency&#x02013;based program on residents&#x02019; learning and their training experience as compared to residents trained using learning objectives.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The data from the 2007&#x02013;2013 COE residents were used in the study, with nine and eight residents trained in the LO and CC programs, respectively. Residents&#x02019; learning was measured using preceptors&#x02019; evaluations of residents&#x02019; skills/abilities throughout the program (118 evaluations in total). Residents&#x02019; rating of training experience was measured using the Graduate&#x02019;s Questionnaire which residents completed after graduation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>For residents&#x02019; learning, overall, there was no significant difference between the two programs. However, when examined as a function of the four CanMEDS roles, there were significant increases in the CC residents&#x02019; scores for two of the CanMEDS roles: Communicator/Collaborator/Manager and Scholar compared to residents in the LO program. With respect to residents&#x02019; training experience, seven out of ten program components were rated by the CC residents higher than by the LO residents.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The implementation of a COE CC program appears to facilitate resident learning and training experience.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>care of the elderly</kwd><kwd>core competencies</kwd><kwd>enhanced skills</kwd><kwd>diploma</kwd><kwd>resident</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Care of the Elderly (COE) Diploma programs provide supplementary training on geriatric care to family physicians who have finished a two-year family medicine residency or who are already in practice.<sup>(<xref rid="b1-cgj-19-50" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>)</sup> The program aims to improve the quality and availability of geriatric care in the face of a growing elderly population and the limited number of geriatricians. The College of Family Physicians of Canada (CFPC) recognized the COE program in 1989.<sup>(<xref rid="b2-cgj-19-50" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>)</sup> Since then, the program has grown and is now offered in 15 Canadian medical schools.<sup>(<xref rid="b3-cgj-19-50" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>)</sup></p><p>The COE Program at the University of Alberta was established in 1993. On initiation of the program, residency training was based on learning objectives, with these learning objectives designed to provide residents with requisite medical knowledge and clinical assessment skills. In 2010, we shifted to a program based on core-competencies. The primary goal for introduction of this core-competency&#x02013;based program was to improve training outcomes. Core competencies relate to skills, behaviours, and knowledge that should be gained through a course or series of courses.<sup>(<xref rid="b4-cgj-19-50" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>)</sup> Unlike learning objectives, core competencies define expected levels of overall competence for practice. The change from learning objectives to core competencies was in response to the call for residency programs to use competency-based assessments.<sup>(<xref rid="b4-cgj-19-50" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>)</sup> Through a three-step iterative process described elsewhere,<sup>(<xref rid="b5-cgj-19-50" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>)</sup> we identified and selected 85 core competencies, each defined as fundamental knowledge, skill set, ability or expertise in a specific subject area. These competencies overarch all components of the COE program&#x02014;defining rotation evaluations, overall evaluations, Academic Half-Day curriculum, and Exit Examination.</p><p>The objectives of this study were to assess the effectiveness of a core-competency&#x02013;based program on residents&#x02019; (1) learning and (2) training experience, as compared to residents trained using learning objectives. We hypothesized that the core-competency&#x02013;based program would result in improved learning and training experience as compared to the program based on learning objectives.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Study Design</title><p>We used a pre-test/post-test design among residents who graduated from the program. The pre-intervention period, defined as calendar years 2007&#x02013;2009, had residents trained using a learning-objective&#x02013;based (LO) program. The post-intervention period, defined as calendar years 2010&#x02013;2013, had residents trained using a core-competency&#x02013;based (CC) program. This study received ethics approval from the Health Research Ethics Board at the University of Alberta.</p></sec><sec><title>Setting</title><p>The study involved residents in the Care of the Elderly Diploma Program in the Department of Family Medicine, University of Alberta. All graduates of the program in calendar years 2007&#x02013;2013 were included in the study. The program typically accepts one to three residents a year; hence, for the seven-year period, we had 17 residents as participants in the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Intervention and Outcome Measures</title><p>The intervention was the implementation of a CC program in 2010. This program is based on the residents&#x02019; acquisition of 85 core competencies across 12 domains: cognition, function, mobility, medication, biology of aging, adverse events, incontinence, transitions of care, health-care planning, professionalism, communication, and research.<sup>(<xref rid="b5-cgj-19-50" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>)</sup> Prior to this intervention, the program was based on learning objectives.</p><p>To assess the effectiveness of the intervention, we measured two outcomes: (1) residents&#x02019; learning, and (2) residents&#x02019; training experience. Learning was measured using the preceptors&#x02019; evaluations of the residents&#x02019; skills/abilities throughout the training rotations (e.g., acute care, geriatric psychiatry, longitudinal clinic). Each evaluation was made using a standardized evaluation form. This was a two-page form containing Likert scale items assessing residents&#x02019; learning according to the Canadian Medical Education Directives for Specialists (CanMEDS) roles: Family Medicine Expert, Communicator/Collaborator/ Manager, Professional/Advocate, and Scholar. The Likert scale ranged from 1 (&#x02018;rarely meets&#x02019; expectations) to 5 (&#x02019;consistently exceeds&#x02019; expectations), with an option for N/A (not applicable) (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-cgj-19-50">Table 1</xref>). There also was an open-ended question for preceptor comments and a checkbox for overall assessment (&#x02018;pass&#x02019; or &#x02018;requires program review&#x02019;).</p><table-wrap id="t1-cgj-19-50" position="float"><label>TABLE 1.</label><caption><p>Example items from the Rotation Specific Evaluation Form for each of the four CanMEDS roles</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="none"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>The Family Medicine Expert Role</italic>

The ratings for Professional/Advocate and Scholar roles did not show much variability among residents in the CC and LO programs (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-cgj-19-50">Figure 5</xref>).</p><fig id="f4-cgj-19-50" position="float"><label>FIGURE 4.</label><caption><p>Variability of residents&#x02019; evaluation scores in the LO-Based and CC-Based programs on an item on the Family Medicine Expert role; residents in the LO program showed more variability in their scores than residents in the CC program</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="cgj-19-50f4"/></fig><fig id="f5-cgj-19-50" position="float"><label>FIGURE 5.</label><caption><p>Lack of variability of residents&#x02019; evaluation scores in the LO-Based and CC-Based programs on an item on the Professional/Advocate role</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="cgj-19-50f5"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Training Experience</title><p>The survey was sent to all nine residents in the LO program, with a response rate of 78% (<italic>n</italic> = 7).

The three other residents in the CC program were not given surveys because they were still in training at the time of the study. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6-cgj-19-50">Figure 6</xref>, on seven out of ten program components, percentages of residents rating each program component as a strength within the program were higher in the CC program than in the LO program. Of the seven, the following program components were significantly different: Admission process, Orientation to the program, and Evaluation process of the residents (all <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; .05). The differences between the two groups on the remaining program components were not statistically significant (all <italic>p</italic> &#x0003e; .05).

With the implementation of the CC-based program, our COE residents have improved their learning and have rated the program highly as compared to residents in the LO-based program. The 85 core competencies overarch our entire program and have led to less variability in the evaluations of residents since their introduction. Of interest, this decreased variability is domain-specific, and is seen in two of the four roles but not seen in the Professional/ Advocate and Scholar roles. This is not unexpected, as the skills in the Professional/ Advocate and Scholar roles are developed over many years of medical practice.</p><p>Core competencies are increasingly being used in training programs. As of 2002, the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education has required residency programs to document mastery of six Core Competencies (Patient Care, Medical Knowledge, Practice-Based Learning and Improvement, Interpersonal and Communication Skills, Professionalism, and Systems-Based Practice) and have identified 360 Degree Feedback as useful in doing this.<sup>(<xref rid="b6-cgj-19-50" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>)</sup> Subsequently, in 2005, a survey of American Family Medicine programs showed that 257 out of 287 programs (90%) had begun to implement evaluation programs using precepting, record review, and logs. The survey indicated that Patient Care was identified as the most important core competency, with time listed as the major barrier to implementing core competency evaluation methods.<sup>(<xref rid="b7-cgj-19-50" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>)</sup> These evaluation methods are similar to the sentinel habits used in the University of Alberta&#x02019;s Family Medicine and Care of the Elderly Programs as part of the Competency-Based Achievement System (CBAS).<sup>(<xref rid="b8-cgj-19-50" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>)</sup> This system, which makes use of field notes to provide feedback to residents on a daily basis, ensures core competencies are achieved (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1">Appendix A</xref>). More recently (2013), osteopathic competencies in geriatrics were developed using consensus of a panel of experts. The process resulted in the addition of 14 new competencies and one new domain for osteopathic students to the American Geriatric Society&#x02019;s 26 core competencies over eight domains.<sup>(<xref rid="b9-cgj-19-50" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>)</sup></p><p>One of the limitations of our study is the small sample size. Like many other residency programs, the number of residents enrolled per year is limited. However, our results are informative because many publications detail core-competency development, implementation, and evaluation, but none describe outcomes of implementation. Further, we note that the consistency in the data across years, in both the LO and CC programs, suggests that the findings may be consistent with a larger sample. Another limitation of our study is the reduced breadth of our core competencies. The competencies were selected using consensus and many competencies initially identified were eliminated due to a lack of consensus. What is unknown is whether these core competencies would have been included with a different expert panel.</p><p>Future research in this area includes more long-term evaluation of the effectiveness of the CC-based program. We will continue to evaluate our program and, as we accumulate more data, we will be able to more adequately discern if there are significant differences on the effectiveness of the CC-based program. Finally, we intend to collaborate with other COE Diploma programs in Canada on the implementation of core competencies, and continue to evaluate their relevance to training and practice.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>The implementation of a COE CC-based program appears to facilitate resident learning and training experience. Further development of the CC-based program is currently underway, with the intent to have the program accepted and adapted nationally.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study received funding from the Department of Family Medicine at the University of Alberta.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>CONFLICT OF INTEREST DISCLOSURES</bold></p><p>All the authors have no conflict of interests to declare.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="b1-cgj-19-50"><label>1.</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><collab>The College of Family Physicians of Canada</collab></person-group><source>Specific standards for family medicine residency programs accredited by the College of Family Physicians of Canada (The Red Book)</source><publisher-loc>Mississauga, ON</publisher-loc><publisher-name>College of Family Physicians of Canada</publisher-name><year>2013</year></element-citation></ref><ref id="b2-cgj-19-50"><label>2.</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><collab>Alberta College of Family Physicians</collab></person-group><source>Final report on care of the elderly</source><publisher-loc>Edmonton, AB</publisher-loc><publisher-name>Alberta College of Family Physicians</publisher-name><year>2002</year></element-citation></ref><ref id="b3-cgj-19-50"><label>3.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Charles</surname><given-names>LA</given-names></name><name><surname>Dobbs</surname><given-names>BM</given-names></name><name><surname>McKay</surname><given-names>RM</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Training of specialized geriatric physicians to meet the needs of an aging population&#x02014;a unique care of the elderly physician program in Canada</article-title><source>J Am Geriatr Soc</source><year>2014</year><volume>62</volume><issue>7</issue><fpage>1390</fpage><lpage>92</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1111/jgs.12907</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">25039513</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="b4-cgj-19-50"><label>4.</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="editor"><name><surname>Oandasan</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name><name><surname>Saucier</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name></person-group><source>Triple C Competency-based Curriculum.
