Recent years have experienced a drastic rise in drug abuse among school and university students. Thus, the need for special attention to the issue is deemed important. The present study was conducted with the aim of assessing the impact of life skills training on promotion of drug abuse preventive behaviors.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Methods:</title><p>This field trial experimental study was conducted on 60 students of Gonabad Medical University selected through quota random sampling and assigned randomly into two Intervention and control groups. Data were collected through a questionnaire, including two sections of demographic information and drug abuse preventive behaviors. The questionnaire was first assessed as to its validity and reliability and then administered both before and after educational intervention and also as a follow-up 4 years after intervention &#x02013; Data were then analyzed using <italic>t</italic>-tests and Chi-square.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>Comparison of post-test mean scores of drug abuse preventive behaviors of both groups showed a significant difference (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01) which remained stable 4 years after intervention.

One divides drug abuse prevention into three &#x0201c;comprehensive, selective and obligatory&#x0201d; categories.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Other preventive strategies include life skills training (LST), information improvement, affective education, social influence and drug abuse resistance education.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>Life skills are abilities needed to provide the groundwork for effective stress management and presentation of positive behaviors. These skills enable an individual to accept his social role responsibilities and to face others&#x02019; demands and expectations and daily interpersonal problems effectively without hurting himself or others.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] The term &#x0201c;life skills&#x0201d; involves a big class of socio-psychological and interpersonal skills which help an individual to take conscious decisions, communicate effectively, improve his interactive and self-management skills and adopt an active healthy life-style. Life skills can organize personal, interpersonal and environmental actions in a way to lead to better health, which in turn leads to more physical, psychological and social comfort.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] LST program aimed at drug abuse prevention is a new preventive strategy which primarily focuses on socio-psychological factors leading to drug abuse and mainly emphasizes the promotion of personal and social skills.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>This program was first planned by Gilbert and Botvin from Kernel University to prevent smoking abuse among teenagers in 1997 and was then used for alcohol and drug abuse prevention.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>Researchers have confirmed the positive influence of LST on drug abuse reduction, effective use of intelligence capacity, furthering self-confidence and ego improvement, prevention of aggressive behaviors and suicide and AIDS prevention. Lots of other investigations have also been conducted on other individual and social problems and their solution through LST.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Zollinger <italic>et al</italic>. studied the impact of LST on middle schoolers&#x02019; knowledge, insight and ability to adopt a healthy life-style. Findings reported a lower rate of smoking among those who attended the program compared with those who refused to attend.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>Eisen <italic>et al</italic>. showed a significant difference between pre- and post-test scores of 6239 students. In this study, drug abuse rate among the intervention group was significantly lower than the norm compared to the control group.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Another study by Botvin and Griffin claimed the positive effect of LST on addiction prevention.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] The same Survey tested 4466 students of New York schools for 3 years to investigate the effectiveness of the cognitive-behavioral program of drug abuse prevention. Those who received at least 60% of the intervention program showed a significant drug abuse reduction.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Furthermore, Qaderi indicated that training courses could reduce drug abuse tendency and affect addicts&#x02019; attitude.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>One other survey was carried out by Nazarpoor <italic>et al</italic>. on 243 students of Tabriz Medical University to investigate how LST affects an individual's opinion toward drug abuse prevention. Based on the obtained results, 37.74% of the participants showed information increase. Besides, there was a change or rise in knowledge, insight and assertiveness skills rate after attending LST workshops. A significant relationship was also observed between participants&#x02019; change of attitude toward drug abuse and the rise in social skills due to participation in workshops. Furthermore, a significant relationship was detected between major and gender and social skills promotion rate (A greater change was observed among boys). They concluded that due to its impact on cognitive skills development, attending LST workshops is necessary for all university students.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>Results of a survey in Feredrick University in Germany not only demonstrated the preventive effect of LST on non-smokers and non-drinkers, but also its great impact on smokers and drinkers.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>Moradi <italic>et al</italic>. investigated the effect of drug abuse resistance and prevention skills training on 181 workers of Asalooyeh Petrochemical Company under two intervention and control groups. Results indicated the positive impact of training on the intervention group's knowledge and insight, drug abuse resistance skills, self-efficacy and decision-making in preventive actions.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p><p>In their study, Barati <italic>et al</italic>. showed the positive role of LST in the reduction of abstract norms encouraging drug abuse among university students. This can prove the positive impact of assertiveness training program on modification of beliefs and abstract norms of the youth and also its great influential role in planning and performance of drug abuse prevention training programs, especially in universities.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>The present study was aimed at investigating the effect of LST on promotion of drug abuse preventive behaviors among university students and stability of the results after a 4-year follow-up.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-2"><title>METHOD HOW TO DEVELOP QUESTIONNAIRE FROM THE BEGGINING</title><p>This field trial study was conducted using pre- and post-experimental design with the control group. The population under study included all freshmen of Gonabad Universityof Medical Sciences.

Before the first workshop, all participants of both groups were tested using the research instrument. Four years after intervention (in 2011), all examinees&#x0200a; except for 9 were tested again using the same instrument (4 from the Intervention group and 5 from the control group ceased to continue with the study due to attrition). To control all the confounding variables all participants were under inspection during this period by researchers.</p><p>Data were collected by the use of a researcher made questionnaire including: (a) Demographic information: Age, gender, major, father's and mother's educational level, father's job and habitation. (b) Drug abuse preventive behaviors including: Self-awareness, interactive skills, decisiveness, ability to say &#x0201c;no&#x0201d;, problem - solving, ability to resist others&#x02019; illogical demands, stress management, familiarity with drug abuse side-effects and negative attitude toward drug abuse.

Eight experts on the field commented on the face and qualitative content validity of the questionnaire. Therefore, its face and qualitative content validity was confirmed. Reliability was obtained 82% by using Cronbach's alpha, which was considered acceptable.</p><p>Having taken the required permits, validation of the aims of the study, emphasizing the confidentiality of the results and attracting the trust and consent of the participants, data were collected through distribution of the questionnaires among the target group before and after LST workshops.</p><p>As the study was of a pre- and post-test design, the questionnaires were encoded, so the examinees could be tested both before and after workshops and 4 years after educational intervention.</p><p>Furthermore, to ensure one-way blindness of the intervention, pre-test and post-test were administered by an experienced test-taker who was unaware of the type of intervention. Workshops were held by four experts including two psychiatrists and two clinical psychology masters who had passed LST courses.</p><p>Training techniques included lecturing, discussion, question and answer, role-play, modeling and handing out educational booklets.</p><p>Data were analyzed by the use of SPSS-16 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). and descriptive and analytical analyses such as frequency, mean, standard deviation, <italic>t</italic>-tests and Chi-square test (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0.5)</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Ethical considerations</title><p>Permission to data collection was gained from the Research Ethics Committee of Gonabad University of Medical Sciences.

The findings of this study is in line with the other studies, e.g., Zollinger <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Botvin and Griffin,[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Botvin <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Moradi <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] which confirmed the positive impact of LST on promotion of the intervention group's insight, drug abuse resistance skills, self-efficacy and decision-making balance in preventive activities. Also, Barati <italic>et al</italic>. showed the effectiveness of LST on the reduction of abstract norms encouraging drug abuse among university students which can affirm the positive impact of training on modification of beliefs and abstract norms of the youth.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>Also, the mentioned factors of this study results show that are directly related to psychological capacity which can be improved through LST.</p><p>The findings of this study are also in line with those of Bohler in Feredrick University which demonstrated not only the preventive role of LST among non-smokers and non-drinkers but also its great impact on smokers and drinkers,[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and Smith <italic>et al</italic>. who also claimed the significant impact of LST on leadership and management skills of the youth.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</p><p>Findings also confirm the results of the studies by Samari and Laalyphase who asserted that LST can promote one's interactive skills and social acceptability which can in turn affect drug abuse preventive behaviors[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and Valyany <italic>et al</italic>. who emphasized the importance of LST workshops as they can reduce drug abuse tendency.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</p><p>The study results indicated that the intervention group's observed pre- and post-intervention difference remained stable even in the follow-up test conducted 4 years after the main treatment. This is in line with the findings of Botvin and Griffin who suggested that their 6-year-long educational program confirms the effectiveness of LST on drug abuse prevention[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and Nazarpoor <italic>et al</italic>. which claimed a promotion in the participants&#x02019; knowledge and social skills and also a meaningful increase in the change of outlook toward drug abuse after attending workshops.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] It seems as if the change in the outlook can in the long run reduce drug abuse tendency.</p><p>Our study proved a significant positive relationship between father's educational level and children's knowledge of drug abuse preventive behaviors. This confirms the findings of Babayi that showed students whose parents had a higher academic level had better information about drug abuse.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] Probably families with higher academic levels have more potential skills and use various techniques to promote their children's insight toward drug abuse. This proves the crucial role parents play in forming a proper insight toward drug abuse and in turn in the formation of drug abuse preventive behaviors in their children.</p><p>Our study included some limitations as some samples ceased to go on with the study or were not available for the follow-up test.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>LST can promote interactive, decision-making, problem - solving, critical thinking and stress management skills and lead to more social acceptability, which in turn reduce drug abuse tendency.</p><p>It is recommended
