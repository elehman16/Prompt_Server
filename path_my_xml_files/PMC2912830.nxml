The most common cause of intra-abdominal adhesions is previous intra-abdominal surgical intervention. Up to 74% of intestinal obstructions are caused by post surgical adhesions. Although a variety of methods and agents have been investigated to prevent post surgical adhesions, the problem of peritoneal adhesions remains largely unsolved. Materials serving as an adhesion barrier are much needed.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>This is a prospective, randomised, controlled, patient blinded and observer blinded, single centre phase I-II trial, which evaluates the safety of A-Part<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>Gel as an adhesion prophylaxis after major abdominal wall surgery, in comparison to an untreated control group. 60 patients undergoing an elective median laparotomy without prior abdominal surgery are randomly allocated into two groups of a 1:1- ratio. Safety parameter and primary endpoint of the study is the occurrence of wound healing impairment or peritonitis within 28 (+10) days after surgery. The frequency of anastomotic leakage within 28 days after operation, occurrence of adverse and serious adverse events during hospital stay up to 3 months and the rate of adhesions along the scar within 3 months are defined as secondary endpoints. After hospital discharge the investigator will examine the enrolled patients at 28 (+10) days and 3 months (&#x000b1;14 days) after surgery.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This trial aims to assess, whether the intra-peritoneal application of A-Part<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>Gel is safe and efficacious in the prevention of post-surgical adhesions after median laparotomy, in comparison to untreated controls.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>NCT00646412</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Post surgical adhesions are quite common, i.e. they can affect up to 93% of patients undergoing abdominal surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Adhesions are internal scars developing after trauma and involving the injured tissue and the peritoneum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The magnitude of the problems caused by adhesions was highlighted by several studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Depending on the location and the structure of the adhesion serious complications may be caused thereby, such as large and small bowel obstruction. Pelvic adhesions are associated with infertility in 15-20% of cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. A number of products that help to reduce or to prevent tissue adhesion are marketed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Barrier materials in various forms such as films, viscous gels and intra-peritoneal solutions have been used clinically for the prevention of surgical adhesions. However, these materials have had limited success, and no treatment is adopted so far as a standard therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><sec><title>Rationale</title><p>Several materials and methods have been tested for the prevention of post surgical adhesions, but the problem is still unsolved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The most established method in adhesion prevention is to apply a barrier between the wounded surfaces. Barrier materials should be easy to apply and should remain in place for several days to allow serosal re-epithalization and should be resorbed afterwards and excreted without systemic reactions or inappropriate accumulation. Materials should be non-inflammatory and non-reactive and should not interfere with the healing processes of sutures, anastomoses or the incision.</p></sec><sec><title>Purpose</title><p>A-Part<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>Gel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] a bioresorbable transparent gel composed of polyvinylalcohol (PVA) and carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) was developed to meet these features mentioned above.

Up to 3 cm of the incision will be left open in the middle of the incision. A-Part<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>Gel is prepared and brought under the incision through the open part in the middle. A-Part<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>gel syringe is placed to one end of the incision. The A-Part<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>Gel is applied along the partly sutured incision while pressing out slowly the viscous gel onto the abdominal wall. This procedure is repeated on the other half of the incision, and when the syringe is taken out from the open middle part of the incision. Thereafter the abdominal incision is completely closed according to the INSECT suture technique [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] and the skin closure is performed with staples. It is recommended to use 10 ml of A-Part<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>Gel for covering 10 cm of incision.

A-Part<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>Gel serves as a temporary absorbable barrier separating the parietal and visceral peritoneal tissue surfaces immediately after surgery. A-Part<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>Gel acts as a physical barrier for adhesiogenic tissue while the normal tissue repair takes place [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].

Sample size considerations are not based on statistical calculations, but on the feasibility of recruitment. It is planned to randomise 60 patients between A-Part<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>Gel and control, because this is expected to be feasible within six months from a single centre. This phase I study is conducted as a first application of A-Part<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>Gel in man, and its aim is to receive first safety data as compared to control. The power considerations are based on the specific observation of two major complications of abdominal surgery "occurrence of wound healing impairment or postoperative peritonitis within 28 (+10) days after surgery" as a primary combined endpoint. It is assumed that without application of the A-Part<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>Gel wound healing impairment will occur with a probability of about 5-10% and postoperative peritonitis will occur with a probability of about 2-5% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. This leads to the assumption that the combined endpoint will occur in the control group with a probability of about 10-15%. It is the aim of the study to show that the application of A-Part<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>Gel does not lead to an unacceptable increase in the probability of occurrence of the combined endpoint i.e the non-inferiority of A-Part Gel<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>as compared to the control. Under the assumption that the application of A-Part<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>Gel does not increase the probability of the combined endpoint, this study can show at one-sided significance level &#x003b1; = 5% with a power of 80% that the absolute difference of the event probabilities between both treatment groups is not larger than 20-25% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p><p>The two-sided 90%-confidence interval for the absolute difference (A-Part<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>Gel minus control) of probability of occurrence of the primary endpoint will be calculated.

Safe, efficient and easily to apply barrier measures are still missing. Hyaluronic acid carboxymethylcellulose films, oxidized regenerated cellulose and extended polytetrafluoroethylene film have been used to prevent adhesions after surgical trauma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The use of a PVA membrane gave quite promising results clearly better than other commercially available products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Membranes are not applicable in every surgical site. Therefore a gel or a liquid solution is preferred in the prevention of post surgical adhesions.</p><p>Anti-adhesion barriers basically fall under two main categories: macromolecular solutions (crystalloids, polysaccharide, hyaluronic acid, fibrin, polyethylene glycol, phospholipids) and mechanical devices (oxidized-regenerated cellulose, hyaluronic acid-carboxycellulose, expanded polytetrafluoroethylene and autologous transplants).</p><p>Crystalloid solutions are proposed to work by hydro-floatation to separate raw peritoneal surfaces. But they have a negative effect on post-operative adhesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], because the volume of the applied crystalloids are absorbed very rapidly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. By hydro-floatation and siliconization of intra-abdominal structures with polysaccharide such as Dextran solutions a physiological separation occurs between peritoneal surfaces. Data of Dextran solution used as a barrier are discussed controversial. There are studies showing good anti-adhesive results but other studies failed to demonstrate any clinical improvement and instead showed severe side effects such as edema, ascites and coagulopathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].</p><p>Carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) is a derviate of cellulose and works by separating raw surfaces and allowing independent healing of traumatized peritoneal surfaces [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. CMC showed a good anti-adhesive effect in experimental models but not in clinical trials. CMC in membranes together with hyaluronic acid and CMC membranes with polyethylene oxide and calcium chloride have also been reported as effective anti-adhesive agents in clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>].</p><p>Oxidized regenerated cellulose (ORC) is another barrier used for the prevention of adhesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. When applied to raw peritoneal surface, it gels within 8 h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Experimental and clinical models reported good preventive results by forming a barrier which physically separates the adjacent raw peritoneal surfaces. However poor results were noted in the presence of blood and probably also at coexisting infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. ORC is not widely used in general surgery today.</p><p>The experimental effects of a glucose polymer have been promising, reducing adhesions without obvious side effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. In a RCT it was shown that this polymer reduces the incidence of adhesions and that its application is safe and easy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. However, a Meta-analysis report on pelvic adhesion, has not recommended this polymer for the prevention of intra-abdominal adhesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>].</p><p>Hyaluronic acid (HA) is a naturally occurring glycosamin which is biocompatible, non immunogenic and bioabsorbable, therefore it seems to be well suited as an anti-adhesive agent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. Compounds consisting of HA act as a barrier because they coat serosal surfaces and provide a certain degree of protection from serosal desiccation and other types of injury. But they have also been shown to have an anti-inflammatory effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. The most popular product on the market is Seprafilm<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, a combination of HA and CMC. Seprafilm<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>reduces adhesive formation, but it is very expensive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Its use increases the risk of anastomotic deshiscence, the formation of abscess [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] and inflammatory reaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>].</p><p>In a previous randomized controlled trial the safety and efficacy of another anti- adhesive agent, Intergel<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>was evaluated in colorectal surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. Intergel<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>is a hyaluronic based gel which is cross-linked with carboxylate groups by chelation with ferric (Fe<sup>3+</sup>) ions. The aim of the study was to reduce the occurrence of intestinal obstructions due to abdominal surgery using Intergel<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>. Patients who received Intergel<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>showed a high incidence of anastomotic dehiscence and a prolonged postoperative ileus in comparison to the control group treated only with distilled water. Furthermore, wound infections were observed more often in the Intergel<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>group. Due to this high incidence of adverse effects in the Intergel<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>treated group the study was prematurely terminated. The authors discouraged from the use of Intergel<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, especially during intervention in which the gastrointestinal tract has been opened, because the application of Intergel<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>may interfered with the anastomotic wound healing process.</p><p>If surfaces are damaged, another way to prevent adhesion formation is the application of phospholipids. Experimental results have been effective using phospholipids, mainly phospatidylcholine, both in models with peritonitis and under normal conditions. No negative effects were seen on wound healing or anastomosis safety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. However no clinical studies have been performed so far.</p><p>Polyethylene glycol has also been used as a barrier to prevent post surgical adhesions. Experimental studies showed good results and clinical trials reported an adhesion-preventing effect in gynaecological surgery. Additionally, no effect has been noted on pregnancy rates after treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. In contrast, a Meta-analysis failed to demonstrate the evidence for the use of polyethylene glycol in the prevention of post surgical adhesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>].</p><p>Fibrin sealant are compounds of fibrinogen and thrombin. They have the advantage of decreasing bleeding and increasing the production of plasminogen activator (PA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI) which may be beneficial in the prevention of adhesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. But experimental results are diverging and no clinical data are available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>].</p><p>Non-dissoluble membranes of expanded polytetrafluoroethylen (ePTFE) have been used successfully to reduce adhesions. But these membranes are difficult to apply and must be fixed in place usually with sutures. In addition they are non biodegradable and should be removed at a later time raising the possibility of damage and subsequent adhesion formation during this surgical episode [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. One clinical study has been conducted, showing a reduction in postoperative adhesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. But ePTFE is not widely used as a barrier in surgery at present.</p><p>No clinical data are available for the use of collagen films as a barrier but experiments reported an effect against adhesion formations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. Transplantation of an autologous mesothelial cell sheet has recently shown positive experimental results and offers also a new interesting platform for future development.</p><p>None of these agents mentioned above have been proven to be uniformly efficacious and safe under all surgical conditions. Despite initial promising results in postoperative adhesion prevention, none of them have become a standard application. Therefore there is still the need of a barrier that is safe and efficient in reducing the incidence and the extent of surgical adhesion occurring after general abdominal surgical procedures.</p><p>A-Part<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>Gel consists of PVA and CMC and shows no cytotoxity, no allergenic reactions, no systemic toxicity and no genotoxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Physical properties such as viscosity and adherence to the wound have also been tested with good results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><p>In this study A-Part<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>Gel is used as a physical barrier between the injured peritoneal surface to prevent post surgical adhesions. Animal studies have shown high efficiency in the prevention of adhesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>]. Wound healing and anastomosis healing were not negatively affected by the application of A-Part<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>Gel in these animals.</p><p>To explore the efficacy of A-Part Gel<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>in reducing adhesion in humans, adhesion to the abdominal wall will be assessed by ultrasound examination. The gold standard of evaluating adhesion formation by second look assessment is only possible in surgical procedures that require a planned re-operation. However, as this limitation would reduce the amount of eligible patients this assessment is not being chosen, especially as there would be no benefit for the primary objective of this trial as a safety study. Assessment of adhesion development will be done by ultrasound examination. Sigel <italic>et al. </italic>as well as Steitz <italic>et al. </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>] described a technique for non-invasive ultrasound examination to detect and map abdominal adhesions. The findings that identify abdominal wall adhesions are based on the presence or restriction of ultrasonically observed movement of abdominal viscera in reference to abdominal wall. Sliding is the result of forces applied by respiratory excursions or by manual ballottement of the abdominal wall and is referred to as viscera slide. In brief, examination of spontaneous visceral slide with ultrasound scanning, provide information on the presence or absence of adhesions. Normal and abnormal visceral slide can be distinctly defined by simple measurement of excursion distance. Restricted visceral slide has been defined as reduced movement at a given point on the abdominal wall during ultrasound scanning of spontaneous visceral slide produced by regular and deep respirations or during longitudinal and transverse scanning of induced viscera slide produced by manual compression. It is strongly correlated with the presence of abdominal adhesions as several authors confirm. Most studies report a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity between 86-93% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>]. The method has only minor shortcomings in the lower third of the abdomen and may not detected a long thin adhesion or adhesions to the movable omentum, probably because this type of adhesion would not cause a significant restriction of viscera movement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>]. For assessment at the laparotomy scar spontaneous visceral slide is the most sensitive indicator of adhesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>This prospective, randomised, controlled, patient - and observer- blinded, single centre study evaluates as a primary endpoint, if the application of A-Part<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>Gel is safe as adhesion prophylaxis, in comparison to a non-treated control group, during and after abdominal surgery.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>AE: Adverse Event; SAE: Serious Adverse Event; PVA: Poly Vinyl Alcohol; CMC: CarboxyMethylCellulose; CRF: Case Report Form; GCP: Good Clinical Practice; MOF: multiple organ failure; ZKS: Clinical Trials Centre; RCT: Randomized Controlled Trial; HA: Hyaluronic acid; ePTFE: expanded polytetrafluoroethylene; ORC: Oxidized regenerated cellulose; PA: Plasminogen activator; PAI: Plasminogen activator inhibitior; INSECT: interrupted or continuous slowly absorbable sutures - evaluation of abdominal closure techniques.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>This study and its publication is sponsored by Aesculap AG, Tuttlingen, Germany.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>PB and HPK (B|Braun Aesculap, Tuttlingen, Germany) managed and conducted the trial together with the Clinical Trials Centre, Freiburg and KWJ.
