To explore the impact of chronodisruption during pregnancy in primates, we exposed pregnant capuchin monkeys to constant light (eliminating the maternal melatonin rhythm) from the last third of gestation to term. Maternal temperature and activity circadian rhythms were assessed as well as the newborn temperature rhythm. Additionally we studied the effect of daily maternal melatonin replacement during pregnancy on these rhythms. Ten pregnant capuchin monkeys were exposed to constant light from 60% of gestation to term. Five received a daily oral dose of melatonin (250 &#x000b5;g kg/body weight) at 1800 h (LL+Mel) and the other five a placebo (LL). Six additional pregnant females were maintained in a 14&#x02236;10 light:dark cycles and their newborns were used as controls (LD). Rhythms were recorded 96 h before delivery in the mother and at 4&#x02013;6 days of age in the newborn. Exposure to constant light had no effect on the maternal body temperature rhythm however it delayed the acrophase of the activity rhythm. Neither rhythm was affected by melatonin replacement. In contrast, maternal exposure to constant light affected the newborn body temperature rhythm. This rhythm was entrained in control newborns whereas LL newborns showed a random distribution of the acrophases over 24-h. In addition, mean temperature was decreased (34.0&#x000b1;0.6 vs 36.1&#x000b1;0.2&#x000b0;C, in LL and control, respectively P&#x0003c;0.05). Maternal melatonin replacement during pregnancy re-synchronized the acrophases and restored mean temperature to the values in control newborns. Our findings demonstrate that prenatal melatonin is a <italic>Zeitgeber</italic> for the newborn temperature rhythm and supports normal body temperature maintenance. Altogether these prenatal melatonin effects highlight the physiological importance of the maternal melatonin rhythm during pregnancy for the newborn primate.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Funding came from FONDECYT-LINEAS COMPLEMENTARIAS 1998-8980006, FONDECYT 1090381 and Conicyt Anillo ACT-1116.

Most physiological functions present 24-h rhythms (circadian) driven by a system of biological clocks comprising a master clock located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus, (SCN) and peripheral circadian clocks located in most tissues of the body. The SCN, connected to the retina by the retinohypothalamic tract, entrains to the light/dark cycle and relays this information to internal peripheral clocks through a number of circadian signals, some of them neurohumoral <xref rid="pone.0057710-Levi1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Several authors have proposed that the circadian rhythm of body temperature provides a global internal entrainment signal for adult peripheral clocks <xref rid="pone.0057710-Brown1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0057710-Buhr1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. There is limited information on the effects of chronodisruption in the circadian system in pregnant primates or on its effect on the offspring.</p><p>The presence of a synchronized circadian temperature rhythm soon after birth in human and non-human primate newborns allows for testing the <italic>in vivo</italic> effects of maternal chronodisruption during pregnancy in the offspring <xref rid="pone.0057710-Glotzbach1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0057710-Mirmiran1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. The early onset of the temperature rhythm suggests that circadian thermoregulation was entrained prenatally. Prenatal entrainment by maternal signals of newborn circadian behavioral rhythms (activity, drinking) appearing weeks after birth has been demonstrated in rodents <xref rid="pone.0057710-Davis1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0057710-Bellavia1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Entrained circadian clock genes oscillate in fetal organs in the capuchin monkey, rat and mouse thus conceptually, fetal organs could be considered as maternal peripheral circadian clocks <xref rid="pone.0057710-SernFerr1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. As fetuses, newborns were obligatorily exposed to the maternal circadian rhythm of temperature and to circadian signals derived from the maternal activity/rest rhythm, both tuned to the LD cycle. In addition, as fetuses, newborns were exposed to the rhythm of maternal melatonin, hormone that crosses the placenta unaltered <xref rid="pone.0057710-Reppert1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0057710-McMillen1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.

We hypothesize that any of these maternal circadian rhythms could potentially convey prenatal light/dark (LD) cycle information for the temperature rhythm in the primate newborn. Therefore, we investigated the effect of exposing pregnant capuchin monkeys to maternal chronodisruption (constant light from the last third of gestation to term), on maternal temperature and activity rhythms and the temperature rhythm of the capuchin newborn. To assess the possible role of melatonin as a <italic>Zeitgeber</italic> on these rhythms, a daily dose of melatonin was given at 1800 h to a group of pregnant females exposed to constant light.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Experiments and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Animals</title><p>Pregnant capuchin monkeys and newborns from the Primate Center, Pontificia Universidad Cat&#x000f3;lica de Chile, were used in the experimental protocols described below.

Altogether, our data demonstrates persistence of entrained maternal rhythms under constant light, although with a new phase relationship. In contrast, the newborn&#x02019;s temperature rhythm was greatly affected. Newborns showed a temperature rhythm that was desynchronized and had a lower mesor. Daily administration of melatonin to the pregnant mother, had no effect on the maternal rhythms but synchronized the newborn temperature rhythm and increased the mesor of the rhythm. Thus in a primate newborn, the prenatal information provided by the LD cycle through the daily maternal melatonin rhythm plays a role in newborn temperature regulation, as a prenatal <italic>Zeitgeber</italic> for the phase of the rhythm and by mechanisms not quite understood, in thermoregulatory mechanisms.</p><p>There is very limited information on the effects of constant light in pregnant animals, especially in primates. In contrast to what might be anticipated from studies in non-pregnant rhesus and squirrel monkeys under constant light <xref rid="pone.0057710-Masuda1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0057710-Fuller1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> in pregnant capuchin monkeys maternal chronodisruption by elimination of the LD photoperiod during the last third of gestation did not translate into free-running of the temperature and activity rhythms at the end of gestation. Although these rhythms remain entrained, they displayed a new phase relationship. In constant light, the acrophase of the temperature rhythm was similar to that of pregnant females maintained in LD and of non-pregnant capuchin monkeys <xref rid="pone.0057710-TorresFarfan2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, whereas the acrophase of the activity rhythm was delayed, coinciding now with that of the temperature rhythm. This contrasts with the 5 hour difference between activity and temperature in LD in pregnant capuchins and in non-pregnant female rhesus monkeys <xref rid="pone.0057710-TorresFarfan2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057710-Barger1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Also, at difference with reports in non-pregnant rhesus and rats <xref rid="pone.0057710-Masuda1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057710-Redman1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0057710-Cassone1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> melatonin treatment did not change the acrophase of the activity rhythm in the pregnant capuchin. It is possible that both entrainment and the shifting of the acrophase of locomotor activity under chronic exposure to constant light may reflect entrainment of the pregnant capuchins to external cues as housekeeping or feeding schedule, that were present in our experimental conditions. The same could apply to the maternal temperature rhythm. The marked contrast between reported responses to constant light in pregnant and non-pregnant monkeys suggests that pregnancy may alter the circadian system response to light. Studies in the rat suggest a functional reorganization of the SCN and ventral subparaventricular zone <xref rid="pone.0057710-Schrader1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. An additional study shows differences with non-pregnant rats in c-Fos expression in brain regions controlling sleep and temperature <xref rid="pone.0057710-Schrader2" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. The persistence of synchronized temperature and activity rhythms in the pregnant capuchin, together with previous data demonstrating that constant light exposure does not affect cortisol, estradiol and progesterone rhythms <xref rid="pone.0057710-Matsumoto1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0057710-TorresFarfan1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> may indicate a sort of resilience to perturbation of the circadian system during pregnancy in primates. The relevance of the present findings is to support that most of the putative potential circadian maternal synchronizers for the fetus, such as cortisol, estradiol and progesterone, as well as body temperature and locomotor activity are maintained. However, constant light has a strong direct effect, suppressing melatonin production and thus the melatonin circadian rhythm <xref rid="pone.0057710-Matsumoto1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0057710-TorresFarfan1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Given our results indicating that melatonin replacement is able to restore the newborn temperature rhythm relative to control LD conditions, this endocrine signal seems to be a major synchronizing cue before and shortly after birth.</p><p>Indeed, the absence of a maternal melatonin rhythm during pregnancy had a marked effect on <italic>the newborn temperature rhythm</italic>. A 24-h temperature rhythm was detected at 4&#x02013;6 days of age in all newborns studied regardless of the prenatal treatments, pointing out to the endogenous nature of the rhythm. However, in LL newborns, the temperature rhythm was not synchronized and temperature mesors were about 2&#x000b0;C lower than in LD newborns. These two effects of exposing the mothers to constant light during pregnancy were reverted in newborns of LL mothers receiving melatonin, again supporting that the gestational maternal melatonin rhythm conveys a photoperiodic signal required to fully achieve synchronized perinatal circadian rhythms. While in utero, the newborns of mothers maintained in constant light during gestation, as well as those LL+Mel mothers were exposed to similar maternal activity/rest and temperature rhythms. After birth both groups of newborns were reared in constant light to avoid providing an LD entraining signal. Altogether, these data demonstrates that in absence of a melatonin rhythm during pregnancy, neither the maternal activity nor the maternal temperature rhythms provide a signal strong enough to entrain the temperature circadian rhythm in the newborn. Evidence from our laboratory suggests that melatonin may have acted at the fetal SCN level. The fetal capuchin SCN expresses the MT1 melatonin receptor and shows oscillatory expression of clock genes synchronized to the LD cycle <xref rid="pone.0057710-TorresFarfan3" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Maternal exposure to constant light shifts oscillatory expression of clock genes in the fetal SCN. As in the present report, daily administration of melatonin to the pregnant mother reversed the effect of constant light <xref rid="pone.0057710-TorresFarfan3" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Thus we conclude that akin to findings in rodents for behavioural rhythms <xref rid="pone.0057710-Bellavia1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> the daily administration of melatonin to the mother during the last third of pregnancy, acted prenatally as <italic>Zeitgeber</italic> for the newborn primate temperature rhythm.</p><p>It is becoming apparent that maternal melatonin plays additional physiological roles along fetal development. It is important to keep in mind that the fetal pineal gland does not produce melatonin and therefore, fetal circulating melatonin is of maternal origin. Newborns from mothers chronically exposed to constant light during pregnancy had a lower mean temperature that was normalized in newborns whose mothers received melatonin. Since the 24-h mean (mesor) temperature rhythm represents the balance of heat production and dissipation, some of these mechanisms were altered by prenatal melatonin deprivation, possibly at the level of brown adipose tissue. Functional melatonin receptors are present in several fetal organs including brown adipose tissue <xref rid="pone.0057710-TorresFarfan4" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. This tissue is accrued during fetal life in human, non-human primates and sheep and produces about half of the heat needed by newborns to face the transition from the <italic>in utero</italic> environment (over 39&#x000b0;C) to the cooler postnatal environment <xref rid="pone.0057710-Alexander1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Alternatively, prenatal melatonin may act on the pathways involved in heat distribution and conservation <xref rid="pone.0057710-Burgess1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. These possibilities are currently being investigated. The former observation added to the involvement of melatonin during gestation in perinatal adrenal function in primates and rats <xref rid="pone.0057710-TorresFarfan5" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0057710-Mendez1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref> and the chronobiotic action just demonstrated in the present study, highlights the importance of maternal melatonin during pregnancy for the newborn. At any rate, the very fact that the newborns from mothers under LL displayed an average body temperature which was 2&#x000b0;C lower than controls, may have profound long term consequences for the newborn.</p><p>The orderly day/night alternation is an important signal for normal physiological functions <xref rid="pone.0057710-Bass1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Regarding the potential relevance of the present findings to human health, it must be kept in mind that exposure to light at night (which effectively suppresses melatonin), most probably is a perinatal environmental risk factor imposed by a modern 24/7 society. In this context, our data demonstrate negative effects of maternal melatonin suppression during pregnancy in the newborn primate, which might carry on into adulthood as abnormal physiological traits. This possibility needs to be seriously considered, since there is a body of evidence suggesting that a deleterious maternal environment increases the risk of developing diseases like diabetes, hypertension, obesity and metabolic syndrome that appear in adult life <xref rid="pone.0057710-Barker1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0057710-Nathanielsz1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0057710.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>
