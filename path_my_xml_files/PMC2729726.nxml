We are currently conducting a study to test the hypothesis that intensive weight loss will reduce inflammation and joint loads sufficiently to alter disease progression, either with or without exercise. This article describes the intervention, the empirical evidence to support it, and test-retest reliability data.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>This is a prospective, single-blind, randomized controlled trial. The study population consists of 450 overweight and obese (BMI = 27&#x02013;40.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) older (age &#x02265; 55 yrs) adults with tibiofemoral osteoarthritis. Participants are randomized to one of three 18-month interventions: intensive dietary restriction-plus-exercise; exercise-only; or intensive dietary restriction-only. The primary aims are to compare the effects of these interventions on inflammatory biomarkers and knee joint loads. Secondary aims will examine the effects of these interventions on function, pain, and mobility; the dose response to weight loss on disease progression; if inflammatory biomarkers and knee joint loads are mediators of the interventions; and the association between quadriceps strength and disease progression.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Test-retest reliability results indicated that the ICCs for knee joint load variables were excellent, ranging from 0.86 &#x02013; 0.98. Knee flexion/extension moments were most affected by BMI, with lower reliability with the highest tertile of BMI. The reliability of the semi-quantitative scoring of the knee joint using MRI exceeded previously reported results, ranging from a low of 0.66 for synovitis to a high of 0.99 for bone marrow lesion size.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The IDEA trial has the potential to enhance our understanding of the OA disease process, refine weight loss and exercise recommendations in this prevalent disease, and reduce the burden of disability.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>NCT00381290</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Current therapy for knee osteoarthritis (OA) most often focuses on pain relief, often with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications that have only modest functional benefit, do not slow disease progression, and have potentially serious cardiovascular and gastrointestinal side effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Recent evidence also casts doubt on the effectiveness of arthroscopic surgery for adults with mild-to-moderate knee OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Modern approaches to OA management should recommend targeting modifiable risk factors, including obesity, malalignment, and muscle weakness.</p><p>Obesity (BMI &#x02265; 30.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) is associated with increased risk of functional impairment and is considered the most modifiable risk factor for knee OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Although caloric restriction has produced dramatic changes in many biological systems and proven beneficial to obese adults suffering from knee OA, no study has directly addressed whether intensive dietary induced weight loss also slows the progression of structural damage in people with OA or determined mechanistically how it happens.</p><p>Dietary weight loss is considered the best potential non-pharmacologic intervention to prevent or to slow disease progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Christensen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] recently found that an 11% weight loss in older adults with knee OA over an 8-week period resulted in a 3-fold improvement in self-reported function relative to a control group. Radiographic evidence of progression was not studied in this trial and would not be expected to change in an 8-week period. The mechanisms responsible for improvements in function and pain in patients with knee OA consequent to long-term intensive dietary weight loss and exercise interventions in obese adults remain unknown. Reductions in joint loads and inflammatory cytokines, each thought to exacerbate joint destruction, are potential pathways. Our current Intensive Diet and Exercise for Arthritis (IDEA) randomized clinical trial will examine the effects intensive weight loss has on the biomechanical and inflammatory osteoarthritis disease pathways. We suggests that a long-term weight loss of at least 10% of baseline body weight, with or without exercise, will reduce knee joint loads and decrease inflammation resulting in a slowing of disease progression and improved clinical outcomes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Theoretical model by which intensive dietary restriction plus exercise decreases knee joint loads, improves strength and power, and decreases inflammation leading to a slowing of disease progression, reduced pain, improved function, and less disability</bold>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2474-10-93-1"/></fig><p>Recent studies demonstrate that low-grade inflammation plays a pathophysiological role in OA. The inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1 beta (IL-1&#x003b2;) is present in the joint fluids of OA patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. An inflammatory component associated with OA can be detected in the circulation since serum concentrations of inflammatory markers, such as cytokines (interleukin-6, IL-6; tumor necrosis factor alpha, TNF&#x003b1;) and the acute-phase reactant C-reactive protein (CRP), are higher in persons with knee or hip OA compared to those without [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In addition, longitudinal studies demonstrate that high systemic CRP and TNF&#x003b1; concentrations predict increased radiographic progression of knee OA as much as 5 years later [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Moreover, OA severity and impaired physical function are associated with higher inflammatory markers in the blood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Thus, severity, mobility, pain, stiffness, and radiographic progression may be partly mediated by the level of chronic inflammation in OA patients.</p><p>Obese individuals have higher concentrations of inflammatory markers and may be at greater risk of functional limitation and OA disease progression. Besides direct effects on the joint, inflammatory mediators can affect muscle function and sensitize nerves leading to increased pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Studies are beginning to show that both exercise training and weight loss decrease overall inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Our Arthritis, Diet, and Activity Promotion Trial (ADAPT) showed that a dietary intervention producing a 5% weight loss significantly reduced CRP, IL-6, and TNF&#x003b1; soluble receptor 1 concentrations compared to a control group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. We still do not know whether there is a "threshold" &#x02013; a relative or absolute weight loss that maximally reduces inflammatory markers &#x02013; or if improvements in physical function, pain, and OA progression are related to declines in chronic inflammation with weight loss and exercise.</p><p>Previous studies indicate that knee OA has an adverse effect on gait mechanics, but little is known about the influence of obesity. Epidemiological and biomechanical data suggest that the additional mechanical stress obesity places on weight-bearing joints increases the propensity for knee OA. We found that as BMI increased, older adults with knee OA changed their gait, walking slower and exerting greater impact forces [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. There are no definitive data on whether weight loss is beneficial for reducing OA progression; however, these data support our proposed model in which intensive dietary induced weight loss and exercise interventions slow disease progression. This study could make intensive dietary weight loss combined with exercise the standard-of-care for overweight and obese adults with knee OA and enhance our understanding of the OA disease process and weight-loss and exercise recommendations for older people generally.</p><p>This paper describes the design of IDEA, a large scale long-term intensive weight loss and exercise randomized clinical trial, and provides new reliability data on knee joint loads calculated using musculoskeletal modeling, and measures of osteoarthritis disease progression using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><sec><title>Study Design</title><p>IDEA is a single-blinded, one center, 18-month, randomized controlled trial.

Since BMI categories carry different risks for diseases and mortality, by reducing them one full category, more profound effects on disease markers may reasonably be expected. During the study, all participants are allowed to maintain their usual medications, including NSAIDs and other analgesics. With their physician's consent, they can also reduce medication if pain decreases. A detailed record of medication use is collected at baseline and 6- and 18-month follow-up testing.</p></sec><sec><title>Interventions</title><sec><title>Intensive dietary induced weight loss intervention</title><p>Both the D and D+E groups receive the same dietary intervention. Our weight loss goal is a group mean of at least 10% of baseline weight, with a desired 15% weight loss. The dietary plan is based on partial meal replacements, including up to 2 meal-replacement shakes per day (provided by General Nutrition Centers, Inc., Pittsburgh, PA.). All participants are closely monitored, and their daily caloric intake adjusted according to their rate of weight change.</p><p>Initial diet plans provide an energy-intake deficit of 800&#x02013;1000 kcals/day as predicted by energy expenditure (estimated resting metabolism &#x000d7; 1.2 activity factor). The lowest calorie level permitted is 1100 kcals for women and 1200 kcals for men. The calorie distribution goal is 15&#x02013;20% from protein, &#x0003c; 30% from fat, and 45&#x02013;60% from carbohydrates, consistent with the Dietary Reference Intakes for Energy and Macronutrients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] and successful weight-loss programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. For the third meal, participants follow a weekly menu plan and recipes provided by the study composed of traditional foods. It contains 500&#x02013;750 kcals and is low in fat and high in vegetables. Snacks include a snack bar, fruit, or vegetable providing approximately 100&#x02013;120 kcals each. The food plan is tailored to individual preferences and energy needs. Meal plans are developed by the intervention staff to provide the prescribed macronutrient-balanced energy intake as fewer meal replacements are consumed during the trial.</p><p>Body weight is monitored in weekly nutrition education and behavioral sessions. Nutrition interventionists, trained in behavioral therapy and experienced in working with older adults, run all group and individual sessions. There is one individual session and 3 group sessions per month for the first 6 months. The behavioral sessions focus on awareness of changing eating habits to lower caloric intake. Information on what food changes to make, how to make them, and why they are important is clearly explained and discussed with participants and significant others. Group sessions include problem solving, review of a specific food topic, and tasting of several well-balanced, low-fat, nutritious foods prepared with easily available ingredients. During the individual sessions, the nutrition interventionist reviews individual progress, solves problems, answers questions, and sets goals. From months 7 to 18, participants attend biweekly group sessions, with an individual appointment every 2 months.</p><p>Once they reach the study's desired weight-loss goal of 15% of baseline body weight, participants either begin weight maintenance or continue to lose weight using safe, healthy nutritional practices. Weight loss can continue throughout the intervention, provided the individual wants to and has not reached a level that may be associated with health hazards in this population; i.e., a &#x0003e;20% body weight loss at 6 months or &#x0003e; 30% at 12 months. Weight maintenance uses relapse-prevention techniques that include managing the environment, adjusting appropriate goal-based daily energy needs, and continuing self-regulatory skills.</p><p>For participants who have difficulty achieving the weight-loss goal, we use a behavioral "toolbox" that includes frequent individual behavioral counseling sessions, incentives, home-assessments, or other items deemed appropriate. Diet plans can be altered to restrict one of the snacks and/or the size of the evening meal. Participants record their food and beverage intake in daily logs that are collected monthly and used as a self-monitoring tool for dietary intake. Nutrition interventionists use them to design rescue procedures, using behavioral and educational strategies.</p></sec><sec><title>Alert Values</title><p>Weight is monitored weekly. A loss of &#x0003e;20% body weight after 6 months or &#x0003e;30% after 12 months triggers a safety alert.</p></sec><sec><title>Exercise intervention</title><p>The exercise intervention is identical for both exercise groups. Sixty-minute sessions are conducted 3 d&#x000b7;wk<sup>-1 </sup>for 18 months, and each group (E and D+E) exercises at a different time to prevent crossover effects from their interactions. The first 6 months are facility-based. Anytime after 6-month follow-up testing is completed, participants that would like to add home based exercise to their training routine will alternate between the facility (2 d&#x000b7;wk<sup>-1</sup>) and home (1 d&#x000b7;wk<sup>-1</sup>) during a 2-week transition phase. Subsequently, participants can decide to remain in the facility program; opt for a home-based program; or combine the facility and home-based programs.</p><p>The 3 d&#x000b7;wk<sup>-1 </sup>exercise program consists of an aerobic phase (15 min), a strength training phase (20 min), a second aerobic phase (15 min), and a cool-down phase (10 min). The strength-training phase is particularly relevant to help offset any possible loss of muscle and bone mass resulting from dietary weight loss.</p><p>Walking is the primary mode of aerobic training. Participants who meet the inclusion criteria but cannot walk for extended periods use upright and recumbent stationary bicycles to supplement walking. Exercise intensity ranges between 50&#x02013;75% of the heart-rate reserve, using the symptom-limited maximum heart rate obtained from a graded exercise test (GXT). The strength training session is approximately 20 minutes and targets lower extremity muscles and, to a lesser extent, upper body muscles. This phase includes 1&#x02013;2 sets of 10&#x02013;12 repetitions on leg extension, leg press, seated leg curl, seated calf raise, compound row, and vertical chest or incline press.</p><p>During months 7&#x02013;18, home-based participants are telephoned every other week in the first 2 months, every third week during the next 2 months, and every month thereafter. Monthly exercise and attendance logs are gathered to monitor progress. The home-based participant exercises at home 3 d&#x000b7;wk<sup>-1 </sup>and comes to the facility once a month for an individual meeting with the exercise interventionist. Home-based strength training utilizes a Thera-Band exercise program.</p></sec><sec><title>Intensive dietary induced weight loss-plus-exercise intervention</title><p>Participants randomized to the D+E intervention receive both interventions described above. Dietary counseling is scheduled before or after the exercise sessions to minimize the number of visits.</p></sec><sec><title>Techniques to Improve Adherence</title><p>We conservatively estimate 80% retention and 65% adherence rates over this 18-month intervention. Adherence to the nutrition intervention is defined as attending the nutrition classes; to the exercise sessions, the number of sessions completed divided by the number scheduled (72 weeks &#x000d7; 3 d&#x000b7;wk<sup>-1 </sup>= 216 sessions).</p><p>The health psychologist trains the exercise interventionists in behavioral techniques that include: (1) tailoring training to the participant's ability; (2) frequent contact during all intervention phases; (3) clear behavioral goals and feedback on achievements; (4) training participants to self-monitor their heart rate and to complete activity logs; (5) establishing personal commitment to the project through the exercise leader; and (6) targeting educational materials and field trips to prevent relapse and to develop prompts to exercise. Primary interventionists regularly review adherence data and identify any participants who need additional reminders and/or counseling.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Trial Conduct</title><sec><title>Recruitment</title><p>The 30-month recruitment period is divided into 10 waves of 45 participants each, entering the study at 3-month intervals. Recruitment strategies include mass mailings, newspaper advertisements, and presentations at local aging service networks, senior centers, and churches. Our Claude D. Pepper Older Americans Independence Center recruitment core also has access to a large database of older adults who have consented to be contacted about participation in clinical trials. Selected physicians in orthopedics, geriatrics, and rheumatology receive information on the study and encourage qualified patients to contact IDEA recruitment personnel for further information. Specific strategies aim to maximize the number of African Americans who qualify for, and are enrolled in, the study.

Ground reaction forces and moments are obtained with a 6-channel force platform (Advanced Mechanical Technologies, Inc., Newton, MA) operating at 480 Hz. Six successful trials are collected on each participant, and 3 chosen for subsequent analysis.

Our preliminary data suggest that a 20% difference in IL-6 is clinically important, and an additional 5% weight loss for a 200 lb patient would result in a 120 lb difference in knee joint loads.

Pharmacologic and surgical interventions have had limited success [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>], and nonpharmacologic interventions, such as exercise and dietary induced weight loss, improve self-reported physical function and pain but appear to result in similar disease progression rates as attention control groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Modest weight loss is a recommended treatment for knee OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]; however, a 5% weight loss, alone or in combination with exercise, does not attenuate disease progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. IDEA is the first adequately powered, long-term trial to examine whether more intensive weight loss, with or without exercise, will reduce inflammation and knee joint loads sufficient to alter disease progression.</p><p>Weaknesses of the study include the challenges involved in losing and then maintaining significant weight loss, and the lack of a gold-standard biomechanical model to estimate knee joint loads. Our previous work suggests that long-term intensive weight loss is required to affect the OA disease process. However, achieving long-term weight loss in obese individuals is challenging. Interventions lasting longer than 1 year that attain at least a 10% weight loss are rare. Esposito et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] produced a 14.7% loss in body weight over a 2-year period in women following a moderate energy restricted diet (1300 kcals year 1 and 1500 kcals year 2). We will incorporate partial meal replacements, frequent contacts, and an intensive behavioral intervention that emphasizes self-regulatory skills and relapse prevention.</p><p>Musculoskeletal models only provide estimates of actual knee joint biomechanics. The principal limitation of our model is the absence of most knee ligaments. This will increase knee-muscle force predictions, since these tissues must resist all external loads. The model does include the lateral collateral ligament, which produces the principal non-muscular restraint during the stance phase of walking. We have successfully applied it to healthy and OA subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>], finding ranges similar to those of previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><p>In addition to the benefit and feasibility of intensive weight loss in this population, IDEA will elucidate the benefits of exercise, both with and without intensive weight loss, on knee joint loads, stability, and neuromuscular function. The Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) has strongly recommended exercise as part of the standard of care for patients with knee OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. Our previous work indicated that long-term exercise improves walking mechanics and reduces knee pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]; however, to our knowledge, no studies have examined the effects of exercise on knee joint loads in this population. Data from animal models suggest that the magnitude and direction of the applied loads influence whether knee articular cartilage responds favorably to regular exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. Using qMRI, IDEA will determine <italic>in vivo </italic>the relationship between knee joint loads and cartilage thickness changes. MRI may also detect effects of weight loss and exercise on OA progression because it is more sensitive to change than traditional radiographs.</p><p>Knee alignment is a known risk factor for disease progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Several authors have suggested that obesity exacerbates disease progression only in the presence of mild varus knee alignment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. As a secondary outcome, we will examine baseline knee alignment to determine its influence on 18-month disease progression using both semi-quantitative (BLOKS) and quantitative MRI (qMRI).</p><p>The IDEA trial has substantial potential to enhance our understanding of the OA disease process, refine weight-loss and exercise recommendations in this prevalent disease, and to ultimately reduce the burden of disability in our aging population. This study could make intensive weight loss with exercise the standard-of-care for overweight and obese adults with knee OA, as it enhances our understanding of the OA disease process and weight-loss and exercise recommendations for older people generally. Moreover, the use of MR imaging may increase our capability to detect effects of weight-loss and exercise on OA progression because of its higher sensitivity to change compared with x-ray.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>SPM conceived the study, participated in its design and coordination, carries out the biomechanical gait and strength analysis, and drafted the manuscript.
