A total number of 613 patients from CCM intervention sites and 557 patients from usual care control sites met the inclusion criteria. The baseline mean 10-year risk of cardiovascular disease was 31% for both the intervention group and the control group. Participants in both groups had improved blood pressure, lipid levels, and HbA1c levels during the observation period. Random intercept hierarchical regression models showed that the intervention group had a 2.1% (95% CI &#x02212;3.7%, &#x02212;0.5%) greater reduction in predicted risk for future cardiovascular events when compared to the control group.

The first collaborative in 1999 was run by the Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI) and had participants from the Eastern, Western, and Southern regions of the United States, whereas the second in 2001 was limited to organizations from the State of Washington. Organizations in the first collaborative paid a flat fee of $12,000 to participate, whereas the second collaborative (run by Qualis, the Washington State Quality Improvement Organization and the Washington State Department of Health) cost $200 per attendee per session. Over the course of a year, participating organizations had an average of 8 members on a team with generally at least 1 physician participant. They were taught methods for making system level organizational change, the elements of the CCM, and evidence-based diabetes clinical care measures and therapies. Experts in diabetes disease management and quality improvement guided the teams to study, test, and implement improvements in essential care processes for diabetes in their intervention sites (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The 13 intervention sites made an average of 45 changes (SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;18) during the study period. In delivery system redesign, most sites worked on enhancing care management roles, providing proactive follow-up, planning visits, and improving the visit system. All sites implemented patient education, and the majority also provided resources and tools to patients and worked with patients in care planning. Guideline implementation and provider education received attention from almost all sites. A more detailed description of the changes can be found elsewhere.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref><fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Chronic illness care collaborative intervention.

Representatives from 40 health care organizations volunteered to participate in one of the two CCM collaboratives. We contacted health care &#x0201c;organizations&#x0201d; with administrative oversight over multiple clinical &#x0201c;sites&#x0201d; for our evaluation. This enabled us to obtain control sites (other clinic or practice) of similar size, location, and financial type as the intervention site with similar patients from within the same organization. Of the original 40, 3 organizations dropped out of the collaborative and 20 were too small to provide within organization control sites, leaving 17 of whom 13 agreed to participate and furnish control sites. The participating organizations cared for patients in nonprofit clinics, a nonprofit health plan, for-profit physician groups, and veteran&#x02019;s administration facilities.

This formula is described in further detail in the <xref rid="App1" ref-type="app">technical appendix</xref> for this manuscript. We compared changes in the UKPDS risk score in the groups exposed to the intervention to changes in the control sample.</p><p>The control site is needed to adjust for local variation and secular trends. Because the control patients may differ in ways affecting reductions in risk factors, we adjust for characteristics that might affect the change in risk factors over the year. The two observation periods were the 11-month preintervention period and the 11-month postintervention observation period that followed a 3-month period beginning after the first collaborative meeting to allow the sites to begin making changes (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). To calculate CVD risk in each period, we used the latest levels of the intermediate outcomes recorded in the medical record for HbA1c, cholesterol ratio, and the average of the 3 most recent for the blood pressures. The study protocol was approved by the Human Subjects Protection Committees from RAND, UCLA, and all participating oganizations.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Study Population</title><p>We used the diabetes registries from participating sites to identify patients. All patients with diabetes were approached to consent except for those at 2 clinical sites that had over 400 patients from which 200 patients were randomly selected. We identified 3,080 eligible patients. No data were collected on patients who declined consent (806). Patients were excluded if they were unable to consent because they died (12), were in a nursing home (9), did not speak English or Spanish (26), could not be found (198), or were too ill to consent (36). In addition, patients were excluded if the medical record could not be found (30) or if they said they did not have diabetes (28). This resulted in 1,935 consenting participants with charts available for review. (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) The analysis of the combined cardiovascular risk score excluded patients missing more than 1 of the 6 modifiable component values (pre- and postcholesterol ratios, HbA1c, and systolic blood pressure) needed to calculate the UKPDS risk score. A full description of the exclusion criteria and calculation of the risk score can be found in the <xref rid="App1" ref-type="app">technical appendix</xref> of this manuscript.

We also abstracted treatment regimen (insulin, oral diabetes medications, or diet-controlled) from medical records during the preintervention period to calculate a measure of disease severity. After documentation of informed consent, charts were either reviewed at the site or deidentified charts were mailed to a central location. Trained abstractors entered data into a computerized tool, and completed records were sent to a central data repository. Lead abstractors initially reviewed a 10% subsample of the other abstractors&#x02019; record reviews to ensure quality and assess reliability. Kappa scores at the level of diabetes-related care measures ranged from 0.62 to 0.88.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Imputation</title><p>We multiply imputed missing values when one of four chart review values required for calculating changes in the UKPDS risk score was missing, specifically 44 pre- or postperiod HbA1c values (2%) and 395 pre- or postperiod total cholesterol or HDL values (17%). We also multiply imputed 163 smoking status indicators (14%). We used the Markov Chain Monte Carlo Method implemented in Proc MI in SAS, copyright (c) 2002&#x02013;2003 by SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA. Estimated coefficients and variances from different imputations were combined using Proc MI analyzed in SAS. Only 26 systolic blood pressure values (&#x0003c;1%) were missing, so we imputed them with mean values.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Analyses</title><p>We performed bivariate tests of association between the baseline characteristics of intervention and control groups. We use a random intercept hierarchical regression model (Proc Mixed in SAS) to simultaneously adjust for clustering of observations within patients (pre and post) and patients within sites. Fixed effect patient level covariates are age, gender, comorbid conditions, and treatment regimen (ordered categorical indicator variables for diet-controlled, oral agents only, oral and insulin use, and insulin alone) to estimate the adjusted change in differences over time between participating and control site patients. The two observations for each patient were coded with indicators for being in the first or second collaborative, being in an intervention site, postperiod, and a postperiod by intervention site interaction term. The coefficient of the postperiod by intervention site interaction term is the estimated adjusted difference in change over time in UKPDS score for those in the intervention versus control groups.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Baseline characteristics were similar for intervention and control patients except that those in the intervention group were significantly more likely to be enrolled in an HMO (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

These findings suggest that collaborative interventions may lead to reduced cardiovascular disease in patients with diabetes. Based on the results of recent efficacy trials for hypertension<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref> and cholesterol management,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref> a stronger focus on cholesterol control and BP control in the CCM model could be associated with even bigger improvements in CVD risk. Recent observations of an independent association of HbA1c with cardiovascular disease risk also support a potential benefit in collaboratives reducing CVD risk.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></p><p>Within a 1-year postobservation period, implementation of the CCM model was associated with significantly greater reductions in lipids and HbA1c than what was observed in the control group. Although one should be cautious when applying NNT calculations to nonrandomized trials, we note that if the observed resulting risk reduction of 2.1% were realized, there would be one fewer myocardial infarction, fatal myocardial infarction, or episode of sudden death for every 48 patients with diabetes at an intervention site during the next 10&#x000a0;years. The risk reductions among the highest risk patients would correspond to one less CVD event for every 24 high-risk persons exposed to the intervention. The reduced cardiovascular disease risk of 2.1% in the overall sample and 4.1% in the highest risk tercile of persons with diabetes is comparable to the 3.2% reduction of major coronary events over 5&#x000a0;years from simvastatin use found in the Heart Protection Study&#x02019;s diabetes population.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref> However, the UKPDS risk engine was developed in the UK in the late 1990s and may not fully apply to US populations in the current time where there is a greater focus on pharmacological therapy directed at reducing CVD risk among persons with diabetes. As similar studies examine other CCM interventions, we will gain a greater understanding of which diseases and populations are best targeted for collaborative interventions.</p><p>The National Institutes of Health has called for more pragmatic research aimed at bridging the gap between clinical knowledge, effective practice, and improved health.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref> Our methods show how a practical clinical trial can provide important information about the potential impact of organizational change on the health of patients.

However, by focusing on tangible processes that are known to improve outcomes and by tracking those outcomes, exposure to the intervention was associated with improvements.</p><p>Our study depended on the cooperation of a heterogeneous group of health plans and practices and therefore suffered from some inherent limitations. Four of the 17 eligible sites did not participate in our evaluation because of perceived administrative burdens such as acquisition of informed consent.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref> Because the CCM intervention was not randomly allocated to sites within organizations, our results could suffer from selection bias if intervention sites were more motivated to make changes to improve care than the controls. To assess whether this was the case, the study conducted surveys of the staff participants in the study and surprisingly, we found that attitudes toward quality and overall assessments of staff attitudes were somewhat less favorable at intervention sites.

That organizations as a whole volunteered to participate is not a problem for our comparison but does limit external validity.</p><p>Because our control sites came from the same organization as the intervention sites, they could have learned of and implemented changes. However, if there was contamination, then the real improvement in CVD risk reduction observed in the intervention sites would have been greater than what we have reported. Our results may not generalize to providers and facilities without the institutional or financial support for change. Although our study&#x02019;s participating organizations had to use their own resources to carry out any changes, other studies of collaboratives have shown improvement in care among community health centers, which typically have fewer resources and more challenging populations than traditional practices.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref> Our study&#x02019;s patient population was roughly 90% non-Hispanic white and thus underrepresented the other 27% of patients with type-2 diabetes in the United States.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref> Future studies are needed to test these methods in settings where more racially and ethnically representative patients with diabetes receive their care.</p><p>We have shown that the introduction of the CCM using a collaborative intervention for diabetes care is associated with a reduction in cardiovascular disease risk in patients with diabetes.

The UKPDS risk engine formula is based on the data from 4,540 U.K. prospective diabetes study patients followed up for roughly 10&#x000a0;years tracking the natural history of treated diabetes. This equation is a diabetes-specific formula which estimates the risk of new coronary heart disease events in people with type-2 diabetes based on their mutable characteristics of glycosylated hemoglobin, systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol/HDL cholesterol ratio, smoking status, and immutable characteristics of age, sex, race/ethnicity, and time since diagnosis of diabetes as risk factors.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref> The exact formula is given in the UKPDS formula section below.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Additional Exclusion Criteria</title><p>During our medical record review, patients were excluded from the UKPDS analysis if more than one lab- or examination-based component necessary to calculate the UKPDS risk score was missing from the medical record in either the preintervention period or the postintervention period (577). Patients were excluded if there was no evidence of diabetes (82), they were not in an assigned intervention or control site (39), or were under 25&#x000a0;years old (67). This resulted in 1,170 patients eligible for the risk score calculation during the pre- and postintervention periods. Eligible patients and characteristics of those excluded are shown in Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> of the manuscript) Participants who agreed to be interviewed were given a telephone survey, which included demographic data, such as race, and information not reliably available from the medical record, such as current smoking status and duration of diabetes. Some 1,011 out of 1,170 eligible patients whose charts were reviewed also completed the telephone survey.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Subgroup Analysis</title><p>We also conducted a preplanned subgroup analysis to examine if the intervention affected patients of higher or lower baseline predicted cardiovascular disease risk differently. From a cost and quality of care perspective, patients with higher baseline risk may stand to gain the most benefit from an intervention and may subsequently be identified for a more targeted effort. Therefore, we compared the impact of the intervention on change in cardiovascular risk for those in the upper tercile versus the lower two terciles in each collaborative of predicted preintervention cardiovascular risk. We repeated our multiple hierarchical regression analyses to determine the impact of the intervention on these two groups.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Complete Case and other Sensitivity Analyses</title><p>The change in risk over time for those exposed to the CCM model is driven by changes in the three mutable characteristics (e.g., systolic blood pressure, HbA1c, and total cholesterol/HDL cholesterol). As described in the text, if the patient had 5 of the 6 values needed for the calculation of UKPDS risk scores in the pre- and postperiods, we imputed the sixth value. HbA1c and total cholesterol/HDL ratio were imputed using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo MCMC method of Proc MI in SAS while we used the mean to impute systolic blood pressure as less than 1% were missing. Smoking status was also imputed using the MCMC method of Proc MI in SAS. In addition to HbA1c, lipid values, blood pressure values, and smoking, we also included indicator variables for the site of care, gender, and age as covariates.

These and one other risk engine variable, smoking status, were collected from the patient survey. For the 159 patients who did not complete the survey, we obtained age and sex from the medical record and imputed the smoking and duration of diabetes (because the coefficients for age at diagnosis and for duration are so similar in the UKPDS formula, the survey-given date of diagnosis used to compute duration has little effect on risk). For purposes of calculating the UKPDS risk score, missing smoking status was also imputed using multiple imputation methods.</p><p>Because of the possibility that groups differing in race, education, income, living alone, and insurance status might respond differently to the intervention, we tested whether changes in the UKPDS were influenced by those factors. We performed sensitivity analyses on patients with complete survey data comparing the changes in outcomes adjusted for all these survey-based variables, with changes in outcomes not adjusted for survey-based variables. There was no difference in the difference of changes in predicted risk in the intervention versus control sites.
