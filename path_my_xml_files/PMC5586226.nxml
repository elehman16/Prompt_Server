conducted from March to November 2012. Anthropometric measurements were
collected and two questionnaires (Typical Day of Physical Activities and
Food Intake, in Portuguese, and the CARDIOKIDS, a questionnaire of knowledge
about cardiovascular risk factors) were applied at baseline, at the end of
intervention, and three months thereafter. The intervention consisted of
eight playful workshops, which involved the presentation of a play.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Seventy-nine students were randomized to the intervention (n = 40) or the
control group (n = 39). Mean age was 10.0 &#x000b1; 1.1 years. After eight
weeks, the intervention group showed significant improvement in the
knowledge score (p &#x0003c; 0.001). There was an increase in physical activity
scores in both groups, but with no difference between the groups at the end
of intervention (p = 0.209). A reduction in the BMI percentile was observed
in the intervention group, but there was no significant statistical

including 144 countries projected an increase of excess weight from 4.2% in 2010 to
9.1% in 2020, representing 60 million children; of those, 35 million will be from
developing countries.<sup><xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup></p><p>Although genetic factors can influence the susceptibility to weight gain, the
consensus is that a sedentary lifestyle, inadequate dietary practices and changes in
family structure all contribute to this epidemic.<sup><xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Urbanization and other environmental factors bring profound
habits changes, especially regarding eating habits and physical activity.<sup><xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> In Brazil, economic and media globalization contributed to
significant changes regarding diet (with more spread use of processed and
ultraprocessed foods in detriment to more traditional preparations) and family
habits, such as having all the meals together.<sup><xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup></p><p>The number of children between 5 and 9 years with excess weight more than doubled in
the country from 1989 to 2009<sup><xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>,
escalating from 15% to 34.8%, while the number of obese children of the same age
increased 30%, from 4.1% to 16.6%.<sup><xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup></p><p>Studies have shown an association between childhood obesity and risk factors for the
development of chronic illnesses such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension,
dyslipidemia and other cardiovascular diseases.<sup><xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>-<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Therefore, there
is an urgent need to focus on early prevention. Early health promotion strategies
with comprehensive nutritional and physical activity guidance have shown to increase
knowledge and improve self-care among patients with chronic conditions.<sup><xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> However, studies
regarding educational interventions for obesity prevention in children are
heterogeneous and yield different results.<sup><xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>-<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> Recent
meta-analysis of educational interventions for obese and non-obese children showed
positive results regarding blood pressure and waist circumference reduction, but a
less clear effect on body mass index (BMI).<sup><xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup></p><p>In this context, there is a need for development and evaluation of innovative
educational interventions targeting prevention and health habit formation. We
designed a low-cost educational intervention based on playful workshops for
children, in a low resource setting, that could be useful in many contexts
worldwide. The objective of the present study is to ascertain the impact of this
intervention on children's knowledge, physical activity levels and BMI in a low
resource community in a developing country.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>This was a cluster randomized, controlled study, carried out from March to November
2012. Seventy-nine students in four classes participated in the study and were
randomly divided into two groups with two classes each, 40 participants in the
intervention group and 39 students in the control group. The study was registered in
the Brazilian Clinical Trials Registry under the code RBR-8f6wr7 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ensaiosclinicos.gov.br/rg/RBR-8f6wr7/">http://www.ensaiosclinicos.gov.br/rg/RBR-8f6wr7/</ext-link>). All parents
signed the informed consent.</p><sec><title>Participants</title><p>Inclusion criteria were children from seven to eleven years of age, who attended
a philanthropic program during non-school hours for children with low
socio-economic conditions in the city of Porto Alegre in the southern Brazilian
state of Rio Grande do Sul. All children were healthy and were also enrolled in
regular schools.</p><p>Exclusion criteria were clinical diseases that would prevent participation in the
program or anthropometric evaluation. No children had any of these conditions,
and therefore there were no exclusions after the signing of the consent
form.</p><p>After randomization, 6 children in the intervention group and 5 in the control
group were lost to follow up, because they moved to other schools or refused to
continue in the study, thus resulting in 40 children in the intervention group
and 39 in the control group. All other children attended to all sessions and
completed the study. For those children that could not attend in a specific day,
another day was scheduled.</p></sec><sec><title>Randomization</title><p>A table with random numbers representing each class was created by an
investigator who was not related to the study, with the aid of the randomization
tool available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.randomization.com">www.randomization.com</ext-link>. These
numbers were placed and sealed in brown envelopes. After inclusion of all
participants, an investigator who was not related to the study opened the
envelopes and the classes were assigned to the arms of intervention or control
(cluster randomization).</p></sec><sec><title>Interventions</title><p>Intervention consisted of eight weekly Playful workshops lasting between 30 and
60 minutes during 60 to 90 minutes each. The workshops included collage,
painting, games creation, physical activity, music and dance, and simulations of
real life situations, all involving the importance of healthy habits for heart
health, especially relating to healthy foods and physical activity. The same
investigator (FHC, a Registered Nurse) performed all the activities in the
classroom or in the school patio.

(DAFA, <italic>Dia T&#x000ed;pico de Atividades F&#x000ed;sicas e de
Alimenta&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o</italic>) is an illustrated and structured
questionnaire developed by a group of Brazilian researchers with the objective
to obtain information about weekly habits of physical activity in children aged
seven to eleven years<sup><xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. The
instrument contains 36 illustrations of physical activities in different
intensities, and a score system was developed to summarize the answers. Of a
total of 141 points, values below 36 are classified as "less active," 37 to 58
as "intermediate," and 59 to 141 as "more active".</p><p>The questionnaire regarding knowledge of healthy habits and risk factors for
cardiovascular disease (CARDIOKIDS) was also developed in Brazil and validated
for children from 7 to 11 years. It contains twelve illustrated questions,
divided in two dimensions: healthy habits (healthy eating and physical activity)
and risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. Response options consist of three
faces: "happy" (good for the heart), "unhappy" (bad for the heart), and
"neutral" (do not know). Scores of 11-12 correct answers were considered as
"excellent knowledge," 8-10 correct answers were considered "good knowledge,"
and scores below 7 correct answers were considered "insufficient
knowledge".<sup><xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup></p></sec><sec><title>Data collection</title><p>Data collection took place at three moments between March and November of 2012,
beginning soon after obtaining the informed consent from their parents.</p><p>At baseline, anthropometric measurements (weight and height) were performed and
two questionnaires (DAFA and CARDIOKIDS) were applied. The same parameters were
measured just after the intervention. Twelve weeks after completion of the
program, the CARDIOKIDS questionnaire was repeated to evaluate knowledge
retention.</p><p>Anthropometric measurements were obtained according to the recommendations of the
World Health Organization.<sup><xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>
For weight measurement, the participants were asked to remove their shoes and
heavy clothing. A Plenna Wind digital scale was used, with a maximum capacity of
150 kg, accuracy of 100 g, and a stadiometer with a measuring range of 192 cm.
Weight and height were measured twice by one of the investigators. Children
above the 85th BMI percentile were considered overweight, and above the 95th
were considered obese.<sup><xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup></p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The sample size was based on previous results from a pilot study on 38
individuals, in which an average of eight correct answers in the CARDIOKIDS
questionnaire was observed, with standard deviation of 2.0. We estimated a 30%
increase in the knowledge scores in the intervention group with a power of 95%
and 0.05 level of significance, yielding a minimum sample of 44 participants (22
in each group). Considering possible losses during the study and the cluster
effect, a total sample of 40 participants for each group was planned. Data
analysis and processing was performed using the IBM SPSS Statistics software,
version 14.0. Continuous variables are expressed by means and standard
deviations and categorical variables are expressed by absolute and relative
frequencies. Normality of data was evaluated with histograms and the
Kolmogorov-Smirnof test. For comparisons between groups after the intervention
we used the paired Student t test for continuous variables and the chi-squared
test for categorical variables. GEE (generalized estimating equations) were used
for comparisons between groups and within groups across different periods
(baseline, immediately after and 12 weeks after intervention) adjusting for age
and gender. The Bonferroni adjustment was used to identify differences in paired
analysis. Repeated measures ANOVA was used to compare different points in time
between groups. In all comparisons, a p &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered
significant.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The institution receives a total of 185 students from 7 to 11 years old. Parents or

playful activities was effective in increasing physical activity scores and
knowledge about healthy habits and risk factors for cardiovascular disease.</p><p>The school environment is considered to be a good setting for health promotion
because it allows reaching children and adolescents.<sup><xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Playful activities focusing on health themes are
an opportunity to create a bond to facilitate the sharing of experiences and
knowledge, empowering a child to take care of the own health.</p><p>This is increasingly important in a context of rising prevalence of chronic diseases
and unhealthy habits very early in life. In accordance with this context,
approximately 38% of this sample of school children was overweight.<sup><xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> In south Brazil, 28% of children aged 11-18 years were
overweight and 10% were obese.<sup><xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p><p>In our study, both groups had previous knowledge of healthy habits and cardiovascular
risk factors before the educational interventions, with no significant difference
between groups at baseline. One possible explanation for these results is the fact
that schools and the media have recently become more concerned about providing
guidance on nutrition and the importance of physical activity for improved quality
of life and prevention of cardiovascular diseases and obesity. However, these data
suggest that playful activities may be a good educational strategy for students, and
that knowledge about healthy habits and risk factors for cardiovascular diseases is
present among students in this age group.</p><p>One recent study carried out with teachers and students aged 5 to 10 years in the
Brazilian capital city of Bras&#x000ed;lia showed that, after nutritional
interventions, there was an increase of knowledge from 61% to 74% in children, and a
similar increase among the teachers.<sup><xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> One study carried on students with higher BMIs out in the
southern region of Brazil in 2005 showed that these students have less knowledge and
less healthy dietary practices than those observed in the present study.<sup><xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> Another recently-published study
performed with 464 students in northern Portugal from November 2008 to March 2009,
using interventions based on the Model of Health Promotion and cognitive theory,
showed satisfactory results in relation to changes in dietary habits of the children
in the intervention group.<sup><xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> Thus,
it is believed that an increased knowledge can improve self-care related to weight
control and dietary habit changes.</p><p>The evaluation of BMI percentiles did not show a statistically significant difference
between the groups at the end of the intervention period, but a slight reduction in
percentile was observed in the intervention group, along with a small increase in
the control group. Studies involving interventions in schools for prevention and
treatment of obesity have shown controversial results,<sup><xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> especially in non-selected populations composed of
normal weight and overweight children. In these conditions, it is more difficult to
observe changes in BMI, since a large part of the population does not need to lose
weight. The heterogeneity of the interventions regarding type, duration and number
of activities included must also be considered.<sup><xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> It is also
possible that more prolonged and comprehensive interventions show more positive
results regarding BMI changes.<sup><xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>
Analysis of baseline data showed that the two groups were homogenous in regards to
sex, ethnicity, weight, physical activity and knowledge, but the intervention group
was older than the control group.<sup><xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup></p><p>It is also important to emphasize that BMI is a controversial measure to be pursued
as an outcome in children. It is insensitive to changes in body composition (for
example, gain of lean mass) and does not account for possible ethnic or body type
differences. Additionally, the most important outcomes in children may be permanent
habit change, and not BMI.</p><p>In regard to physical activity, our results are similar to various other studies, in
which the majority of this population is considered to have low levels of physical
activity. Others studies carried out in 2004 in others regions Brazil, showed that
40% to 67% of children and 61% of the adolescents were sedentary.<sup><xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> Lifestyle changes of families and students, in which
television, videogames and the computer have become the greatest source of
entertainment among children and youth contribute to these numbers. Additionally,
urban violence, especially in low-income settings, has been described as a barrier
for children to become involved in sports and other outdoor activities.<sup><xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup></p><p>After intervention, we observed an increase in physical activity in both groups. This
might be due to contamination (children in the intervention group who became more
active may have influenced children in the control group) or to climate changes.
While the intervention started during the winter, which is rainy and with
temperatures around 10&#x000ba;C in Porto Alegre, and the second evaluation was performed
during warmer weather.</p><p>Programs implemented with students to increase their physical activity level and
provide dietary guidance have shown good results,<sup><xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> but controversies
exist regarding the best intervention to be applied. This may be due to the fact
that these programs are applied to various groups with many cultural and
environmental differences and interventions need to be customized according to these
factors.</p><p>It must also be emphasized that knowledge is fundamental to motivate change, but is
not enough to provoke persistent change. Education and health strategies involving
playful activities can improve self-care, but must be done in conjunction with other
strategies. Improving knowledge is the first step in any comprehensive prevention
strategy, empowering the child for taking care of the own health.</p><sec><title>Limitations of the study</title><p>Some limitations of the study deserve mention. First of all, the study was
carried out in an institution with low socioeconomic resources, making it
difficult to apply these data to other student populations. The second
limitation is related to the non-participation of students' parents in the
study, as recent studies report success with strategies that include family
members. Also, the intervention period of eight weeks may be too short to
observe a significant change in habits resulting in weight loss. Finally, there
was a difference of schooling between groups, with more children in the control
group belonging to more advanced grades. However, this difference would reduce
the differences between groups after intervention, thus altering the results to
an opposite direction than that of our hypothesis.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our results show that a simple, low-cost intervention consisting of playful
educational activities performed with low-income children in a school may help
improving knowledge about healthy habits and risk factors for cardiovascular
disease, and may be useful for the planning of preventive strategies in similar
settings.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="con"><p><bold>Author contributions</bold></p><p>Conception and design of the research, Statistical analysis e Writing of the
