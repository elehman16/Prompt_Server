Plasmin-dependent activation of the epithelial Na<sup>+</sup> channel has been proposed to have a role in renal Na<sup>+</sup> retention in the setting of nephrotic syndrome. We hypothesized that the epithelial Na<sup>+</sup> channel inhibitor amiloride would be an effective therapeutic agent in inducing a natriuresis and lowering blood pressure in individuals with macroscopic proteinuria.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We conducted a pilot double-blind randomized cross-over study comparing the effects of daily administration of either oral amiloride or hydrochlorothiazide to patients with type 2 diabetes and macroscopic proteinuria. Safety and efficacy were assessed by monitoring systolic blood pressure, kidney function, adherence, weight, urinary Na<sup>+</sup> excretion, and serum electrolytes.

Nutrition analysis of food diary records was performed using Nutrition Data System for Research 2012 (University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN).

Change in SBP and other study outcomes, within and between the low- and high-dose 2-week treatment periods were estimated and compared using mixed model analysis of variance to account for the repeated per-subject assessments. To determine whether uPl/Cr has a role in amiloride treatment effects, we performed an additional series of mixed model analyses of variance, comparing the degree to which uPl/Cr status was associated with treatment outcomes. This was achieved by testing for an interaction between uPl/Cr and treatment group. We estimated the degree of change observed for each treatment within groups stratified on the basis of uPl/Cr above or below 100 &#x003bc;g/g.

Our inability to detect significant effects on BP and weight may, in part, be due to the small sample size that resulted from stopping the trial early.

Third, the initial dosing of amiloride was based on that used for patients with Liddle&#x02019;s syndrome. It may be that a lower dose of amiloride would have a better safety profile. Lastly, in this study, we explored whether amiloride had a differential effect among those with measurable uPl/Cr. A larger study prospectively measuring uPl/Cr would be needed to assess whether amiloride should be used in the subpopulation of patients with diabetes and proteinuria who have higher levels.</p><p id="p0160">In summary, among individuals with normal renal function and proteinuria, we did not find evidence that amiloride was superior to HCTZ with regard to reductions in BP or weight. Furthermore, acute kidney injury and severe hyperkalemia were safety concerns with amiloride at a dose of 10 or 20 mg in patients with diabetes and proteinuria who were taking an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker. Our study was stopped early because adverse effects occurred, and the evaluations of the primary study outcomes, BP and weight, were inconclusive. Data collected from this study provide important preliminary data for future studies of amiloride in the context of proteinuria and plasminuria. uPl/Cr varies among individuals with proteinuria. Further studies are needed to determine whether uPl/Cr provides a more robust biomarker than albuminuria for those individuals with proteinuria who develop Na<sup>+</sup> retention and increases in BP.<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr"><sup>38</sup></xref></p></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>Disclosure</title><p id="p0165">All the authors declared no competing
