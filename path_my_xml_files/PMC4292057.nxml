Response on postoperative distress and pain in pediatric day care surgery has been evaluated. Forty-two children were enrolled. Patients were randomly assigned to the <italic>music-group</italic> (music intervention during awakening period) or the <italic>non-music group</italic> (standard postoperative care). Slow and fast classical music and pauses were recorded and played via ambient speakers. Heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, glucose and cortisol levels, faces pain scale and Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability (FLACC) Pain Scale were considered as indicators of response to stress and pain experience. Music during awakening induced lower increase of systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels. The non-music group showed progressive increasing values of glycemia; in music-group the curve of glycemia presented a plateau pattern (P&#x0003c;0.001). Positive impact on reactions to pain was noted using the FLACC scale. Music improves cardiovascular parameters, stress-induced hyperglycemia. Amelioration on pain perception is more evident in older children. Positive effects seems to be achieved by the alternation of fast, slow rhythms and pauses even in pediatric age.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>music therapy</kwd><kwd>children</kwd><kwd>surgery</kwd><kwd>pain</kwd><kwd>stress</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="1"/><table-count count="3"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="33"/><page-count count="5"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1-1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Listening to music is a complex phenomenon, involving psychological, emotional, neurological, endocrinological and cardiovascular changes.<sup><xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup></p><p>The physiological reaction to music is qualitatively similar in musicians and non-musicians. Although musicians respond better, the response seems not to be influenced by musical preferences. The response may be conditioned by musical style, melody, harmonic structure, rhythm, tempo, but also by verbal content. An arousal effect proportional to the speed of the music is described in the literature: with slower rhythms inducing relaxation; while a pause in the music induces a condition of relaxation greater than preceding the exposure to music.<sup><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup></p><p>This evidence leads to the speculation that the music may give pleasure, and perhaps health benefit, as a result of controlled alternation between arousal and relaxation.<sup><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup></p><p>According to the National Association for Music Therapy, music therapy (MT) consists of using music to achieve therapeutic objectives: restoration, maintenance, and increase in health, both physical and mental.</p><p>In recent years, music has been increasingly used as a therapeutic tool in the treatment of different diseases especially in intensive care medicine.<sup><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5-12</xref></sup> More specifically; music has been shown to decrease pain, stress, anxiety and demand for analgesic and anesthetics drugs.<sup><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup></p><p>Music seems to have measurable benefits on physiological and psychological outcomes in pediatric age.

Height measurement was performed using a Harpenden stadiometer, performed with patients in an upright position, without shoes, with their heels together, arms extended down the sides of the body and head positioned parallel to the floor. Weight was made with the children barefooted and wearing light clothes, standing upright in the center of the scale platform with their arms extended down the sides of the body.

Mean values were used for statistical analysis); ii) T1 (HR every 2 minutes and BP and SpO2 every 5 minutes, for 10 minutes. Mean values were used for statistical analysis); iii) T2 (HR every 2 minutes and BP and SpO2 every 5 minutes, for 20 minutes.

The child rated the pain intensity on a scale, with point 0 being no pain and point 10 being the worst pain.</p><p>At T0, at the end of T2 and at T3 the FLACC was used to assess the behavioral reactions to pain. The FLACC pain scale assesses five behavioral areas (facial expression of the child, the position of the legs, activity, crying, and consolability) with scores ranging from 0 to 2 for each item; assessment of behavioral scores was 0=no pain; 1-3=mild pain, 4-6= moderate pain; 7-10=severe pain.

All subjects were in good physical state. Anesthesia was induced with propofol (2-2.5 mh/g) as sedative-hypnotic agent and fentanyl (1-1.5 mcg/kg) as analgesic. After laryngeal mask or tracheal tube positioning, patients underwent volume controlled mechanical ventilation with an inspired mixture of air and oxygen using a closed breathing system (fresh gas flow of 0.75l min<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> oxygen and 1.5l min<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> air during anesthesia) adjusted to achieve an end-tidal carbon dioxide of 32-35 mmHg. Anesthesia was maintained via volatile anesthetic based on the administration of Sevoflurane. The Sevoflurane was administered in a 0.75 to 1.25 MAC range. Twenty minutes before the end of intervention, all patients received Paracetamol 15 mg/kg, as analgesic.

Stressors activate the hypothalamic-pituitaryadrenal (HPA) axis and the sympathetic nervous system. During stress, the HPA axis stimulates the adrenal cortex to secrete cortisol, to support and stimulate cardiovascular and inflammatory response.<sup><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20-22</xref></sup> Listening to music could offer a wide range of therapeutic effects, such as helping patients to relax, enhancing sedation and relieving anxiety and pain.<sup><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Music evokes desired emotional and stress responses that serve as distraction from unpleasant stimuli.<sup><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup></p><p>Music induces physiological cardiovascular changes even in absence of conscious reactions. The subconscious autonomic response is independent of music preferences or previous training and involves respiration and cardiovascular parameters. Sympathetic nervous system response leads to a decrease in adrenergic activity. It induces altered status of consciousness delayed neuromuscular arousal. This relaxation response is manifested by physiologic indicators like decrease in heart rate, blood pressure, metabolic rate, oxygen consumption, respiratory rate, skeleton muscle tension, gastric acidity and motility and sweat gland activity.</p><p>Our study showed the positive impact of the music on blood pressure, postoperative glucose levels and pain experience in children undergoing day surgery procedures.</p><p>During awakening, the music group reported a lower increase of the DBP and SBP levels. The current findings confirm the benefits of music in reducing the sympathetic nervous system stress response.<sup><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup></p><p>Music may stimulate physiological responses.<sup><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> This response seems to be strictly related to the music characteristics (tempo, style, harmonic and rhythmic structure), sequence and presence of other stimuli (such as colors, lights, sounds). Cardiovascular, respiratory and autonomic systems also respond to different genres of music, order of presentation and short interpolated pauses. Music induces an arousal effect, predominantly related to the tempo.<sup><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup></p><p>Autonomic response is synchronized with music. Slow or meditative music can induce a relaxing effect particularly evident during pauses. In adults, the same effect has been achieved by alternating faster and slower rhythms or pauses.<sup><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> The use of the same method has led to a positive response in our report. Due to the different blood pressure and heart rate in childhood ages, it would be more convenient to use different music characteristics. Further studies are needed to define the most useful style of music with more benefits according to the child&#x02019;s age.</p><p>Our results also document how glucose response after surgery is linked to music influence. This finding seems to have a possible impact on the stress-induced hyperglycemia (SIH). SIH is a transient condition, characterized by insulin resistance and an up regulated hepatic gluconeogenesis (in part through of cortisol) that occur during stressful situations such as trauma, surgery, stroke and sepsis.<sup><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24-27</xref></sup> The improvement of SIH may have a positive impact on patients&#x02019; risks of infection and complications.</p><p>As reported, cortisol levels increase quickly following surgical incision and remain elevated during and after surgery.<sup><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> Studies of the effect of music on cortisol levels before, during and after surgery have had mixed results.<sup>15,29-31</sup> We showed that serum cortisol levels were higher in the immediate postoperative care compared to values found before surgical procedure. Music played for almost 20 minutes after surgery, does not influence the decrease of cortisol levels during awakening. The effect of music was probably less evident due to the high intraindividual biological variability of cortisol, although its gluconeogenic effect was found to be reduced in music group. To understand the real benefit of music on the cortisol response necessitates more than one measurement of its levels 24 hours post operatively.</p><p>Even though total pain scores were similar between music and no-music groups, a distinct reaction to pain in music group was noted using the behavioral FLACC scale. These results, which seem to be influenced by a wide age range, may confirm the pain gate control theory. Music may act as a distracter by blocking pain pathways thus diminishing the amount of perceived pain.<sup><xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup></p><p>Caprilli <italic>et al</italic>. have previously reported that age, but not gender, was found to have a significant effect on behavioral distress during venipuncture.<sup><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> In our study, an high number of boys is present and the gender was not included as a covariate in statistical analysis. A further evaluation including a more homogenous sample, could be useful to define any difference on music benefits on postoperative distress and control pain between males and females.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Music seems to improve postoperative cardiovascular parameters. While benefits on pain control are not so evident, positive effects on hyperglycemia stress-induced are relevant.
