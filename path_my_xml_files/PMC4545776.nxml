There is Western medicine for this condition but the treatment effect is often incomplete. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been increasingly prescribed for patients with PIC. Preliminary trials on <italic>Qing-Feng-Gan-Ke-Granules</italic> (QFGKG) conveyed promising results in treating PIC. This protocol describes an ongoing phase III randomized controlled clinical trial, designed according to a novel methodology of &#x0201c;one study, one primary outcome&#x0201d;, with the objective of evaluating the efficacy and safety of QFGKG in patients suffering from PIC.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>This is a multicenter, phase III, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled clinical trial, comprising two simultaneously conducted study parts, part A and part B, intending to investigate two primary outcomes, <italic>i.e.</italic> time to cough resolution and cough symptom score, respectively. A total of 480 patients, aged 18 to 65&#x000a0;years, who complain of an ongoing persistent cough that has been lasting &#x02265;3&#x000a0;weeks, will be recruited from six participating sites and then randomized to receive QFGKG 12.0&#x000a0;g twice daily or placebo 12.0&#x000a0;g twice daily. Each part will enroll 240 patients, with 180 patients being allocated to the QFGKG group and 60 to the placebo group.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Although traditional Chinese medicine is a structured intervention that has shown some promise in treating persistent cough, existing unconvincing evidence has noted limitations. This is a rare well-designed and rigorously-controlled, randomized, double-blind trial to evaluate the effects and safety of a Chinese herbal medicine in patients with postinfectious cough, providing tangible benefits for clinical research. Results of this trial are inclined to be conjectured as more truthful by implementing separate study parts that specifically estimate exclusive primary outcome. It will not only provide robust clinical evidence on the efficacy and safety of QFGKG for postinfectious cough, but will also provide a critical piece of information on the availability and superiority of a novel methodology for future clinical trials. The current trial is ongoing with recruitment of the predetermined number of patients being in progress.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>The two parts of this trial were separately registered with the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.chictr.org/cn/proj/show.aspx?proj=4978">ChiCTR-TRC-13003278</ext-link> (part A); and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.chictr.org/cn/proj/show.aspx?proj=4788">ChiCTR-TRC-13003337</ext-link> (part B).</p></sec></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>Cough is the most common symptom presenting to primary healthcare services. Postinfectious cough (PIC) is considered as one of the top causes of subacute cough, which occurs in 11 to 25 % of patients with upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. It involves a persistent cough lasting &#x02265;3&#x000a0;weeks or even months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] (but normally&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;8&#x000a0;weeks) secondary to the acute symptoms of a common cold or upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Although PIC is always self-limited and is not associated with severe debilitation or mortality, persistent cough may impair the quality of daily life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Therefore, many patients with PIC are frequently impelled to seek medical help [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>Aside from pertussis, however, despite the fact that many pathogenic agents including respiratory viruses (particularly respiratory syncytial virus, adenoviruses, parainfluenza, and influenza), M pneumoniae and Chlamydophila pneumoniae have been implicated in children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], the role of infectious aetiology in PIC in adults is rarely confirmed till now [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Poor knowledge on the pathogenesis of PIC, which is supposed to be frequently multifactorial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], results in a diagnostic challenge for physicians. Patients are constantly investigated for other causes of persistent cough [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Therapy with antibiotics has no role, as there is no evidence that bacterial infection plays a role in adult patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Cysteinyl leukotrienes were considered to be involved in the pathogenesis of PIC in recent studies, however, montelukast failed to effectively treat PIC in a latest randomized trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], leading to a controversy on its role in PIC. Therefore, PIC can be a troublesome problem for physicians and patients alike [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Currently available therapies, including inhaled ipratropium, inhaled or oral corticosteroids, central acting antitussive agents such as codeine and dextromethorphan, can only be used for symptom relief [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. They have not been proved to be effective in reducing the cough duration or improving the quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. And above all, a range of adverse outcomes including blurred vision, confusion, difficulty in urination, drowsiness or dizziness, body rash/itching, nausea or vomiting, constipation, diarrhea, sedation, nervousness are elicited occasionally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. For these reasons, complementary and alternative medicine is becoming more and more popular in patients with PIC, such as a combination of honey and coffee [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] as well as traditional herbal medicines.</p><p>The use of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) as a complementary and alternative therapy for cough can be dated back to thousands of years ago. People in China who suffer from a persistent cough always give first priority to TCM. With an increasing number of TCM formulas developed for clinical use, an overview to facilitate the discussion of its pros and cons is warranted. A recent comprehensive systematic review of randomized controlled trials demonstrated potential curative effects and reassured the safety of TCM in the management of PIC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Unfortunately, due to the undesirable quality of included studies, the definite effect of TCM turned to be inconclusive in this review. Therefore, a rigorously designed randomized trial becomes imperative.</p><p>TCM offers a holistic vision on disease, and syndrome differentiation is the cornerstone of TCM prescription. Differentiation means comprehensive analysis, and syndrome refers to symptoms and signs. Differentiation of syndromes implies that the patient&#x02019;s symptoms and signs collected by the four diagnostic methods (inspection, auscultation ant olfaction, inquiry, pulse-taking and palpation) are analyzed and summarized to identify the etiology, nature and location of a disease, thereby determining what syndrome the disease belongs to. Based on both clinical experience and literature review, &#x0201c;pathogenic-wind invading lung syndrome&#x0201d; is considered as the most common TCM syndrome in patients with PIC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. TCM patent drug <italic>Qing-Feng-Gan-Ke-Granules</italic> (QFGKG), designed on the basis of a classic formula, comprises four widely used herbal plants (<italic>Ephedra sinica Stapf</italic>, <italic>Sinomenium acutum</italic>, <italic>Stemona japonica (Blume) Miq.</italic>, and <italic>Aster tataricus L.f.</italic>). It has been shown that QFGKG is very effective in dispelling wind and relieving cough and is specifically appropriate for treating &#x0201c;pathogenic-wind invading lung syndrome&#x0201d;. Unpublished preliminary phpartacodynamics studies in rats showed that QFGKG could significantly alleviate sulfur dioxide-induced cough and ammonium hydroxide-induced cough, increase the tracheal phenolsulfonphthalein excretion, improve the peritoneal capillary permeability reduced by acetic acid, relieve asthma caused by acetyl choline and histamine inhalation, inhibit carrageenin-induced toes swelling, suppress dinitrochlorobenzene-induced delayed type hypersensitivity, which suggests its antitussive, anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties. Subsequent clinical studies investigated its efficacy and feasibility in individuals with PIC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In addition, a previous multi-center phase II trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] investigated the dose-effect relationship and dose-safety relationship of QFGKG, with primary outcomes of time to cough relief and time to cough resolution, as well as secondary outcomes of cough symptom score, cough recovery rate, TCM curative effect, and Chinese version of cough-specific quality of life questionnaire (CQLQ) score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In this phase II trial, 180 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive high dose of QFGKG (12.0&#x000a0;g, twice daily), or low dose of QFGKG (6.0&#x000a0;g, twice daily) plus dummy QFGKG (6.0&#x000a0;g, twice daily), or dummy QFGKG (12.0&#x000a0;g, twice daily) alone. Great improvements in all outcomes, especially the time to cough resolution and cough symptom score, were observed in the high dose group. To the best of our knowledge, the phase II study was the first well-designed placebo-controlled clinical trial that reported TCM as a remedy for PIC, and its resultful conclusions provide foundations for the current phase III trial.</p><p>&#x0201c;One study, one primary outcome&#x0201d;, a novel methodology for clinical trial design, was published by China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA). The core of this concept lies in the supposition that study results will be more credible if the whole study is single-mindedly and exclusively designed for the unique outcome of main interest. Moreover, the SPIRIT guidance suggests a minimum number of primary outcomes in clinical trials because multiple primary outcomes can introduce problems with multiplicity, selective reporting, and interpretation when there are inconsistent results across outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Thus, although this design has not been widely implemented in clinical trials, we prefer to conduct a tentative trial in an attempt to provide some practical information.</p><p>The objective of this trial is to demonstrate the superior efficacy and safe of QFGKG over placebo in adult individuals with PIC by addressing the following hypotheses: (1) That QFGKG will significantly shorten the cough duration in patients with PIC; (2) That QFGKG will significantly relieve the main clinical symptoms in patients with PIC; (3) That QFGKG will increase the quality of life in patients with PIC; (4) That QFGKG is safe and will not result in any serious side effects; (5) That the novel design methodology of &#x0201c;one study, one primary outcome&#x0201d; is feasible and desirable in clinical trials.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study designs</title><p>This trial is designed as a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel, phase III, superiority trial, with allocations stratified by participating centers and randomization performed as block at a ratio of 3:1, adhering to the recommendation of &#x0201c;CONSORT statement&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and &#x0201c;SPIRIT statement&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. As to the allocation ratio, generally speaking, for a superiority trial using placebo as a control intervention, 3:1 is recommended by Provisions for Drug Registration (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sda.gov.cn/ypzcgl/ml.htm">http://www.sda.gov.cn/ypzcgl/ml.htm</ext-link>), taking into full consideration of statistical significance, ethical requirement and risk-cost relationship. This trial consists of two simultaneously conducted study parts (part A and part B), currently involving six participating centers across China: West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Tangdu hospital of The Fourth Military Medical University, Affiliated Hospital of Jiangxi University of TCM, the Second Affiliated Hospital of Tianjin University of TCM, Affiliated Hospital of Inner Mongolia Medical University, and the First Affiliated Hospital of Henan University of TCM. These centers were defined primarily geographically. In each participating center, a chief investigator will be appointed to be responsible for the whole clinical process (subject recruitment, intervention, follow-up, and data collection), adhering to the study protocol. All personnel involved in this trial will be trained prior to trial initiation. Training program is about study protocol and relevant skills, especially the skill of TCM syndrome differentiation. Staff placement and individual responsibility will also be elaborated in the training session. Besides, investigator&#x02019;s brochure developed by the sponsor to facilitate the smooth running of the trial will also be provided. This protocol is designed largely depending on the results of previous phase II trial. Both study parts have been registered with Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.chictr.org/">http://www.chictr.org</ext-link>).

Patients, who are diagnosed as having PIC in one of the participating centers according to the guideline issued by the Chinese Medical Association [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], aged between 18 and 65&#x000a0;years, with a TCM syndrome being differentiated as &#x0201c;pathogenic-wind invading lung&#x0201d; based on the Guidelines for Clinical Research of New Chinese Medicine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], are eligible for enrollment.

Some discrepancies should be noticed in the inclusion criteria of two parts. Part A is designed to focus on the time when cough can be resolved completely, thus patients&#x02019; cough severity is relatively mild in order to yield more expected results. On the other hand, part B is designed to calculate the dynamic change in cough symptom score across four time-points (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>), so the cough severity of patients recruited in this part is relatively severe for more obvious changes.<table-wrap id="Tab3"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Diagnosis criteria for postinfectious cough</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td>&#x025cf;

A centralized randomization will be employed. The random coding of each center as well as the allocation sequence are generated electronically using SAS 6.12 software. Assignments are concealed in sequentially prepared coded, sealed, opaque envelopes, in which the corresponding intervention group of the randomization list will be found. A professional statistician who is independent of intervention and data collection is appointed to choose appropriate block length to ensure concealment. A group of research assistants who are not involved in recruitment, intervention or assessment of outcomes will prepare the envelopes. Staff responsible for recruitment is not allowed to take part in the group allocation. Only after the former participant is enrolled and his/her baseline testing is completed, the next envelope could be opened by researchers responsible for allocation. Participants will be randomized to the intervention group or the control group in line with numbered envelope under instructions from drug managers at each center. Blind codes along with random seeds and block length will be recorded in duplicate and delivered to Good Clinical Practice (GCP) Centre of West China Hospital and the sponsor for safekeeping. Patients and all engaged personnel including the sponsor remain blind to allocation and intervention throughout the whole process. Placebo will be packaged with imitative similarity in appearance, smell and taste with QFGKG. However, personnel who are designated to prepare drug packaging and labeling will not be blinded. The prepared emergency code-break envelope that contains allocation information, and emergency measures as well as contact details of the responsible department will be distributed to study centers along with drugs. Patients reported side effects will be recorded in the case report forms (CRFs) detailedly by physicians at visit 1 and visit 2. If an unpredictable severe adverse event happens, the chief investigator is qualified to open the emergency envelope and guide physicians to treat the patient according to emergency measures. The patient must be withdrawn and be followed up until he/she recuperates. In this case, the chief investigator should report the case to hospital ethical committee and drug administration agency. The broken code and reasons for unblinding should be recorded on CRF. Meanwhile, severe adverse event report form (SAERF) will also be completed. During the revealing, allocation information must not be disclosed to the patient and any third party.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Sample size</title><p>The latest edition of Provisions for Drug Registration issued by CFDA recommends a minimum number of 300 for subjects enrolled in the trial group in a phase III clinical trial. Sample size calculation of this trial results in 24 patients in total for part A (18 in the QFGKG group and 6 in the placebo group) and 56 patients in total for part B (42 in the QFGKG group and 14 in the placebo group), respectively. Obviously, the calculated patient number in the QFGKG group is much smaller than the recommended one. Given the above, we set the sample size according to the Provisions for Drug Registration. 480 patients in total would be included, with 360 being assigned to the QFGKG group and 120 being assigned to the placebo group, considering a maximal dropout rate of 20 %. Calculation assumed an 80 % power for a two-sided log-rank test at a 5 % significance level.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Interventions</title><p>After enrollment, eligible patients will be randomly assigned to receive twice daily QFGKG 12.0&#x000a0;g or twice daily dummy QFGKG (placebo) 12.0&#x000a0;g. The use of placebo as a comparator in this trial largely depends on empirical evidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] and Guidelines for Clinical Research of New Chinese Medicine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Besides, the absence of generally recognized therapy and self-healing tendency of PIC also support the use of placebo. QFGKG and placebo in this trial are manufactured by Baotou TCM Co., Ltd. The Latin names, English names and Chinese Pinyin of the four herbs used in QFGKG are listed in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref>. Both within-group changes and between-group changes are assessed across three time-points during treatment. As to the treatment duration, a longer (14&#x000a0;days) treatment in part A is conducted for the sake of more cured cases, while a shorter treatment (10&#x000a0;days) in part B is enough for monitoring noticeable changes in cough symptom score. A two-day follow-up will be conducted for all patients. At the initial drug dispensing stage, patients are advised to strictly follow protocol instructions, which will be reiterated at each study visit. Participants are requested to genuinely report their daily dosage of drugs that have been actually taken and to return unused ones to physicians at each study visit. Drug using and returning will be recorded on CRF by physicians. Unused drugs will be finally collected and counted by drug managers and then be destroyed by the sponsor at the end of the trial. All previous and concomitant treatments, including drug and non-drug therapies, taken one week before and during the intervention will be recorded on CRF. Concomitant treatment for comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes and other chronic conditions are permitted during the intervention. Whereas, the use of antibiotics, Western or other antitussives, and non-drug cough suppressing therapies such as acupuncture and cupping are strongly discouraged to prevent potential systemic effects. Participating centers are required to record dropout cases and reasons, and also side effects happen during the intervention.<table-wrap id="Tab6"><label>Table 6</label><caption><p>Latin name, English name and Chinese pinyin of the four herbs</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Latin name</th><th>English name</th><th>Chinese pinyin</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Exploring an effective treatment for PIC is an urgent necessity. TCM is a structured intervention that has shown some promise in the management of persistent cough. A growing number of clinical trials are studying the effect of TCM on PIC. But unfortunately, existing unconvincing evidence makes it awkward to interpret findings in a consistent manner or confirm a conclusion. Although our previous phase II trial is the first study using TCM to treat PIC, some limitations still exist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], such as the absence of follow-up. This trial aims to fill this gap by undertaking a well-designed multicentre, placebo-controlled, double-blind randomized trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a TCM formula, <italic>Qing-Feng-Gan-Ke-Granules</italic>. Moreover, this trial will be an outstanding supplement to this area by providing tangible benefits for PIC research.</p><p>In this trial, we conduct two simultaneous study parts that are mutually independent but not mutually exclusive. We aim to not only propose a new effective remedy for PIC but also practice a novel methodology for clinical trials, that is &#x0201c;one study, one primary outcome&#x0201d;. As we all know, a well designed clinical trial is always expected to answer multiple main clinical questions. Nevertheless, sometimes it is unreasonable to assess multi-primary outcomes in one study. In this trial, we intend to investigate the effectiveness of QFGKG on different clinical outcomes. In this case, it may be more convincing and persuasive to study different groups of patients and conduct different intervention durations to achieve exclusive primary outcome by separating the original trial into study parts. We believe that if considering the results of the two study parts as a whole, it would be helpful not only for figuring out ongoing objectives but also for clarifying further implications. Therefore, we assume that this novel design contributes to maximized efficacy, lower cost, a better risk-benefit ratio of treatment and more convincing results with strong application value and may be recommended for further clinical intervention trials. This is the most all-important distinguishing feature of this trial. Another breakthrough in this protocol is that we highlight the importance of two clinical related outcomes, time to cough resolution and quality of life, which are seldom assessed in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>Several limitations and drawbacks of this study are as follows. Firstly, since we are going to conduct different intervention durations in the two parts, some patients with relatively mild cough would be treated for 14&#x000a0;days while those with relatively severe cough will be treated for 10&#x000a0;days, which is paradoxical and against common clinical practice. Secondly, although a careful knowledge of medical history and physical examination including serologic tests may provide clues to diagnosis, the diagnosis of PIC still largely depends on clinical exclusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Therefore, the possibility of misdiagnosis cannot be ruled out. Thirdly, an objective cough measurement is not included in this study. Many video and sound recording surveillance have been used in clinic to objectively monitor the cough frequency and severity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. However some studies reported a poor relationship between cough frequency and cough symptom score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Furthermore, although operating a manual recording instrument is easy for patients, it requires a good compliance, otherwise, considerable errors could be induced. In addition, how to effectively and sensitively distinguish and filter the external vocal interference, and also record the weak electromyographic signals of pulmonary muscles are still the technical bottlenecks for the development of 24&#x000a0;h cough monitors. Besides, the expensive cost also limits the use of cough recording surveillance. For the above reasons, objective cough measurements are not included in our study. Fourthly, the lack of data from old people over the age of 65 fails to provide information about the efficacy and safety of QFGKG in this group of patients.</p><sec id="Sec16"><title>Trial status</title><p>The recruitment process was initiated from May 01, 2013 and until now, a total of 318 participants have been included.</p></sec></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ALP</term><def><p>Alkaline Phosphatase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ALT</term><def><p>Alanine aminotransferase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AST</term><def><p>Aspartate aminotransferase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BPT</term><def><p>bronchial provocation test</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BUN</term><def><p>Blood urea nitrogen</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CMH</term><def><p>Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CQLQ</term><def><p>cough-related quality of life questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Cr</term><def><p>Creatinine</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CR</term><def><p>chest radiography</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CRF</term><def><p>case report form</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ECG</term><def><p>Electrocardiogram</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FAS</term><def><p>Full Analysis Set</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GCP</term><def><p>good clinical practice</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>QFGKG</term><def><p>Qing-Feng-Gan-Ke Granules</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CFDA</term><def><p>China Food and Drug Administration</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SS</term><def><p>Safety Analysis Set</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PPS</term><def><p>Per Protocol Set</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TCM</term><def><p>traditional Chinese medicine</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>UPT</term><def><p>urine pregnant test</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>URTI</term><def><p>upper respiratory tract inflammation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>&#x003b3;-GT</term><def><p>&#x003b3;-Glutamyl Transpeptidase</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p>Wei Liu and Hongli Jiang contributed equally to this work.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>WL and HL-J are co-first authors, they contributed equally to this work.
