Standard options for eradicating residual leukemia after induction are intensive cycles of cytarabine-based consolidation chemotherapy, autologous stem cell transplant, or allogeneic stem cell transplant. Each option carries significant morbidity and may be difficult to tolerate in patients with co-morbidities and impaired performance status. In the setting of minimal residual disease, immunotherapy offers an innovative strategy for treating post-remission AML without the classic side effects of intensive chemotherapy or transplantation. The existence of leukemia-associated antigens (LAAs), which can serve as molecular markers to distinguish leukemia cells from host cells, provide the rationale for immunotherapy in the treatment of AML [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. CD8<sup>+</sup> cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTLs) are capable of recognizing LAAs after presentation on class I MHC molecules, and can subsequently mediate elimination of malignant cells bearing these antigens (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]). Vaccination with peptide antigens can increase the frequencies with which antigen-specific effector and memory T cells are generated to enhance the effectiveness of cancer cell clearance.</p><p id="Par15">Wilms tumor 1 (WT1) is a particularly promising target for cancer vaccination because it is overexpressed in the majority of myeloid cancers and has an essential role in leukemogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The inhibition of <italic>WT1</italic> gene expression causes leukemia suppression in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] while forced expression of <italic>WT1</italic> in mice results in leukemia induction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In addition, not only do WTI transcript levels in bone marrow and peripheral blood increase with disease severity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], but detection of WT1 transcripts is itself a marker for minimal residual disease that can presage clinical signs of relapse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. These properties make peptide vaccination with WT1 a promising strategy for pursuit in AML.</p><p id="Par16">Two WT1 peptides, the HLA-A*02-restricted peptide 126&#x02013;134 and the HLA-A*24-restricted peptide 235&#x02013;243, have been tested in clinical trials and have been shown to be well-tolerated, safe and capable of inducing immunogenic and molecular responses both in the setting of complete remissions (CR) and in active AML and high-risk MDS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Vaccination with WT1 peptides can induce expansion of WT1-specific T cells, as measured by tetramer analysis or ELISPOT assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Furthermore, the presence of WT1-specific T cells has been correlated with reduction of WT1 transcript levels (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]).</p><p id="Par17">Given these positive results, the ideal strategy for vaccination with WT1, including identification of the optimal vaccine adjuvant, deserves further investigation. We present the results of a pilot trial of HLA-A02<sup>+</sup> patients randomized to receive vaccination with WT1 126&#x02013;134 peptide (RMFPNAPYL) in Montanide or in polyinosinic&#x02013;polycytidylic acid (poly ICLC), a novel immune adjuvant that acts as a synthetic agonist to Toll-like Receptor 3 (TLR3). In animal models, TLR3 agonists promote an IFN-mediated vaccine response when stimulated by its ligand, dsRNA. dsRNA promotes antigen cross-presentation by dendritic cells and enhances the sustained production of primary and memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In humans, TLR3 agonists have been used as adjuvant treatments for cancer patients with variable success [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The goals of this trial were to compare the effectiveness of a novel immune adjuvant in patients with myeloid leukemia as well as to offer further validation of the immunogenicity of the WT1 vaccine.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Patient selection</title><p id="Par18">Between March 2012 and May 2014, seven adult patients with bone marrow biopsy-confirmed AML or MDS were enrolled.

Both had delayed WT1 qRT-PCR responses: Pt 001 had increased WT1 PCR level after the third and sixth WT1 vaccination, thus donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) was planned. Interestingly, the WT1 PCR level became undetectable at the time prior to DLI about 40&#x000a0;days after 6th WT1 vaccination, and remained very low when last measured at the 3&#x000a0;month follow-up (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, Pt 001) with persistent WT1-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, Pt 001). The WT1 PCR level of Pt 006 was undetectable after 9 WT1 vaccines, but unfortunately resurged after 12 vaccinations. This patient subsequently relapsed several months later (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, Pt 006). Both Pt 001 and Pt 006 had increased WT1 level at the time of disease relapse. WT1 specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were detected with WT1 peptide vaccination (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, Pt 006). The high level WT1 specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell at the time of WT1 PCR relapse might help to control the leukemia, since the patient did not have morphologic relapse until 18&#x000a0;months after the last WT1 vaccination. Pt 005 had some increase of WT1 PCR level after three vaccinations, but it became undetectable after the 6th WT1 vaccination. Patient 007 had a mild decrease of WT1 level after the three vaccinations, but it increased sharply following the 6th WT1 vaccination, corresponding to morphologic disease relapse. Our data from this small number of patients suggest that monitoring WT1 levels during vaccination treatment might be useful to predict response and disease relapse.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>Both WT1 vaccine in Montanide and poly ICLC could decrease WT1 level during the vaccination; and WT1 level is correlated with disease progression</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="40164_2018_93_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig>

However, WT1 peptide in poly ICLC failed to induce any detectable WT1 specific CD8<sup>+</sup> lymphocytes (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, Pt 004 and data not shown). Thus, our data from the limited patients demonstrated that Montanide appears to be a superior vaccine adjuvant to poly ICLC for induction of specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses. However, poly ICLC might lead to control of WT1 levels through other mechanisms. Our observation will need to be confirmed by a large study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Biased TCR enrichment with WT1 peptide vaccination</title><p id="Par31">In order to monitor the TCR repertoire changes with WT1 vaccination, TCR alpha and beta deep sequencing was done on three patients on the Montanide arm and one patient on the poly ICLC arm from whom cells were available for analysis.

The third patient on the poly ICLC arm was later found to have A0202 instead of A0201, and thus would not have been expected to respond and could serve as negative control. Not surprisingly, this patient did not have a decrease of WT1 qRT-PCR levels nor TCR clonal expansion during vaccination (data not shown).

To our knowledge, this is the first prospective study to directly compare two adjuvants using WT1 peptide vaccination with incorporation of WT1 minimal residual disease monitoring and TCR repertoire analysis. Although we could not complete the whole enrollment of the trial, our data suggest that Montanide may be the superior adjuvant to induce peptide specific cytotoxic T cells and could be considered for future vaccine studies in patients. Due to the small number of patients randomized to each arm, statistical analysis could not applied; we are reporting our interesting observation without statistical significance in the hope to provide some insight for the future trial design.</p><p id="Par33">Our trial demonstrated that it is plausible to incorporate minimal residual disease monitoring and TCR repertoire analysis in prospective studies with coordinated efforts. This helped us to understand the different mechanisms that Montanide and poly ICLC as adjuvants might use to control disease. We anticipated generation of WT1 specific CD8<sup>+</sup> CTL after WT1 peptide in Montanide vaccination, which resulted in transient control of disease elicited by the WT1 MRD monitoring; these results are consistent with previous results from other groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. An interesting finding from our study was that administration of WT1 in the TLR3 agonist poly ICLC was associated with clinical benefit manifested by controlling of WT1 PCR levels, and two patients remained in clinical remission more than 3&#x000a0;years after treatment (we could not rule out that their remission might not associated with WT1 vaccination in poly ICLC), even though no increase in WT1-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell response was detected. It is possible that, given the small number of patients treated; these results are a consequence of variability in the WT1 assay over time. However, it is conceivable that poly ICLC stimulates immune activation and disease control through different mechanisms, distinct from induction of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. When engaged, TLRs promote the priming of adaptive immune responses by host antigen presenting cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. TLR signaling on dendritic cells following CpG or LPS exposure has been reported to render effector T cells refractory to Treg-mediated suppression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. TLR3 agonists have been utilized to treat cancer patients with the aim of inducing an IFN-mediated anticancer immune response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Poly-ICLC has been given intramuscularly or subcutaneously and has been used safely in several clinical trials with promising efficacies in various type of tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Poly ICLC was demonstrated to induce rapid immune response in ovarian cancer patients when used as an adjuvant in targeting tumor self-antigens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Rapoport et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] demonstrated that combination of Montanide/poly ICLC/MAGE-A3 protein had greater antibody responses and better CTL responses in patients with multiple myeloma but was complicated with severe injection-site reactions that evolved into sterile abscess, but the MAGE-A3 alone without Montanide group still elicited clinical responses. Due to the small number of patients on each arm, our observations were informative only and solid conclusion will require larger study.</p><p id="Par34">Recent advances in deep sequencing technology make it possible to characterize the antigen-specific T cell receptor repertoire generated following immunotherapies in cancer patients (i.e. the &#x0201c;clonality&#x0201d; of the response). Previous studies demonstrated biased usage of TCR-V&#x003b2; gene families in WT1 peptide-vaccinated patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Thus, an in-depth analysis of the WT1 specific TCR repertoire could lead to identification of high avidity WT1-specific TCRs for use in future adoptive cell therapy approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Our TCR sequencing results demonstrated TCR clonal enrichment with vaccination of WT1 in Montanide, but not in WT1 in poly ICLC. These results suggest that different mechanisms are involved in the apparent disease control by WT1 peptide vaccination in these two adjuvants. With the accumulation of novel WT1-specific TCR sequences from vaccinated patients, it may be possible to establish a dataset or bank of WT1-specific TCR sequences to be used as a pool to generate WT1 reactive TCR engineered CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells for clinical utilization as cellular therapy.</p><p id="Par35">Our results demonstrated efficacy and tolerability of WT1 peptide vaccination in patients with myeloid malignancies especially in the setting of minimal residual disease status. In order to enhance the efficacy of peptide vaccination, future work should include blockade of negative regulatory mechanisms such as depletion of Tregs, or the inclusion of checkpoint inhibitors such as anti-CTLA4 antibody or anti-PD1/PD-L1 antibodies.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>WT1</term><def><p id="Par5">Wilms tumor 1</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TLR3</term><def><p id="Par6">Toll-like receptor 3</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>poly ICLC</term><def><p id="Par7">polyinosinic&#x02013;polycytidylic acid</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>qRT-PCR</term><def><p id="Par8">quantitative real-time PCR</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CDR3</term><def><p id="Par9">complement determining region 3</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AE</term><def><p id="Par10">adverse event</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AML</term><def><p id="Par11">acute myeloid leukemia</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>allo-SCT</term><def><p id="Par12">allogeneic stem cell transplantation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DLI</term><def><p id="Par13">donor lymphocyte infusion</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>HL, AS, RL, TG and WS designed the trial.
