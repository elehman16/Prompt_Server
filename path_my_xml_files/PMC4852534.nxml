Girls are less active and experience a steeper decline in activity than boys (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Nader et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>). In England, the majority of adolescent girls do not meet the government's recommendations of a minimum of 60&#x000a0;min of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) per day (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Joint Health Surveys Unit, 2013</xref>). As physical activity is associated with physical and mental health (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Janssen &#x00026; Leblanc, 2010</xref>), identifying ways to encourage more girls to be active more often is a national (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Department of Health, 2011</xref>) and global (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">World Health Organisation, 2004</xref>) health promotion priority. A recent meta-analysis has shown that physical activity interventions for girls are more effective if they exclude boys, are delivered at school and are based on an underlying theory of behaviour change (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Pearson, Braithwaite, &#x00026; Biddle, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Dance is a popular activity amongst girls (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">O'Donovan &#x00026; Kay, 2005</xref>) and proliferates contemporary culture and media consumed by young people such as music TV, talent shows and singing contests. Dance can be an enjoyable form of cardiovascular exercise in which girls develop their co-ordination, acquire new skills, work independently and in groups and develop friendships and self-expression (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Australian Women Sport and Recreation Association, 2010</xref>). Dance is an alternative to traditional/competitive sports offered to girls and we have previously highlighted the potential of a dance-based physical activity intervention for adolescent girls: the Bristol Girls Dance Project (BGDP) (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Jago et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Jago et&#x000a0;al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Jago et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Powell et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>). The BGDP was a cluster-randomised controlled trial designed to examine the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of an after-school dance-based intervention in increasing the MVPA of Year 7 girls (aged 11&#x02013;12 years).</p><sec id="sec1.1"><label>1.1</label><title>Theoretical foundations of BGDP</title><p>Underpinning interventions with behavioural theory is hypothesised to increase their effectiveness (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Baranowski et&#x000a0;al., 1998</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Craig et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>). In addition, theories allow intervention developers to target activities at theoretically-derived mediators (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Baranowski et&#x000a0;al., 1998</xref>). The BGDP intervention was based on self-determination theory (SDT) (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Deci and Ryan, 2000</xref>, <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Ryan and Deci, 2007</xref>) because its theoretical foundations are concerned with how the psychological and socio-environmental conditions (e.g., created by a dance teacher) can support individuals' motivation (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Fortier, Duda, Guerin, &#x00026; Teixeira, 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec1.2"><label>1.2</label><title>Motivation quality</title><p>According to SDT, an individual's motivation for a behaviour such as dance, can be more or less self-determined and six different types of motivation are hypothesised to be differently associated with behaviours such as physical activity and related cognitive and affective outcomes (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Ryan &#x00026; Deci, 2007</xref>). The more self-determined types of motivation (i.e., intrinsic motivation, integrated &#x00026; identified behavioural regulation) are broadly grouped as <italic>autonomous</italic>. Intrinsic motivation is based on the inherent satisfaction or enjoyment that accompanies a given behaviour. The other forms of autonomous motivation are extrinsic in nature and involve undertaking a behaviour for a reason other than its inherent satisfaction. Integrated regulation is where a person aligns their engagement in a behaviour with their broader self (e.g., seeing being active as part of one's identity) and identified regulation represents motivation which is driven by a valued outcome such as health benefits or making new friends. The less self-determined types of motivation (i.e., introjected &#x00026; external regulation) are broadly grouped as <italic>controlled</italic> motivations. Introjected regulation refers to motivation based on internalised pressures such as avoiding feelings of guilt, whereas external regulation is characterised by prods and pushes which are external to the person such as complying with demands or avoiding punishments. Previous research suggests that more autonomous physical activity motivation is positively associated with child and adolescent physical activity (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Owen et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Sebire et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>) and positive psychological outcomes such as quality of life and physical self-concept (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Standage, Gillison, Ntoumanis, &#x00026; Treasure, 2012</xref>). On the other hand, adolescents' controlled motivation for exercise has been shown to correlate negatively with health-related quality of life and functioning within physical, social, school and emotional domains (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Standage et&#x000a0;al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec1.3"><label>1.3</label><title>Fostering high quality motivation</title><p>A cornerstone of SDT is that autonomous motivation is developed when people feel that their psychological needs for autonomy (i.e., feelings of volition and free will), competence (i.e., feeling capable to perform challenging tasks) and relatedness (i.e., perceptions of belonging &#x00026; meaningful connections with others) are fulfilled (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Deci &#x00026; Ryan, 2000</xref>). This hypothesis is supported by empirical research among children (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Sebire et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>), adolescents (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Van den Berghe, Vansteenkiste, Cardon, Kirk, &#x00026; Haerens, 2014</xref>) and adult dancers (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Quested &#x00026; Duda, 2010</xref>). Within SDT, people's psychological needs can be supported or undermined by the motivational climate that an authority figure (e.g., dance instructor) creates through their motivating or teaching style (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Deci and Ryan, 2008</xref>, <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Su and Reeve, 2011</xref>). Need supportive styles are underpinned by the provision of autonomy support, structure and involvement which is reflected in how teachers' (or dance instructors) conduct their classes and interact with pupils (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Haerens et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Su and Reeve, 2011</xref>). When teachers provide autonomy support they give meaningful rationales (especially for tasks which are important but not as enjoyable as others), offer choices which pupils value, seek and acknowledge pupils' perspectives or ideas and nurture pupils' internal motivation, interest and enjoyment. In contrast, controlling teachers aim to motivate pupils by either inducing internal pressures such as guilt, or external pressure such as a deadline and feedback given and language is used to manipulate rather than be informative. Such strategies are likely to frustrate rather than support pupils' psychological needs (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Bartholomew, Ntoumanis, &#x00026; Thogersen-Ntoumani, 2009</xref>). Teacher's provision of structure is primarily related to supporting pupil's competence. A well-structured class is where clear expectations are set out before tasks and during tasks, guidance, direction and positive effect-based feedback is given. Without structure, a learning environment can be described as chaotic where students do not know what they should do or what is expected of them (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Vansteenkiste et&#x000a0;al., 2012</xref>). Pupils' relatedness is supported when teachers' are involved by showing the pupils empathy and genuine interest in them (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Aelterman et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Haerens et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Su and Reeve, 2011</xref>). In contrast, a lack of involvement by teachers will frustrate relatedness. Amongst children, Physical Education (PE) teachers' use of need-supportive styles has been shown to be associated with their pupils' psychological need satisfaction and autonomous motivation for PE (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Ntoumanis and Standage, 2009</xref>, <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Van den Berghe et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec1.4"><label>1.4</label><title>Design of the BGDP</title><p>We have previously reported the study protocol (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Jago et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>) and outcome paper (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Jago et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>). The study involved 571&#x000a0;Year 7 girls (aged 11&#x02013;12 years) from 18 schools from the greater Bristol area allocated at the school-level to intervention (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;9) and control (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;9) arms. The intervention consisted of 40, 75-min after-school lessons that took place, twice per week for 20&#x000a0;weeks&#x000a0;at school and were led by 10 professional dance instructors between January and July 2014. Girls were provided with a dance diary which they could complete and hand in to the dance instructor at the end of each lesson, in which they could record what they had learnt, their feelings and thoughts. Instructors were provided with a manual which provided plans for all 40 lessons in addition to training outlined below. One instructor was unable to complete the full intervention and was replaced at the intervention mid-point with another instructor. One instructor taught in two schools (ID numbers 21 and 51).</p></sec><sec id="sec1.5"><label>1.5</label><title>Embedding SDT within the BGDP intervention</title><p>BGDP aimed to increase girls' autonomous motivation for both dance and physical activity and this was targeted through the BGDP instructor manual, the lesson design and content, and dance instructor intervention training (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;1</xref>). Dance instructors received a one day training session (5th December 2013) prior to the start of the intervention (13th January 2014) which included 2&#x000a0;h on SDT (delivered by SJS) highlighting the key features of the training manual and how the theory could be applied in dance lessons. The content of the manual and the training focussed on how to provide autonomy, competence and relatedness support and intertwined involvement and structure as ways to achieve this. Comparisons were made between using these need-supportive strategies and more controlling practices. Instructors were given the opportunity to practice using need-supportive techniques by role-playing different dance activities, asking questions and receiving feedback. At the mid-point of the intervention, instructors attended a half-day top-up training session where the SDT components were revisited and instructors shared their experiences of delivery to resolve any problems.</p></sec><sec id="sec1.6"><label>1.6</label><title>Results of BGDP and the need for a theoretical process evaluation</title><p>The BGDP intervention was not effective in increasing girls' MVPA at the end of the intervention period when dance lessons were still running or at 12 months after baseline (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Jago et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>). Following the intervention, autonomous and controlled motivation and perceptions of competence and relatedness were lower among intervention versus control group participants. This was unexpected and highlighted the importance of using process evaluation to further understand these findings and the motivational processes at play. The part of the BGDP process evaluation which focussed on the dose of the intervention received (i.e. the number of lessons attended) and evaluation of issues pertaining to attendance and retention identified that between 37 and 40 dance lessons were delivered in all schools (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Sebire et&#x000a0;al.,</xref>). Attendance (<italic>M</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;12.8, SD&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;7.0) at dance lessons declined over time and approximately nine girls per school out of a possible 33 received the intervention dose (defined as two thirds of the lessons offered). Participants enjoyed taking part and reported social and physical health benefits. Instructors valued the intervention training and identified that variable attendance challenged delivery but also facilitated the development of a core group of committed participants. Multiple process evaluation papers are justified to make full use of all of the data collected (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Moore et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>). Given the large volume of data produced from the detailed process evaluation of BGDP the aim of this paper is to report a process evaluation of the BGDP study with particular focus on theoretical fidelity. Process evaluation can play a crucial role in illuminating how theory-based intervention components are experienced by the participants and importantly how they are received, interpreted and implemented in practice by intervention deliverers. The findings can then be used to interpret findings of intervention effects in greater detail and refine how theory can be best operationalised in practice.</p><p>Specifically we sought to use both quantitative and qualitative methods to evaluate: (a) the degree to which dance instructors adopted a need-supportive style, (b) participants' perceptions of the dance instructors' teaching practices, (c) participants' qualitative perceptions of satisfaction of autonomy, competence and relatedness and (d) dance instructors' experiences of delivering an SDT-based intervention.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><label>2.1</label><title>Data collection</title><sec id="sec2.1.1"><label>2.1.1</label><title>Qualitative data collection</title><p>At the end of the intervention and within three weeks of the final dance lesson (delivered 11th July 2014), the 10 dance instructors participated in individual semi-structured interviews with JMK (mean duration&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;67.2&#x000a0;min, range&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;41.4 to 91.4). An interview guide was followed which covered instructors' experiences of the intervention training and using the intervention manual (e.g., &#x0201c;<italic>Were you able to include any of the motivational ideas that were in the manual and training day?&#x0201d;)</italic>, delivering the intervention in a need-supportive way (e.g., <italic>What strategies did you use to motivate the participants?</italic>), their relationship with the participants (e.g., <italic>What was your relationship with the girls like?

Of particular relevance to this paper, the focus group topic guide explored participants' views on and relationship with the dance instructor (e.g., <italic>Is there anything you would change about your dance instructor's teaching style?</italic>), and perceptions of autonomy, competence and relatedness (e.g., Autonomy: <italic>Do you think you had some control over what you did?</italic> Competence: <italic>How did you find the dance sessions physically?</italic> Relatedness: <italic>Did your relationships with one another change as the weeks went on?</italic>).

Instructors wore an audio recording device on their arm with a microphone attached to their clothing. The observation tool developed by Haerens et&#x000a0;al. (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Haerens et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>) was used. Although the tool was originally designed to rate videos of PE teachers, due to ethical constraints we adapted the method to combine rating of audio recordings of lessons with real-time observation. The instrument contains 21 items measuring <italic>Relatedness support</italic> (5 items), <italic>Structure before the activity</italic> (5 items), <italic>Structure during the activity</italic> (6 items) and <italic>Autonomy support</italic> (4 items). One item (&#x0201c;<italic>encourages pupils to persist</italic>&#x0201d;) was excluded based on low validity within the validation study (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Haerens et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>). Fifteen items were rated from the audio recordings as they did not rely on visual observation and five items (e.g., <italic>Is physically nearby the pupils</italic>) were rated by direct observation. The frequency of each teaching practice occurring was rated using a four-point scale (0&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;<italic>Never</italic>, 1&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;<italic>Sometimes</italic>, 2&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;<italic>Often</italic>, 3&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;<italic>All the time</italic>) for each 5-min&#x000a0;segment of the lesson. Observations and ratings were undertaken by a researcher (JMK) who had discussed the definitions and meaning of the higher order constructs and scale items in depth with (SJS) and undertaken a pilot observation/rating. JMK and SJS listened to the pilot recording separately, then together using the observation tool to guide a discussion of the presence of each teaching behaviour in 5&#x000a0;min segments. To check consistency in interpretation, six audio recordings (excluding the items requiring visual observation) were coded by both (JK) and (SJS).

Dance instructors considered performances to be an important motivational element of a dance programme: <italic>You've almost got to have like an end plan that they're all working towards</italic> (Dance instructor 62).

The results can be used to better understand theoretical fidelity and shed light on the results of the trial.</p><p>The majority of instructors believed that the SDT principles of the training aligned with their teaching styles and methods. The training was well received and served as a reminder to instructors to focus on the &#x0201c;how&#x0201d; (i.e., communication practices) in addition to the &#x0201c;what&#x0201d; (i.e., dance content) of their teaching. A previous study among PE teachers (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Aelterman et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>) identified similar acceptance of SDT-based intervention training and research has shown that classroom teachers' beliefs that implementing an SDT-based teaching style is likely to be effective, easy and normal/usual are associated with their motivating style (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Reeve et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>). We believe that our findings indicate that the dance instructors involved in BGDP did buy-in to the SDT teaching style, and believed that it would be effective however the reality and ease of implementing it in practice with the participant group led to variable fidelity as discussed below.</p><p>Dance instructors qualitatively reported providing choice (of music, dance styles, warm-up activities, and choreography) within sessions that reflected examples given in the training manual (this therefore also indicates fidelity) and this was perceived by instructors and girls to make lessons more engaging and enjoyable. However, this provision largely reflected <italic>option choice</italic>, and did not appear to provide <italic>action choice</italic>, such as having control over the pace of task progression which is a central element of autonomy-support (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Reeve, Nix, &#x00026; Hamm, 2003</xref>). Previous research suggests that providing action choice promotes self-determination and intrinsic motivation more than option choice (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Reeve et&#x000a0;al., 2003</xref>). Instructors that mainly provided option choices may have believed that this was sufficient autonomy-support and neglected action choice. The quantitative need-support ratings corroborate this finding and suggest low provision of autonomy-support across all instructors and substantial room for improvement. This finding is consistent with Haerens et&#x000a0;al. (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Haerens et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>) who reported that autonomy-support was the least common need supportive practice amongst PE teachers relative to other practices. Further, the qualitative results highlighted the importance of combining autonomy-support with structure as some participants felt uncomfortable when they were left to practice on their own with insufficient instructions. Previous work has shown that teaching styles which combine autonomy-support and structure are associated with improved learning, behavioural and motivational outcomes amongst adolescents (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Vansteenkiste et&#x000a0;al., 2012</xref>) and highlight the importance of ensuring that interventions are able to help teachers balance these two teaching dimensions.</p><p>In addition to instances of low autonomy-supportiveness, the qualitative findings identified that some dance instructors used somewhat controlling motivational practices. Instructors may have used controlling strategies for a number of reasons; first, the intervention training may not have successfully changed their teaching styles to be more need-supportive and they adopted their usual practices which included controlling techniques. However, the instructors reported believing that the philosophy of SDT chimed with their usual teaching practices which suggest that this may not have been the case. The SDT component of the dance instructor training was comparable in duration to previous training for PE teachers (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Aelterman et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>), but shorter than others (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Aelterman, Vansteenkiste, Van den Berghe, De Meyer, &#x00026; Haerens, 2014</xref>). Instructors reported wanting more time to practice implementing the different motivating techniques, suggesting that the training may have been conceptually clear but not sufficiently practical. Previous studies of SDT-based training have incorporated videos of real teaching scenarios (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Aelterman et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Aelterman et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>) which can be used to identify and reflect on real teaching practices and dedicated more time to practicing motivating strategies. Second, some dance instructors may have misinterpreted the theory, confusing autonomy-support with a lack of rules or structure. The need-support ratings suggested that structure was used with moderate frequency which provides some evidence for this hypothesis and may have led to more disruptive behaviour and reversion to the use of controlling strategies. Third, some dance instructors may have adopted more controlling practices in response to the challenges associated with teaching large classes of beginners in a school environment. For example, one dance instructor <italic>drifted</italic> (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Bumbarger &#x00026; Perkins, 2008</xref>) from the need-support foundation by using press ups as punishment for talking. Others used working towards a dance performance as a motivational lever which while seen positively by some, was also a source of pressure for others and their dance instructors.</p><p>Moving beyond dance, to broader physical activity interventions which rely on trainers leading groups of young people, our findings suggest that future work is needed to identify whether and how physical activity intervention deliverers use controlling strategies. Further, and based on the nature of trainer's existing practices, it is important to ascertain whether they can be equipped with techniques to use in response to challenging behaviour without resorting to controlling techniques. The findings highlight a need for those developing theory-based interventions to identify innovative ways to communicate theoretical nuances (e.g., action <italic>vs</italic>. option choice) that can be understood and implemented by practitioners. As theory is sometimes viewed as lacking real world validity (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Davidoff et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Rothman, 2004</xref>), there is a risk that efforts to ensure practitioners adopt theoretical principles result in theoretical dilution and more room for drift (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Bumbarger &#x00026; Perkins, 2008</xref>) from the intended theoretical targets.</p><p>Embracing technology within theory-based complex physical activity interventions may be an effective way to overcome some of the issues which in our study were commonly derived from having limited time within training to adequately cover detailed and subtle theoretical nuances alongside other content or intervention deliverers facing challenges within lessons. For example, previous work has supported training with self-study websites which teachers are asked to engage with (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Reeve, Jang, Carrell, Jeon, &#x00026; Barch, 2004</xref>) which include videos of real teaching scenarios. A possible next step is to develop smartphone apps to support in-person training, extend the possible training time and provide a hub of resources to support intervention fidelity such as multimedia content, tasks which reinforce learning, tips when dealing with challenges &#x00026; networking with other instructors.</p><p>Dance instructors reported confidently providing competence support to girls and used a number of techniques which may have utility in future PA interventions. These included a number of examples of providing structure during the dancing activities such as peer&#x02013;peer teaching, encouraging self-reflection, providing genuine encouragement and provision of structure through clear instructions before the dance activities. The dance instructors' experience in teaching may explain their confidence in using these strategies and supports the importance of identifying well trained intervention deliverers who can bring beneficial <italic>innovation</italic> to PA interventions (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Bumbarger &#x00026; Perkins, 2008</xref>). Girls also had positive experiences of competence support (and some reflected on their own increased levels of perceived competence). However, in the BGDP trial, perceived competence towards dance and physical activity decreased pre-post intervention in the intervention group (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Jago et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>). It is possible that both results are correct; that while some participants did feel more competent after the intervention, girls on average did not. Alternatively, the results could point towards changes in the girls' cognitive representations of dance before and after the intervention. Pre-intervention, the majority of girls had no prior experience of formal dance lessons. Dance competence levels were rated as relatively high; which could reflect informal dance experiences (e.g. dancing with friends or alone). However, after experiencing dance in a more structured taught environment, trying more complex choreography and comparing their ability with that of their peers, it is not unreasonable to assume that their cognitive representations of dance and their frame of reference for their perception of competence could have changed post-intervention. This could mask some of the qualitative perceptions of increased competence.</p><p>Relatedness support was the most commonly observed need-supportive technique used by the dance instructors which in most cases was verified by the qualitative findings. This is consistent with previous research among PE teachers (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Haerens et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>), but the dance instructors in our study provided more relatedness support (2.29/3.00) than previously studied PE teachers (&#x02248;1.30/3.00) (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Haerens et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>). This may reflect the interpersonal style the dance instructors have developed through their teaching of dance to groups of girls in out-of-school settings and be an indicator that they found this particular dimension of need-supportive instruction easy which has been shown to be associated withteacher's motivating style (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Reeve et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>). Previous research suggests that relatedness towards PE teachers is associated with girls' engagement in PE (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Shen, McCaughtry, Martin, Fahlman, &#x00026; Garn, 2012</xref>). The qualitative findings identified the development of some strong and trusting girl-instructor relationships. The instructors' use of a number of relatedness-supportive techniques which represent effective intervention <italic>innovation</italic> (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Bumbarger &#x00026; Perkins, 2008</xref>) could be adopted in other interventions (e.g., dedicating time at the end of lessons for the instructor and girls to&#x000a0;lie on the floor with their heads together and reflect on the&#x000a0;lesson, giving regular high-fives, using the dance diary to guide empathically changing lessons in line with what girls enjoy/don't enjoy). However, it was clear from the findings that for a minority of girls, a sense of relatedness was not formed with the instructor which was commonly caused by perceptions that the instructor-participant bond was not genuine. It would be useful in future interventions to identify the use of effective techniques during implementation and share them amongst the network of practitioners who are finding relatedness support difficult. Whilst extra support for instructors was included in BGDP mid-intervention, a&#x000a0;more effective dissemination of teaching techniques or more frequent provision of materials/support (e.g., via an intervention resource such as an app as referred to above) could hold promise in challenging low-fidelity during theory-based PA interventions.</p><sec id="sec4.1"><label>4.1</label><title>Strengths &#x00026; limitations</title><p>The theoretical underpinning of BGDP is a strength that has helped to evaluate where the intervention was consistent with, or drifted from, the intended behaviour change strategies. In addition, the combination of quantitative and in-depth qualitative data collected from both dance instructors and participants has facilitated the development of a detailed picture, strengthened by triangulation between participants and across methods.</p><p>An inherent limitation in theoretical process evaluations is that the intervention deliverers are aware of the theoretical foundations with which they are asked to underpin their delivery. As such, there is the potential for their interview responses and observed lessons to be biased towards good fidelity. However the focus group results largely added credibility to the dance instructor results and we are confident that we heard a diverse range of perspectives including negative experiences which we have reported. Furthermore it is unlikely that the instructors would have been able to change their teaching style significantly during the four observations, particularly given that the instructors were informed on the day of the lesson that they would be observed. A related limitation is that the inter-rater reliability of the rated dance instructor teaching styles was low for relatedness support and low/moderate for the other dimensions but generally lower than previous work with PE teachers (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Haerens et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>). A potential reason for this is that we rated audio rather than video recordings of the dance lessons (as the original measure used) and thus underestimated the information given by physical indicators alongside the audio to make the ratings. However, we only used the ratings of one observer whose ratings were consistent as indicated by good internal consistency estimates. An additional limitation is that we did not measure the dance instructors' perceptions of using an autonomy-supportive teaching style pre- and post-training. This would have afforded us a short-term check of training effectiveness and could be incorporated into future intervention designs. Further, we used a general measure of girls' perception of instructor autonomy-support, which prevented us from examining individual psychological need support and comparing this to our more nuanced observation and qualitative data. Finally, research including applications in the sport and PE domains (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Bartholomew et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Haerens et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>) has separated the concept of need thwarting (e.g., a child perceiving that their teacher/coach is trying to control or manipulate them) from the experience of low need satisfaction (e.g., that a child does not feel that they have much input in lessons/training sessions). In PE, pupils' perceptions of their teacher's controlling teaching was associated with their need frustration whereas perceptions of teacher autonomy support were associated with need satisfaction. In sport coaching, after controlling for need satisfaction, adolescent athletes' perceptions of psychological need thwarting have been positively associated with exhaustion and negatively associated with vitality (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Bartholomew et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>). In the present study, we did not quantitatively measure need thwarting nor the controlling practices of dance instructors. Future process evaluations of SDT-based PA interventions which involve teachers or coaches would benefit from considering need thwarting alongside need satisfaction.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec5"><label>5</label><title>Conclusion</title><p>It is recommended that complex health behaviour change interventions are based on sound theory and that the theoretical elements are subjected to in-depth process evaluation (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Moore et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>). The findings of this theory-based process evaluation indicated that theoretical fidelity within BGDP was variable. We identified a number of instances of high theoretical fidelity and intervention innovation which informs pragmatic techniques that intervention deliverers working with groups of children could use. Illuminating the lack of intervention effectiveness, we also found that there was much room for improvement as we identified examples of low fidelity, some drift from the intended motivational techniques and potential failures to convert theoretical nuances into practice. More broadly, this work has highlighted the value of combining quantitative and qualitative approaches in theory-based process evaluations of physical activity interventions.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Aelterman</surname><given-names>N.</given-names></name><name><surname>Vansteenkiste</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name><name><surname>Van Keer</surname><given-names>H.</given-names></name><name><surname>De Meyer</surname><given-names>J.</given-names></name><name><surname>Van den Berghe</surname><given-names>L.</given-names></name><name><surname>Haerens</surname><given-names>L.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Development and evaluation of a training on need-supportive teaching in physical education: qualitative and quantitative findings</article-title><source>Teaching and Teacher Education</source><volume>29</volume><year>2013</year><fpage>64</fpage><lpage>75</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib2"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref2"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Aelterman</surname><given-names>N.</given-names></name><name><surname>Vansteenkiste</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name><name><surname>Van den Berghe</surname><given-names>L.</given-names></name><name><surname>De Meyer</surname><given-names>J.</given-names></name><name><surname>Haerens</surname><given-names>L.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Fostering a need-supportive teaching style: intervention effects on physical education teachers' beliefs and teaching behaviors</article-title><source>The Journal of Sport &#x00026; Exercise Psychology</source><volume>36</volume><year>2014</year><fpage>595</fpage><lpage>609</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">25602142</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib3"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref3"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Amorose</surname><given-names>A.J.</given-names></name><name><surname>Anderson-Butcher</surname><given-names>D.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Autonomy-supportive coaching and self-determined motivation in high school and college athletes: a test of self-determination theory</article-title><source>Psychology of Sport and Exercise</source><volume>8</volume><year>2007</year><fpage>654</fpage><lpage>670</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib4"><element-citation publication-type="book" id="sref4"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Australian Women Sport and Recreation Association</surname></name></person-group><chapter-title>Young people's dance: A ten year vision 2010&#x02013;2020 for the development of dance for children and young people in England</chapter-title><comment>Panton Hill</comment><year>2010</year></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib5"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref5"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Baranowski</surname><given-names>T.</given-names></name><name><surname>Anderson</surname><given-names>C.</given-names></name><name><surname>Carmack</surname><given-names>C.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Mediating variable framework in physical activity interventions &#x02013; how are we doing?
