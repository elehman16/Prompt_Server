The EA group will receive acupuncture treatment at both regional and distal acupuncture points with electrostimulation. The SEA group will receive sham acupuncture treatment with mock electrostimulation. Both EA and SEA groups will receive a total of four treatments 1&#x02009;hour preoperative, 1&#x02009;hour postoperative and during the morning and afternoon the day after surgery with the same routine postoperative pain control. The control group will receive only routine postoperative pain control. The primary outcome is the 11-point Pain Intensity Numerical Rating Scale (PI-NRS) at 24&#x02009;hours after surgery. The secondary outcomes are the PI-NRS, analgesic consumption, opioid-related side effects, time to first passing flatus, quality of life and adverse events evaluated 6, 12, 24 and 36&#x02009;hours and 7 days after surgery.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>The study was planned in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration and the Korean Good Clinical Practice Guidelines to protect the participants and was approved by the institutional review board (IRB) of Kyung Hee University Medical Center (KMC IRB-1427&#x02013;02).

Moreover, inflation with carbon dioxide during the laparoscopic procedure induces shoulder pain due to irritation of the phrenic nerve, which is referred to as visceral pain.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p><p>Multimodal approaches are beneficial for treating postoperative pain because there are multiple mechanisms of pain after laparoscopic surgery.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Opioid analgesics are generally used to control pain with rapid onset of action.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> However, side effects associated with opioids such as nausea/vomiting, pruritus and reduction in bowel motility (leading to ileus and constipation) may lead to a delayed hospital discharge.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Although other modalities, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors and local anaesthetics, are also used for postoperative pain, patients who have undergone laparoscopic surgery are generally unsatisfied with pain control and approximately 30%&#x02013;40% patients suffer from moderate pain after hospital discharge.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><p>Electroacupuncture (EA) shows the potential to reduce postoperative pain as an adjuvant therapy to conventional anaesthetics. Several clinical trials have shown that preoperative or postoperative EA reduced postoperative pain and analgesic consumption with no significant adverse effects.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8&#x02013;11</xref> However, based on a recent systematic review, there is still insufficient evidence to conclude that EA is an effective method for controlling postoperative pain in surgery due to methodological flaws in the studies that have been performed. Moreover, previous acupuncture trials have mostly focused on postoperative pain after open surgery<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> or orthopaedic surgery such as total knee arthroplasty<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13&#x02013;15</xref> or back surgery.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> For this reason, despite the potential benefits of EA for postoperative pain, the efficacy and safety of EA for laparoscopic surgery remains to be examined. We aim to evaluate the effects of EA on postoperative pain after laparoscopic appendectomy as a basic, common and representative laparoscopic surgery.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Objective</title><p>The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of EA for postoperative pain through pain intensity, analgesic consumption, opioid-related side effects, time to first passing flatus, quality of life and adverse events after laparoscopic appendectomy compared with sham electroacupuncture (SEA) and no acupuncture treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Design and setting</title><p>This study is a single-centre, three-arm, equal randomised, patient-blinded and assessor-blinded (to the type of acupuncture treatment), parallel-group, clinical trial conducted in Korea.</p><sec id="s2b1"><title>Recruitment period</title><p>The participants will be recruited from the Kyung Hee University Medical Center in Seoul, Korea.

A researcher will explain the two types of EA treatments as &#x02018;classical EA, typically used in Korean medicine clinics&#x02019; and &#x02018;non-classical EA, rarely used in Korean medicine clinics&#x02019;.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> After a patient voluntarily consents to the study, a researcher will screen whether the patient can participate in the study. If the patient satisfies the inclusion/exclusion criteria, a clinical research coordinator (CRC) will contact an independent researcher who has the random number table, and the patient will be randomly allocated into one of three groups (the EA, SEA or control group) at a 1:1:1 allocation ratio. Only the patients assigned to the EA or SEA group will receive the acupuncture treatment 1&#x02009;hour before the scheduled laparoscopic surgery. The postoperative pain management of all patients will be performed according to the manual of the Department of Surgery of the Kyung Hee University Medical Center. The patients assigned to the EA or SEA groups will receive acupuncture treatments again 1&#x02009;hour after surgery and the morning and afternoon of the following day. Patients will be discharged on 2&#x02009;days after surgery, and follow-up visits will be scheduled on 7 (&#x000b1;3) days after surgery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Flow chart of study process.

The CRC will send the assignment information to the researcher who will conduct random allocation, then the researcher will only provide assignment information to the doctors of Korean medicine (DKMs) that perform the acupuncture treatment. To ensure allocation concealment, the allocated group information will be recorded in an allocation log by the researcher and will not be opened until the data are locked.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Blinding</title><p>The participants will be blinded to the type of acupuncture treatment and the assessor, data managers, statisticians and study monitors will be blinded to the allocation. All participants who receive acupuncture will be treated using the Park sham device (PSD; Acuprime, Exeter, UK) regardless of what group they are included in. Moreover, mock EA will be provided with the same pulse sound and lamp light as real EA, so the participants will not be able to predict the allocated group based on the appearance of the acupuncture treatment. The blinding will be maintained until the data are locked. For blinding evaluation, allocation guessing will be assessed immediately after the final treatment. Practitioners and assessors will be instructed to treat the participants according to predefined standard operating procedures (SOPs) during the trial to maintain blinding.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Intervention</title><p>EA treatment will be conducted by DKMs with more than 6 years of Korean medicine college education and at least 2 years of clinical experience. A total of four acupuncture treatments will be performed in the EA and SEA groups. One hour preoperative and 1&#x02009;hour postoperative treatments will be performed on the day of the surgery (day 0). On the day after surgery (day 1), one treatment will be carried out in the morning (08:00&#x02013;12:00) and another in the afternoon (13:00&#x02013;17:00) with at least 4&#x02009;hours between treatments. Each acupuncture treatment will be performed after the acupuncture points are sterilised with a disposable ethyl alcohol swab and the acupuncture needles will be retained for 30&#x02009;min. Both EA and SEA are performed under the same conditions, except for the needling components,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> and both groups will be given the same postoperative analgesics in accordance with the predefined protocol and SOPs. This information will be given to the practitioners during workshops before the study begins to ensure standardisation of the treatments.</p><p>A Park sham needle guide&#x000a0;tube<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19 20</xref> will be used for both EA and SEA groups to ensure that the patients remain unaware of the differences between the two acupuncture treatments. This will ensure that the patients do not discern any differences between the individualised, real acupuncture and sham acupuncture treatments, although the penetration of the needles will vary between the two groups.</p><sec id="s2f1"><title>Surgical procedure</title><p>The surgical department is part of a tertiary teaching hospital, in which 12 surgeons and 7 residents participate. Laparoscopic appendectomies are performed by surgeons or residents under the supervision of a surgeon. The operation is performed under general anaesthesia with the patient in a supine position. A 12&#x02009;mm trocar for the camera is inserted just below the umbilicus. Two additional 5&#x02009;mm trocars are inserted in the suprapubic area and right or left lower abdomen. The surgical procedure is performed using standard laparoscopic instruments and in a usual manner including dividing the mesoappendix, ligating the appendix and removing the specimen using a pouch. The 12&#x02009;mm port site is closed using 2-0 Vicryl sutures and the skin incision is closed with subcuticular sutures.</p></sec><sec id="s2f2"><title>Electroacupuncture treatment</title><p>A total of four acupuncture sessions will be performed using 0.25&#x000d7;40&#x02009;mm disposable sterile acupuncture needles (Dong&#x000a0;Bang Acupuncture, Chungnam, South&#x000a0;Korea). After penetration, deqi sensation will be induced using reinforcing-reducing techniques such as rotating and lifting&#x02013;thrusting methods. An EA device (Partner-1; ITC, Daejeon, South&#x000a0;Korea) will be used to apply 2/120&#x02009;Hz (acupuncture points: bilateral ST36, GB34, LI4, PC6, SP6, LR3) and 120&#x02009;Hz (acupuncture points: four ashi points located within a diameter of 5&#x02009;cm from the incision site) at 80% of the maximum intensity that the patient can endure. Acupuncture point selection (including local abdomen and distal points) and frequency of electrical stimulation were based on traditional acupuncture theory and clinical experience by clinicians. The practitioner will regulate the intensity based on the degree of the twitching of muscles or by request from the subject, and only one adjustment will be allowed during treatment. In both acupuncture groups, an infrared lamp will be applied to keep the abdominal area of the patients warm during treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2</xref>).</p><fig id="F2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Acupuncture points of treatment.

When planning an EA study, timing of treatment, treatment points and frequency of electric stimulation should all be carefully considered as these can affect the outcomes of EA. In several EA trials for postoperative pain, it is likely that the results varied because of heterogeneity in the protocol. For this reason, we established a regimented EA protocol based on previous research and our clinical experience. This protocol has been tested and optimised at the Kyung Hee University Medical Center.</p><p>While acupuncture is usually applied after the onset of pain in most pain-related conditions such as low back pain, knee pain or headache, acupuncture can be performed before, during or after surgery to alleviate postoperative pain. Most preoperative and postoperative acupuncture trials have shown to be effective for reducing postoperative pain and analgesic consumption. However, intraoperative EA has shown little to no effect on analgesic consumption, though only a few studies have been conducted. Adding the fact that it is realistically difficult to conduct EA during surgery, we planned to perform EA treatments only before and after surgery.</p><p>Previous studies have used various acupuncture points that include distal points such as ST36 and LI4,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 9 11 29</xref> local points around the incision region<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> or a combination of points.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10 30</xref> There have not yet been any studies that directly compare the effects of distal and local points, but one study<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> reported that electrical nerve stimulation significantly reduced postoperative pain in both local and distal point treatment groups. Some studies used only distal points due to fear of potential adverse events by direct electrical stimulation around the incision site, but there has not been any reports of adverse events such as increased pain or infection of the surgical site in studies that have applied electrical stimulation directly near the surgical region.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10 29 30</xref> Therefore, we utilised both local incision points as well as distal acupuncture points to maximise the effect of acupuncture treatment.</p><p>There is still a lot of debate on the optimal frequency of EA for pain control. Individual studies have used low, high or mixed frequencies and the effectiveness varies from study to study. In the case of EA at distal acupuncture points, the low frequency of 2&#x02009;Hz generally releases &#x003b2;-endorphins, and high frequency (over 100&#x02009;Hz) is known to release dynorphins. Therefore, a mixed combination of both low and high frequencies releases various opioid peptides and creates a synergetic effect that inhibits pain.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27 31</xref> On the other hand, in case of EA around the incision site, high-frequency electrical stimulation (over 100&#x02009;Hz) stimulates specific afferent nerve fibres instead of releasing endogenous opioid peptide and has been shown to be effective for superficial parietal pain caused by skin incision.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> For this reason, one study suggested that mixed stimulation of local high frequency and remote low frequency by silver spike point offered the most relief for postoperative pain.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> As a result, we are using different frequencies from two separate EA devices for local and distal points to maximise the effect of EA.</p><p>We expect that if the results show that EA treatment is a safe and effective option for reducing postoperative pain and analgesic consumption, the study may act as evidence to support the inclusion of EA treatment in a future &#x02018;enhanced recovery after surgery&#x02019; programme in conjunction with laparoscopic appendectomy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e218" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2016-015286.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e219" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2016-015286.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><p>The authors thank Professor Kun Hyung Kim for encouraging suggestions and helpful comments, and Hyun Jin Kim, PA, of Department of Surgery of Kyung Hee University Hospital for her assistance with the data collection.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> SL and SJP planned the overall study protocol.
