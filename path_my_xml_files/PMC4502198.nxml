Other symptoms include cough, dyspnea, malaise, weight loss, wheezing, chest pain, and/or fever. Many of the patients may remain asymptomatic for several years. Radiologically, PA usually presents as a single ball-like lesion or multiple ball-like lesions inside cavities, partially surrounded by a radiolucent crescent (Monod sign),[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] but early disease may present with recent thickening of the cavity wall and/or pleural thickening.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] As most of these patients either do not expectorate or their sputa are negative for mycelia, the diagnosis of PA is mainly based on the detection of anti-aspergillus antibodies (anti-Asp-Ab) in their serum.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Surgical resection is the only definitive mode of treatment for PA, but low respiratory reserve often makes it impossible.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Further, attempts to resect PA with multiple ball-like lesions, often referred to in the surgical literature as complex PA, has been associated with high morbidity and mortality. Bronchial artery embolization may be a useful life-saving measure in some patients with massive hemoptysis but re-bleeding is common and the measure is to be used at best as a short-term therapy, to stabilize the patient till other definitive therapy is instituted.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Direct intracavitary installation of an antifungal agent through the endobronchial route or cavernostomy and radiotherapy has also been tried out with variable, but inconsistent results. Medical therapy has been traditionally considered to have limited activity in the treatment of PA, but it is the only hope of cure in times to come.</p><p>Among the antifungal agents, itraconazole is the most suited drug to deal with a chronic condition such as PA and indeed it is the most frequently used drug, being an orally administered agent, with low cost, high activity against <italic>A. fumigatus</italic>, and high tissue penetration into the lung. However, it works slowly and may not be useful in patients presenting with massive hemoptysis. Tsubura[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] has recommended a dose of 200 mg per day for six months, but Gupta <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] have been able to achieve only partial success on such a dose schedule. The latter have argued that a low dose of the drug or inadequate duration of therapy may be responsible for this. Higher doses of itraconazole have been used around the world in the management of severe mycosis,[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], but Agarwal <italic>et al.</italic> have noted side-effects in about half of their patients on a dose of 400 mg/day.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Thus, the dose and duration of the drug to be used in PA are not clearly defined. It has been hypothesized that a fixed dose of the drug may not be optimal for every patient of PA, as it may be ineffective in overweight patients and too toxic in low-weight patients. Furthermore, 12 months of therapy may be more effective than six months.</p><p>Therefore, a study was carried out to define the optimal dose and duration of itraconazole therapy, based on the efficacy and tolerance of the drug, in diagnosed cases of PAs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>The intake for this prospective, randomized study was started in July 2012 and completed in December 2013. All old treated patients of pulmonary tuberculosis, with a disease duration of more than two years, reporting to the Outpatient Section of the Department of Respiratory Medicine, NIMS Hospital, Jaipur, with respiratory symptoms, along with ball-like lesions inside the cavities or a recent thickening of cavity wall in their chest x-ray/computed tomography (CT) of the thorax were enlisted. The study methodology is briefly shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Consort diagram showing the study methodology</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="LI-32-342-g001"/></fig><p>After careful clinical assessment these patients were subjected to laboratory investigations that included total and differential leucocyte counts, blood sugar and urea, human immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV) serology, complete urine examination, and sputum for Gram stain, pyogenic culture/sensitivity (C/S), and acid fast bacillus (AFB). Two additional morning sputa samples were collected and sent for KOH mount and fungal culture. Venous blood samples drawn from each patient were subjected to an estimation of anti-Asp-Ab as per the protocol used by Gupta <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>All PA patients of age between 18 and 60 years, body weight between 30 and 60 Kg, having two sputa smears negative for AFB, and positive serology (Anti-Asp-Ab titers &#x0003e;60 IU/ml), were included, however, pregnant women, alcoholics, HIV seropositives, and those having co-existing diseases, such as, diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, and chronic liver failure or those on immunosuppressive drugs were excluded.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study protocol</title><p>All the study patients were given a loading dose of itraconazole, that is, 400 mg per day (200 mg, twice daily) for three days and then randomly allocated to one of the three groups as under:</p><p>

</p><p>All the patients were followed up for the entire duration of the study for clinical and radiological response, at monthly intervals. Anti-Asp-Ab titers were estimated at two, six, and twelve months. Adverse effects were recorded as and when reported by the patients and managed symptomatically (chiefly lesupride 25 mg, every eight hours).</p><p>On the basis of the pattern of a radiological lesion, PA was classified as (a) Early PA: Recent thickening of the cavity wall and/or pleura; (b) Simple PA: One or two large, ball-like lesions inside the cavity/cavities, and (c) Complex PA: Multiple, small, ball-like lesions inside the cavities. The criteria for clinical response included control or decrease in the amount of hemoptysis, control or decrease in cough/expectoration, control or decrease in shortness of breath, and control of weight loss or increase in weight. The criteria for radiological response included a decrease in size or disappearance of the fungal ball and thinning of cavity wall. The clinical/radiological response was defined as good, partial or poor.</p><p>Those patients who showed poor clinical as well as radiological responses at two months were shifted to a higher dose schedule of itraconazole, but those patients who continued to suffer adverse effects in spite of symptomatic treatment were shifted to the lower dose schedule. All such patients, where the dose schedule had to be changed, were also followed and monitored as per the protocol of the study, but were excluded from the group analysis. However, these patients were included in the subsequent correlation analyses. Patients who continued to have massive hemoptysis (&#x0003e;100 ml/day) were referred for bronchial artery embolization (BAE). The primary endpoints included clinical response, radiological response, and adverse reactions. The secondary endpoints included death and BAE.</p><p>The data so obtained were tabulated and statistically analyzed using the student's t-test, the analysis of variance (ANOVA) test, and &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test or Fisher exact test, as applicable. The results were also subjected to multivariate analysis, if the difference between the variables on univariate analysis was highly significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001).</p><p>The ethical clearance for the study was initially given by the SMS Medical College, Jaipur, and later, confirmed by the NIMS University, Jaipur.

Hence, the study data are valid for statistical comparison.</p><p>It is clearly evident from this study that the clinical as well as the radiological responses were inferior in patients on the lower dose schedule, as compared to the variable and higher dose schedules at two months. Although, thereafter, the clinicoradiological responses were similar in the in the three groups (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.4), this could be due to the fact that the non-responders on the lower dose schedule (group I) were excluded from the subsequent group analysis. A search of the literature failed to reveal a study that compared the efficacy of various dose schedules of itraconazole in PA. In an earlier study, Gupta <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] have used the lower dose schedule in their patients with partial success, but Agarwal <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] have used a dose of 400 mg of the drug in their patients, with a significantly higher success in the test group.</p><p>It was also observed in this study that a significantly higher number of patients on the higher dose schedule of the drug suffered from adverse reactions, as compared to the rest (<italic>p</italic> &#x02264; 0.003), so much so, the dose of itraconazole had to be decreased in three of these patients. The frequency of adverse reactions was low, but comparable, in patients on variable and lower dose schedules. Agarwal <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] have reported that about half of their patients on the higher dose schedule of itraconazole (400 mg/day) suffered from adverse reactions, but tolerance was not an issue in the study by Gupta <italic>et al.</italic>,[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] where a lower dose schedule of itraconazole (200 mg/day) was used.</p><p>A within-group analysis of patients was also consistent with the fact that the response and adverse reactions to itraconazole were dependent on the dose of the drug vis-a-vis the body weight.</p><p>Furthermore, in this study, the radiological response (and to some extent, the clinical response also) was significantly poor in patients with simple PA, as compared to the early and complex PA. Agarwal <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and Denning[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] observed a favorable therapeutic response to systemically administered itraconazole in their patients with chronic cavitary pulmonary aspergillosis (multiple cavitations with or without ball-like lesions). Furthermore, a six-month therapy was inadequate, as these patients continued to respond beyond this period more so, the patients with simple PA. No study has specifically correlated the sequential response to therapy in different forms of the disease.</p><p>From the above, it can be safely concluded that a weight-based variable dose schedule of itraconazole is both an effective as well as a safe modality in the management of PA, as compared to the fixed dose schedules, and therapy should be extended beyond six months, more particularly in patients with simple PA. Moreover, surgical options should be kept open for patients with simple PA, who fail to respond to the drug.</p><p>The limitations of the current study include a fewer number of patients and an inability to monitor the drug levels. Larger studies with monitoring of drug levels are required, to substantiate the above results and make substantial recommendations on the issue.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn
