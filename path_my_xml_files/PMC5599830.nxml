by identifying the ratios of the multifidus muscles on the two sides of the spine when
standing postures are maintained on mediolateral ramps of diverse angles. [Subjects and
Methods] The study was conducted with 15 healthy adult males. All subjects participated
voluntarily. Mediolateral ramps at five angles (0&#x000b0;, 5&#x000b0;, 10&#x000b0;, 15&#x000b0;, and 20&#x000b0;) were used.
Ultrasonography was used to determine the thicknesses of the multifidus muscles under
individual conditions. [Results] The ratio of the left/right multifidus muscles showed
statistically significant differences as the angle of the mediolateral ramp increased.
Post-hoc test results showed that the use of the two multifidus muscles was asymmetric on
mediolateral ramps at angles equal to or larger than 10&#x000b0;. [Conclusion] The asymmetric use
of the multifidus muscles began on a mediolateral ramp at an angle of 10&#x000b0;, suggesting that
subjects with instability in body control might have risk factors such as falls on
mediolateral ramps with angles equal to or larger than 10&#x000b0;. Therefore, caregivers must be
attentive and/or assist patients and older adults when they are walking on ramps at angles
of approximately 10&#x000b0; and up in their daily lives.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Mediolateral ramp</kwd><kwd>Multifidus muscle</kwd><kwd>Ultrasonography</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The multifidus muscles on the spine are among the important muscles that maintain the
stability of the spine and pelvis<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the
spine neutral position, the contraction of the multifidus muscles on the two sides increases
the spine stability and prevents lumbar instability and low back pain<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. In particular, they provide greater amounts of stability in
the L4/L5 segments, where lumbar instability appears the most frequently<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. The proximal stability provided by the
multifidus muscles affects the motility of the limbs, which are distal parts<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. That is, asymmetric and abnormal
contractions of the multifidus muscles affect low back pain and body balance<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Balance and stability in the body are secured through the complex processes of diverse
structures of the body. Strategies for restoring balance and securing stability include the
ankle joint strategy, hip joint strategy, and integration strategy. Among these, the
integration strategy is used for most external agitations<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. The use of the integration strategy requires the cooperative
actions of the body segments and the trunk, and the stability of the trunk should be secured
for the cooperative movements of the limbs<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>External factors affecting the body&#x02019;s balance are very diverse due to the development of
society. Among the external factors, ramps are a facility for the simultaneous vertical and
horizontal movements of walking. To ensure safe walks and the use of facilities via ramps,
the angles of ramps have been determined by the Act on Guarantee of Promotion of Convenience
of Persons with Disabilities, the Aged, Pregnant Women, etc. in South Korea. Studies on
ramps have been continuously conducted with respect to ascending and descending slopes to
fit the purpose of the use of the ramps. Movements using ramps are very complex due to
defects and weakness in the anatomical structures of the lower limbs<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, ramp gaits can secure stability only when the
movements of the knee, hip, and ankle joints are changed to be more diverse compared to
movements on flat ground<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, if
the body lacks the ability to adapt to changes in the ground such as ramps, the risk of
falls is high due to lack of stability<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.
As such, the environments of ramps increase the risk of falls in cases where physical
movements are deficient, such as in older adults and people with disabilities. However, most
studies on ramps have been limited to the analysis of body movements on ascending and
descending ramps, and studies on environments where people cross the ascending and
descending ramps, such as where people cross roadways, are quite insufficient due to changes
in social environments.</p><p>Therefore, this study was conducted to identify changes in the multifidus muscles while
body balance is maintained on mediolateral ramps rather than ascending and descending ramps.
This study used mediolateral ramp environments with diverse angles and analyzed the
left/right balance of the multifidus muscles, which play an important role in trunk
stability when walking on an angled ramp, to provide basic data that informs the field about
the risks of increasing mediolateral ramp angles.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study was conducted with 15 healthy adult males in their 20s, who voluntarily agreed
to participate in the study. All the subjects were right-sided, had no neurological or
musculoskeletal disorders, heard sufficient explanations of the purpose of the study, and
understood the explanations. To enhance the reliability of the muscle thicknesses measured
through ultrasonography, subjects that corresponded to body mass indexes (BMI) that ranged
from 18.5 to 24.9 were selected to ensure the homogeneity of the soft tissues<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. The mean age of the study subjects was
22.8&#x02005;years, the mean height was 171.36&#x02005;cm, and the mean body weight was 67.4&#x02005;kg. We declare
that the abovementioned manuscript was approved by Ethics Committee of Kyungsung University
according to approval number KSU-17-04-004 and that an Informed Consent Form was signed by
the participants.</p><p>Ultrasound imaging equipment (MyLabTMSix, ESAOTE Europe BV, Netherlands) was used to
measure the thicknesses of the multifidus muscles. The multifidus muscles were measured by a
proficient expert who had knowledge of the anatomical locations and functions of the
multifidus muscles to minimize inter-examiner errors due to muscle locations and applied
pressure. The researchers used a convex probe (3.5&#x02013;5&#x02005;MHz) to acquire standardized ultrasound
images and obtained the clearest images by locating the anatomical position of the muscles
between the L4/L5 spinous processes<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.
The thicknesses of the multifidus muscles were identified from the acquired images using NIH
Image J software (version 1.44 for Windows). The measurements were conducted three times on
each subject for each ramp angle condition, the average value was calculated, and the
thickness ratios of the left and right multifidus muscles were used as statistics. The
thickness ratios of the left/right multifidus muscles were calculated using the following
equation.</p><p>The measurements were performed while the subjects maintained standing postures with both
feet on a mediolateral ramps set at five different angles (0&#x000b0;, 5&#x000b0;, 10&#x000b0;, 15&#x000b0;, and 20&#x000b0;). At
all ramp angles, the measurements were performed when the subjects were able to maintain the
posture without shaking so that they had sufficient time to ensure stability. The standing
postures on the ramp were achieved by having the subjects stand with their feet shoulder
width apart, with both soles in contact with the ramp, and place the right foot in the lower
position of the mediolateral ramp. The ramp was made of aluminum materials and the angles
could be adjusted. The postures were performed with bare feet to remove the variable of shoe
shapes. Ramp angles were randomly assigned to the subjects and a 2-minute rest time was
provided after each condition.</p><p>The data were processed using the statistical program SPSS ver. 18.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago,
IL, USA) for Windows. One-way ANOVAs were used to compare the thickness ratios of the
left/right multifidus muscles for each ramp angle. Post-hoc tests were conducted using
Tukey&#x02019;s measure to identify the statistical difference of each angle. Statistical
significance level &#x00251; was set to 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The results of the identification of the ratios of the left/right multifidus muscles for

multifidus muscles measured in the standing postures were maintained on the mediolateral

The ratios of the left/right multifidus muscles measured in the standing postures were
maintained on the mediolateral slope at 10&#x000b0; (95.04 &#x000b1; 3.43), which was statistically
significantly different compared to those on flat ground and on an angle of 5&#x000b0; (p=0.05)

sides of the road sidewalks and use crosswalks that go across the roadway. Although the Act
on Guarantee of Promotion of Convenience of Persons with Disabilities, the Aged, Pregnant
Women, etc. provides standards for the environments where people walk, due to changes in
age, people are using part of the roadway as a crosswalk and consequently, people are using
ramps that are higher than the ramps that have been specified by the law. In addition,
people use crosswalks across such ramps. Therefore, this study was conducted to analyze the
effects of crosswalk environments on human bodies, thereby studying mediolateral ramps that
can prevent falls among older adults and people with disabilities to prepare standards for
environments such as crosswalks and ensure stability.</p><p>According to the results of this study, standing postures on mediolateral slopes at 5&#x000b0; did
not show any statistical difference in the uses of the multifidus muscles on the two sides
from standing postures on flat ground, indicating that excessive trunk asymmetry did not
occur. However, in the case of standing postures on the mediolateral slope at 10&#x000b0;, the uses
of the multifidus muscles on the two sides became asymmetric, indicating that the postures
affected the rotation or extension of the trunk. These results were observed at all angles
greater than 10&#x000b0; among the angles of the mediolateral slopes used in this study. These
results mean that the body changes occur with an angle smaller than the 16&#x000b0;<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup> reported to be the angle where
ascending/descending ramps affect changes in gait. This means that the risk of mediolateral
slopes is higher than that of ascending and descending slopes. In addition, whereas gaits
with the same movements on the left and right side of the body are performed on ascending
and descending slopes, mediolateral slopes cause asymmetry in which the left and right sides
of the body generate different mechanisms. Therefore, the risk of falls can be said to be
higher on mediolateral slopes. Among the mechanisms that maintain body balance, the weight
shifting strategy adjusts left/right balance and is a more important strategy for patients
with cerebral palsy and hemiplegia compared to the anteroposterior balance strategy<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, in the case of patients, although there are risks on
ascending and descending slopes, risks on mediolateral slopes can be said to be higher.</p><p>According to previous studies, the use of the gluteus medius increases on mediolateral
slopes at 15&#x000b0; and this angle affects stability<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, in the present study, which observed the multifidus
muscles that directly affect the stability of the trunk and show proactive movements as deep
muscles<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>, the multifidus muscles were
identified as showing left/right asymmetry at 10&#x000b0;, which is smaller than the 15&#x000b0; slope
angle.</p><p>Based on the results of this study, the risks of using a mediolateral ramp increase
beginning at an angle of 10&#x000b0; and further studies of risks in environments where ramps are
crossed, such as crosswalks installed on sloped roads, are necessary. In terms of
limitations, since this study was conducted with 15 normal adults, the results may not be
safely generalized and since muscles cannot be measured when movements such as gaits are
done due to the characteristics of deep muscle measuring equipment, the results cannot be
safely identified as results during gaits. More studies on mediolateral ramps should be
conducted hereafter with diverse subjects and more detailed angles.</p><sec><title>Conflict of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest to declare.</p></sec><sec><title>Financial disclosure</title><p>None.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by
