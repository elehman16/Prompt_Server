The process of periodontal pocket formation represents the pathological sequel of microbial- and inflammatory-mediated degradation of collagenous connective tissues and alveolar bone.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>]</p><p>Recent developments in science and technology have revolutionized the basic outlook and approach to the periodontal disease. A thorough understanding of the etiopathogenesis of periodontal disease has provided the clinicians and researchers with a number of diagnostic tools and techniques that has widened the treatment options.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>]</p><p>Conventional periodontal treatment consists of mechanical debridement to eliminate the subgingival microbiota and infected tissue in the inflamed pocket, usually performed by scaling and root planing.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] The aim of nonsurgical periodontal therapy is to eliminate both living bacteria in the microbial biofilm and calcified biofilm microorganisms, i.e. dental calculus, from the root surface and from the subgingival area without surgical reflection of the soft tissues surrounding the teeth.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>]</p><p>However, deep periodontal pockets, especially with root surface concavities or furcation involvement, prevent the effectiveness of scaling and root planing. Consequently, this has led to the adjunctive use of antimicrobials, assuming that chemical aids would compensate for technical limitations and prevent early microbial recolonization to, ultimately, ensure the best chance for clinical improvements.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] Goodson <italic>et al</italic>. first proposed the concept of controlled delivery of drug therapy in the treatment of periodontitis.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] The advantage of this form of therapy is that it reaches the base of the periodontal pocket and is maintained for an adequate time for the antimicrobial effect to occur. Local administration of antimicrobial drugs directly into the periodontal pocket has been suggested as a means of bypassing systemic complications and targeting localized areas of periodontal destruction. The local concentration achieved can be much higher than is possible by the systemic route, and there is no dependence on patient compliance for success of the therapy.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>]</p><p>Different drugs used for local delivery are tetracyclines, including doxycycline[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] and minocycline,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] metronidazole[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] and chlorhexidine.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] Of all the chemical plaque control agents, chlorhexidine has proven to be the most effective, safe and clinically effective in reducing plaque and gingivitis and is the time-tested gold standard for the treatment of periodontal diseases. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of a controlled-release biodegradable chlorhexidine chip (Periocol CG; Eucare Pharmaceuticals Pvt. Ltd., Chennai, India) when used as an adjunct to scaling and root planing in the management of periodontitis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>Forty patients (28 males and 12 females) in the age group of 30&#x02013;65 years suffering from mild to moderate adult periodontitis were selected among the patients visiting the dental OPD.

According to Soskolne <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>] if, after definitive periodontal therapy, there are still residual pockets of &#x02265;5 mm remaining, then combined routine periodontal maintenance therapy along with the chlorhexidine chip is advisable.</p><p>Clinical attachment gain from the baseline for the duration of study at 1 month, 2 months and 3 months intervals were 0.15&#x000b1;0.37 mm, 0.00&#x000b1;0.57 mm and 0.47&#x000b1;1.26 mm, respectively, for group A and 0.36&#x000b1;0.76 mm, 1.05&#x000b1;1.12 mm and 1.15&#x000b1;1.30 mm, respectively, for group B [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>]. The findings of our study are in partial accordance with those of Azmak <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] who observed a significant improvement in the clinical attachment level in both the scaling and root planing plus chlorhexidine chip group and the scaling and root planing alone group at 1 month, 3 months and at 6 months as compared with baseline.</p><p>At the end of the study, the mean change in clinical attachment level from baseline was 0.47&#x000b1;1.26 mm for group A and 1.15&#x000b1;1.30 mm for group B [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>]. These findings are in accordance with those of Jeffcoat <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>] who observed improved attachment levels over the 9-month period for the scaling and root planing plus chlorhexidine chip group and a significant improvement compared with the scaling and root planing alone group at 9 months.</p><p>Reduction in the bleeding index score at 1 month, 2 months and 3 months intervals was 0.21&#x000b1;0.65, 0.15&#x000b1;0.55 and 0.26&#x000b1;0.45, respectively, for group A and 0.23&#x000b1;0.69, 0.42&#x000b1;0.44 and 0.39&#x000b1;0.56, respectively, for group B as compared with baseline [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T6">Table 6</xref>]. There was a statistically significant difference in the bleeding index score observed at 3 months interval in group A and statistically highly significant difference in bleeding index score at 2 months and at 3 months intervals in group B compared with baseline. These findings are in accordance with those of Azmak <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] who found a mean reduction in bleeding index score at 1 month and 3 months for both the combination group and the scaling and root planing alone group when compared with baseline. However, at all periods of observations, a statistically nonsignificant correlation was observed in the bleeding index score in between groups A and B. With respect to radiographic findings, 21% of the sites in group A and 47% of the sites in group B experienced bone gain at the end of the study, whereas 74% and 53% of the sites in group A and group B, respectively, maintained bone level that was statistically highly significant (<italic>P</italic>=0.001). The results of our study are in accordance with those of Jeffcoat <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>] who observed with digital substraction radiography technique that 15% of the sites in the scaling and root planing alone group and 11% of the sites in the scaling and root planing plus placebo chip group experienced bone loss during the study; in contrast, no sites in the scaling and root planing plus chlorhexidine chip group exhibited bone loss. The differences in the results observed may be attributed to the use of intraoral periapical radiograph along with X-ray mesh in our study for assessing changes in alveolar bone height, which is a comparatively less-sensitive technique for the detection of small osseous changes.</p><p>About five patients (26%) observed adverse effects like gingival pain and tender gums in group B, whereas there was not even a single patient in group A who reported any side-effect due to the treatment procedure. Adverse effects occurring in the first week of the study appeared to be associated with chip placement at baseline after scaling and root planing. None of the changes discovered on oral examination were of a serious and irreversible nature.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>In conclusion, the results of this study show that chlorhexidine chip containing 2.5 mg chlorhexidine gluconate (Periocol CG) is an effective adjunctive therapy to scaling and root planing in the treatment of chronic periodontitis. It provides a safe, easily applied single-dose means of achieving significantly better clinical results than scaling and root planing alone. The adjunctive use of the chlorhexidine chip with scaling and root planing resulted in a clinically meaningful improvement in pocket depth reduction and clinical attachment level gain compared with scaling and root planing alone.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold>
