In two double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over experiments, we investigated whether the food supplement choline bitartrate improved declarative memory and working memory in healthy, young students one to two hours after supplementation. In experiment 1, 28 participants performed a visuospatial working memory task. In experiment 2, 26 participants performed a declarative picture memorization task. In experiment 3, 40 participants performed a verbal working memory task in addition to the visuospatial working memory and declarative picture task. All tasks were conducted approximately 60 minutes after the ingestion of 2.0&#x02013;2.5g of either choline bitartrate or placebo. We found that choline did not significantly enhance memory performance during any of the tasks. The null hypothesis that choline does not improve memory performance as compared to placebo was strongly supported by Bayesian statistics. These results are in contrast with animal studies suggesting that choline supplementation boosts memory performance and learning. We conclude that choline likely has no acute effects on cholinergic memory functions in healthy human participants.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The authors have no support or funding to report.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="6"/><table-count count="0"/><page-count count="16"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>Data files are available from the Open Science Framework (URL: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://osf.io/k8ctb">osf.io/k8ctb</ext-link>).</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>Data files are available from the Open Science Framework (URL: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://osf.io/k8ctb">osf.io/k8ctb</ext-link>).</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Consuming sufficient nutrients is at the base of healthy physical functioning and mental well-being. The daily intake of dietary components is essential for the synthesis of the brain&#x02019;s neurotransmitters and a lack of such chemical compounds can have serious consequences for health and behavior [<xref rid="pone.0157714.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0157714.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. One such dietary components is choline, which is believed to be important for healthy brain functioning and behavior.</p><p>Animal studies have shown that choline is a precursor of the major neurotransmitter acetylcholine [<xref rid="pone.0157714.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0157714.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], a neurotransmitter crucial for cholinergic memory functioning [<xref rid="pone.0157714.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0157714.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Choline is chemically very similar to acetylcholine [<xref rid="pone.0157714.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and the synthesis of acetylcholine largely depends on dietary choline intake [<xref rid="pone.0157714.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0157714.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Thus, choline is important for the synthesis of acetylcholine in animals [<xref rid="pone.0157714.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. As a result, the long-term effects of dietary choline availability on the rodent&#x02019;s brain and memory have been investigated extensively. For example, the brain&#x02019;s acetylcholine concentrations increase after an enriched choline diet [<xref rid="pone.0157714.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and memorization of food locations improve after rats were administered with choline either prenatally [<xref rid="pone.0157714.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0157714.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], around birth [<xref rid="pone.0157714.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0157714.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], or later in life [<xref rid="pone.0157714.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0157714.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] (for a review, see [<xref rid="pone.0157714.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]). Furthermore, in cognitively impaired mice prenatal choline supplementation also enhances performance in typical attention and memory-related tasks [<xref rid="pone.0157714.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0157714.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Yet other studies have demonstrated a link between a choline deficient diet and impaired acetylcholine synthesis [<xref rid="pone.0157714.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], and impaired memory in adult animals [<xref rid="pone.0157714.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0157714.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0157714.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In sum, the studies above suggest that there is a strong link between dietary choline intake and memory functions in animals.</p><p>Due to the promising findings in animal studies, scientists have postulated that abnormalities in choline availability and acetylcholine synthesis may give way to the development of memory disorders such as Alzheimer and Parkinson dementia in humans [<xref rid="pone.0157714.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0157714.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Several studies have tried to improve memory functioning in aged human patients suffering from impaired memory by increasing the amount of choline in the diet. However, the results were mixed. Lecithin and choline chloride, both substances containing the chemical structure of choline, do not successfully improve memory performance [<xref rid="pone.0157714.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0157714.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0157714.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0157714.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. However, cytidine diphosphate choline (citicoline, CDP-choline) and choline alphoscerate (alpha-glyceryl-phosphoryl choline, alpha-GPC), both alternative compounds that contain choline, seem to be promising substances in the treatment of progressively declining memory functioning in human patients with dementia [<xref rid="pone.0157714.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0157714.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The discrepancy between the effects of these different substances may relate to the complexity of the digestive system. Nonetheless, it remains unclear why and which choline-containing substances improve memory. Here we extend this field of research by testing the effects on memory functioning of another substance called choline bitartrate.</p><p>Many of the studies discussed above manipulated choline availability in the diet. However, the more acute effects of choline intake on memory performance have thus far not been investigated in humans. Recent evidence suggest that choline has acute effects on the motor system, which, as memory does, depends on cholinergic brain networks [<xref rid="pone.0157714.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. In the current study we therefore investigated whether choline can affect performance on a variety of memory tasks an hour after supplementation.</p><p>Most aforementioned studies used cholinergic substances to improve memory performance in elderly patients with memory impairments. A recent study has further examined the effect of choline on visual and auditory memory performance in healthy human adults, either by itself or in combination with caffeine [<xref rid="pone.0157714.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Although choline on its own did not lead to significant improvements in memory performance they did find that a combination of 2g of choline bitartrate and 25mg of caffeine significantly improved performance on both the visual and auditory memory task compared to a placebo group. In a different experiment a combination of 100mg of caffeine and 2g of choline also significantly improved performance on a backwards digit span test compared to either caffeine or choline on its own [<xref rid="pone.0157714.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. This suggests that choline bitartrate does have the ability to improve memory functioning in healthy human adults, although the exact mechanism remains unclear. To examine whether high age and memory improvements matter for choline to have effect, and to examine a larger target group than just patients, we additionally investigated the effects of choline in a population of young, healthy, human adults. In sum, the current study had two a priori goals: to investigate whether choline bitartrate, a salt version of choline, could improve memory performance in healthy individuals and to test what types of memory functions are improved by the ingestion of choline.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Experiment 1 &#x02013;Visuospatial Working Memory</title><sec id="sec003" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>The first experiment was designed to test the effects of choline bitartrate versus placebo intake on visuospatial memory performance. We used a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized cross-over design with a counterbalanced order of conditions.</p><sec id="sec004"><title>Participants</title><p>Thirty human individuals were recruited through the use of fliers and an online advertisement placed on a university website for ongoing studies. Two participants dropped out after session one. We eventually gathered data from 23 females and 5 males (age M = 19.50, SD = 2.05, range = 18&#x02013;28; body mass index: M = 22.67, SD = 2.72, range = 17.6&#x02013;29.8). All participants were right-handed students, received study credit or money for participation, gave informed written consent on paper before the experiment, and were debriefed after the experiment. Participants were required to be between 18 and 35 years old, to have normal or corrected-to-normal vision, no cardiac, hepatic, renal, neurological or psychiatric disorders, personal or family history of depression, migraine and no medication or drug use. All female participants were tested only on days that they were using hormonal contraception. Women who did not use hormonal contraceptives were therefore excluded from participation. In this way hormonal confounds were limited, allowing for proper comparison across subjects (for details, see [<xref rid="pone.0157714.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]). In line with previous studies on the acute effects of choline on behavior [<xref rid="pone.0157714.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0157714.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0157714.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] and to control for choline uptake unaffected by other supplements, participants were restricted from drinking alcohol the day preceding the study and participants were not allowed to have breakfast, coffee, or cigarettes before the experiment (overnight fasting, only water and caffeine-free fruit tea without sugar allowed). Participants were na&#x000ef;ve to the purpose of the experiment and told that we investigated the effects of vitamin C on cognition. To prevent that the students&#x02019; knowledge about food supplements would confound the results, the experiment was deceptive: participants were led to believe that they drank orange juice enriched with vitamin C. The experiments conformed to the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and were approved by the local ethical committee &#x0201c;Commissie Ethiek Psychologie&#x0201d; (Approval number: 5430110878 and 9406292569; For ethics guidelines concerning food supplements, see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://media.leidenuniv.nl/legacy/richtlijnen-toediening-voedingssupplementen.pdf">http://media.leidenuniv.nl/legacy/richtlijnen-toediening-voedingssupplementen.pdf</ext-link>; Leiden University, Institute for Psychological Research). There were no minors (participants younger than 18 years old) involved in the here described experiments.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Apparatus &#x00026; materials</title><p>Depending on the session, participants were given 400ml of orange juice including 2g of dissolved choline bitartrate or 2g of microcrystalline cellulose. Choline bitartrate contains 41.1% choline by molecular weight (104 g/mol choline in 253 g/mol choline bitartrate; Chemical info from Pubchem, an open chemistry database), resulting in the administration of approximately 800mg of choline. Previous studies that have shown effects of choline on memory performance in dementia patients [<xref rid="pone.0157714.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0157714.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] required their subjects to take 1200mg of choline alphoscerate a day (257g/mol), thus containing 485mg of choline a day. We therefore assumed a one-time dose of 800mg well exceeding these dosages would suffice to produce an acute effect on memory functioning in healthy young adults. The given amounts were still well below the established 3.5g recommended upper level of daily intake for adults [<xref rid="pone.0157714.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] for safety purposes and to control for the fact that people typically ingest smaller amounts of choline throughout the day (adequate intake of choline is ~500mg; Dietary Reference Intakes, Institute of Medicine). The choline bitartrate consisted of a white powder of pure choline bitartrate ordered from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bulkpowders.co.uk/">www.bulkpowders.co.uk</ext-link>. Similarly, the microcrystalline cellulose placebo also consisted of a white powder with a similar fine-grained structure as the choline bitartrate. The choline bitartrate and microcrystalline cellulose were dissolved into the orange juice out of sight of the participant and it was not possible to distinguish the choline bitartrate and placebo containing orange juice by either sight, smell, texture, or taste.</p><p>Stimuli were generated on an Asus Vivobook laptop computer with Windows 8 operating system (Microsoft), using MatLab (Mathworks) and the Psychophysics toolbox extension [<xref rid="pone.0157714.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. The presentation monitor displayed 1366 by 768 pixels at a 60-Hz refresh rate. Screen size was 26cm in width and 17cm in height, and the participant&#x02019;s viewing distance to the screen was approximately half a meter. We measured heart rate (HR) and systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DPB) at the non-dominant arm with an OSZ3 automatic digital electronic wrist blood pressure monitor (Welch Allyn). Mood and arousal were measured using a pen and paper on a 9 by 9 pleasure/valence x arousal grid [<xref rid="pone.0157714.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0157714.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>Stimuli and procedure</title><p>First the participant&#x02019;s HR, SBP, DBP, and subjective mood. These assessments were repeated an hour later right before the memory experiment and again approximately 30 minutes later after the last task was completed. After the first assessment, participants ingested 400ml of orange juice containing either dissolved choline bitartrate or placebo. Fourteen participants took choline bitartrate in session 1 and placebo in session 2, while the order was reversed for the remaining 14 participants (random group assignment). The sessions were conducted on 2 separate days with approximately a week between sessions. Choline bitartrate and placebo doses were prepared in sealed tubes by author MN and handed over to the na&#x000ef;ve experimenters. None of the participants was able to detect any difference in the way the orange juice tasted between sessions.</p><p>The behavioral experiments were carefully timed to ensure that choline was taken up into the participant&#x02019;s system.

For these reasons participants had to wait a full hour before conducting the behavioral tasks in each session to ensure that choline was taken up into the system. The duration between supplement ingestion and the memory tasks was set to 60 minutes, not varying more than a couple minutes across participants. Approximately half an hour after ingestion, participants were offered an apple or orange to prevent hunger (both of which are known to contain no choline). Sessions took approximately 1 hour and 30 minutes each to complete. Participants also performed a visuospatial motor task which was unrelated to the memory task. Results of this task are published in a different article [<xref rid="pone.0157714.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].</p><p>The visuospatial memory task consisted of an adapted version of the popular children&#x02019;s game &#x0201c;Memory&#x0201d; that is known to depend on cholinergic functioning in healthy human adults [<xref rid="pone.0157714.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Participants played three blocks per session and the same pictures were presented in each block to facilitate learning. Each block consisted of 5 distinct trials (i.e., 5 distinct sets of 9 different pictures) in which participants had to memorize the location of 9 target pictures (150 by 225 pixels). The targets were simultaneously shown for 10 seconds in a 3-by-3 grid on a grey background (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0157714.g001">Fig 1</xref>). To prevent that the task would be too easy and that participants would memorize simple features instead of entire pictures, the pictures were selected from a set of natural images [<xref rid="pone.0157714.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] exclusively consisting of cluttered scenes of trees and plants and without individual objects and animals. Pictures were masked after presentation with a checkerboard pattern for 4 seconds. This was followed by a cue of the target picture that was shown below the grid. Participants had to retrieve the location of the target image from memory and click on its previous location with a computer mouse cursor. The image at the selected location then became visible for 2 seconds and the cue turned green or red depending on whether the participant had correctly or incorrectly indicated the location of the target, respectively. The next target was automatically shown following the feedback display and each of the 9 picture locations was consecutively tested within a trial. A total of 45 (5 x 9) pictures were tested within a block and each block lasted approximately 5 minutes. Participants were debriefed about the purpose of the experiment after the second session.</p><fig id="pone.0157714.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0157714.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Timeline, procedure, and stimuli of the visuospatial working memory task of experiment 1.</title><p>Participants received a 2 gram dose of either choline bitartrate or placebo in 2 separate sessions (cross-over design).

Because choline is a precursor of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, we expected positive effects on memory. However, no evidence was found of a beneficial effect of choline bitartrate supplementation on performance on a visuospatial working memory (experiment 1, 3), declarative long-term memory (experiment 2, 3), and verbal working memory task (experiment 3). These results suggest that choline bitartrate does not improve remembrance of spatial locations, declarative items, and verbal words.</p><p>Although these results are in contrast to expectations, there are a number of reasons that may explain the current findings. However, we first rule out a couple factors that could not underlie the null-results. The consistency of lacking differences between placebo and choline across all experiments deems it unlikely that statistical power was too low. Another possibility is that the effective dose of 1 gram choline may simply not be enough to have an effect. This, again, is not likely as similar amounts are known to affect behavior in humans [<xref rid="pone.0157714.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. The possibility that choline bitartrate was not synthesized to acetylcholine and could therefore not intervene with cholinergic functions is also unlikely. Choline is known to improve behavioral functions in healthy, young adults that rely on the cholinergic <italic>peripheral</italic> nervous system [<xref rid="pone.0157714.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. A perhaps more likely explanation is that the substance choline bitartrate may not affect cholinergic cell receptors in the <italic>central</italic> nervous system. Some chemicals may not be able to cross the blood-brain barrier but still affect the peripheral nerves. The blood-brain barrier actually keeps the central and peripheral neurotransmitter pools separate [<xref rid="pone.0157714.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Alternatively, choline may not be synthesized into acetylcholine at the brain regions important for memory. This limitation would then have to be specific to choline bitartrate as the supplementation of other choline-containing substances result in rapid increases in acetylcholine levels a variety of brain regions in humans [<xref rid="pone.0157714.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0157714.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0157714.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0157714.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0157714.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>] and rats [<xref rid="pone.0157714.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In line with this notion are results from a study showing that a single dose of 2g of choline bitartrate also did not produce any effects on either a visual or auditory memory task [<xref rid="pone.0157714.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. However, when combined with 25mg of caffeine performance was significantly improved on both tasks compared to a placebo group. The authors suggest that administration of choline bitartrate alone might lead to an oversaturation in choline availability unless the synthesis of acetylcholine is stimulated through increases in neuronal firing. Similarly, a combination of 100mg of caffeine and 2g of choline has been shown to significantly improve performance on a backwards digit span test compared to either caffeine or choline on its own [<xref rid="pone.0157714.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Therefore the effectiveness of choline bitartrate on its own might be limited unless for instance combined with a substance such as caffeine which is thought to disinhibit neuronal firing through the release of adenosine. Another possible explanation is that we might have been unable to find an effect of choline bitartrate on memory performance due to individual differences in participants&#x02019; (baseline) neurochemical make-up. It is not uncommon for the relationship between the availability of a neurotransmitter and task performance to follow an inverted U-curve. Thus, additional acetylcholine synthesis might have both improved and impaired memory performance depending on a participant&#x02019;s baseline position on the inverted U-curve. Lastly it might be possible that choline bitartrate has to be supplemented for a longer period of time before the memory system can benefit from its increased availability.</p><p>The interpretations outlined above are speculative and further scientific explorations are necessary before conclusions can be drawn on this issue. Unfortunately, it is not yet possible to directly measure choline-to-acetylcholine synthesis in the human brain and assess choline&#x02019;s impact on cholinergic neural network activity.</p><p>The present study is the first to assess the acute effects of choline bitartrate supplementation on performance in a variety of memory tasks. Previous results on the effects of cholinergic substances on memory performance were mixed [<xref rid="pone.0157714.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0157714.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0157714.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0157714.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], possibly due to differences in populations and the type of cholinergic precursor. Future studies should therefore take into account the type of cholinergic substance used in the experiment. Another limitation of this study is the relatively large sample of female participants. It is first necessary to examine the effects of choline on a larger sample of males before the data can be generalized.</p><p>To this end, it would be interesting to study potential interactions across food supplements. Antioxidant, flavonoid, glucose, and fatty acid ingestion improve memory functions [<xref rid="pone.0157714.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0157714.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>] and the administration of a cocktail including these supplements together with choline may be an interesting design for future studies. Future research may also further explore the role of choline in the peripheral nervous system as it is known to acutely affect pupil size after ingestion [<xref rid="pone.0157714.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].</p><p>As a final remark, the data reported in this article question the impact of choline on memory functions in humans but also request for additional investigations to shed light on the actual mechanism behind choline supplementation and previously reported memory improvements. Nonetheless, we do not exclude the possibility that choline bitartrate could be an enhancer of other, yet untested cognitive skills. Nevertheless, while recent studies show that choline supplementation may help the elderly to recover from memory impairments [<xref rid="pone.0157714.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0157714.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], our experiments suggest that there are no beneficial effects of choline bitartrate administration on memory functioning in healthy, young
