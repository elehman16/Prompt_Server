Counselling patients about this decision can be challenging, given the medical evidence uncertainties and the complexity of related information. Although physicians are the primary source of medical information for patients considering RRA, some patients have a desire for supplemental information from sources such as the internet. Yet, thyroid cancer resources on the internet are of variable quality, and some may not be applicable to the individual case. We have developed a computerized educational tool [called a decision aid (DA)], directed to patients with early stage papillary thyroid cancer, and intended as an adjunct to physician counselling, to relay evidence-based medical information on disease prognosis and the choice to accept or reject RRA. DAs are tools used to inform patients about available treatment options and have been utilized in oncologic decision-making. We tested our web-based DA in fifty patients with early stage PTC and found that it improved medical knowledge. Furthermore, participants found the technical usability of the tool acceptable. We are currently conducting a randomized controlled trial comparing the use of the DA plus usual care to usual care alone to confirm the educational benefit of the website and examine its impact on the decision-making process. In the future, DAs may play an expanded role as an adjunct to physician counselling in the care of patients with thyroid cancer.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type=""><title>Introduction</title><p>Thyroid carcinoma is increasingly being diagnosed<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>, and the most common subtype is papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref> New cases of PTC are most commonly diagnosed at an early stage, with a low risk of disease-related mortality.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref> After the standard surgical removal of the thyroid (total or near-total thyroidectomy), radioactive iodine remnant ablation (RRA) treatment or no RRA (with close medical follow-up) is considered acceptable options for management of early stage PTC, with some flexibility in the approach depending on the individual case characteristics and treatment preferences.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref></p></sec><sec sec-type=""><title>Information needs of patients with thyroid cancer considering RRA</title><p>Decision-making about accepting or rejecting RRA for early stage PTC is challenging, as there are no published randomized controlled trials testing the benefit of this intervention on long-term thyroid cancer outcomes, and results from existing observational medical evidence are conflicting.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref> In a recent qualitative study, thyroid cancer survivors identified some key medical information needs related to the consideration of RRA (or no RRA), and these include the following: information on the disease prognosis, clearly delineated treatment options (RRA or no RRA, with follow-up implications), the treatment rationale, the potential risks and benefits of the treatment options and related medical evidence uncertainties, current clinical practice guideline recommendations and reproductive considerations (for some patients) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref> The desired level of detail of medical information and the degree of involvement in medical decision-making is highly variable among patients with thyroid cancer, with the spectrum spanning from the preference for basic medical information and leaving decisions entirely to the physician, to the preference of highly detailed information and active participation in decision-making.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref> The information needs of some patients with thyroid cancer may not be fully met in their clinical encounter with their healthcare providers.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref> For patients with thyroid cancer desiring additional medical information to supplement physician counselling, the internet is easily accessible resource, but unfortunately, the information retrieved may not necessarily be applicable to the individual case.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref> Thus, thyroid cancer survivors have called for the development of a plain-language educational resource, called a decision aid (DA), relating to the decision to accept or reject RRA.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref> The availability of a web-based DA, with the capacity to retrieve printed material, has been favoured by thyroid cancer survivors.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref></p><table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><label>Table

We also examined the usability of the DA in this population. We recruited individuals aged 18 years or older who had a thyroidectomy since September 1, 2007 and whose surgical pathology reports confirmed the presence of the following TNM stage of PTC: pT1a (multifocal if &#x0003c;1 cm), pT1b, or pT2, N0 (or Nx), M0 (or Mx) (TNM stage, AJCC VII<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>), with no tall cell features (i.e. primary tumours were 4 cm or less in diameter with no known positive lymph nodes and no known distant metastases). Individuals with a single intra-thyroidal papillary thyroid cancer measuring less than one centimetre in diameter or those who had undergone only a hemithyroidectomy (with no completion thyroidectomy) were not eligible for the study because such patients are typically not offered RRA. All participants received usual counselling from their treating physicians and were eligible whether or not they had received RRA. All participants were required to be fluent in written and spoken English and able to read a computer screen. Participants were required to be taking thyroid hormone treatment at the time of testing. The study was approved by the University Health Network Research Ethics Board, and all participants provided informed consent.</p><sec><title>Study procedure and statistical analyses</title><p>Participants were tested between November of 2009 and February of 2010. Demographic data were also collected from all participants. Participants self-navigated the DA website on a PC desktop computer (using a secure website) in a research office. Medical knowledge of participants was evaluated before and after DA exposure using a self-administered medical knowledge questionnaire.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> The medical knowledge questionnaire includes 10 questions (true or false) on the following topics: early stage PTC prognosis, RRA treatment preparation and treatment procedure, potential radioactive iodine treatment side effects, medical follow-up implications of RRA or no RRA and current medical evidence on the impact of RRA treatment on long-term thyroid cancer outcomes (scored by number of correct responses out of 10, with a maximal score of 10) (details of the development and validation of this questionnaire available from the corresponding author by request).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> Usability of the DA was assessed by participants&#x02019; responses to an adapted System Usability Scale (SUS) questionnaire for human&#x02013;computer interaction.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref> The adapted SUS questionnaire includes 10 questions on the ease of use, format and applicability of the DA (each question scored on a Likert scale of 1&#x02013;5 with 1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref></p><p>Descriptive data were presented as mean and standard deviation (for continuous data) or number and percentage for categorical data.

Unpaired Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic>-tests were used to compare medical knowledge questionnaire scores pre-DA for those who had previously received RRA compared with those who did not. The criterion for statistical significance was set at alpha = 0&#x000b7;05. Quantitative statistical analyses were performed using PASW Statistics 18.0 (IBM, Chicago, IL, USA).</p></sec><sec><title>Results of testing the DA in patients with early stage PTC</title><p>The demographic characteristics of participants are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>. As expected for PTC, women comprised the largest percentage of participants (41/50, 82%). Most participants had a college or university or higher level education, and most described themselves as very comfortable with computers (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). The mean time spent by participants in reviewing the website was 33 min (minimum 14, maximum 60 min). The mean score on the knowledge questionnaire (number of correct responses out of a maximum score of 10) was 8&#x000b7;04 [standard deviation (SD) 1&#x000b7;43, <italic>n</italic> = 50], prior to exposure to the DA. The mean score on the knowledge questionnaire post-DA was 9&#x000b7;42 (SD 0&#x000b7;88). The DA significantly improved medical knowledge of patients (mean score increase of 1&#x000b7;38 out of 10, SD 1&#x000b7;37) [<italic>t</italic> = 7&#x000b7;13, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0&#x000b7;001; degrees of freedom (df) = 49].

We have found that a patient-directed computerized decision aid, explaining the options of radioactive iodine remnant ablation or no radioactive iodine remnant ablation for early stage papillary thyroid carcinoma, improves patients&#x02019; medical knowledge after physician counselling. Furthermore, the web-based format of the decision aid utilized in this study is acceptable to patients. The decision aid tested herein was designed to be used as an adjunct to individualized physician counselling, to meet the information needs of patients who may desire supplemental web-based information. A limitation of the study was that most participants were comfortable with using computers and well-educated, so the findings may not be generalizable to patients unfamiliar with computer technology. However, ultimately, the target population for use of our decision aid are individuals seeking supplemental web-based information sources, so we expect that such individuals would be comfortable using computers. Another important limitation of our study is that for most participants, the decision to accept or reject radioactive iodine remnant ablation had already been made prior to exposure to the decision aid, so we could not examine the impact of the decision aid on the decision-making process (including related psychosocial stress and cultural factors), nor the ultimate decision. However, this was a pilot study, utilized in the planning of a current randomized controlled trial, in which we are comparing the medical knowledge of early stage papillary thyroid carcinoma patients randomized to the decision aid (with usual care) to compared to usual care alone.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref> In this trial, we are also examining the impact of the decision aid on the final decision, its rationale and satisfaction of patients and physicians.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref> In the future, thyroid cancer treatment decision aids may become a valuable adjunct in patient education, used to complement physician counselling.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank Mrs Coreen Marino for her assistance with research administrative tasks.
