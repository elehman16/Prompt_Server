Until recently the only proven effective therapy for acute ischemic stroke was intravenous (IV) thrombolysis with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In January 2015 the results of the Multicenter Randomized Clinical Trial of Endovascular Treatment for Acute Ischemic Stroke in the Netherlands (MR CLEAN) were published and demonstrated the clinical effectiveness of endovascular treatment with respect to functional recovery at three months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In the subsequent months several other trials confirmed these results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. However, results on long-term clinical outcome are still lacking. In the current paper we present the design and statistical analysis plan (SAP) of the extended, two-year clinical follow-up study of the MR CLEAN trial. The primary objective of our study is to estimate the effect of endovascular treatment in comparison to standard treatment on functional outcome at two-year follow-up in patients with acute ischemic stroke caused by a proximal occlusion in the anterior cerebral circulation. Secondary objectives include the effect of endovascular treatment on major vascular events, mortality, and quality of life during two years of follow-up.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design and overall study plan</title><p>MR CLEAN was a multicenter clinical trial with randomized treatment allocation, open-label treatment, and blinded endpoint evaluation. The intervention contrast was endovascular treatment (mechanical thrombectomy with stent retriever in 97% of patients) versus no endovascular treatment. The treatment was provided in addition to usual care, which included intravenously administered rt-PA (in approximately 90% of patients). Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio. The randomization procedure was web-based, with the use of permuted blocks, stratified by center, with dichotomized score on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), treatment with intravenously administered rt-PA, and intended mechanical treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Data were collected at baseline, 24&#x000a0;hours, one week, and three months for the main trial. Detailed information on the main trial, treatment, blinding, statistical analysis, and determination of sample size is given in the protocol and SAP of the MR CLEAN trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>Because of funding issues, the extended follow-up study came into effect only in May 2013. At that moment the inclusion of the MR CLEAN trial was well halfway of the projected 500 patients to be included. As a result, many patients had already completed their three-month follow-up, and some patients had even passed the two-year follow-up point. After checking the Dutch Death Certificate Register, surviving patients were re-invited to take part in the extended follow-up study. If patients did not wish to participate, a reply was to be sent back to the trial office. Approximately two weeks after sending the invitation letter, all willing participants were contacted by telephone to confirm their participation and to explain additional study goals and activities. For the remaining MR CLEAN trial inclusions and their legal representatives, the new follow-up duration including additional study activities was explained in an adjusted MR CLEAN informed consent letter. All participating patients or their primary caregivers, for patients who were unable to respond, were contacted by telephone at six months, one year, 18&#x000a0;months and two years of follow-up. One experienced research nurse, blinded for treatment allocation, assessed functional outcome using the modified Rankin scale (mRS) and noted the occurrence of medical events in between follow-ups by a telephone interview [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The patient or his/her primary caregiver was also invited to complete the EuroQol &#x000a0;EQ-5D-3L questionnaire to assess quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study population</title><p>Patients aged 18&#x000a0;years or older with acute ischemic stroke caused by an anterior proximal artery occlusion who were able to be treated within six hours after stroke onset were eligible for inclusion in MR CLEAN. Detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria are described in the protocol of the MR CLEAN trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>Because the current extended follow-up study started more than two years later than the main MR CLEAN trial, many patients had already completed their participation in the main trial at the start of the extended follow-up study. As a result different groups of patients emerge:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Patients randomized before May 2011 (group 1)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Patients randomized between May 2011 and May 2013 who:<list list-type="alpha-lower"><list-item><p>&#x02009;Had died by May 2013 (group 2)</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#x02009;Were untraceable or were living abroad in May 2013 (group 3)</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#x02009;Did not provide consent for extended follow-up or who withdrew consent during follow-up (group 4)</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#x02009;Provided consent for extended follow-up study with subsequently a different number of measurements during follow-up (group 5)</p></list-item></list>
</p></list-item><list-item><p>Patients randomized after May 2013 (group 6).</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>As a consequence of the above, the population for the two-year follow-up analysis will be somewhat smaller than the one for the three-month follow-up analysis, with a varying number of available measurements over time. All patients with an available two-year follow-up visit will be included in the main long-term follow-up analyses. These include patients from group 2, group 5 and group 6.&#x000a0; One major concern regarding the estimation of treatment effect in this selected patient population might be an unbalanced distribution in treatment arms at two years. A possible threat for the treatment effect estimation at two years could be bias created by patients who decided not to consent for the long-term follow-up study (group 4). One reason for not participating in the long-term follow-up study might be that these patients had worse outcomes after three months and therefore felt they were not capable of participating in the follow-up visits. They may also be dissatisfied with being allocated to standard treatment as a reason for refusal for further participation. Both motivations may lead to relatively more patients available for the long-term follow-up who received intervention and had a good outcome at three months. This may cause serious selection bias, resulting in overestimation of the treatment effect.</p><p>To assess whether indeed the patient selection resulted in an unbalanced distribution, and thus an unrepresentative two-year trial population, we will compare main prognostic variables, three-month functional outcome, and treatment allocation between patients who did not consent (group 4) to patients who consented for the extended follow-up study (groups 5 and 6) and perform additional sensitivity analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].

Cardiac events include myocardial infarction, resuscitation after cardiac arrest, and hospitalization for unstable angina or cardiac insufficiency. Major peripheral events include all events related to noncoronary arterial disease leading to hospitalization or revascularization (e.g., new or worsening of claudication leading to revascularization). Major thrombo-embolic events include pulmonary embolism or cerebral venous thrombosis.</p><p>Recurrent stroke was defined according to the World Health Organization criteria as &#x0201c;rapidly developing symptoms and/or signs of focal, and at times global, loss of cerebral function, with symptoms lasting more than 24&#x000a0;hours or leading to death with no apparent cause other than that of vascular origin&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. We defined a recurrent stroke as a stroke, using the above definition, in which (1) there was clinical evidence of the sudden onset of a new focal neurological deficit with no apparent cause other than that of vascular origin (i.e., the deficit could not be ascribed to an intercurrent acute illness, epileptic seizure, or toxic effect) occurring at any time after the index stroke; or (2) there was clinical evidence of the sudden onset of an exacerbation of a previous focal neurological deficit with no apparent cause other than that of vascular origin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Assessment of major vascular events</title><p>Reported events were checked by contacting the treating physicians, hospitals, and/or general practitioners.

To adjust for the prespecified factors, a Cox regression model will be applied with a risk ratio expressed as a hazard ratio.</p><p>Major vascular events between three months and two years of follow-up will be analyzed by using person-years at risk to calculate the event rate in both treatment arms.

To gain as much information as (legally) possible on the clinical status of these patients, a waiver from the Institutional Review Board was obtained to assess the vital status of these patients at two years of follow-up. This information will be used for the survival analysis as well as for the sensitivity analyses of the primary outcome.</p><p>First we will compare patients who did not consent to patients who consented to the extended follow-up, including the following variables: main prognostic variables, treatment allocation, and functional outcome at three months (dichotomized mRS 0&#x02013;3 versus 4&#x02013;6). To test for any statistically significant differences between groups, categorical variables will be compared by the chi-square test and continuous variables by Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic> test or, in case of a non-normal distribution, the Mann-Whitney U test. Finally, we will develop alternative modeling scenarios to assess the robustness of the base case results (complete case analyses) of the primary outcome. Based on clinically plausible scenarios, the analyses will consist of two different scenarios created by single imputation for the mRS at two years in patients who did not consent:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Last observation carried forward: patients of whom we have information on vital status at two years and who died will be scored as an mRS 6 (death), and for all other patients the mRS score will be imputed with the available three month mRS score.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Worst case scenario: patients of whom we have information on vital status at two years and who died will be scored as an mRS 6; for patients with an mRS score of 5 (=severe disability) at three months, the mRS score will be imputed with an mRS 5; and for patients with an mRS &#x0003c;5 at three months, the mRS score will be imputed with mRS 5.</p></list-item></list>

Additionally, it assessed safety and effect on recanalization of endovascular therapy. Limited evidence is available for the long-term outcome after endovascular treatment for acute ischemic stroke. In the current study we extend the follow-up duration to two years after randomization to estimate the effect of endovascular treatment on functional outcome over the longer term. Secondary objectives include the effect of endovascular treatment on major vascular events and mortality during two years. This paper allows for peer review of the proposed methods and provides a transparent statement of the planned analyses.</p><sec id="Sec17"><title>Limitations and concerns</title><p>The sample size of the main trial was not powered for an extended follow-up. During longer term follow-up studies, loss to follow-up is a well-known phenomenon, resulting in smaller sample sizes. Furthermore, loss to follow-up may cause serious attrition bias. Both these problems may play an important role in our study, mainly because of the late start of the extended follow-up study. We therefore will provide clear information on the flow of patients through the study and differences in baseline and measured variables according to provision of consent for the long-term follow-up, and we will perform additional sensitivity analyses for different scenarios.</p><p>The results of our study will provide information on the long-term clinical effectiveness of endovascular treatment for patients with acute ischemic stroke. The benefit of endovascular treatment on short-term disability might translate into longer term improvements in survival and functional status, which could influence individual treatment decisions and estimates of cost-effectiveness. Subsequently, it will have important additional value concerning implementation of endovascular treatment all over the world.</p></sec></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec18"><title>Appendix</title><sec id="Sec19"><title>List of MR CLEAN investigators and affiliations</title><p>Olvert A.
