The results indicate that both efficacy and safety are maintained when using the larger injection volume of 0.1 mL per injection point to deliver 10 sU of abobotulinumtoxinA.</p><p>A search of the published literature identified few clinical trials comparing the effect and safety of different reconstitution volumes to deliver a fixed unit dose of botulinum toxin to treat facial muscles. Comparisons with and between these studies are difficult because they investigated different products and involved the use of unit dose and reconstitution volume that are different from the respective product labels. One study on 20 patients comparing 2 reconstitution volumes used single injection of 5 U onabotulinumtoxinA in either 0.05 mL or 0.25 mL to treat lateral orbital rhytides and concluded no statistically significant difference in effect between the 2 injection volumes. There were no study-related AEs in either group. Another study of 80 patients used a total of 30 U onabotulinumtoxinA reconstituted as 10 U, 3.3 U, 2.0 U, and 1.0 U per 0.1 mL given as 7 intramuscular injections to treat glabellar rhytides. This study did not show any significant differences in wrinkle assessment by trained observers or in the number of subjects reporting AEs.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Another comparative study involving 40 patients used 5 injection points of 5 U incobotulinumtoxinA in either 0.125 or 0.2 mL per injection point to treat glabellar lines and found no difference in response rate between the 2 treatment groups.<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup></p><p>To our knowledge, this study represents the first randomized controlled study comparing 2 reconstitution schemes for delivering a fixed unit dose of abobotulinumtoxin where one of the treatment arms used the labeled recommendation for injection volume. In this study population, no increase in pain on injection, as measured by VAS, was observed for the larger volume. No difference in safety profile was observed for the different injection volumes, and the types of AEs for both groups were in line with those described in the abobotulinumtoxinA SmPC.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> No serious AEs were reported. This suggests that for the injection volume of 0.1 mL per injection point (10 sU per point), the spread, if any, of abobotulinumtoxinA to surrounding muscles has not resulted in any clinically significant AEs. Assessment of wrinkle severity showed rapid onset, high maximum effect, and long duration of effect with both injection volumes. No decrease in clinical efficacy at the target muscle was observed despite an increase in reconstitution volume. Subjects in both treatment groups showed a high degree of satisfaction with both the aesthetic outcome and the onset of effect.</p><p>CMAP results provide objective support to the clinical findings, as the muscle paralysis response of the corrugator muscles to abobotulinumtoxinA treatment very closely reflects the wrinkle severity assessments. The CMAP amplitude has previously been reported to be an appropriate neurophysiological parameter for evaluation of the dose&#x02013;response effect of botulinum toxin injections in the facial muscles of the glabellar area.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> In our study, CMAP results also demonstrate that the twofold injection volume of 0.1 mL of abobotulinumtoxinA is noninferior to the 0.05 mL labeled injection volume in delivering the 10 sU fixed dose.</p><p>In comparing the 2 groups, although not statistically significant, there is a numerical difference both in wrinkle severity and in CMAP results, suggesting higher efficacy and longer duration of effect when the twofold injection volume is used. Similar observations have been reported previously, when an increase in wrinkle reduction or hypohidrotic effect has been shown when a higher injection volume is used for a fixed dose.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> The increased effect of the twofold increase in injection volume might be explained by a greater coverage of nerve terminals, thus resulting in a faster onset of effect and a slightly improved efficacy. These findings need to be studied further. Furthermore, there was still measurable impact on CMAP at 6 months, and this might partly explain the observed continuation of patients' satisfaction at 6 months despite attenuation in the wrinkle severity response.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="s4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Both the twofold injection volume of abobotulinumtoxinA and the labeled injection volume provide excellent efficacy with early onset of effect, high effectiveness, and duration of effect lasting up to 6 months. The study results were consistent for improvements in wrinkle severity, reductions in CMAP amplitudes, and subject satisfaction. The safety profile was comparable for the 2 different injection volumes in the nature, frequency, and severity of AEs, and the low level of pain on injection was similar in both study groups. Additionally, the objective neurophysiological measurement of CMAP supported the noninferiority of the twofold injection volume to the labeled injection volume.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors thank Dr. Andy Pickett, Dr. John Rogers, and Dr. Karin Westermark for critical review of the article.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>The keypoint machine and camera used in this study were loaned by Galderma, who also supplied the abobotulinumtoxinA to the authors.
