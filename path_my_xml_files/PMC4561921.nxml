Lezrek et al. <xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> used a removable partition purse-string suture at the bladder neck, and the prostatic fossa was drained.</p><p>Other techniques are capsular plication either longitudinal or transverse, packing the prostatic fossa with gauze or by an inflated catheter balloon, early vascular control before cystotomy, and transurethral endoscopic coagulation by a second surgical team <xref rid="b0040 b0045" ref-type="bibr">[8,9]</xref>. Kirollos <xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> reported that life-threatening bleeding after prostatectomy (the patient received 12 units of blood) was controlled only by anterior digital rectal pressure for 10&#x000a0;min. Thereafter, Osman et al. <xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> used a gauze pack inserted into the patient&#x02019;s rectum opposing the prostate, after TVP.

All patients underwent TVP performed by senior staff, and a RB was used only in group 2.</p><p>Patients included presented with LUTS that was not responding to medical treatment, or with refractory or chronic urinary retention due to their BPH. Prostate volume (mass) was measured using TRUS and was &#x0003e;80&#x000a0;g. A TRUS biopsy was taken to exclude malignancy when indicated. Informed consent was obtained from each patient to join the protocol. The ethics committee of the Faculty of Medicine, Fayoum University, approved the protocol.</p><p>Patients were excluded if they had a prostate volume of &#x0003c;80&#x000a0;g by TRUS, prostate cancer, bladder tumour, neurogenic bladder, abnormal bleeding profile, anorectal pathology or previous anal surgery.</p><p>Before TVP each patient was assessed for surgical and anaesthetic fitness. All patients had history taken (and completed the IPSS), a clinical examination (with DRE), laboratory values (PSA) and radiological investigations (TRUS, abdomino-pelvic US with an assessment of the post void residual urine volume, PVR). The maximum urinary flow rate (<italic>Q</italic><sub>max</sub>), mean flow rate and voided volume were obtained by uroflowmetry. On the day of surgery the patients had a rectal enema, and before surgery a blood sample was taken to measure the haemoglobin level. All patients had a diagnostic cysto-urethroscopy under regional anaesthesia, and then TVP (using the Freyer technique) <xref rid="b0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>.</p><p>In group 2 the RB was inserted before TVP into the rectum, above the anal sphincter and opposing the prostate. The RB was prepared by inserting the tip of a three-way Foley catheter into a medium-sized balloon (5&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;7&#x000a0;cm) and then fixed by a plaster strip, making it airtight (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>A and B). The small channel of the catheter was attached to the pump of the sphygmomanometer for air inflation (inside the balloon), and the large channel attached to the mercury storage of the sphygmomanometer to measure the pressure during inflation of the balloon inside the rectum. The position of the RB is shown in <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>.</p><p>After adenectomy the haemostatic techniques were the same in all patients. The prostatic fossa was packed with gauze for 5&#x000a0;min. Two haemostatic sutures were made at the 5 and 7 o&#x02019;clock positions, with separate sutures or cauterisation by diathermy for other bleeding sites. A Foley catheter (20 F) balloon was inserted in the prostate bed and inflated to a volume less than the infravesical part of the enucleated adenoma, to avoid interfering with the retractile power of the prostatic capsule <xref rid="b0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>.</p><p>In group 2, after adenectomy, the RB was inflated to a pressure between the systolic and diastolic pressure of the patient for 15&#x000a0;min (the normal clotting and bleeding time is &#x0003c;15&#x000a0;min), and thereafter deflated and removed from the rectum. Meanwhile, the anal sphincter was inspected for any abnormalities. No patient developed bleeding after the deflation of the balloon.</p><p>Suprapubic and urethral catheters for irrigation were inserted, then the bladder made watertight and bladder irrigation started as a slow drip. A retropubic tube drain was fixed and the wound closed anatomically. A blood sample was then taken to estimate the haemoglobin level, from which the amount of blood lost during surgery was estimated. The patient was then discharged to the ward. A typical patient undergoing TVP with a RB is shown in <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>.</p><p>The operative duration was calculated and the haemoglobin level determined 24&#x000a0;h after surgery. When the bladder wash became clear it was stopped. The amount of saline used for irrigation was calculated for each patient. At three days after TVP another blood sample was taken to determine the total haemoglobin loss. The suprapubic catheter was removed after stopping irrigation, and the urethral catheter was removed 3&#x02013;5&#x000a0;days later. Finally the tube drain was removed. After a successful trial of voiding the patient was discharged. The catheter duration and length of hospital stay were recorded for each patient. Regular follow-up visits were scheduled at 1 and 3&#x000a0;months and patients were followed-up using the IPSS, PVR, <italic>Q</italic><sub>max</sub>, mean flow rate, voided volume and any rectal complaints.</p><p>The results were analysed statistically using Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic>-test, the chi-squared test and Fisher&#x02019;s exact test, as appropriate, to compare results between the groups, with <italic>P&#x000a0;</italic>&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05 considered to indicate statistical significance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s0015"><title>Results</title><p>Of the 100 patients included, 33 (33%) presented in urinary retention and 15 had a bladder stone, with no significant difference between the groups.

Open TVP is a rapid, less costly and definitive treatment for BPH in developing nations.

We then developed our new technique (RB), with a measured pressure in the rectum to avoid pressure necrosis on the rectal wall, to facilitate haemostasis.</p><p>In the present study, 33 patients (33%) presented in urinary retention, which is higher than reported in North America (10%) <xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, and other studies <xref rid="b0070 b0075" ref-type="bibr">[14,15]</xref>, of 31%, and the Sicilian-Calabrian Society of Urology (23%) <xref rid="b0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, but less than reported by John et al. <xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> (69%). The mean (SD) IPSS for both the present groups was 23.2 (3) and 22.7 (3), higher than reported by Gratzke et al. <xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> (20.7) and Evren et al. <xref rid="b0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> (21.7). The mean (SD) <italic>Q</italic><sub>max</sub> of groups 1 and 2 in the present study was 7.3 (3.5) and 7.2 (3.3)&#x000a0;mL/s, respectively, and less than reported by Gratzke et al. <xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> (10.5) and Evren et al. <xref rid="b0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> (9.3), but equal to that reported by Varkarakis et al. <xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> of 7.3 (1.7)&#x000a0;mL/s. This might be due to the delayed presentation in developing countries. The mean (SD) PVR in the present groups was 214 (217) and 195 (210)&#x000a0;mL, respectively, both less than reported by others <xref rid="b0015 b0025 b0075" ref-type="bibr">[3,5,15]</xref>, at 145, 116 and 116&#x000a0;mL, respectively, as many patients were adapted to chronic retention with no obvious complaints.</p><p>There was a significant difference between the present groups in total prostate volume (<xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) and the values were similar to that reported by Elshal et al. <xref rid="b0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> (123&#x000a0;g), but larger than reported by others, e.g., <xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> (96&#x000a0;g), <xref rid="b0080" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> (114&#x000a0;g), <xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> (104&#x000a0;g), <xref rid="b0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> (98&#x000a0;g), <xref rid="b0085" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> (96&#x000a0;g) and <xref rid="b0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> (75&#x000a0;g). The mean (SD) weight of the enucleated adenoma was 102 (39.6)&#x000a0;g in group 1 and 104 (42)&#x000a0;g in group 2, comparable with values reported by Elshal et al. <xref rid="b0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, but greater than reported by others, e.g., <xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> (61&#x000a0;g), <xref rid="b0080" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> (82&#x000a0;g), <xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> (84&#x000a0;g), <xref rid="b0085" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> (73.5&#x000a0;g) and <xref rid="b0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> (89.9&#x000a0;g). There is agreement that there has been an increase in prostate weight since the advent of medical treatments, and prostates are larger in countries with inefficient healthcare systems, where patients present late.</p><p>The mean operative duration in group 2 (71&#x000a0;min) was longer than in group 1 (65&#x000a0;min), but was not significantly different, but the 6-min difference was the mean time needed for RB insertion and inflation. The operative duration was less than reported by others, e.g., <xref rid="b0080" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> (101&#x000a0;min), and <xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> (81&#x000a0;min), although the adenomas in those studies were smaller than in the present study, and we are more familiar with TVP.</p><p>To date there is no consensus on the ideal technique to control blood loss during TVP, so we used the same techniques for haemostasis in all patients (a pack in the fossa, two sutures at the 5 and 7 o&#x02019;clock positions, coagulation of other bleeding sites, and placing a Foley catheter balloon in the fossa), but using the new technique (RB) in group 2. We measured the haemoglobin loss throughout TVP and afterwards. The mean loss during TVP was similar in both groups (&#x02248;0.8&#x000a0;g/dL) and was comparable to that reported by Condie et al. <xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> (0.8&#x000a0;g/dL, within the first day), although they did TVP with a removable bladder neck partition suture, with its hazards.</p><p>The loss within the first 24&#x000a0;h after TVP and total loss were 0.94 and 1.9&#x000a0;g/dL for group 1, while in group 2 it was 0.23&#x000a0;g/dL and 1&#x000a0;g/dL, respectively, with a statistically significant difference between the groups. This represents the compression effect of the RB on the blood supply to the prostate from the rectum posteriorly, leading to a dramatic effect on bleeding control.</p><p>In TVP, after packing the fossa, and the two haemostatic sutures and suturing or cauterising other bleeding, the main blood loss is venous. Thus the pressure applied from both balloons decreases the blood loss. Although the total haemoglobin loss in group 2 was significantly less than in group 1, the total loss in group 1 was less than reported by others, i.e., <xref rid="b0090" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> (3.5&#x000a0;g/dL in their control group), <xref rid="b0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, 2.7&#x000a0;g/dL (the enucleated adenoma weight was comparable), <xref rid="b0095" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, 2.8&#x000a0;g/dL, and <xref rid="b0085" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, 1.3&#x000a0;g/dL (reporting only loss on the day of surgery), as the different techniques we used during TVP for blood control gave good results.</p><p>In Millen&#x02019;s technique, where the prostatic bed is directly exposed, we expect better bleeding control <xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. The haemoglobin loss in group 2 (1&#x000a0;g/dL) was less than reported by Shaeen and Quinlan <xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> and Varkarakis et al. <xref rid="b0090" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, where they used the Millen method with early vascular control (2.8 and 2.1&#x000a0;g/dL, respectively), although the enucleated adenomas in both studies were smaller (92 and 98&#x000a0;g) than in the present study. These differences represent the compression effect of the RB, which reduces the blood loss.</p><p>Our threshold haemoglobin level for blood transfusion is 10&#x000a0;g/dL. Four patients (8%) needed a blood transfusion in group 1, but only one (2%) in group 2, whereas the main loss was during surgery. However, there was no significant difference between the groups. Evren et al. <xref rid="b0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> reported a relationship between the size of the prostate and the transfusion rate, so that with a prostate of &#x0003c;100&#x000a0;cm<sup>3</sup> the transfusion rate was 9.4% but if &#x0003e;100&#x000a0;cm<sup>3</sup> it was 19.2%. Other reported transfusion rates are 0&#x02013;56.7% <xref rid="b0030 b0070 b0090" ref-type="bibr">[6,14,18]</xref>.</p><p>The transfusion rate in group 2 was in the lower range but in group 1 it was similar to those reported in large contemporary series, e.g., 12.7% <xref rid="b0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> and 9.6% <xref rid="b0090" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, and the prostate volume was 98&#x000a0;g in <xref rid="b0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Oranusi et al. <xref rid="b0095" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> reported that 2.8% of their patients needed a blood transfusion during surgery because of bleeding, and 18% did so after surgery.</p><p>There was a statistically significant difference between the present groups in the volume of saline used for bladder irrigation, favouring group 2 (<xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), and this is attributed to a lower blood loss in group 2. The volume of irrigation in group was similar to that reported in <xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> before those authors introduced the modified bladder neck repair (12&#x000a0;L), but they did not use irrigation after they used their technique. The volume of irrigant in group 2 was more than reported by Lezrek et al. <xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> by 2.5&#x000a0;L, although they used the modified Denis technique, with its complications. As we report a new technique we were reluctant to use no irrigation, but the promising results could encourage the omission of irrigation after TVP.</p><p>Although the mean prostate volume in the present study was large (&#x0003e;100&#x000a0;g), no patient has clot retention or a re-operation for bleeding, as we use many techniques for blood control, and with good results. Gratzke et al. <xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> reported a 3.7% surgical revision rate due to bleeding. Also the present incidence of seroma formation and wound complications (4%) was comparable to those reported by Varkarakis et al. <xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> (4.3%), and Meier et al. <xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> (2.9%).</p><p>The duration of catheterisation in groups 1 and 2 was significantly different (<xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), but that in group 2 was less than many studies <xref rid="b0010 b0020 b0025 b0070 b0100" ref-type="bibr">[2,4,5,14,20]</xref>, of 5, 5, 7, 7.9, and 8&#x000a0;days, respectively. The hospital stay in group 2 was significantly less than in group 1, and less than reported elsewhere <xref rid="b0010 b0015 b0020 b0025 b0070 b0100" ref-type="bibr">[2&#x02013;5,14,20]</xref>, at 7, 6, 8.1, 9, 11.9 and 10&#x000a0;days, respectively, although the enucleated adenomas in the present study were larger than those reported in these studies <xref rid="b0010 b0015 b0020 b0025 b0100" ref-type="bibr">[2&#x02013;5,20]</xref>.</p><p>There was a significant improvement in IPSS, <italic>Q</italic><sub>max</sub> and PVR for both groups (<xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) as reported by others <xref rid="b0010 b0015 b0020 b0030" ref-type="bibr">[2&#x02013;4,6]</xref>, with no significant difference between the groups. Notably, RB did not affect the quality of the improvement, but only the postoperative blood loss.</p><p>The present patients were treated in a University hospital, where there is no charge for the services, but the costs are lower in group 2 (e.g., less irrigant use, nursing care and hospital stay). Moreover, RB is a cost-effective technique that greatly reduces the blood transfusion rate, saline use, catheter duration and hospital stay. Further multi-centre widely based studies are recommended to confirm our findings and to document the outcome of a primary trial.</p><p>In conclusion, in developed countries the open prostatectomy remains an important option for managing large prostates, and so the skills required should be well-practised. Using a RB after TVP is a simple and safe procedure with no specific operative technique, and that reduces the postoperative blood loss, decreases the transfusion rate and use of saline for irrigation, shortens the catheterisation period and hospital stay, and causes no rectal complications. These promising results with the RB during TVP suggest that multicentre studies should be done to confirm the findings, and that it can be used in a Millen&#x02019;s prostatectomy.</p></sec><sec
