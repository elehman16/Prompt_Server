In Experiment 1, 569 dairy cows that underwent TAI (day 0) following short-term synchronization with prostaglandin F<sub>2&#x003b1;</sub> were randomly allocated into two groups: no further treatment (control, n = 307) or injection of 100 &#x000b5;g of gonadorelin on day 5 (GnRH, n = 262). In Experiment 2, 279 dairy cows that underwent TAI (day 0) following Ovsynch were randomly allocated into two groups: no further treatment (control, n = 140) or CIDR insert treatment from days 3.5 to 18 (CIDR, n = 139). The probability of pregnancy following TAI did not differ between the GnRH (34.4%) and control (31.6%, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05) groups. However, the probability of pregnancy following TAI was higher (odds ratio: 1.74, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) in the CIDR group (51.1%) than in the control group (39.3%).

Various biological (<italic>e.g.</italic>, milk yield, energy balance, diseases, and other factors) and environmental factors may affect the reproductive performance of dairy cows [<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Among them, progesterone insufficiency in the early luteal phase is associated with embryo mortality in cows [<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The progesterone concentration post-insemination plays critical roles in stimulating production of a variety of endometrial secretions, embryo growth, and establishment and maintenance of pregnancy [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Similarly, progesterone inhibits luteolysis by decreasing sensitivity to oxytocin by binding to oxytocin receptors [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and enhancing conceptus development, which stimulates secretion of interferon-&#x003c4; [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>Catabolism of steroids increases with increased feed intake in high-producing dairy cows and leads to inadequate progesterone concentrations during early embryonic development, resulting in reduced fertility [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In this regard, a number of studies were performed to increase the circulating progesterone concentration post-insemination, thereby increasing fertility in dairy cows [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. An accessory corpus luteum (CL) is induced by treatment with gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) or human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) at 5 or more days post-insemination [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Previous studies reported that treatment with GnRH or hCG increased the circulating progesterone concentration during the luteal phase [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Thus, some studies reported beneficial effects on pregnancy outcomes under limited conditions, <italic>i.e.</italic>, for high-producing dairy cows during the warm season or in limited herds [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]; however, a number of studies reported no beneficial effects on pregnancy outcomes [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p><p>The circulating progesterone concentration post-insemination can also be increased through use of a controlled internal drug-releasing (CIDR) insert during the luteal phase. However, the timing and duration of such an insertion has been found to vary among studies [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].

However, many studies reported no improvement in pregnancy rates [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Moreover, only a few studies using a CIDR insert post-insemination comprising small numbers of experimental cows reported beneficial effects on pregnancy outcomes [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], indicating the need for more extended field trials.</p><p>Based on the characteristic functioning mechanisms, GnRH administration during the luteal phase results in ovulation, a dominant follicle and formation of an accessory CL, increasing the circulating progesterone concentration from 2 to 4 days after GnRH treatment [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In contrast, the circulating progesterone concentration may immediately (within 45 min) increase in response to a CIDR insert via the release of exogenous progesterone [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Therefore, the present study was conducted to compare the effects of a single GnRH administration at 5 days or CIDR insert treatment from 3.5 to 18 days after timed artificial insemination (TAI) on the pregnancy rates of dairy cows.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>Experiments were carried out at 10 dairy farms located in Chungcheong Province, Korea.

These cows then underwent TAI (day 0) 16 h after the second injection of gonadorelin. Following TAI, cows were randomly allocated into two groups: no further treatment (control, n = 140) or placement of a CIDR insert containing 1.9 g of progesterone (CIDR; InterAg, New Zealand) into the vagina from days 3.5 to 18 (n = 139, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Ultrasonography and pregnancy diagnosis</title><p>In Experiment 1, a subset of cows from the GnRH (n = 44) and control (n = 39) groups underwent ultrasonographic examinations to assess CL numbers on days 5 and 14 (9 days after GnRH injection, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>).

Cows treated with a CIDR insert at days 3.5 to 18 had a higher probability of pregnancy after TAI following an increased circulating progesterone concentration during the early luteal phase than non-treated control cows (Experiment 2). However, GnRH treatment had no beneficial effects on pregnancy outcomes, although the percentage of cows with an accessory CL after TAI was higher among GnRH-treated cows than non-treated cows (Experiment 1).</p><p>Injection of GnRH on day 5 induced ovulation and formation of an accessory CL in 68.2% of cows in Experiment 1, which is slightly higher that the previously reported rate of 60% [<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Other studies reported accessory CL induction rates of 93% and 100% in dairy heifers and cows injected with GnRH at 5 days post-insemination, in which GnRH administration increased the circulating progesterone concentration [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. However, neither of these studies reported an increase in subsequent pregnancy rates. Moreover, several studies reported that GnRH injection at 4 to 5 days post-insemination had no beneficial effects on the pregnancy outcomes of cows [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Similarly, the present study revealed no beneficial effects of GnRH injection at 5 days post-insemination on pregnancy outcomes. However, a few studies reported beneficial effects of GnRH treatment on pregnancy outcomes in limited conditions. For example, Sterry et al. [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] showed that GnRH treatment at 5 days after TAI improved pregnancy rate per AI for noncycling, but not cycling dairy cows. Additionally, the beneficial effects of GnRH treatment post-insemination on fertility vary among studies. Therefore, further studies should be conducted to clarify the beneficial effects of GnRH administration post-insemination on pregnancy outcomes.</p><p>CIDR treatment, as an exogenous supplement of progesterone, immediately (within 45 min) increases the circulating progesterone concentration in dairy cows [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Thus, various investigations of the effects of CIDR treatment post-insemination on subsequent fertility were performed [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In the present study, the serum progesterone concentration was higher in CIDR-treated cows than non-treated control cows on day 5, reaching 2.5 ng/mL (<italic>vs</italic>. 1.6 ng/mL in control cows); however, the concentrations at days 3.5 and 13 were similar between groups. These findings are similar to those of a previous study, in which dairy cows were treated with a CIDR insert from 3 to 20 days after TAI. In this previous study, the circulating progesterone concentrations were higher in cows with a CIDR insert than in those without one at 4 and 7 days post-insemination, whereas there was no difference in concentration between groups on other days [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Our results that the serum progesterone concentration was higher in CIDR-treated cows than non-treated control cows on day 5 are supported by those of other studies [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, a previous study reported that use of a CIDR insert from 4 to 18 days post-insemination did not increase the circulating progesterone concentration, which was regarded as the result of increased metabolism of progesterone by the liver [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Importantly, our logistic regression analysis in Experiment 2 revealed that only the treatment group (CIDR treatment) affected the pregnancy rate following TAI, no other factors (farm, cow parity, AI season, postpartum interval, and BCS) had any effects. Our results are supported by those of a previous study [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] in which use of a CIDR insert from 5 to 19 days post-insemination increased the serum progesterone concentration and consequently the pregnancy rate. In addition, another study showed that use of a CIDR insert from 3.5 to 10 days post-insemination increased the circulating progesterone concentration and tended to increase the pregnancy rate [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, a number of studies using CIDR insert treatment post-insemination, in which the timing and duration of CIDR insert use varied, reported no beneficial effects on pregnancy outcomes [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. It is unclear why only a few studies have reported beneficial effects on pregnancy outcomes. However, it is postulated that initiating the use of a CIDR insert as early as 3.5 to 5 days post-insemination might be associated with improved pregnancy outcomes. Although the circulating progesterone concentration was higher in CIDR insert-treated cows than in non-treated cows on day 5, it was similar between the two groups on day 13, suggesting the importance of progesterone concentration during the early luteal phase to pregnancy outcomes. Stronge et al. [<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] also demonstrated a positive relationship between milk progesterone concentration on days 5, 6, and 7 and embryo survival, implying that the critical window for progesterone supplementation is between the morula and hatching blastocyst stages. Moreover, the progesterone concentration during early and mid-diestrus is associated with changes in endometrial gland ducts [<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], which likely increase the supply of nutrients to the developing conceptus and accommodate changes in subsequent placentation [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. A previous study also reported a positive relationship between increased circulating progesterone concentration from days 3 to 6.5 and embryo survival rate in CIDR insert-treated heifers [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Green et al. [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] reported that production of interferon-&#x003c4; at 16 days post-insemination was positively correlated with the progesterone concentration on days 4 and 5. Similarly, it was reported that progesterone administration from 5 to 9 days after AI enhanced both embryo development and secretion of anti-leteolytic interferon-&#x003c4; [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Dairy heifers, which have high fertility, exhibit a steeper rise in the post-ovulation progesterone concentration than lactating dairy cows starting 4 days after insemination [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Taken together, these findings may help explain the importance of the timing of progesterone supplementation using a CIDR insert post-insemination [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>In summary, treatment with a CIDR insert from days 3.5 to 18 increased pregnancy rates following an increase in the circulating progesterone concentration during the early luteal phase relative to non-treated control dairy cows. However, a single GnRH injection had no beneficial effects on pregnancy outcomes, although the percentage of cows with an accessory CL after TAI was higher among GnRH-treated cows than non-treated control cows. Thus, the beneficial effect of CIDR treatment on pregnancy outcomes in cows might be associated with the earlier increase in the circulating progesterone concentration during the luteal phase (metestrous stage).</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work was conducted with the support of the Cooperative Research Program for Agriculture Science &#x00026;
