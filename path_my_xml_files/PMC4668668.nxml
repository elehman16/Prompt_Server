Briefly, participants in active group were required to take moderate aerobic exercise at least 30&#x000a0;min for five times per week, whereas in controlled group, participants were also advised to take exercise but not mandatorily required the same degree as that of active group. At baseline and 3&#x000a0;month&#x02019;s follow-up, laboratory and demographic variables were compared.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>At baseline, no significant between-group differences were observed. Generally, leukocyte ROCK2 activity in the active and controlled groups were 58.7&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;6.0&#x000a0;mg/mL and 60.2&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;7.3&#x000a0;mg/mL, and daily average exercise time at baseline in both groups was extremely little, with 5.2&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;3.8&#x000a0;min and 5.9&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;3.5&#x000a0;min, respectively. After 3&#x000a0;months&#x02019; follow-up, 52 and 56 participants in the active and controlled groups completed the whole program. Compared to baseline, leukocyte ROCK2 activity and daily average exercise time were improved in both groups. Nonetheless, compared to the controlled group, leukocyte ROCK2 activity was reduced more profoundly and the daily average exercise time was longer in the active group (37.5&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;6.3&#x000a0;min versus 18.3&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;7.2&#x000a0;min, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05).

Previously, some studies revealed that improving glucose metabolism by medicines could reduce adverse outcomes in subjects with coronary artery diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In addition, emerging evidence reveals that compared to the controlled participants, the incidences of ASCVD (mainly including ischemic stroke, coronary artery disease and peripheral artery disease) and DM in populations with pre-diabetic status such as impaired fasting glucose (IFG) are also profoundly increased [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Therefore, effectively and efficiently treating this subgroup of pre-diabetic population is clinical relevance to reduce the incident DM and ASCVD. Knowingly, glucose metabolism disorder contributes to the development and progression of atherosclerosis in patients with DM. For example, increased serum glucose level leads to endothelial dysfunction and thereby causes leukocytes infiltration and accumulation in vascular wall [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In addition, hyperglycemia contributes to increased platelet activity which is positively associated with atherosclerotic plaque formation and progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>ROCKs are important regulators of cellular apoptosis, proliferation, metabolism, and migration via control of the actin cytoskeletal assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In the past decades, ROCKs have been identified associated with endothelial dysfunction, platelet activation, inflammatory reaction and oxidative stress, macrophages proliferation and endothelial apoptosis, and smooth muscle cells contraction in experimental researches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Moreover, increased ROCK activity contributes to atherosclerosis progression and inhibiting ROCK activity by its inhibitor fasudil is beneficial for improving symptoms and clinical outcomes in patients with ASCVD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Knowingly, increased ROCK activity is associated with metabolic syndrome development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and lifestyle modification such as moderate aerobic exercise is helpful to improve metabolic disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. However, whether moderate aerobic exercise is beneficial for attenuating ROCK activity needs further investigation. Thus this, we conducted a cross-sectional clinical research to address these questions. Hopefully, results from our preliminary research could provide evidence and valuable data for future researches.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Participant enrollment</title><p>Totally, 120 participants who were diagnosed as IFG according to the criterion of guideline recommendation were enrolled [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. All participants were without previous myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, peripheral artery disease, severe liver and renal dysfunction, and anemia. Oral informed consent was obtained before enrollment. At baseline, all enrolled participants were randomly assigned into the active group and controlled group. Participants in the active group were recommended to mandatorily take at least 30&#x000a0;min of moderate aerobic exercise (jogging or brisk walking) at least 5&#x000a0;days per week. Briefly, watch or the time facility in the mobile-phone was used to record the duration of moderate aerobic exercise which was recorded on a paper. Similarly, participants in the controlled group were also advised to take exercise but were not mandatorily required to take the same degree of exercise as that in the active group. In terms of mandatory requirement, which meant that members of our research group called participants in the active group every 3&#x000a0;days by telephone to check out and encourage them to follow protocol&#x02019;s instructions. However, participants in the controlled group would not get such kind of motivated encouragement. After 3&#x000a0;months&#x02019; follow-up, parameters of interest collected and compared between these two groups.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Blood parameters measurement</title><p>At baseline and 3&#x000a0;months&#x02019; follow-up, fasting blood samples were drawn for the measurements of serological parameters including lipid profiles, liver and renal functions, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (Hs-CRP), fasting blood glucose (FBG), fasting C-peptide and insulin levels, and glycated hemoglobin level (HbA1c).

Data from our preliminary research indicates that in subjects with IFG, 3&#x000a0;months of moderate aerobic exercise is beneficial for improving fasting glucose metabolism. In addition, other key variables including serum level of Hs-CRP and ROCK2 activity were also significantly decreased. Multivariate regression analyses revealed that exercise time and ROCK2 activity were independently associated with IFG. Moreover, exercise time was inversely associated with ROCK2 activity. These data suggested that increased moderate aerobic exercise was beneficial for improving IFG, and the mechanism might be associated with its effects on decreasing ROCK2 activity.</p><p>Accordingly, in subjects with IFG, the risk to develop overt DM is profoundly higher than those without IFG. Mechanically, in subjects with IFG, basic insulin production is significantly reduced and thereby leads to fasting blood glucose elevation. Increased serum glucose level is detrimental to vascular wall and could result in systemic inflammation and oxidation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. As reflected in our present research, serum level of Hs-CRP at baseline was profoundly increased which is consistent with previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. However, whether increased ROCK2 activity is associated with the incidence of IFG, and in addition whether exercise is useful for decreasing ROCK2 activity has not been fully investigated yet.</p><p>Briefly, ROCK2 is an isoform of rho-associated kinase and is expressed in multiple tissues such as vascular wall and myocardium. Previously, many experimental studies have revealed that increased ROCK2 activity is associated with pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases. Inhibiting ROCK2 activity by its inhibitor or cardiac-specific deletion of ROCK2 leads to profound cardio-protective effects including reduced cardiac fibrosis and diminished lipid accumulation in vascular wall [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. However, whether ROCK2 activity is associated with glucose metabolism is unknown yet. Our present cross-sectional research revealed that in subjects with IFG, 3&#x000a0;months of moderate aerobic exercise not only reduced the incidence of IFG, but also attenuated ROCK2 activity. Results from multivariate regression analyses indicated that through diminishing ROCK2 activity, exercise time improved fasting blood glucose metabolism in subjects with IFG. On the basis of pathophysiological functions of ROCK2, we considered that the following explanations might account for our findings. In the first place, it has been reported that increased ROCK activity is associated with phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) which thereby causes insulin resistance and blood glucose elevation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Secondly, since adipocytes are the key organ in keeping glucose homeostasis, and increased ROCK activity promotes inflammation and oxidation within adipocytes which thereby negatively affects glucose metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Indeed, in animal model, using ROCK inhibitor could result in improvement of glucose metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Last but not the least, increased ROCK activity is associated with BMI, waist circumference, and Hs-CRP level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. This suggests that increased ROCK activity could serve as a critical contributor for DM and metabolic syndrome development.</p><p>Another important finding of our present research was that exercise time is negatively associated with ROCK2 activity. On the basis of the physiological roles of exercise, we considered that the following mechanisms could be used to explain this relationship. On the first hand, exercise is beneficial for improving endothelial function and reducing oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], both of which were beneficial for attenuating ROCK2 activity. On the other hand, since ROCK activation is dependent on small GTP-binding protein Rho isoprenylation during cholesterol biosynthesis. Therefore, cholesterol metabolism improved by exercise might diminish Rho isoprenylation and its associated ROCK activation. Indeed, lipid profiles in both groups were improved after 3&#x000a0;months&#x02019; follow-up in our present research, and the benefits presented in an exercise-time dependent fashion.</p><p>Other than ROCK2 activity and IFG, other variables including lipid profiles, fasting C-peptide and insulin, and Hs-CRP levels were all improved in both groups compared to the baseline. And these benefits associated with the duration of daily average exercise time. Notably, although data from our present research indicates a relationship between exercise time and IFG, and the underlying mechanism may be associated with exercise effects on attenuating ROCK2 activity. However, we could not draw a causal relationship owing to the inherent defect of cross-sectional research. Rather, data from our present research could be used as a tool for hypothesis generation for future research.</p><p>Lastly, in our present research, we used the American Diabetes Association criterion to define IFG (plasma glucose levels 5.6&#x02013;6.9&#x000a0;mmol/L) which is different from that of World Health Organization (WHO, 6.1&#x000a0;mmol/L as the cut-off value). Therefore, it is cautious to interpret our finding when using different diagnostic criterion. Additionally, the cut-off value to diagnose IFG in our present research was 5.6&#x02013;6.9&#x000a0;mmol/L, therefore, we considered that finding regarding the positive relationship between ROCK2 activity and IFG might be applied to wider range of population than using WHO criterion. Moreover, since it was reported that IFG was predominantly related to genetic factors, while impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) was predominantly related to physical inactivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Therefore, it was possible that moderate aerobic exercise might also improve IGT in participants with IFG and ROCK2 activity might also be significantly associated with IGT which deserved further investigation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our present research shows that in subjects with IFG, increased daily average exercise time is beneficial for improving fasting blood glucose metabolism, and the mechanism operating in this process may be associated with its effects on attenuating ROCK2 activity.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>Peng Li and Weibin Chen are co-first authors.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Competing interest</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>PL, WC, and CC performed this study, PW performed statistic analyses, and YW designed this study and PL wrote this article.
