Heterogeneous findings are attributed to large differences in the training designs between WBV and &#x0201c;control&#x0201d; groups in regard to training volume, load and type. In order to separate the additional effects of WBV from the overall adaptations due to the intervention, in this study, a four-week WBV training setup was compared to a matched intervention program with identical training parameters in both training settings except for the exposure to WBV. In a repeated-measures matched-subject design, 38 participants were assigned to either the WBV group (VIB) or the equivalent training group (CON). Training duration, number of sets, rest periods and task-specific instructions were matched between the groups. Balance, jump height and local static muscle endurance were assessed before and after the training period. The statistical analysis revealed significant interaction effects of group&#x000d7;time for balance and local static muscle endurance (p&#x0003c;0.05). Hence, WBV caused an additional effect on balance control (pre vs. post VIB +13%, p&#x0003c;0.05 and CON +6%, p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.33) and local static muscle endurance (pre vs. post VIB +36%, p&#x0003c;0.05 and CON +11%, p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.49). The effect on jump height remained insignificant (pre vs. post VIB +3%, p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.25 and CON &#x000b1;0%, p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.82). This study provides evidence for the additional effects of WBV above conventional exercise alone. As far as balance and muscle endurance of the lower leg are concerned, a training program that includes WBV can provide supplementary benefits in young and well-trained adults compared to an equivalent program that does not include WBV.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The study has been funded by the German Space Agency (DLR).

Although WBV combined with resistance training is becoming increasingly popular in various training recommendations, there is still an ongoing debate in literature, whether there are additional effects of WBV on muscle fitness and muscle performance in comparison to conventional exercise <xref rid="pone.0089905-Rittweger1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. On one hand, there is evidence for an additive effect of WBV beyond that of conventional exercises regarding strength gains <xref rid="pone.0089905-Delecluse1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0089905-Mahieu1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, power <xref rid="pone.0089905-Roelants1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0089905-Rees1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, flexibility <xref rid="pone.0089905-Kinser1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0089905-Cochrane2" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> and adaptations in motor control <xref rid="pone.0089905-Adsuar1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0089905-an1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. On the other hand, there are several other studies, in which WBV-induced performance improvements could not be found <xref rid="pone.0089905-deRuiter1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0089905-Rnnestad1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, and some authors question if there are any additional effects of WBV if the training protocols of workouts with and without exposure to WBV are matched <xref rid="pone.0089905-Nordlund1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. In the existing literature, these controversial observations can be allocated to the following three aspects <xref rid="pone.0089905-Nordlund1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>:</p><p>1. Divergence in WBV Training protocols: There are incompatibilities in WBV training regarding experimental protocols and inconsistently adjusted WBV parameters in WBV intervention studies. Hence, functional responses and training adaptations are hardly comparable between studies <xref rid="pone.0089905-Cochrane1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. WBV training setups are characterized mainly by the adjustment of WBV parameters such as vibration frequency, amplitude and direction; the latter being defined by the vibration type <xref rid="pone.0089905-Rittweger1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Each of these WBV factors is known to significantly influence training adaptation and modulates WBV-induced physiological responses <xref rid="pone.0089905-Cochrane1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. For instance, changes in energy metabolism and turnover <xref rid="pone.0089905-Rittweger2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, blood flow <xref rid="pone.0089905-MaloneyHinds1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0089905-Games1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> and neuromuscular activation <xref rid="pone.0089905-Abercromby1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0089905-Ritzmann1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> have been shown to be highly dependent on the specific parameter selection. Furthermore, these changes were accompanied by a variety of functional responses <xref rid="pone.0089905-Cochrane1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0089905-Rittweger1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> like different effects on muscle power <xref rid="pone.0089905-DiGiminiani1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>and vertical jump height <xref rid="pone.0089905-BazettJones1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>.</p><p>2. Matched Controls: Large differences in training designs as well as variations in training load, volume or type between WBV and control group training assumably are the main cause for the inhomogeneous results of these intervention studies <xref rid="pone.0089905-Nordlund1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0089905-Cochrane1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. The activities of the control groups vary remarkably from training settings different to that of the treatment group <xref rid="pone.0089905-an1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0089905-Fagnani1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0089905-Torvinen1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0089905-Roelants1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> up to control groups not performing any extra exercise at all <xref rid="pone.0089905-Delecluse1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0089905-Russo1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. There are only a few studies, in which both groups performed identical exercises <xref rid="pone.0089905-Rnnestad1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0089905-deRuiter1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0089905-Mahieu1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0089905-Kvorning1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Among those studies, Kvorning et al. <xref rid="pone.0089905-Kvorning1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, Ronnestaad et al. <xref rid="pone.0089905-Rnnestad1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> and De Ruiter et al. <xref rid="pone.0089905-deRuiter1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> could not find any additional effects in strength and jump performance caused by WBV exposure compared to the control groups.</p><p>3. Intervention Design: There is very little scientific evidence about the optimal duration for WBV exposure <xref rid="pone.0089905-Cochrane1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Usually, WBV training protocols are characterized by a short duration of 1&#x02013;5 min of intermittent or continuous WBV application (for review see <xref rid="pone.0089905-Rittweger1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>). Particularly when a high demand on the neuromuscular system accompanied by metabolic stress is required also exhausting protocols have been taken into account <xref rid="pone.0089905-Cochrane1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>.</p><p>Hence, based on the three aspects mentioned above, the potential benefits of WBV in comparison to traditional forms of exercise still remain unclear. Despite the substantial amount of vibration-related articles there is a lack of controlled training intervention studies providing equivalent training settings for WBV and control groups regarding training load, volume and type. Disregarding these methodological constraints, there is general evidence in literature that WBV training causes a variety of adaptations associated with performance improvements <xref rid="pone.0089905-Rittweger1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. For instance, enhancements in energy metabolism <xref rid="pone.0089905-Rittweger4" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, muscle perfusion <xref rid="pone.0089905-Games1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> and peripheral circulation <xref rid="pone.0089905-KerschanSchindl1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> point towards distinct alterations in endurance capacities, although the WBV-induced effects on endurance per se has not yet been studied. It has also been demonstrated that force generating capacities <xref rid="pone.0089905-Adams1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0089905-BazettJones1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> are increased after WBV training and that these adaptations may improve jump performance; accordingly, strength gains <xref rid="pone.0089905-Mahieu1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0089905-Adams1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0089905-BazettJones1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> and enhanced motor capabilities <xref rid="pone.0089905-Amano1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0089905-an1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> are also associated with improvements in balance control. Moreover, one can expect that the vibration stimulus, which is associated with improvements in neuromuscular control and an augmented in joint stiffness <xref rid="pone.0089905-Siu1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0089905-Melnyk1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, could enhance postural control <xref rid="pone.0089905-Roelants1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0089905-Pollock1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> due to improved ankle <xref rid="pone.0089905-Cloak1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref> and knee joint stability <xref rid="pone.0089905-Melnyk2" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0089905-Moezy1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>.</p><p>This study aimed to investigate whether a WBV intervention program results in superimposed improvements in balance control, jump performance and local static muscle endurance in comparison to an equivalent intervention program performed without vibration.

Thus, the VIB group performed the same exercise as the CON group, except for an additional exposure to WBV.</p><p>Three protocols were used to assess performance adaptations in response to training interventions: In protocol 1 we investigated the effect of both training regimes on balance control in a postural task.

However, the present results provide evidence for an enhancement in balance control in healthy well-trained subjects as well. The COP displacement in anterior-posterior and medio-lateral direction was significantly reduced after the four-week WBV training regimen, whereas the improvements in the CON group remained insignificant. Since the training variables for both groups were leveled, the improvements in balance control most likely can be attributed to the WBV treatment.</p><p>The effective mechanisms underlying the improvements in balance control are hardly understood. However, it is well documented that side-alternating WBV training causes rapid vertical and horizontal displacement with particularly high levels of acceleration <xref rid="pone.0089905-Abercromby2" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0089905-Pel1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref> classified as perturbations <xref rid="pone.0089905-Rittweger1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.

In general, perturbations are known to be an appropriate training stimulus regarding balance control. After perturbation training, postural control was improved to a similar extend as in response to balance training <xref rid="pone.0089905-Obuchi1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. Moreover, WBV is associated with a strong inhibition of spinal reflexes.

Although to date there is no study investigating long-term adaptations of spinal reflexes due to WBV training, the above-mentioned aspects point towards a similarity in acute neuromuscular modulation regarding balance and WBV training. Thus, highly diminished spinal reflexes and a reduction in spinal excitability in response to WBV might have contributed to the improvement in balance control.</p><p>Furthermore, vibration-induced changes in joint stiffness <xref rid="pone.0089905-Siu1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0089905-Melnyk1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, which is accompanied by an improvement in ankle and knee joint stabilization <xref rid="pone.0089905-Saudo1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0089905-Savelberg1" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0089905-Roelants1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0089905-Melnyk2" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0089905-Pollock1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, also might have contributed to the improvement in balance control.

Furthermore, from a neuromuscular perspective, highly augmented activation intensities of the knee extensors (i.e., the muscles mainly responsible for a vertical jump performance) are associated with vibration training settings performed with a distinct knee flexion instead of extended knee joints <xref rid="pone.0089905-Ritzmann1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>.

Moreover, Rittweger et al. <xref rid="pone.0089905-Rittweger2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> observed an increase in VO2, dependent on frequency and amplitude and an augmented energy turnover during WBV training <xref rid="pone.0089905-Rittweger4" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Accordingly, one would expect an enhanced energy demand arising from exposure to vibration. Those physiological changes are accompanied by changes in neuromuscular activity. EMG activity was shown to be distinctly increased due to WBV in a static and dynamic muscle contraction mode <xref rid="pone.0089905-Abercromby1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0089905-Ritzmann1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>.

Additionally, based on the study of Stewart et al. <xref rid="pone.0089905-Stewart1" ref-type="bibr">[70]</xref> it might be suggested that training duration has supplementary influences beyond that. In our present study, duration was rather long (with an average of more than 6 and 13 min in the first and second set, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0089905-t001">Table 1</xref>). Although there seems to be a knowledge deficit regarding the effect that the time of exposure to vibration has on performance <xref rid="pone.0089905-Cochrane1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, it might be speculated that the longer the muscles are exposed to WBV the higher the neuromuscular and metabolic demand should be <xref rid="pone.0089905-Rittweger4" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>.</p><p>In conclusion, WBV training causes an additional effect on balance control and local static muscle endurance; however, jump performance remains unaffected. It might be speculated that the improvements in local muscle endurance could be caused by adaptations in energy metabolism and turnover, which is associated with vibration-induced changes in neuromuscular activation. The enhancement in balance control might be caused by the perturbation-like stimulus due to rapid mechanical oscillation during WBV. Platform displacements with high acceleration transmitted quickly throughout the entire body might interfere with postural control and cause immediate deterioration, and thus, could provide a training stimulus entailing adaptations in balance control.</p><p>However, in our study there is no evidence for a vibration-induced change in jump performance. As vibration amplitude and frequency as well as the extent of knee flexion are known to considerably determine the extent of the vibration-induced muscle strength and muscle power gains, it can be speculated that the training setting in our study was not appropriate to cause sufficiently high activation intensities in the target muscle groups and finally cause adaptations.</p><p>In summary, this study provides evidence for an additional effect of WBV beyond conventional exercise alone regarding the parameters associated with balance control and muscle endurance. Thus, a training program that includes WBV can provide supplementary benefits in young well-trained adults compared with an equivalent program that does not include WBV.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0089905-Cochrane1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Cochrane DJ (2011) Is vibration exercise a useful addition to a weight management program.
