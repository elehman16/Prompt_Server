To further determine long-term effect of KRG, the subjects were recruited to be followed up to 2 yr. Cognitive function was evaluated every 12 wk using the Alzheimer&#x02019;s Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS) and the Korean version of the Mini Mental Status Examination (K-MMSE) with the maintaining dose of 4.5 g or 9.0 g KRG per d. At 24 wk, there had been a significant improvement in KRG-treated groups. In the long-term evaluation of the efficacy of KRG after 24 wk, the improved MMSE score remained without significant decline at the 48th and 96th wk. ADAS-cog showed similar findings. Maximum improvement was found around week 24. In conclusion, the effect of KRG on cognitive functions was sustained for 2 yr follow-up, indicating feasible efficacies of long-term follow-up for Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd><italic>Panax ginseng</italic></kwd><kwd>Korean red ginseng</kwd><kwd>Alzheimer disease</kwd><kwd>Long term effect</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>In the recent decade, the prevalence of dementia increased as the proportion of elderly population was expanding. The number of subjects with dementia has been doubling every 20 yr and will reach 81.1 million by 2040 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B001">[1]</xref>. In spite of enormous research efforts, only a few symptomatic treatment options currently exist. Anticholinesterases and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor blockers are clinically in use as anti-dementia medications, but they cannot prevent the disease cascade, and provide modest symptomatic benefits. Moreover, the active Amyloid beta immunization treatment for Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease (AD), which had been suggested to modify the disease process, was halted due to critical adverse events <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B002">[2]</xref>. Clinical trials with herbal medicines have been actively investigated, warranting discovery of new drug <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B003">[3]</xref>. Ginseng is one of the most popular herbal medicines used, and has been proven to have effects on cognitive functions, such as attention, working memory performance, processing and auditory reaction time in healthy individuals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B004">[4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B005">5]</xref>.</p><p>However, only a few studies have shown effects of ginseng on dementia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B006">[6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B007">7]</xref>. These studies investigated the effects of total powder extract of <italic>Panax ginseng </italic>or Korean red ginseng (KRG) in patients with AD, followed-up for either three or six mo. Although neuropsychological assessment with the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS) or the Korean version of the Mini-Mental Status Examination (K-MMSE) showed cognitive improvements, whether the effect of ginseng was transient or not remained unknown, due to limitation of study duration.</p><p>In this study, we attempted to test the long-term efficacy of ginseng by extending follow-up duration. The goals of this study were: 1) to further clarify the long-term efficacy of KRG as an adjuvant therapy to conventional anti-dementia medications in patients with AD and 2) to monitor the cognitive changes during the extended follow-up duration.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Patients</title><p>The patients were included according to previously described inclusion and exclusion criteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B007">[7]</xref>. The inclusion criteria were, as follows: 1) probable AD consistent with the criteria of the National Institute of Neurologic and Communicative Disorders and Stroke-Alzheimer&#x02019;s Disease and Related Disorders Association <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B008">[8]</xref>, 2) older than 50 yr, and 3) baseline Mini-Mental State Examination score of &#x02265;10 and &#x02264;26. Participants treated with conventional anti-dementia medication were allowed at least for 6 mo before the study. The exclusion criteria were: 1) history of psychiatric disorder, seizure disorder, or medical condition that would limit the completeness of the study, and 2) cognitive impairment due to stroke, hypoxic brain damage, cerebral neoplasia, infection, and medications, such as antidepressants or psychoactive drugs. Sixty-one patients, aged 50 to 80 yr, had been enrolled. Informed consent to participation in this study was obtained from all subjects and the study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Seoul National University Hospital.</p></sec><sec><title>Korean red ginseng treatment</title><p>The patients had been grouped according to the doses of KRG, as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B007">[7]</xref>. In brief, using a 1:1:2 randomization ratio, the patients were allocated in three treatment groups: low-dose KRG (4.5 g/d), high-dose KRG (9 g/d), and control. KRG (total powder capsule, 6-year-old root; Korea Ginseng Corporation, Daejeon, Korea) was administered in a divided dose twice or three times a day. Ginsenosides, the active constituent of KRG, are composed of Rb<sub>1</sub> (1.96%), Rb<sub>2</sub> (2.18%), Rc (1.47%), Rd (0.72%), Re (1.11%), Rf (0.24%), Rg<sub>1</sub> (0.49%), Rg<sub>2</sub> (0.13%), Rg<sub>3</sub> (0.12%), Rh<sub>1</sub> (0.12%), and Rh<sub>2</sub> (0.003%), and account for 8.54% of the herb <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B009">[9]</xref>. Conventional anti-dementia medications (acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, i.e., donepezil, galantamine, and rivastigmine) were continued during the study period. For the initial 24 wk, there were 15 subjects in the low-dose KRG group and 15 subjects in the high-dose KRG group. The control group consisted of 31 patients who did not receive KRG and were compared to those in the KRG groups.</p><p>After 24 wk, the same doses and formula KRG powder capsules were provided continuously to the patients in the KRG groups for 2 yr. In this extended period, we continued the study with the KRG groups, but not with the control group.</p></sec><sec><title>Neuropsychological assessments</title><p>A neurologist or a supervised technician administered the neuropsychological tests. Neuropsychological assessments included the ADAS-cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog) and ADAS-non-cognitive subscale (ADAS-noncog), the K-MMSE and Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale. The tests were performed before taking the KRG, and at 12 and 24 wk after KRG administration. In the KRG groups, neuropsychological evaluation for the long-term follow up (i.e., between 24 wk and 2 yr) was performed at 12 wk intervals.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>We compared the results of neuropsychological tests between KRG groups and the control group using the SPSS ver. 11.5 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The data are expressed as means&#x000b1;SD or as numbers. Inter-group comparisons of changes in ADAS and MMSE score were performed using the Student&#x02019;s t-test, and the frequencies of side effects and withdrawal from the study were compared using Fisher&#x02019;s exact test.

Based on the previous 12-week randomized open-label study with KRG, maintaining of KRG did not show declining of scores measured by ADAS-cog and K-MMSE after this period. Therefore, the effect of KRG on cognitive functions can be sustained at least for 2 yr, suggesting feasible long-term efficacy for AD.</p><p>Due to the explosive growth of the aged population, there&#x02019;s a growing concern for dementia, particularly AD, an aging-related major degenerative disorder. Because it&#x02019;s becoming an issue for the whole society, there have been many clinical trials to develop drugs to arrest the progressive cognitive decline of the dementia patients. Approved acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, such as donepezil, galantamine or rivastigmine, have been tested for their efficacy at least for 6 mo and for up to 5 yr. However, since these drugs are targeted for the reduced acetylcholine due to cholinergic neuronal loss, none of them can protect the degenerative process of AD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B010">[10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B011">11]</xref>. In this study, we found KRG-related improvements in cognitive function and sustainability of the clinical efficacy in patients with AD. Previously, data on long-term outcomes of KRG in AD patients are limited, not exceeding several months <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B006">[6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B007">7]</xref>. Therefore, these studies were unable to determine whether the effect of ginseng was only temporary or could last with inhibiting the progressive course of AD. Our findings show that the efficacy of KRG on cognitive function in AD can be maintained for at least 2 yr.</p><p>In acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, several long-term (over 2 yr) extension trials have demonstrated that, although the efficacy of medications was apparent, they could not block or reverse the cognitive decline <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B010">[10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B011">11]</xref>. The decline in the MMSE score over 2 yr was usually 2.5 to 4.0 points, compared to initial evaluation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B012">[12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B013">13]</xref>. In patients taking conventional medication, the usual pattern of cognitive decline shows initial improvement for 3 or 6 mo and then decrease to the initial level at around 1 yr. Then, they progressed thereafter. In contrast, in our study, the ADAS-cog and K-MMSE scores have been sustained without apparent declining at each visit time for 2 yr. This clinical course may be attributed to the difference of underlying mechanisms in ginseng from anti-cholinesterase.</p><p>The effects of ginseng on the cognitive function with underlying mechanisms have been proposed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B005">[5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B015">15]</xref>. Ginsenoside Rb<sub>1</sub> is known to improve learning and memory in hippocampus-dependent tasks and increased cell survival in the dentate gyrus and hippocampal subregion CA3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B014">[14]</xref>. Ginsenoside Rb<sub>1</sub> attenuated A&#x003b2;<sub>1-42</sub>-induced neurotoxicity and tau hyperphosphorylation at multiple AD-related sites in a dose-dependent manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B015">[15]</xref>. In addition, it has been suggested that ginsenoside Rg<sub>1</sub> and Rb<sub>1</sub> potentiated the cholinergic pathways in the central nervous system. Thus, both Rg<sub>1</sub> and Rb<sub>1</sub> enhanced choline acetyltransferase activity and inhibited acetylcholine -esterase activity, thereby enhancing the function of cholinergic system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B016">[16]</xref>. Administration of Rg<sub>1</sub> and Rb<sub>1</sub> in weaning mice increased the cortex thickness and density of synapses in the hippocampal CA3 region, which is suggested to modulate synaptic plasticity, regarded as one of the most essential mechanism in learning and memory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B017">[17]</xref>.</p><p>Our study was limited because no placebo was used in the control group and we could not prove whether KRG is a cognitive enhancer like acetylcholinesterase inhibitors or disease-modifying drugs. Additional biomarker study is required to clarify this. Nevertheless, our results suggest that KRG treatment is both safe and feasible, and is effective for the long-term management of AD patients.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by
