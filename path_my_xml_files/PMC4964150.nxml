Low-income mothers have greater challenges in accessing health care services due changes in the health care system and budget cuts. The purpose of this randomized clinical trial was to test a nurse practitioner (NP) intervention using cell phone and texting on maternal/infant outcomes. <italic>Methods</italic>. The sample included 129 mother-infant pairs. Intervention group mothers received NP 2-way cell phone follow-up intervention post&#x02013;hospital discharge for 6 months. <italic>Results</italic>. Intervention mothers&#x02019; perceived social support was significantly higher. Intervention infants received their first newborn follow-up visit significantly earlier (6 vs 9 days); significantly more infants were immunized at recommended times (2, 4, and 6 months of age); and there were fewer infant morbidities compared to controls. The intervention saved between $51&#x02009;030 and $104&#x02009;277 in health care costs averted. <italic>Conclusion</italic>. This easy-to-use, safe intervention is an effective way to reach a wide range of populations and demonstrated improved maternal/infant outcomes and decreased cost.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>general pediatrics</kwd><kwd>low-income mothers</kwd><kwd>nurse practitioner</kwd><kwd>follow-up care</kwd><kwd>mobile health</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>January-December 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="section1-2333794X16660234"><title>Background</title><p>Low-income mothers in the United States have higher birth rates and higher infant morbidities compared to upper income mothers.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-2333794X16660234" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> They also have greater challenges in accessing health care services.

Mothers in the control group received routine hospital discharge care. The NP follow-up intervention group received routine hospital discharge care in addition to a 2-way NP cell phone intervention that included cell phone contact and texting on post&#x02013;hospital discharge days 3, 7, 14, 21, then monthly for 6 months. Additionally, intervention group mothers were able to contact the NPs by cell phone or texting Monday through Saturday 9 <sc>am</sc> to 5 <sc>pm</sc>. Mothers were instructed to call their health care provider or 911 if they needed emergency assistance outside of these times. Both groups of mothers were followed for the first 6 months post&#x02013;hospital discharge following delivery. The NPs were experienced pediatric nurse practitioners. Maternal and infant health outcomes data and health care charges were collected for 6 months postpartum after hospital discharge on both groups of mothers.</p><p>First-time low-income mothers who met the study inclusion criteria were enrolled from the Mother Baby Unit at Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami, Florida.

Only infants with limited access to health care (ie, delayed discharge due to delay in Medicaid, no pediatrician) were included. Exclusion criteria were the following: infants &#x0003c;36 weeks, multiple births, infants with medical conditions (feeding intolerance, hypoglycemia, congenital abnormalities), and mothers with medical conditions (diabetes, hypertension, delivery complications).</p><p>The study was approved by the university and the clinical site institutional review boards. Eligible mother-infant pairs meeting the study inclusion criteria were identified by the attending physician and NPs on the Mother Baby Unit where they briefly explained the study. For mothers interested in participating, a research assistant (RA) explained the study further to the mothers in their preferred language (English or Spanish) and obtained informed consent. The bilingual (English, Spanish) RA, a bachelor&#x02019;s prepared registered nurse, was trained in the study protocol, recruitment process, and consent procedures by the principal investigator. Following the signing of informed consent, mothers were randomized to a control or intervention group using a table of random numbers. After randomization, the RA collected the mothers&#x02019; demographic information and reviewed the data collection time points with the mothers.</p><p>The RA collected data on maternal and infant health outcomes in both groups on post&#x02013;hospital discharge day 3 and months 1 through 6 by reading the questions to the mothers in their preferred language by telephone. Data on health care utilization for both groups were collected from the mothers by phone on month 6. Time points for data collection were based on the common occurrence of infant morbidities within the first 6 months of life and by the recommended routine infant follow-up visits by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). Infants are recommended to have their first pediatrician appointment for well child assessment by 3 to 5 days of age (48-72 hours post&#x02013;hospital discharge) and at 1 month. Additional follow-up for well visits including immunizations are on months 2, 4, and 6.<sup><xref rid="bibr22-2333794X16660234" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup></p><p><italic>Control Group</italic> mothers were provided with routine hospital discharge care. The mother baby nurse provided them with instructions on postpartum maternal care (ie, breast feeding, episiotomy/cesarean care, and infant care [ie, feeding, bathing, sleep positions, signs and symptoms of emergent conditions]) prior to discharge. The mothers are also provided printed papers in their language with instructions on infant care and a follow-up appointment with a clinic affiliated with the hospital or an appointment with a pediatrician the mother chose prior to delivery. The mothers were contacted by the RA by telephone on beginning on the third post&#x02013;hospital day, then monthly to month 6 to administer the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS). If the mother voiced a health concern for herself or her infant, the RA directed the mother to contact her physician or use the 911 emergency system if the mother perceived the complaint as an emergency.</p><p><italic>Intervention Group</italic> mothers received routine hospital care as described above. In addition, they received the NP follow-up intervention using 2-way cell phone contact and texting beginning on the third post&#x02013;hospital discharge day and then on days 7, 14, 21, and monthly to month 6 to assess health problems or concerns regarding the infant. These contact points were established based on the common occurrence times of infant morbidities during the first 6 months of life that result in acute care visits or rehospitalizations.<sup><xref rid="bibr23-2333794X16660234" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="bibr24-2333794X16660234" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> Mothers also able to contact the NPs by cell phone or texting with any infant health concerns. If a health care concern was stated, the NP used the AAP Pediatric Telephone Protocol<sup><xref rid="bibr25-2333794X16660234" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> to implement care. The NPs documented the mother&#x02019;s concern and the care provided using the protocol in a clinical interaction log. If the mother voiced a serious infant complaint such as fever, excessive crying, vomiting, lethargy, or seizure-like activity, the mother was instructed to contact the 911 emergency systems. If there was no health concern, the NPs documented the mother&#x02019;s reply in the log. Backup pediatricians were available to the NPs for consultation on infant health concerns.

The PSS measures which situations of life are appraised as stressful.<sup><xref rid="bibr26-2333794X16660234" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> Questions include items about thoughts and feelings and how often they were experienced within the last month.

Overall total scores have a range of 0 to 40. Higher summative scores indicate greater perceived stress.</p><p>Social Support was measured using the MSPSS, which measures perceptions about support from family, friends, and significant others.<sup><xref rid="bibr27-2333794X16660234" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> The MSPSS is a 12-item instrument with a 7-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 &#x0201c;very strongly disagree&#x0201d; to 7 &#x0201c;very strongly agree.&#x0201d; Total overall scores have a range from 12 to 84. Higher summative scores indicate higher levels of perceived support.</p><p>Infant Heath was measured by contacting mothers on day 3 and months 1 to 6 to document the timing of routine well infant checks (immunizations and weight gain), acute care visits (urgent care, emergency department visits), and any infant hospitalizations. Data were recorded on a standard form indicating when immunizations were received, weight gain appropriate or not for age, and date, type, and reason for acute care visits.</p><p>The total health care costs for infant emergency room visits, acute care visits, and rehospitalizations over the first 6 months postdischarge were calculated using 2 measures. First, a conservative approach was used, where the cost of an emergency room visit is $450, the base charge for an emergency room visit at Jackson Memorial Hospital. The cost of a night in the hospital was obtained from the Kaiser Family Foundation&#x02019;s estimate of hospital operating costs per inpatient day,<sup><xref rid="bibr28-2333794X16660234" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> then adjusted for inflation to current-year dollars according to the medical care component of the Consumer Price Index.<sup><xref rid="bibr29-2333794X16660234" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> The other estimates were obtained directly from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey.<sup><xref rid="bibr30-2333794X16660234" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> These estimates were also adjusted to current year dollars using the medical care component of the Consumer Price Index.<sup><xref rid="bibr29-2333794X16660234" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> According to the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, the average reimbursement for an emergency room visit was $1009, and the average reimbursement for a night in the hospital was $4558. In both cases, the cost of an urgent care visit was assumed to be $100.</p><p>The cost of the NP follow-up intervention was calculated by adding all recorded NP intervention time including cell phone contact, texting, charting, physician consultation, a 2-hour NP training in the study protocol, and the cost of cell phones. The value of NP time was calculated based on the mean NP annual salary in South Florida plus fringe benefits.<sup><xref rid="bibr31-2333794X16660234" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> An hourly rate ($42.22) was calculated by dividing annual salary and benefits by 52 weeks and then dividing by 40 hours per week. A cost-benefit analysis was conducted to determine whether the health care costs averted as a result of the intervention outweighed the intervention costs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="section3-2333794X16660234"><title>Results</title><p>A convenience sample of 141 mothers was recruited; 12 mothers were lost to contact postdischarge due to disconnected cell phones.

Kulash<sup><xref rid="bibr47-2333794X16660234" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup> reported similar delays because changes in the health care system make it difficult for many pregnant women and newborns to confirm their Medicaid eligibility status, leaving some without coverage for weeks, or even months.

The 2-way NP mobile intervention used in this study with low-income first-time, mainly minority, mothers was low-cost, easy-to-use, safe, and demonstrated improved maternal and infant outcomes. This intervention of 2-way mobile technology with cell phone and text messaging is an effective way of providing continuity of care for vulnerable populations at a time of major budget cuts and health care changes that affect health care services.</p><p>Future studies could include interventions with mobile technology using cell phones and texting on other populations. Studies using such interventions have reported improved communication between providers and patients by facilitating quick and direct access regardless of physical location and increased patient compliance.</p></sec><sec id="section6-2333794X16660234"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>JH substantially contributed to conception or design; contributed to acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data; drafted the manuscript; critically revised the manuscript for important intellectual content; gave final approval; and agrees to be accountable for all aspects of the work in ensuring that questions relating to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work are appropriately investigated and resolved.</p><p>DB substantially contributed to conception or design; contributed to acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data; drafted the manuscript; critically revised the manuscript for important intellectual content; gave final approval.</p><p>TP substantially contributed to conception or design; contributed to acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data; drafted the manuscript; and gave final approval.</p><p>AG substantially contributed to conception or design and gave final approval.</p><p>MT contributed to acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data and gave final approval.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Declaration of Conflicting Interests:</bold> The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding:</bold> The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This study was funded by MBRS Score National Institute of Health; Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health &#x00026; Human Development, 1SC2HD076043-01.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bibr1-2333794X16660234"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="gov">
