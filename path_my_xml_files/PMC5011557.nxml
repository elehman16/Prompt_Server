on the lung capacities of healthy subjects. [Subjects and Methods] Twenty-nine healthy
subjects with no orthopedic history of the back were recruited. Subjects were randomly
assigned to a experimental group and control group. Subjects were allocated to one of two
groups; an experimental group that underwent lumbopelvic sling and abdominal drawing-in
exercises and a control group that underwent treadmill and abdominal drawing-in exercises.
Lung capacities were evaluated 4 weeks after exercises. [Results] The experimental group
showed significant increments in EV, ERV, IRV, VT vs. pre-intervention results, and the
control group showed significant increments in the EVC and IRV. Significant intergroup
differences were observed in terms of post-training gains in EVC, IRV, and VT.
[Conclusion] Combined application of lumbopelvic sling and abdominal drawing-in exercises
were found to have a positive effect on lung capacity.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Abdominal drawing in maneuver</kwd><kwd>Lung capacity</kwd><kwd>Sling exercise</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) is a measure of the capacity of the cardiovascular system
to transport oxygen and the ability of the muscles to use this oxygen. In addition, CRF
reflects the ability of the circulatory, respiratory, and muscular systems to supply oxygen
to skeletal muscles during sustained physical activity<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>, and thus, CRF is associated with health outcomes. Furthermore,
accumulating evidence demonstrates CRF is independently associated with morbidity and
mortality in the general population<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Sling exercise is a new training method for athletes and orthopedic patients<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Because of its convenience and
practicality, sling exercise has become more and more common in rehabilitation clinics and
fitness training centers<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Recently,
researchers have reported that lumbopelvic sling exercises are effective for strengthening
respiratory muscles<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>, and Lukens et
al.<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup> advised that these exercises
effectively strengthen transverse abdominalis muscle, which is an important respiratory
muscle. However, few studies have been performed on the clinical effects of combined
lumbopelvic sling and respiratory muscle strengthening exercises. Therefore, in the present
study, we studied the effects of combined lumbopelvic sling and respiratory muscle
strengthening exercises on vital capacity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study was conducted on 29 healthy individuals without an orthopedic history after
obtaining informed consent. All procedures were reviewed and approved by the Institutional
Ethics Committee of Eulji University Hospital. The subjects were randomly assigned to an
experimental group of 15 subjects or a control group of 14 subjects. Both the experimental
group and the control group received ADIM (abdominal drawing-in maneuver) exercise for 20
minutes per session. Members of the experimental group also received a lumbopelvic sling
exercise for 20 minutes per session, whereas control group members received 20 minutes of
additional treadmill training. Exercises were performed 40 minutes per session once per day,
five times per week, for four weeks, which is referred to as the intervention period.</p><p>The study selection criteria were as follows: 1) had not performed any trunk muscle-related
exercise during the three months prior to selection; 2) no history of surgery in the waist
region; and 3) the absence of lower back pain. In experimental and control groups average
ages, heights, and weights were 20.93 &#x000b1; 1.33, 20.64 &#x000b1; 1.15&#x02005;years, 173.45 &#x000b1; 5.56, 170.69 &#x000b1;
4.27&#x02005;cm, and 64.05 &#x000b1; 10.19, 60.11 &#x000b1; 6.82&#x02005;kg, respectively. The sling exercise group
represented the high load exercise group. Sling exercises for the lumbopelvic region were
performed using the Redcord Trainer (Redcord AS, Norway), which has been previously
described by Stuge et al.<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup> Elastic ropes
attached to a band supporting the pelvis were used to ease loads, help subjects maintain a
neutral spine position at all times, and to eliminate exercise-associated pain. Exercise
progression was achieved by gradually reducing the elasticity of the ropes or increasing
distance (torque) to the distal band. Participants were tested for muscle weakness using the
slings using a preset number of stabilizing exercises. When weakness, pain, fatigue or
asymmetry was observed, this loading position served as a starting point for training and
progression. The number of repetitions/sets was adjusted on an individual basis according to
pain and fatigue. All training sessions were guided by a trained physical therapist.
Examples of sling exercises with non-elastic ropes or firm ropes supporting the distal
leg(s) and elastic ropes supporting the pelvis. The purpose of the elastic ropes was to
assist subjects raise the pelvis to a neutral lumbar spine position. This position was then
maintained for as long as possible. Load was progressively increased by provided less pelvic
support increasing the elastic strengths of the pelvic ropes, increasing the lever arm
distance of firm rope attachment points, increasing lower extremity movement range or
removing distal support for one leg. Exercises were performed prone, supine, and
side-lying.</p><p>ADIM was implemented while in a crook-lying position on a stable surface<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. A pressure biofeedback apparatus (Stabilizer, Chattanooga Group
Inc., USA) was placed below L5 to obtain visual feedback during ADIM. Subjects were
instructed to slowly draw in the lower abdomen (below the navel) toward the floor, and not
to move the upper abdomen or spine, to maintain the pelvis in the neutral position, and to
maintain the pressure displayed by the pressure biofeedback apparatus in the range 40&#x02013;70
mmHg during the procedure.</p><p>A breathing evaluation tool (Quark Spiro, COSMED sri, Italy) was used to measure
respiratory competence and slow vital capacity was selected as a measurement variable. To
measure, the subject&#x02019;s nose was blocked using a nose clamp and the subject was instructed to
breathe normally through the mouth. For measurements, the subject was instructed to hold a
breathing measuring instrument in his/her mouth after maximum inhalation and to breathe out
slowly over up to 10 secs. Expiratory vital capacity (EVC), expiratory reserve volume (ERV),
inspiratory reserve volume (IRV), expiratory minute ventilation (VE), respiratory frequency
(RF), tidal volume (TV) were measured three times and average values were calculated.
Intra-group comparisons of lung capacity before and after intervention were performed using
the paired samples t-test, and intergroup comparisons of pre- to post-test differences in
lung capacity were performed using the independent t-test. The statistical analysis was
conducted using SPSS 20.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA), and statistical significance was
accepted for p values&#x0003c;0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Twenty-nine subjects (experimental group=15, control group=14) completed the experiment.

ADIM exercises on the respiratory competences of normal, healthy adult males. Significant
intergroup post-intervention gains were observed for EVC, IRV, and VT. The respiration rate
of an adult male at rest is 13&#x02013;18 breaths/min, the amount of air inhaled per breath is
400&#x02013;600 ml, and the amount of air inhaled per minute is 4&#x02013;15 l. During exercise the amount
of air inhaled is proportional to oxygen uptake and to the CO<sub>2</sub> yield of active
muscles<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Accessory muscles act during
forced inhalation or extended active inhalation. Accessory muscles for exhalation are core
muscles, such as, the rectus abdominis, the internal/external oblique, and the transverse
abdominis, and when these muscles contract, pressure in the thoracic cage increases and air
is forced out of the lungs<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. During
inspiration, respiratory muscles expand the ribs, increase diaphragm movement, and draw air
into the lungs, and during expiration, these muscles are relaxed and air is discharged<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Exercise to improve respiratory competence are diverse. Recently, exercises based on the
use of slings, intended to stabilize trunk muscles, have been used<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Sling exercises are performed using the subject body
weight and antigravity, and have the advantages of requiring little space, being
straightforward, and of enabling diverse exercises. As a result they are widely used to
strengthen respiratory muscles<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. In
addition, unlike other exercise methods, sling exercises are effective for muscle
strengthening because changes in body axis allow different movements<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Respiratory competence improvement by sling exercise is
due to increases in the activities of core respiratory muscles that are required to maintain
neutral posture during trunk movements caused by the external resistance applied by the
sling. According to our results, the sling exercise activates the diaphragm which acts as an
agonist for inspiration and accessory muscles for expiration to enhance respiratory
competence. The effects of core exercises using slings include dynamic stabilization of the
trunk and lumbar vertebrae, neutral control of the spine, and enhanced coordination of
muscles that positively affect respiratory muscle strength<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. The limitations of the present study include its small cohort,
short duration, and lack of follow-up. Therefore, we suggest future studies be conducted to
determine the long-term effects of combined lumbopelvic sling and ADIM exercise.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Laukkanen</surname><given-names>JA</given-names></name><name><surname>Kurl</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Salonen</surname><given-names>JT</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Cardiorespiratory fitness and physical activity as risk
