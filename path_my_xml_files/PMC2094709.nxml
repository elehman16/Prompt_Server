Memory difficulties, slowing mental speed, and decreased mental flexibility become evident in old age, even in older adults without dementia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Normal, age-associated cognitive decline is related to declines in everyday functional abilities, and to increases in both formal and informal service use among older adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Interventions which improve cognitive functioning are therefore important for the well-being and quality of life of older adults.</p><sec><title>Exercise</title><p>Exercise has been suggested as an innovative approach to improving cognitive functioning in older adults. The benefits of exercise for general health and well-being in older adults are already well known [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Cross-sectional evidence suggests that older adults who are physically active display better cognitive functioning than their sedentary peers, in areas such as memory, reaction time, and visuospatial skills [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Prospective and longitudinal findings suggest that physical inactivity is predictive of subsequent cognitive decline and that changes in physical activity patterns over time are associated with changes in cognitive functioning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>Experimental studies of exercise training programs for older adults have generally shown improvements in cognitive functioning, particularly on measures of information processing speed and executive functioning (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]). While some experimental studies have been less conclusive (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]), this discrepancy is most likely attributable to methodological differences. These include differences in duration, intensity, and frequency of exercise training, along with differences in control groups, exclusion criteria, and cognitive outcome measures. A meta-analysis by Colcombe and Kramer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] found that, overall, exercise interventions do have the potential to improve cognitive functioning in older adults, particularly mental speed and executive functioning. The meta-analysis also highlighted that the most beneficial programs are those which have exercise sessions of greater than 30 minutes duration, include aerobic <italic>and </italic>strength training components, and target adults aged between 65 and 70 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. As this is a relatively new area of research, additional evidence is required to further support the claim that exercise training can improve cognition.</p></sec><sec><title>Linking exercise and cognitive functioning</title><p>Several mechanisms have been suggested to explain the relationship between exercise and cognitive functioning. The main hypothesis is that exercise directly affects the structure and function of the brain. Increases in aerobic capacity (as a result of increases in exercise) are thought to increase cerebral blood flow, improve the transport and utilization of oxygen and glucose in the brain, promote neurogenesis (the creation of new nerve cells), and regulate neurotransmitter synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Some studies have found an association between improvements in aerobic capacity and improvements in cognitive function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Other studies, however, have found no relationship [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. More evidence is required to validate the idea of increased aerobic capacity as a prerequisite for improved cognitive functioning.</p><p>Psychological factors may play a role in mediating the relationship between exercise and cognition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Exercise is known to improve psychological well-being [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], and psychological well-being has been associated with cognitive functioning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. A few studies of exercise training and cognitive training have included psychological measures (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]), but results have been mixed. More research is required to elucidate the mediating role of psychological factors in the exercise-cognition relationship [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Combination training</title><p>Some researchers have suggested that the benefits of exercise may be further enhanced by combining exercise training with cognitive training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>].</p><p>Cognitive training has been the traditional approach to improving cognitive functioning in older adults. It consists of learning and practicing skills and techniques to manage cognitively demanding situations (e.g. using mnemonics to aid recall). While these programs have been successful in improving the specific cognitive function targeted by the training (i.e. memory programs improve memory performance) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], they do not have the potential to provide the physical <italic>and </italic>cognitive benefits offered by exercise training. A combination of exercise training and cognitive training, however, may provide the best of both worlds.</p><p>Fabre and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] conducted an experimental study of combination training with four groups: aerobic training, cognitive training, aerobic <italic>and </italic>cognitive training, and control. They found that all three training groups improved significantly, with the combination training group (aerobic <italic>and </italic>cognitive training) improving significantly more than the other groups. These findings are limited, however, by the fact that the combination training group appear to have received a greater total number of training sessions per week than the other groups. Given that engaged lifestyles have been linked to cognitive performance in older adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>], it is possible that the results of the combination training group could be a consequence of increased social interaction, rather than an added benefit of cognitive training. The potential of combined exercise and cognitive training could be better investigated by matching the overall training exposure of participants in a dual group to that of participants in an exercise training group.</p></sec><sec><title>Feasibility</title><p>Little is known about older adults' perceptions of exercise training programs and combined exercise and cognitive training programs. While adherence and compliance data can provide some insight into the feasibility of a training program, qualitative feedback from participants provides information about satisfaction and acceptability. Collection of this type of information also provides an opportunity to identify specific strengths and weaknesses of a program, and to assess the real-life benefits of the training which cannot be measured with clinical tests or surveys [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Aim</title><p>The aims of the present study are to:</p><p>(1) examine the impact of an exercise training program for older adults on cognitive and physical functioning,</p><p>(2) compare the impact of exercise training and a combined program of cognitive <italic>and </italic>exercise training for older adults (which has an equal number of total training sessions per week) on cognitive and physical functioning,</p><p>(3) examine associations between changes in aerobic capacity (as a result of exercise) and changes in cognitive functioning;</p><p>(4) examine associations between changes in psychological wellbeing (as a result of exercise) and changes in cognitive functioning; and</p><p>(5) identify older adults' perceptions of exercise training and combined exercise and cognitive training.</p><p>An exercise training program and a cognitive training program have been developed by the first author (SO), and will be evaluated in a randomized controlled trial.

Twenty participants in each group would enable detection of a between-group difference, at post-test, of 2 items (<underline>SD</underline> = 2.2) on Digit Span. Twenty-nine participants in each group would enable detection of a between-group difference, at post-test, of 118.8 milliseconds (<underline>SD</underline> = 160) on Choice Reaction Time. These sample size calculations assume a two-tailed alpha level of 0.05 and a power of 80%.

CLVT has satisfactory test-retest reliability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. Norms are also available for the CVLT, which has been shown to be somewhat sensitive to the effects of aging and neuropsychological impairment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. Scores include the number of words correctly recalled, the number of intrusions, and the number of repetitions. To limit test-retest effects, the original form is used at baseline and 6-month follow-up, with the alternate form used at the post-test assessment (16 weeks).</p></sec><sec><title>Logical Memory</title><p>This task is from the Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS-III) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. It is a measure of semantic memory. Participants are presented with two brief stories and must recall information from these stories immediately and after a delay of between 10 and 20 minutes. Logical Memory has good test-retest reliability, is not susceptible to practice effects, and norms are available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. Logical Memory has been shown to be sensitive to the effects of aging and neuropsychological impairment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>].

It is a measure of working memory. Participants are presented with a number sequence and must immediately recall the numbers. The task progresses in difficulty as number sequences increase in length (minimum = 2 digits, maximum = 9 digits). Digit Span has two components. In the first part participants must recall the number sequences in the order presented (Digits Forward). In the second part participants must recall the number sequences in the reverse order to which they were presented (Digits Backward). Digit Span has good test-retest reliability, is not susceptible to practice effects and norms are available. Scores include the number of correctly recalled digits forward, the number of correctly recalled digits backward, and the total number of correctly recalled digits.</p></sec><sec><title>California Older Adult Stroop Test (COAST)</title><p>Stroop Tests are a common measure of executive functioning. COAST has been specially developed for use with geriatric populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. It has three components. For the first task participants must identify the names of colours. For the second task participants must read colour name words. In the final task participants must identify the colour in which each colour name word is printed (e.g. the word RED is printed in green ink, so the correct participant response is "Green"). Stroop Tests generally have shown good test-retest reliability and only modest practice effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. Stroop Tests have also been shown to be sensitive to the effects of aging and neuropsychological impairment, and some norms are available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. Scores include completion time, number of errors and number of self-corrected errors.</p></sec><sec><title>Sorting Test</title><p>This task is from the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function Scale (DKEF-S) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>]. Participants are presented with a set of six cards. The cards have words printed on them, and vary in colour and size. There are up to eight ways (rules), according to which the cards may be sorted into groups of three. In the Free Sorting condition, participants must sort the cards in as many different ways as possible and identify the rule by which they have sorted. The Sorting Test has been shown to be sensitive to the effects of aging and neuropsychological impairment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. The Sorting Test has good test-retest reliability and norms are available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>].

It is a measure of executive functioning. Participants are presented with a visual pattern that has one part missing. Participants must select, from multiple choice options, the picture which completes the pattern. The patterns progress in difficulty. Matrix Reasoning has good test-retest reliability and norms are available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>]. The score is the number of patterns correctly solved.</p></sec><sec><title>Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT)</title><p>This is a measure of psychomotor speed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>]. It is a written task requiring participants to substitute numbers for symbols according to a key. Participants must complete as many substitutions as possible in 90 seconds. The SDMT has good test-retest reliability, is not susceptible to practice effects and is sensitive to the effects of aging and neuropsychological impairment. Norms are available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. The score is the number of correct substitutions.</p></sec><sec><title>Timed Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (TIADL)</title><p>This is a measure of applied information processing speed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>]. Participants complete five common tasks of daily living, according to set instructions. These tasks cover communication, money, food preparation, shopping, and medications, and incorporate actual everyday objects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>]. The score is based on the time taken to complete each task, with an adjustment for any errors.</p></sec><sec><title>Simple reaction time</title><p>Simple Reaction Time tasks are frequently used to measure psychomotor speed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>]. Computer-based, these tests require participants to press a button when a stimulus (e.g. a light or object) appears on the screen. Marked slowing of reaction time is evident with age and neurological impairment. Consistent with current practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>], a Simple Reaction Time Task was developed specifically for this project. The Simple Reaction Time Task is run on a Toshiba Tecra A2 Laptop. For this task, 4 taps (faucets) are presented horizontally (and equidistant) across the screen. Participants are required to press the Space Bar when water starts to drip from one of the taps. A warning tone and message ("Get Ready") appear at the top of the screen before each trial. To avoid anticipatory responses, the interval between the warning and stimulus onset is variable. Participants complete 50 trials, with response time recorded in milliseconds from stimulus onset. Responses less than 100 millseconds are considered invalid. Scores are mean reaction time and standard deviation of reaction time.</p></sec><sec><title>Choice reaction time</title><p>Choice Reaction Time Tasks assess speed and concentration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>]. In these tests participants are presented with one stimulus and multiple response options. Responses are usually more delayed than in Simple Reaction Time Tasks, because participants must make a decision before responding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>]. The Choice Reaction Time Task was also developed specifically for this project. The Choice Reaction Time Task is run on a Toshiba Tecra A2 Laptop. For this task, 4 taps (faucets) are presented horizontally (and equidistant) across the screen. The keys D, F, J and K correspond to each tap in order from left to right. Participants are instructed that when water starts to drip from one of the taps, they are to press the corresponding key. A warning tone and a message ("Get Ready") at the top of the screen precede each trial. To avoid anticipatory responses, the interval between the warning and stimulus onset is variable. Participants complete 50 trials, with response time recorded in milliseconds from stimulus onset. Any errors are also recorded. Responses less than 100 millseconds are considered invalid. Scores are mean reaction time, standard deviation of reaction time, and number of errors.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Primary outcome measures: aerobic capacity and strength</title><sec><title>Six-Minute Walk Test (SMWT)</title><p>This is adapted from the Senior Fitness Test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>]. It is a functional measure of aerobic endurance. A rectangular course, measuring 3 m &#x000d7; 15 m, is marked out for participants to walk around. Two chairs are placed inside the course for participants who need to rest during the test. The score is the number of metres walked in six minutes.

It is conducted on a cycle-ergometer and is a measure of aerobic fitness. This test is similar to the Astrand-Ryhming protocol, except that work-rate is adjusted after the second minute, according to heart-rate and age (see Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). The initial power level is set at 0.5 kp for sedentary older women, and 1.0 kp for sedentary older men. This modified protocol is regularly used with clinical populations in research conducted at the School of Human Movement Studies, University of Queensland.
