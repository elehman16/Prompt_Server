			<italic>Objective:</italic> The purpose of this study was to compare the clinical efficacy and safety of intravenous trospectomycin to that of cefoxitin plus doxycycline in the treatment of women hospitalized with acute pelvic inflammatory disease (PID).</p>
		<p>
			<italic>Methods:</italic> Thirty-nine patients admitted with a clinical diagnosis of an acute PID were enrolled in this prospective, single-blind study. Patients were treated with either intravenous trospectomycin, 500 mg every 8 h, or intravenous cefoxitin, 2 g every 6 h, plus oral or intravenous doxycycline, 100 mg every 12 h, in a 2:1 ratio. The patients were followed for clinical response and side effects. Both groups of patients were discharged on oral doxycycline for 10 days. Appropriate cultures were obtained before starting inpatient treatment, on completion of inpatient treatment, and at 2 follow-up visits.</p>
		<p>
			<italic>Results:</italic> The overall success rate for trospectomycin was 95.6% and for cefoxitin/doxycycline was 91.6%. This difference was not statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> = 0.63). Trospectomycin was found to be effective against <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic>.</p>
		<p>
			<italic>Conclusions:</italic> Single-agent therapy with trospectomycin may be as effective as cefoxitin plus doxycycline in the treatment of women hospitalized with acute PID.</p>
