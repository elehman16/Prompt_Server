The efficacy of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLITNs) and IRS was reduced in an area where malaria vectors were resistant to insecticide in Benin
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. In Ethiopia, resistance to pyrethroid insecticides by <italic>Anopheles arabiensis</italic> is increasing
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] and, hence, integrated malaria vectors control approach is needed to reduce the challenge from resistance on malaria transmission
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>Mosquito-proofing houses have a historical success against malaria vectors
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In Missouri, USA, screened houses afforded a considerable degree of protection against malaria vectors and the incidence of malaria was higher in houses without screening where the population was most accessible for biting mosquitoes
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Similarly, in Tennessee River area in USA a substantial reduction of the incidence of malaria was obtained by improving rural houses
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Recently, modification of houses reduced houses entry of <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic> by 78% to 80% in The Gambia
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Forty three percent reduction of house entry of <italic>An. gambiae</italic> was reported by closing eves of houses
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Screening houses using mosquito proofing materials significantly reduced indoor density of host seeking <italic>An. gambiae</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], and it provides equal protection for all occupants in the houses against bites of malaria vectors
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. <italic>Anopheles arabiensis</italic> predominantly bites humans indoors in study site
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], hence there is a need for additional malaria vector control to reduce house entry and minimize indoors human-vector contact, and divert them to non-human hosts available outdoors.

Although screening intervention reduced indoor density of <italic>An. arabiensis</italic> at all abdominal stages, the reduction was substantially higher against unfed <italic>An. arabiensis</italic>. The intervention was based on locally bought materials, and was affordable.</p><p>The houses we assessed were grass thatched, and doors and windows were not well-suited for screenings. The incompatible of doors for screening might reduce the efficacy in such house types. The roofs of grass thatched local houses prevent opening of screened doors outward; consequently, the screened doors were not permanently fixed and people might not used them constantly during the nights before collection.</p><p>A house screening study from The Gambia resulted in 43% reduction of house entry of <italic>An. gambiae</italic> which is comparable to the current study
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Although the incidence of malaria infection was not assessed, the previous studies have shown less malaria cases in screened houses than in controls
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Moreover, the association between the incidence of malaria and the accessibility of a population to mosquitoes was observed with the highest incidence in the population most accessible for mosquito bites
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In The Gambia, screening doors, windows and eves resulted in 59% reduction of indoors density of <italic>An. gambiae,</italic> and reduced the prevalence of anaemia

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>The likely explanation for moderate efficacy the current intervention is that people may not use screened doors in the nights before collection because the screened doors were not permanently fixed as windows. Moreover, <italic>An. arabiensis</italic> could enter houses when the people open the doors during earlier hours of the night
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The small gaps left in the door and windows could also contribute for the moderate reduction of mosquitoes in the intervention houses. Maximum reduction in number of <italic>An. arabiensis</italic> might be achieved if the screened doors were constantly used by home owner&#x02019;s, and the doors were compatible for screening. The likely reason for the overall lower number of mosquitoes sampled during intervention (October/November 2011) compared to the pre-intervention period (April/May 2011) was presumably due to the seasonal variation of the area. Study from the same area shows the highest density of mosquitoes in April and May; the months with the highest rainfall than the October and November; the months with short and small rains
