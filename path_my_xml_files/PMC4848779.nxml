The psycho-educational method &#x02018;affect school with script analysis&#x02019; and the mind-body therapy &#x02018;basic body awareness treatment&#x02019; will be trialled in patients with diabetes, high HbA1c concentrations and psychological symptoms. The primary outcome measure is change in symptoms of depression. Secondary outcome measures are changes in HbA1c concentrations, midnight salivary cortisol concentration, symptoms of alexithymia, anxiety, self-image measures, use of antidepressants, incidence of diabetes complications and mortality.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Two studies will be performed. Study I is an open-labeled parallel-group study with a two-arm randomized controlled trial design. Patients are randomized to either affect school with script analysis or to basic body awareness treatment. According to power calculations, 64 persons are required in each intervention arm at the last follow-up session. Patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes were recruited from one hospital diabetes outpatient clinic in 2009. The trial will be completed in 2016. Study II is a multicentre open-labeled parallel-group three-arm randomized controlled trial. Patients will be randomized to affect school with script analysis, to basic body awareness treatment, or to treatment as usual. Power calculations show that 70 persons are required in each arm at the last follow-up session. Patients with type 2 diabetes will be recruited from primary care. This study will start in 2016 and finish in 2023. For both studies, the inclusion criteria are: HbA1c concentration &#x02265;62.5 mmol/mol; depression, alexithymia, anxiety or a negative self-image; age 18&#x02013;59 years; and diabetes duration &#x02265;1 year. The exclusion criteria are pregnancy, severe comorbidities, cognitive deficiencies or inadequate Swedish. Depression, anxiety, alexithymia and self-image are assessed using self-report instruments. HbA1c concentration, midnight salivary cortisol concentration, blood pressure, serum lipid concentrations and anthropometrics are measured. Data are collected from computerized medical records and the Swedish national diabetes and causes of death registers.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Whether the &#x0201c;affect school with script analysis&#x0201d; will reduce psychological symptoms, increase emotional awareness and improve diabetes related factors will be tried, and compared to &#x0201c;basic body awareness treatment&#x0201d; and treatment as usual.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01714986">NCT01714986</ext-link></p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Alexithymia</kwd><kwd>Anxiety</kwd><kwd>Cortisol</kwd><kwd>Depression</kwd><kwd>Diabetes mellitus</kwd><kwd>HbA1c</kwd><kwd>Mind-body therapy</kwd><kwd>Randomized controlled trial</kwd><kwd>Psycho-education</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Diabetes is a progressive and demanding chronic disease, which might cause secondary distress requiring emotional adaptation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. An increased prevalence of depression is found in patients with diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The comorbidity is linked with inadequate glycemic control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], disturbances in cortisol secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], increased prevalence of diabetes complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and all-cause mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>Affects are the innate, unconscious and strictly biological portions of emotions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Deficits in the awareness of affects result in abnormal physiological reactions and impaired capacity for self-care and self-regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Alexithymia includes difficulties in identifying and describing feelings, as well as low capacity for introspection and reflection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Alexithymia has been demonstrated as a risk factor of depression but the number and prevalence of alexithymic features might also increase during depressive episodes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Type 1 diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], inadequate glycemic control of diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], reflexive emotional eating and obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and increased cardiovascular mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] have been linked to alexithymia. Anxiety has been associated with depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and inadequate glycemic control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>A negative self-image, which includes self-hate, self-ignorance or self-blame, is often present in persons with eating disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], which, in turn, are associated with inadequate glycemic control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p>High concentrations of HbA1c [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] and disturbances in cortisol secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] are linked to complications of diabetes.</p><p>The psycho-educational method &#x02018;affect school with script analysis&#x02019; (ASSA) was constructed by Bergdahl and Armelius [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], inspired by Silvan S.

Two psychotherapists and one physician are recruited as instructors for both studies. They were trained together to become instructors by the constructors of the ASSA method, and have been instructors together in several ASSA groups. The same two instructors participate in all eight group sessions, which render three possible combinations: physician and psychotherapist I; physician and psychotherapist II; and psychotherapist I and psychotherapist II. The patients could be considered clustered within the pair of instructors. Patients will also be clustered by the set of five to seven participants included in each group. As depression is the main outcome measure we will test associations between depression symptoms, instructors and groups. Only one room will be used for all group sessions in each study.</p><p>At each affect school session a specific information handout is distributed, containing affect and script theory and the topics for the affect discussion. The scheme for the affect school sessions is presented in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. During the first part of each affect school session the participants are instructed on general affect theory, and specific theory regarding the particular innate affects that are the topics for the session, followed by script theory. During the second part, the affect discussion, participants are encouraged to tell single-event autobiographical memory narratives; this exercise is considered important in psychotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. The goal of the affect school is to achieve increased emotional awareness and verbal expressiveness. The affect theory presented during the affect school group sessions is essential for the script analysis, and we consider that participation in at least five group sessions is necessary to obtain an understanding of the theory. Persons with lower participation rate will not be offered script analysis.

These sessions are performed by psychotherapists or social counsellors.</p><p>Here follows a short description of the affect theory that will be presented during the group sessions. A more complete description is presented elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Essential in the affect school are the five concepts of affects, feelings, emotions, mood and scripts. Affects are the innate, unconscious and strictly biological portions of emotions. Each affect has a specific programme involving face mimicry, body gestures, voice and autonomous nervous and hormone system physiology. The innate affects are enjoyment-joy, interest-excitement, surprise-startle, fear-terror, anger-rage, distress-anguish, shame-humiliation, distaste and dissmell. Pain has features of both an affect and a drive. Affects are important messengers to the self. The primary functions of the innate affects are to regulate drives, such as hunger and sexuality. The secondary functions are to regulate other affects. <italic>Feelings</italic> are the conscious portions of emotions. <italic>Emotions</italic> reflect biography. A triggered affect evokes memories of earlier situations and relationships where this affect has been triggered before and, in addition, other affects triggered in the earlier situations will be triggered again in the present situation. An emotion lasts as long as memory continues to trigger the involved affects. <italic>Mood</italic> is defined as a persistent state of emotion. Anxiety and depression are subsequently mood disorders. <italic>Scripts</italic> are learned patterns to handle emotions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec32"><title>Basic body awareness therapy &#x02013; a physiotherapeutic mind-body therapy</title><sec id="Sec33"><title>Studies I and II</title><p>This comprises ten weekly sessions for a group of five to seven participants with one instructor responsible for all sessions. Three physiotherapists, with special BBAT education and clinical experience of being BBAT instructors are recruited for both group and individual sessions in both studies. Before intervention, the BBAT instructors meet and synchronize how they will perform the interventions. The patients are clustered by BBAT instructors. Patients will also be clustered by the set of five to seven participants included in each group. We will test associations between depression symptoms, instructors and group. Only one room will be used for all group sessions in each study. Breathing, grounding, stability in the central line, centring, flexibility and flow are features systematically trained at each session. Patients are encouraged to observe and accept the sensations and emotions that awaken during the treatment situations. Patients systematically train to discern and differentiate between thoughts, emotions and body sensations. Continuous training and repetition are fundamental parts of BBAT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p><p>Patients are offered five individual sessions where they focus on their own particular difficulties.</p><p>To balance the two intervention methods patients participating in fewer than five group sessions will not be offered any individual sessions. The total participation rate will be counted.</p><p>Enhanced body awareness and a greater unity between body and self are important goals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Body awareness is the subjective, phenomenological aspect of proprioception and interoception that enters conscious awareness, and is modifiable by mental processes including attention, interpretation, appraisal, beliefs, memories, conditioning, attitudes and affects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Important in BBAT is breathing, which is regarded as a central connector between body and mind. Improved body and mind integration is achieved by noticing, discerning, and differentiating thoughts, emotions and body sensations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec34"><title>Measures to enhance participation</title><p>In both studies, participants are offered &#x02018;preventive sick leave&#x02019; for the time spent in group or individual sessions by the Swedish Social Insurance Agency, as a measure to enhance participation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec35"><title>Discontinuation of intervention with ASSA and BBAT</title><p>In both studies, if anything should happen to patients during the intervention so that they fulfil the exclusion criteria, they will be advised to withdraw.

Previous research has shown that alexithymia is a risk factor for depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], which is deleterious for patients with diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Also, a deficit in the awareness of affects results in abnormal physiological reactions and impaired capacity for self-care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. An advanced capacity for self-care is necessary in diabetes.</p><p>For this reason, we were interested in finding interventions focusing on increased emotional awareness and verbal expressiveness. We have chosen to test the ASSA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] against BBAT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] in two studies. In Study I, we perform a two-arm randomized controlled trial with patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes from one hospital diabetes outpatient clinic. In Study II, ASSA, BBAT and &#x02018;treatment as usual&#x02019; will be compared in a three-arm randomized controlled trial for patients with type 2 diabetes from primary care units.</p><p>We expect the ASSA method to be more efficient than BBAT in reducing depressive symptoms. In the ASSA intervention, patients are systematically trained to identify and describe feelings, and are also presented with advanced affect theory. In BBAT, patients focus more on bodily features, such as breathing, grounding, stability, centring, flexibility and flow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. The patients undergoing BBAT are not systematically trained to identify and describe feelings but they are encouraged to observe and accept sensations and emotions that awaken during the treatment sessions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. As neither of the two interventions is &#x02018;placebo&#x02019;, we think it is important to compare both ASSA and BBAT with treatment as usual.</p><p>We have chosen reduction of depression symptoms as the primary outcome measure, even though some patients were not depressed at the time of inclusion. A reduction in depression symptoms might be of value even for patients not fulfilling our criteria for self-reported depression. A lower cut-off level (&#x02265;5 points) has been proposed for the depression subscale of the Swedish version of Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale than we have chosen to use. This means that the sensitivity for depression might be less than optimal in our study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].</p><p>One limitation to our studies is that we only use self-report instruments, not structured interviews. Another limitation is that not enough patients in the first part of our randomized controlled trial agreed to participate in the intervention, so randomizing into three arms (ASSA, BBAT and a no-intervention group) was impossible. We aim to recruit more patients in Study II, to be able to perform the three-arm randomized controlled trial.</p><p>We foresee recruitment difficulties. Patients have generally not previously been introduced to the idea that emotional factors might impact their disease; presumably neither ASSA nor BBAT are methods known to the patients. Patients may feel that it is stressful to talk about emotions in a group situation and therefore BBAT may be more easily accepted.</p><p>Another difficulty is that most patients are working or university students, which might make participation difficult, therefore the Swedish Social Insurance Agency will offer preventive sick-leave compensation for treatment session time. It is, however, not possible to offer preventive sick-leave compensation for nonparticipants.</p><p>The clustering within the pair of instructors in ASSA might affect the results, but this will be tested. The three ASSA instructors were trained together, and have previously been ASSA instructors together in all three possible combinations; this will probably minimize the effects of clustering. The three BBAT instructors all have special training and long experience, but have not been trained together; however, they will co-operate in synchronizing how they will perform the BBAT intervention. The results of the interventions might be influenced by the group members being randomized into each group and by study design. Previously, we have carefully selected patients who we thought could benefit from the ASSA intervention and would not disturb the group dynamics. In the current studies, no individual selection can be made by the instructors, owing to the study design. Previously, we have made contracts with the patients to do their very best to participate in all sessions. In the current studies, we have declared that they can stop participating at any time.</p><p>In summary, depression is a serious disease in patients with diabetes. Intervention with ASSA and BBAT will be tried for patients with diabetes, psychological symptoms and inadequate glycemic control, first in one two-arm randomized controlled trial and then in one three-arm randomized controlled trial.</p></sec><sec id="Sec47"><title>Trial status</title><p>Patients from the hospital outpatient clinic were recruited in 2009 with the final follow-up section expected to take place in 2016.
