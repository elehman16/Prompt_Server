Patients with gastrointestinal symptoms including reflux and dyspepsia symptoms for more than 3 months in a period of 6 months prior to enrollment who visited the outpatient clinics of the participating hospitals were invited to participate in this study. Symptoms were confirmed through patient interviews. Patients were required to have upper gastrointestinal endoscopy within 1 month of enrollment and were selected for the study if minimal change esophagitis was noted. Minimal change esophagitis was defined as the presence of one of the following characteristics at the distal end of the esophageal mucosa: whitish change and/or erythema, and/or erosion not regarded as mucosal break.<xref rid="b5-jnm-20-338" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b6-jnm-20-338" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Patients were also required to be aged 20 years or older, and to be outpatients at the relevant center.</p><p>Patients who had apparent causes of gastrointestinal symptoms such as gastric ulcer, malignancy, pancreatitis, biliary disease, irritable bowel syndrome and/or inflammatory bowel disease were excluded. Patients with a history of intra-abdominal surgery were also excluded. Furthermore, patients who had been treated with prokinetics, histamine H<sub>2</sub> receptor antagonists, or PPIs within 1 month prior to the start of the study were excluded. Finally, any patients who were pregnant, lactating and/or who were attempting to become pregnant were excluded, as well as patients who were regarded by the study investigators as not to be suitable for participation.</p><p>All patients gave their written informed consent to participate in the study. The institutional review board of each center approved this study.</p></sec><sec><title>Randomization and Treatment</title><p>Randomization was achieved by using a computerized random number table with the key code securely stored. Random number table was created by one of the investigators (CHP) by applying a block randomization method with a block size of 6. Patients were randomized to one of the 2 study arms. The patients in the treatment arm received DA-9701 (Motilitone, Dong-A Pharm., Co., Seoul, Korea) 30 mg t.i.d. (means 3 times a day) for 4 weeks. The patients in the control arm received placebo tablets that were identical to the DA-9701 tablets t.i.d. for 4 weeks. The following concomitant medications were prohibited: prokinetics, PPIs, H<sub>2</sub> receptor antagonists, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroids and/or anti-cholinergics.</p></sec><sec><title>Safety Assessment</title><p>Safety profiles were assessed by using review of systems and physical examination at screening and at each outpatient clinic visit. Laboratory tests including a complete blood count, biochemistry and electrolytes were performed before and after the treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Nepean Dyspepsia Index</title><p>The patients&#x02019; symptoms and quality of life were assessed by using the Nepean dyspepsia index questionnaire-Korean version (NDI-K).<xref rid="b28-jnm-20-338" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> The NDI-K consists of a symptom checklist and a disease-specific quality of life measure. The symptom indexes of the NDI-K were rated for frequency (scored 0&#x02013;4), intensity (scored 0&#x02013;5) and bothersomeness (scored 0&#x02013;4). The higher numbers represented the worsening of each symptom. Among the 15 items of the NDI-K symptom checklist, we used 8 and 2 items that represent dyspepsia and reflux, respectively. In addition, quality of life scores were obtained by using the NDI-K quality of life scale, which consists of 25 items, with a total score ranging from 0 to 99. The NDI-K quality of life scale measures the quality of life in four domains: interference (13 items), knowledge/control (7 items), eating/drinking (3 items) and sleep (2 items).</p></sec><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Patients&#x02019; and Investigators&#x02019; Global Assessment</title><p>After 4 weeks of treatment, patients rated the efficacy of the drug by completing a self-reported questionnaire with a 7-point Likert scale ranging from &#x0201c;no response&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;complete response.&#x0201d; Patients who reported the efficacy of the drug as &#x0201c;no response&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;slight response&#x0201d; were classified as non-response group, while others that reported the efficacy as higher than &#x0201c;slight response&#x0201d; were classified as response group.

Therefore, it was suggested that minimal changes were considered as early endoscopic findings of GERD.<xref rid="b3-jnm-20-338" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> However, another prospective multicenter study conducted in Korea showed that most of the endoscopic findings indicating minimal changes were not associated with GERD.<xref rid="b29-jnm-20-338" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> In addition, patients with NERD have been suggested to be of heterogeneous group and different mechanisms may be responsible for their symptoms.<xref rid="b9-jnm-20-338" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Some patients experience heartburn caused by excess acid reflux, whereas others show esophageal chemoreceptor sensitivity to physiological amounts of acid. Another subgroup of patients may develop heartburn symptoms as a result of esophageal motor dysfunction. Hiatal hernia is less common and severe gastric atrophy is more frequently observed in patients with minimal change esophagitis than in those with erosive esophagitis.<xref rid="b13-jnm-20-338" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="b17-jnm-20-338" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Moreover, PPIs are less effective in NERD patients than in those with erosive esophagitis patients.<xref rid="b13-jnm-20-338" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b16-jnm-20-338" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> These findings suggest that the pathophysiology of minimal change esophagitis may be different from that of erosive esophagitis, and indicate that the development of more effective treatment options is necessary.</p><p>In the present study we assessed the efficacy of DA-9701, a newly developed prokinetic agent, in patients with minimal change esophagitis. Although DA-9701 improved the NDI-K symptom scores and quality of life scores after 4 weeks of treatment, an advantage of DA-9701 over placebo was not demonstrated. These results may be explained based on the ineffectiveness of DA-9701 in patients with minimal change esophagitis. However, the high placebo response rate in this trial might be another reason for the lack of a significant difference in efficacy between DA-9701 and the placebo. In our study, both of the proportions of patients who showed a response to the placebo according to the patients&#x02019; and the investigators&#x02019; global assessment were 66.7%. A previous meta-analysis on GERD showed that the placebo response rate tended to increase in patients with NERD compared to those with erosive esophagitis (placebo response rate: NERD vs. erosive esophagitis, 18.31% vs. 11.87%, <italic>P</italic> = 0.246).<xref rid="b30-jnm-20-338" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Furthermore, the placebo response rates in patients with functional dyspepsia were 30&#x02013;50%.<xref rid="b31-jnm-20-338" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b33-jnm-20-338" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Because minimal change esophagitis patients who had symptoms including dyspepsia were included in the study, the placebo response rate was higher in our study than in previous studies on GERD. We believe that the high placebo response may have masked the differences in the efficacy of DA-9701 in patients with minimal change esophagitis.</p><p>We performed exploratory data analyses by dividing the patient population into various subgroups. The main purpose of this additional analysis was to identify low placebo response subgroups. The results showed that elderly patients aged 65 years or older had a low placebo response regarding reflux symptoms. DA-9701, however, showed similar efficacy on reflux symptoms between elderly and non-elderly patients. In addition, DA-9701 had an advantage on reflux symptoms over placebo in the subgroup of elderly patients. Despite the possibility of coincidental findings, we think that the efficacy of DA-9701 on reflux symptoms should be reinvestigated carefully in selected patients who do not respond to placebo.</p><p>Although this was a randomized, doubleblind, placebo-controlled study, there were several limitations. Firstly, several factors associated with the severity of symptoms in patients with NERD or erosive esophagitis, including hiatal hernia, atrophic gastritis, and <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> infection status, were not assessed. Although the randomized design of the study should minimize selection bias including hidden risk factors, an even distribution of all risk factors was not guaranteed. Secondly, we could not distinguish the patients with GERD from those with functional heartburn because 24-hour esophageal pH monitoring was not performed. Although such an exam is not a primary diagnostic option prior to treatment in patients with NERD, it would help to identify a subgroup of patients who would benefit from DA-9701 treatment. Thirdly, although we showed a low placebo response rate in elderly patients and an advantage of DA-9701 on reflux symptoms over placebo, it has not been proven that elderly patients generally have a lower placebo response rate than non-elderly patients. One previous study with pooled analysis, however, showed that elderly patients had a lower placebo response rate for migraine than younger patients.<xref rid="b34-jnm-20-338" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> Our result, with a low placebo rate for reflux symptoms in elderly patients with NERD, should be supported by further studies.</p><p>Our results showed that DA-9701 did not improve the symptom scores nor quality of life scores in comparison with the placebo despite an improvement in the NDI-K symptom scores and quality of life scores after 4 weeks of treatment compared with baseline values in patients with minimal change esophagitis. The effect of DA-9701 on reflux symptoms in elderly patients, however, may be meaningful and merit further investigation.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p>Financial
