</p><sec id="apa13407-sec-0006"><title>Background</title><p>Telemedicine applications can enhance the involvement of patients in their own care, provide monitoring of their symptoms and help the healthcare provider identify signs of deterioration in the patient's condition early and respond to these in a timely manner. Telemedicine has mostly been used in the management of adult patients with chronic conditions, such as congestive heart failure, stroke or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease <xref rid="apa13407-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref>. Recently, telemedicine applications have also been used in the home care of children with chronic illnesses. A randomised trial of a remote home support programme for infants with major congenital heart disease showed that the use of video conferences compared with telephone consultations made clinicians feel more confident in making medical decisions <xref rid="apa13407-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2</xref>. Parents were more satisfied with videoconferencing support than with telephone calls. The risk of hospitalisation was also lower in the videoconferencing group <xref rid="apa13407-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2</xref>. Videoconferencing has also been shown to be feasible in the management of children on home ventilator support <xref rid="apa13407-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref> as well as for paediatric palliative care at home <xref rid="apa13407-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref>.</p><p>An area where the use of telemedicine is being developed is the home health care of newborn infants. Due to prematurity or illness, many newborn infants need hospital care after birth. When the infants are sufficiently mature and physiologically stable, the infants can be discharged from the NICU to home health care in which neonatal staff support parents in the care of their infants. In a previous study, we compared the use of either a web application or video calls with traditional telephone calls in the home health care of preterm infants after discharge from a large neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) of a university hospital. Under this hospital's home healthcare programme, neonatal nurses made home visits to the family until the visits were no longer necessary <xref rid="apa13407-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref>. The randomised pilot study showed that parents felt that the use of telemedicine helped them cope with the care of their infant at home <xref rid="apa13407-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref>.</p><p>In western Sweden, the catchment areas of regional hospitals are very large, making home visits time&#x02010;consuming and therefore costly. At the Norra &#x000c4;lvsborg Regional Hospital, infants who are discharged from the NICU have control visits at the hospital instead of home visits by nurses. Since both parents are on parental leave during the period of hospital&#x02010;supported home health care, they can be present during the hospital visits. In the present randomised study, we investigated whether the combined use of a web application and video calls would improve the comfort level of parents taking care of their infants at home and decrease the need for scheduled or emergency visits to the hospital.</p></sec><sec id="apa13407-sec-0007"><title>Patients and methods</title><sec id="apa13407-sec-0008"><title>Ethical approval</title><p>This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board for Human Studies of Gothenburg University.</p></sec><sec id="apa13407-sec-0009"><title>Patients and study groups</title><p>The study was conducted at the NICU of Norra &#x000c4;lvsborg Regional Hospital during the years 2012&#x02013;2013. The hospital has about 3500 births per year. Due to the regionalisation of neonatal care in western Sweden, this hospital admits only babies born at or above 27 weeks of gestational age. During the years 2012&#x02013;2013, 1112 babies were admitted to the NICU. Of these, 161 received home health care after discharge from the unit.</p><p>Families with newborn infants who were going to be discharged from the NICU to home care were eligible for the present study, except families with insufficient knowledge of the Swedish language to be able to converse on the phone with the nurses or read and write messages written in Swedish, families without a computer and Internet connection at home and families whose infant was expected to need control visits for less than a week.</p><p>A total of 139 families fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Of these, 137 families were given both oral and written information about the study during their child's hospitalisation. To ensure that all the families received the same information, one of the authors (CR) informed all the families. As discharge from the unit approached, the families were asked whether they wanted to participate in the study and 89 (65%) consented. After they provided written informed consent, they were randomised into two groups, with 42 families in the control group and 47 families in the study group.</p><p>Families in the control group received standard health care after discharge from the hospital. This meant that the families generally visited the hospital neonatal nurse two to three times per week on Monday, Wednesday or Friday. At each visit, a neonatal nurse met with the family for 30&#x02013;90 minutes. During the visit, the baby was weighed and his or her length and head circumference were measured. The nurse answered the parents&#x02019; questions and concerns and provided instructions on how to care their infant. The next visit was usually booked at this time. In addition, the nurse could phone the family as needed. The family could phone the neonatal nurses at the hospital or come to the hospital with their infant at any time, if needed.</p><p>The care received by the telemedicine group was similar to that received by the control group except that the hospital visits were complemented with the web application. In addition, the nurses were instructed to use video calls instead of regular phone calls to communicate with the families. As in the control group, the families could telephone the neonatal nurses at the hospital or come to the hospital with their infant at any time.</p><p>Prior to discharge from the hospital, the parents in the telemedicine group were shown how to use the web application and were also given written instructions about its use. They were encouraged to answer the ten questions on the web form once a day. They could also write messages to the nurses either through the form or through the internal mail function of the web application. If interested, the families could see their child's data, including his/her growth curve, in graphic form. The home health nurse was instructed to read the parents&#x02019; answers, give them feedback and answer any questions the parents had written the same day.</p><p>In addition to using the web application, the families in the telemedicine group received video calls from the nurse. Each call was scheduled in advance at the time of the previous hospital visit. The video calls took place on Mondays, Wednesdays or Fridays since the nurses worked with home health care only on these days.</p></sec><sec id="apa13407-sec-0010"><title>Neonatal nurses</title><p>Four neonatal nurses at the hospital were involved in the study. They were 38&#x02013;47 years old and had worked at the NICU for 12&#x02013;15 years. They received training in the use of the web application and Skype prior to the study.</p></sec><sec id="apa13407-sec-0011"><title>The web application</title><p>The web application contained a form with 10 questions about the child's health and nutrition as well as how the parents were coping with the care of their infant at home. Questions about the infant's general health, activity level, sleeping pattern, nutrition (including tube feeding), spitting up and skin&#x02010;to&#x02010;skin care were included. The nursing staff entered the baby's weight and length data on the web page and could view the parents&#x02019; answers and any questions or comments. The parents could view the child's data in graphic form. The parents and the nurses could also exchange internal messages with each other through the web application.</p></sec><sec id="apa13407-sec-0012"><title>Video calls using Skype</title><p>Skype is a commercially available off&#x02010;the&#x02010;shelf programme for video communication over the Internet. The user logs in with a username and a password and can make voice or video calls and send text messages to other Skype users.</p><p>For Skype calls, the families were given a bag containing an HD web camera, namely a Logitech QuickCam Pro9000 for PC users and Logitech QuickCam Vision Pro for Mac users (Logitech International S.A., Lausanne, Switzerland), a set of Ace G35 speakers (Ace of Sweden, M&#x000f6;lndal, Sweden) and a compact disc containing the installation programme for Skype version 5.3. The families were given both oral and written instructions for the use of the web camera and Skype.</p></sec><sec id="apa13407-sec-0013"><title>Data retrieval and analysis</title><p>The infant's gestational age and birth weight as well as the length of initial hospitalisation and of the home healthcare period were recorded. The number of scheduled and emergency visits to the hospital as well as the number of phone and video calls was recorded. The number of times the families or nurses used the web application for communication was also studied.</p><p>After discharge from the hospital&#x02010;supported home health care, the families were asked to fill in a questionnaire on what they thought of the home health care they had received. Thirty&#x02010;five of 42 families (83%) in the control group and 32 of 47 families (68%) in the telemedicine group completed the questionnaire. The questionnaire for the telemedicine group contained questions specific to this group and was therefore longer than that of the other group. This may in part explain why a lower percentage of parents in the telemedicine group filled in the questionnaire.</p><p>The nurses were also given a questionnaire addressing their perceptions of the use of the web&#x02010;based system and video calls in neonatal home health care. Three of the four nurses (75%) filled in the questionnaire.</p></sec><sec id="apa13407-sec-0014"><title>Statistics</title><p>The results are given as means &#x000b1; SEM. The two&#x02010;tailed Mann&#x02013;Whitney <italic>U</italic>&#x02010;test was used to compare continuous variables between the control and the web group. The relation between categorical variables was analysed using Fisher's exact test. A p value of &#x0003c;0.05 was considered significant.</p></sec></sec><sec id="apa13407-sec-0015"><title>Results</title><sec id="apa13407-sec-0016"><title>Characteristics of the mothers and infants</title><p>Maternal age, the number of older siblings in the family, the gestational age of the infants at birth, their birth weights and the length of their hospitalisation before discharge to home health care did not differ significantly between the groups (Table <xref rid="apa13407-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap">1</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="apa13407-tbl-0001" xml:lang="en" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Characteristics of mothers and infants, of the initial hospitalisation and of the home health care</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><col style="border-right:solid 1px #000000" span="1"/><col style="border-right:solid 1px #000000" span="1"/><col style="border-right:solid 1px #000000" span="1"/><col style="border-right:solid 1px #000000" span="1"/><thead valign="top"><tr style="border-bottom:solid 1px #000000"><th align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Control group, median (range)</th><th align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Telemedicine group, median (range)</th><th align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">p value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" colspan="4" rowspan="1">Mothers</td></tr><tr><td align="left" style="padding-left:10%" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age</td><td align="char" char=" " rowspan="1" colspan="1">31 (21&#x02013;45)</td><td align="char" char=" " rowspan="1" colspan="1">30 (21&#x02013;40)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">ns</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="4" rowspan="1">Siblings</td></tr><tr><td align="left" style="padding-left:10%" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Number of older siblings</td><td align="char" char=" " rowspan="1" colspan="1">0 (0&#x02013;4)</td><td align="char" char=" " rowspan="1" colspan="1">0 (0&#x02013;10)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">ns</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="4" rowspan="1">Infants</td></tr><tr><td align="left" style="padding-left:10%" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Gestational age, weeks + days</td><td align="char" char=" " rowspan="1" colspan="1">34 wk + 0d (26 wk + 0d &#x02212;

The infants in the web group were hospitalised for the evaluation of poor weight gain and for osteopenia of prematurity. The infant in the control group was admitted for increased oxygen requirement and low blood haemoglobin requiring a blood transfusion. The percentages of planned visits leading to hospital admission were 0.6% and 0.3% in the web and the control group, respectively. The difference is not significant (p &#x0003e; 0.9, Fisher's exact test).</p><p>Seven emergency visits led to hospitalisation, five in the web group and two in the control group. In the web group, one infant was admitted to the hospital twice, once for observation for a suspected infection involving tiredness and poor food intake and once for a viral upper airway infection. The other three infants in the web group were hospitalised for observation because of two episodes of colour change in the infant during sleep, observation because of an episode of apnoea after spitting up, subsequently interpreted as a laryngospasm, and a viral upper airway infection. The two infants in the control group were hospitalised for a viral upper airway infection and for observation because of an episode of apnoea after spitting up, later interpreted as a laryngospasm. The reasons for the hospital admissions were of such a kind that they could not have prevented by telemedicine consultation. The percentages of emergency visits leading to hospitalisation were 17% and 4% in the web group and the control group, respectively. There was a trend towards emergency visits being more likely to result in hospital admission in the web group, possibly indicating that telemedicine consultations could prevent unnecessary emergency room visits. The difference between the two groups, however, was not statistically significant (p = 0.12, Fisher's exact test).</p></sec><sec id="apa13407-sec-0018"><title>Use of video calls and the web application in the telemedicine group</title><p>To make video calls to the families, the nurses used one stationary computer located in a room outside the NICU, since installation of Skype on the computers in the NICU was not allowed. Video calls were scheduled in advance and took place on Monday, Wednesday or Friday, since the nurses only worked in home health care during these days.</p><p>The number of video calls received by families was low, ranging from zero to five. On average, there was one Skype call per 19 days of home care. In the telemedicine group, 13 families (28%) received no video calls at all. Three of these families had problems with their Internet coverage. Three families had a short stay of less than 14 days in the home healthcare programme and paid frequent scheduled visits, three times per week, to the hospital. In these cases, video calls were deemed unnecessary. One family did not want to receive video calls. In one case, video calls were not used because the family visited the hospital nurse frequently due to the infant's illness.</p><p>The families in the telemedicine group were asked to answer the questions on the web page every day. The median number of times the families filled in the web form was 10.5, and the range was 1&#x02013;30. On average, the families completed the web form every other day. The nurses were supposed to check on a daily basis what the parents had written, send a note back to acknowledge having read the entry and answer questions if necessary. However, the nurses only responded to 33% of the parents&#x02019; entries. In addition, the website contained answers to frequently asked questions about newborn infants and their illnesses.</p></sec><sec id="apa13407-sec-0019"><title>Use of conventional telephone calls</title><p>The families could call the nurses at any time to ask questions or take care of practical matters such as rescheduling the next hospital visit.

The web page and video calls could give the families answers to their questions in a timely manner and thereby decrease the need of scheduled and emergency visits to the hospital. The use of telemedicine made them feel more secure in caring for their baby. A large percentage of the parents in the telemedicine group thought that they did not need all their visits to the hospital, whereas few parents in the control group thought so. Similarly, in a randomised trial of a remote home support programme for infants with major congenital heart disease, the use of video calls increased the satisfaction of parents and lowered the risk of hospitalisation and the use of healthcare resources <xref rid="apa13407-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2</xref>.</p><p>The parents also had suggestions about how the home health care could be improved. Some parents mentioned that they could have further decreased the number of hospital visits by weighing their infant at home and by using video calls to talk with the nurse about issues that were usually discussed during hospital visits. Parents also pointed out that having a scale at home to check the infant's weight would have spared visits to the hospital and that a mobile version of the web page would have made it possible to communicate with the nurse from anywhere. The possibility of calling the nurse by Skype during the weekend would also have been appreciated.</p><p>In some cases, the parents felt that telecommunication was unnecessary because their infant was doing well. It is understandable that spending time answering questions on a web page or conversing with nurses using video calls was not relevant for these families. Similarly, adult patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease did not make use of a self&#x02010;monitoring device if they were in good health <xref rid="apa13407-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref>. It is important that the use of telecommunication and hospital visits is individualised to meet the variable needs of families in order to avoid unnecessary use of healthcare resources and of parents&#x02019; and nurses&#x02019; time.</p><p>One strength of the study was that a very high percentage of eligible families (98.6%) received information about the study and that this was given to them all by the same person. This ensured that the same information was given to all the families and probably also contributed to the high percentage of the families (65%) who agreed to participate in the study. A limitation of the study was that the relatively low response rate to the questionnaire (83% in the control group and 68% in the telemedicine group) may have caused a bias in the data based on parents&#x02019; opinions.</p><p>Although the nurses were mostly favourable to the use of video calls and the web page, they pointed out that using these technologies required a change in their way of working that they needed motivation and time to get used to. It seems that the nurses did not use telecommunication and home visits as complementary ways of communicating with parents. For example, the next follow&#x02010;up visit was still routinely scheduled during each visit. The nurses could instead have assessed the need of individual families for an appointment by using information from video calls and from the parents&#x02019; answers and comments on the web page. This would most likely have resulted in fewer scheduled hospital appointments.</p><p>The organisation of the home healthcare programme at the hospital prevented the optimal use of the video calls and web page. The nurses were only involved in home health care on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. During the rest of the week, they worked in inpatient care at the NICU. During that time, they could not make or receive video calls because the computer that was used for the calls was located outside the unit. This may explain why the possibility of using video calls did not decrease the use of ordinary telephone calls in the web group. The nurse could answer the families&#x02019; comments on the web page while working at the NICU, but only if she happened to have time. This meant that on four days of the week, the nurses hardly used the new technology. It was therefore not surprising to find that the nurses wrote feedback to the families&#x02019; comments on the web page in only 30% of cases and that video calls were used infrequently. Organisational factors also limited the possibility of individualising the times of appointments according to the family's needs. Any appointment that was postponed had to be delayed by at least two or (over the weekend) three days. Better organisation of the home healthcare programme would have enabled the nurses to use the telemedicine applications optimally and to adjust the number of hospital visits to meet the families&#x02019; individual needs. A study examining the impact of a home telemonitoring intervention on the hospital and home health care of patients with elderly chronic obstructive pulmonary disease also concluded that using new technologies requires reorganisation of nurses&#x02019; care plans <xref rid="apa13407-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="apa13407-sec-0024"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study showed that the use of video calls and a web page in the home health care of newborn infants was well accepted by young computer&#x02010;proficient parents. However, to optimally use the possibilities of telemedicine, home health care needs to be reorganised to meet the families&#x02019; needs. Telemedicine in the home health care of newborn infants can lead to more effective use of healthcare resources for this patient population.</p></sec><sec id="apa13407-sec-0026"><title>Funding</title><p>This study was supported by grants from the Swedish Heart and Lung Foundation, the Frimurare Barnhus Foundation and the Swedish Research Council for Clinical Research in Medicine.</p></sec><sec id="apa13407-sec-0027"><title>Conflict of interest</title><p>The authors declare no conflict of interest.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="apa13407-sec-0025"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to thank the nurses and families who participated in this study.</p></ack><ref-list content-type="cited-references" id="apa13407-bibl-0001"><title>References</title><ref id="apa13407-bib-0001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal" id="apa13407-cit-0001">
