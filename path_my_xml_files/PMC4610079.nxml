In 17-41% of the patients, pain is the main reason for overnight hospital stay after day case surgery.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Intense acute pain after laparoscopic cholecystectomy might predict the development of chronic pain (e.g., postlaparoscopic cholecystectomy syndrome).[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Pregabalin is a structural analog of &#x003b3;-aminobutyric acid, which shows the analgesic, anticonvulsant, and anxiolytic effects. In many countries, it is approved for the treatment of neuropathic pain.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Like its predecessor, gabapentin, it binds to the &#x003b1;-2-d subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels, reducing the release of several excitatory neurotransmitters (including glutamate, norepinephrine, substance P, and calcitonin gene-related peptide) and blocking the development of hyperalgesia and central sensitization.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Pregabalin is more potent than the similar drug, gabapentin. It is rapidly absorbed orally with &#x0003e;90% bioavailability, achieves peak plasma levels within 30 min to 2 h. and shows linear pharmacokinetics.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] The most common adverse events are dizziness and somnolence, and pregabalin has no effect on arterial blood pressure or heart rate.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>Paracetamol (acetaminophen; N-acetyl-p-aminophenol) is well-absorbed from the proximal small bowel and is not subject to significant first-pass metabolism in the liver, with oral bioavailability estimated at between 63% and 89% in adults.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] The minimum plasma paracetamol level required for analgesia and antipyresis is thought to be 10 &#x003bc;g/ml, and the therapeutic range is usually stated to be 10-20 &#x003bc;g/ml.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] 150 &#x003bc;g/ml is considered to be the threshold for potential hepatotoxicity.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Peak plasma concentration (Cmax) is achieved approximately 45 min after 1 g orally.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Paracetamol inhibits both isoforms of cyclooxygenase (COX); the constitutive COX-1 and the inducible COX-2. Paracetamol displays weak anti-inflammatory activity, few or no gastrointestinal side effects and only a small dose-dependent alteration of platelet function. Current evidence points to multisite activity in the central nervous system, involving inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis and interaction with both serotonergic and cannabinoid pathways.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>The stress response to surgery is characterized by increased secretion of pituitary hormones and activation of the sympathetic nervous system. The changes in the pituitary secretions have secondary effects on hormone secretion from target organs (increased secretion of cortisol from the adrenal cortex).[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>The present study was therefore designed to evaluate the role of a preoperative single oral dose of paracetamol (1 g) in comparison to preoperative single oral dose of two different doses of pregabalin (150 mg or 300 mg) for attenuating postoperative pain and analgesic consumption in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This randomized controlled study was conducted on 75 patients aged between 18 and 60 years old of both sex of American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I and II of 70-90 kg body weight and height 160-180 cm undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy under general anesthesia. The study protocol was approved from the Institutional Ethical Committee and written informed consent was obtained from all the patients.</p><p>Patients with impaired kidney or liver functions, history of cardiac or central nervous system disease, history of drug or alcohol abuse, history of chronic pain or daily intake of analgesics, uncontrolled medical disease (diabetes mellitus and hypertension), history of intake of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs within 24 h before surgery or allergy to the used medications, and duration of operation &#x0003e;90 min were excluded from the study.</p><p>Patients meeting the inclusion criteria during the preanesthetic evaluation were randomly assigned into three groups of 25 each to receive1 g paracetamol (group I, control group) or pregabalin 150 mg (group II) or pregabalin 300 mg (group III) orally 2 h before induction of anesthesia with sips of water. Assessment of postoperative pain, sedation, postoperative monitoring of heart rate, mean systolic and mean diastolic blood pressure, and side effects (e.g., vomiting, blurring of vision, and excessive sedation) were done every 30 min for 2 h and after 6 h.</p><p>Postoperative pain was evaluated based on visual analog scale (VAS), 1<sup>st</sup> time to ask for rescue analgesia administered over a period of 6 h postoperatively. Before the surgery, patients were instructed in the use of VAS for pain assessment postoperatively where 0 cm defines no pain, and 10 cm defines the maximum intolerable pain. Patients with (VAS) &#x0003e;3 were given extra-analgesic doses in the form of 0.5 mg/kg pethidine intramuscularly. Assessment of sedation was according to sedation score where 0 = alert, 1 = sleepy and arousable by verbal command, 2 = sleepy and arousable by tactile stimulation and 3 = sleepy and arousable by painful stimulation.</p><p>Serum cortisol was measured by a fluorescence polarization immunoassay technology by the Abbott AxSYM system with the following reference ranges (morning serum cortisol 4.2-38.4 &#x003bc;g/dl) and evening serum cortisol 1.7-16.6 &#x003bc;g/dl). Serum cortisol level was measured 1 h postoperatively.</p><p>The general anesthesia technique was standardized for all the patients as well as monitors including 5 lead electrocardiography (ECG), noninvasive blood pressure (NIBP) monitor, pulse oximetry, and capnography after intubation using Datascope monitors. Neuromuscular function was also monitored using a peripheral nerve stimulator. After establishing an intravenous (IV) line, induction of general anesthesia with fentanyl (2 &#x003bc;g/dl) and sleeping dose of propofol followed by rocuronium (0.6 mg/kg) to facilitate orotracheal intubation was done. Anesthesia was maintained using sevoflurane in oxygen and air. Granisetron (1 mg IV) was given as a prophylactic antiemetic. At the end of the surgery, the residual neuromuscular paralysis was antagonized with neostigmine (0.05 mg/kg) and atropine (0.01 mg/kg). After satisfactory recovery, patients were extubated and transferred to the postanesthesia care unit where they were monitored with ECG, NIBP, and pulse oximetry.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Analysis of data</title><p>Using PASS for sample size calculation, it was calculated that a sample size of 22 patients per group will achieve 80% power to detect differences in the mean-time to 1<sup>st</sup> rescue analgesia of 90 min between the three groups with a standard deviation (SD) within a group assumed to be 41.77 using an <italic>F</italic> test with a 0.05000 significance level.
