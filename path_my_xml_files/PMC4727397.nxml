The polymorphisms of genes encoding drug-metabolizing enzymes can play a crucial role in the increased susceptibility of cancer patients to chemotherapy toxicity. Therefore, we plan to explore the effect of the genetic polymorphism of uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (<italic>UGT1A1</italic>) for irinotecan detoxification in mCRC patients. This trial will compare the clinical outcomes and side effects observed in mCRC patients treated with bevacizumab plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin/irinotecan (FOLFIRI) with and without <italic>UGT1A1</italic> genotyping and irinotecan dose escalation. A total of 400 mCRC patients were randomized into a study group and a control group.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>This trial is a prospective, multicenter, randomized clinical trial comparing <italic>UGT1A1</italic> promoter polymorphism for irinotecan dose escalation in mCRC patients administered with bevacizumab plus FOLFIRI as the first-line setting. The enrolled patients were randomly assigned to one of two groups, a study group and a control group, on the basis of receiving <italic>UGT1A1</italic> genotyping or not. The study group receive a biweekly FOLFIRI regimen, with irinotecan dose escalation based on <italic>UGT1A1</italic> genotyping; whereas the control group receive the conventional biweekly FOLFIRI regimen without <italic>UGT1A1</italic> genotyping.

Because of the limited treatment response of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) combined with leucovorin (LV), other therapeutic agents with different mechanisms can be considered, such as irinotecan, a potent inhibitor of topoisomerase I involved in unwinding the DNA during replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Bevacizumab, the first antiangiogenic agent approved for cancer treatment, is a humanized monoclonal antibody that inhibits tumor angiogenesis by blocking vascular endothelial growth factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Previous trials</title><p>Infusional FU or LV plus an irinotecan-based regimen (FOLFIRI) with bevacizumab has been widely used as a first-line treatment for patients with mCRC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Recently, a prospective analysis of uridine diphosphate glucuronosyl transferase 1A1 (<italic>UGT1A1</italic>) genotyping was reported to guide irinotecan dose escalation (FOLFIRI regimen) in combination with biweekly bevacizumab in a first-line treatment setting of mCRC patients and resulted in satisfactory therapeutic outcomes clinically [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Our previous retrospective study showed that the clinical response rate of patients with mCRC treated with FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab under <italic>UGT1A1</italic> genotyping and irinotecan dose escalation was significantly higher than that of those without <italic>UGT1A1</italic> genotyping and dose escalation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The two groups (conventional and escalated doses of irinotecan after <italic>UGT1A1</italic> genotyping) did not differ statistically regarding receiving prior surgery or the subsequent administration of 5-FU/LV/oxaliplatin adjuvant chemotherapy. The clinical response rate was significantly higher in the mCRC patients receiving <italic>UGT1A1</italic> genotyping and irinotecan dose escalation in advance than in those not receiving genotyping. The two groups did not differ significantly in grade 3/4 adverse events. Furthermore, the progression-free survival (PFS) was significantly higher in the patients with mCRC who received <italic>UGT1A1</italic> genotyping and irinotecan dose escalation before systemic treatment than in those who did not receive prospective <italic>UGT1A1</italic> genotyping, with a median PFS of 12.2&#x000a0;months versus 9.4&#x000a0;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>A prodrug that is converted into the active metabolite 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin (SN-38), irinotecan, is potently toxic to topoisomerase I in vivo, thus interrupting DNA replication in cancer cells and resulting in a high rate of cell death. SN-38 is further detoxified into its inactive metabolite, SN-38G, through glucuronidation by the enzyme uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) in the liver. The glucuronidation of SN-38 to SN-38G is the decisive step in the metabolism and detoxification of irinotecan. The number of repeats in the TATA box of the <italic>UGT1A1</italic> promoter alters <italic>UGT1A1</italic> activity, with six TA repeats representing the most common allele of the <italic>UGT1A1</italic> gene (<italic>UGT1A1</italic>*1, wild-type) and seven TA repeats representing a variant allele (<italic>UGT1A1</italic>*28, mutant type).</p><p>Reduced gene transcription and expression of <italic>UGT1A1</italic> are observed in individuals with the <italic>UGT1A1</italic>*28 variant; consequently, reduced SN-38 glucuronidation and increased irinotecan-related toxicity are well-established in mCRC patients with the <italic>UGT1A1</italic>*28 variant. <italic>UGT1A1</italic>*28 is considered the main predictor of toxicity in mCRC patients treated with irinotecan. The use of <italic>UGT1A1</italic> genotyping as a predictive marker of irinotecan-induced severe neutropenia or diarrhea has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration of the United States [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. However, no predictive marker exists for irinotecan-based chemotherapy in the treatment of mCRC. Hence, we will evaluate the efficacy and safety profile of FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab when the irinotecan dosage is adjusted on the basis of the blood <italic>UGT1A1</italic> genotype through a prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Objective</title><p>The primary objective is to implement a prospective, randomized multicenter trial to evaluate the efficacy of the FOLFIRI-plus-bevacizumab regimen with the irinotecan dosage adjusted on the basis of the <italic>UGT1A1</italic> genotype as measured by the PFS at 1&#x000a0;year. The secondary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of the FOLFIRI-plus-bevacizumab regimen with the irinotecan dosage adjusted on the basis of the <italic>UGT1A1</italic> genotype as measured by the objective response rate (ORR) and toxicities, and finally to measure overall survival (OS).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Hypothesis</title><p>On the basis of our previous study, we hypothesize that patients with mCRC who receive pretherapeutic <italic>UGT1A1</italic> genotyping and subsequent irinotecan dose escalation can achieve more favorable responses and outcomes without a significant increase in toxicity while using the FOLFIRI-plus-bevacizumab regimen.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Trial sites</title><p>The trial will be performed at 10 sites of the Colorectal Cancer Consortium, part of the Grant of Biosignature in Colorectal Cancers of the Academia Sinica in Taiwan.

Recently, Marcuello et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] conducted a genotype-directed dose-finding study on irinotecan in combination with fluorouracil/LV as a first-line treatment for advanced mCRC.</p><p>Genotyping and sequencing data have led to the discovery of over 100 variants within the promoter regions and coding sequence of the <italic>UGT1A</italic> genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Many of these variants exhibit allele frequencies of up to 40&#x02013;50&#x000a0;% in the general population, which are in linkage disequilibrium. However, a few variants are of sufficient frequency in the general population to be classified as polymorphisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Polymorphisms lead to different degrees of transcriptional and functional alterations, which may reduce UGT activity and result in the pathology of the affected individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>We conducted the current study, based on our previous retrospective investigation published in 2014 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], of which we had the prospective, randomized trial to obtain Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval in Taiwan. At that time there was no relevant information regarding <italic>UGT1A1</italic>*6 genotyping that could be used for directing dose escalation of irinotecan (trade name: Camptosar&#x000ae; other name: Camptothecin-11(CPT-11)) in Taiwanese mCRC patients. In fact, one recent study published by Kim et al<italic>.</italic> in 2015 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], Patients were genotyped for UGT1A1 and stratified according to the number of defective alleles (DA; *28 and *6) wherein they showed that the recommended doses were 300 (0 DA), 270 (1 DA) and 150 (0 DA) mg/m<sup>2</sup>. Conversely, there were no significant differences in the efficacy or toxicity of FOLFIRI between patients with the UGT1A1*1/*1 genotype and those with the UGT1A1*1/*6 or *1/*28 genotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Additionally, Maeda et al. had demonstrate that UGT1A1*6 A/A polymorphism were not statistically different between the Caucasian population and Asian populations (<italic>P</italic> value&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.0) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>Patients with homozygous polymorphism of the <italic>UGT1A1</italic> promoter (<italic>UGT1A1</italic>*28) were more frequently associated with severe toxicity following irinotecan treatment. The genotypes of the promoter polymorphism of the <italic>UGT1A1</italic> gene in our patients were either <italic>UGT1A1</italic> 6/6 or <italic>UGT1A1</italic> 6/7. Individuals who are homozygous for the <italic>UGT1A1</italic>*28 allele are at an increased risk of toxicity following the initiation of FOLFIRI treatment; a low initial dose should be considered for patients known to be homozygous for the <italic>UGT1A1</italic>*28 allele (seven repeats). Heterozygous patients (carriers of one variant allele and one wild-type allele, which results in intermediate <italic>UGT1A1</italic> activity) may be at an increased risk of toxicity; however, clinical results were variable, and such patients could tolerate the normal starting dose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Furthermore, the possible role of bevacizumab as a protective agent against irinotecan toxicity in these patients should be investigated. The addition of bevacizumab improved the pathological response and protection against hepatic injuries in patients treated with oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy for colorectal liver metastases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. This trial is performed to demonstrate the prognostic advantage of <italic>UGT1A1</italic> genotyping and irinotecan dose escalation before systemic chemotherapy to patients with mCRC.</p><p>In our previous study, a combination of bevacizumab and FOLFIRI as a first-line therapy for mCRC patients was retrospectively demonstrated to have a favorable response rate and acceptable toxicity. Nearly 70&#x000a0;% of the patients (55 of 79) with mCRC who had undergone pretherapeutic <italic>UGT1A1</italic> genotyping and received an escalated dose of irinotecan responded clinically to bevacizumab-plus-FOLFIRI chemotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Therefore, we are prospectively conducting a clinical trial to demonstrate that irinotecan dose escalation can achieve more favorable responses and outcomes without a significant increase in toxicities while using the FOLFIRI-plus-bevacizumab regimen. The use of novel genomic DNA analysis in our current study can achieve more favorable clinical outcomes for mCRC patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Trial status</title><p>The trial started in January 2015 and is expected to finish in December 2017.
