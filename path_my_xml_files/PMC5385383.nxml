However, it is not known whether this is also the case for elderly individuals. Thus, the present study tested the hypothesis that eccentric training of the knee extensors would improve physical function and health parameters (e.g., blood lipid profiles) of older adults better than concentric training. Healthy elderly men (60&#x02013;76 years) were assigned to either eccentric training or concentric training group (<italic>n</italic> = 13/group), and performed 30&#x02013;60 eccentric or concentric contractions of knee extensors once a week. The intensity was progressively increased over 12 weeks from 10 to 100% of maximal concentric strength for eccentric training and from 50 to 100% for concentric training. Outcome measures were taken before and 4 days after the training period. The results showed that no sings of muscle damage were observed after any sessions. Functional physical fitness (e.g., 30-s chair stand) and maximal concentric contraction strength of the knee extensors increased greater (<italic>P</italic> &#x02264; 0.05) after eccentric training than concentric training. Homeostasis model assessment, oral glucose tolerance test and whole blood glycosylated hemoglobin showed improvement of insulin sensitivity only after eccentric training (<italic>P</italic> &#x02264; 0.05). Greater (<italic>P</italic> &#x02264; 0.05) decreases in fasting triacylglycerols, total, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterols were evident after eccentric training than concentric training, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterols increased only after eccentric training. These results support the hypothesis and suggest that it is better to focus on eccentric contractions in exercise medicine.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>muscle damage</kwd><kwd>lengthening muscle contraction</kwd><kwd>senior functional fitness tests</kwd><kwd>insulin resistance</kwd><kwd>blood lipid profile</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100004663</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn001">99-2410-H-415-037-MY2</award-id><award-id rid="cn001">105-2410-H-003-052-MY3</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn002">Ministry of Education<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/100010002</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn002">105J2A0801</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="2"/><table-count count="2"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="48"/><page-count count="11"/><word-count count="9456"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introducion</title><p>Our daily physical activities and exercises consist of a combination of static (isometric), shortening (concentric), and lengthening (eccentric) muscle contractions, but eccentric contractions of the knee extensors are emphasized in some of the activities such as descending stairs or slopes and slowly sitting on a chair. One negative aspect of performing eccentric contractions is potential muscle damage characterized by delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) and a prolonged loss of muscle function (Clarkson et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">1992</xref>; Howatson and van Someren, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; G&#x000f3;mez-Cabello et al., <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Hody et al., <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Jamurtas et al., <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Greater muscle damage is induced when eccentric contractions are performed without prior experience or with a long interval from a previous exposure to similar eccentric contractions (Howatson and van Someren, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Hody et al., <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Hyldahl and Hubal, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Ciolac and Rodrigues-da-Silva, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). However, it has been shown that preconditioning exercise consisting of low-intensity eccentric contractions that do not induce any symptoms of muscle damage, is effective for attenuating severe muscle damage potentially induced by maximal eccentric exercise (Chen et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Thus, it is possible that eccentric exercise training can be prescribed without muscle damage by progressively increasing the intensity from very low to high. However, this has not been systematically investigated in previous studies, and no previous study has reported the effects of progressive resistance training on muscle damage in elderly individuals.</p><p>It has been reported that exercise training emphasizing on eccentric contractions (i.e., eccentric exercise training) increases muscle function (e.g., strength and power) and muscle mass greater when compared with concentric exercise training for young (Hortob&#x000e1;gyi et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>; Vikne et al., <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Paschalis et al., <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Elmer et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Vogt and Hoppeler, <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) and older individuals (Ploutz-Snyder et al., <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; LaStayo et al., <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Mueller et al., <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). For example, a classical study by Hortob&#x000e1;gyi et al. (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>) showed that isokinetic eccentric training in which consisted of 4&#x02013;6 sets of 8&#x02013;12 maximal eccentric contractions of the unilateral knee extensors performed 3 sessions per week over 12 weeks increased eccentric strength 3.5 times more, concentric strength similarly and type II fiber area 10 times more, when compared with maximal isokinetic concentric training. However, this was not necessarily found in other studies (Blazevich et al., <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Nickols-Richardson et al., <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Franchi et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). For example, Franchi et al. (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) reported that increases in maximal isometric strength and muscle mass, and muscle protein synthesis rate were similar between 4-week of eccentric and concentric training of the unilateral knee extensors when the relative intensity was matched (80% of 1RM eccentric and 80% of 1RM concentric, respectively). Thus, the superiority of eccentric to concentric exercise training is still controversial, but a recent review paper by Douglas et al. (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>) has concluded that eccentric resistance training is effective for improving muscle function to a greater extent than other modalities. It might be that eccentric exercise training does not require high-intensity contractions to induce such training effects, since relatively low-intensity eccentric contractions in eccentric cycling result in large muscle hypertrophy in elderly individuals (LaStayo et al., <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Gault and Willems (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) have stated that endurance eccentric exercises characterized by high mechanical force production at a low metabolic demand (e.g., eccentric cycling, downhill walking/running) are adequate for elderly adults with or without clinical conditions, to improve their quality of life and to reduce their risk of falls. To the best of our knowledge, no previous study has compared knee extensor eccentric vs. concentric exercise training to examine whether eccentric resistance training could improve muscle and physical function of elderly individuals greater than concentric resistance training, when the intensity is progressively increased.</p><p>Eccentric exercise training has also been shown to improve insulin sensitivity and blood lipid profiles. Zeppetzauer et al. (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) compared hiking upwards (concentric) and hiking downwards (eccentric) interventions for their effects on glucose and lipid profiles of healthy sedentary men and women, and found that the eccentric intervention resulted in significantly greater improvement of glucose tolerance and decrease in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDHC) per energy expenditure when compared with the concentric intervention. Paschalis et al. (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) reported that an 8-week eccentric resistance training but not concentric resistance training of the knee extensors performed once a week significantly improved resting insulin sensitivity and blood lipid profiles of young healthy untrained women. However, to the best of our knowledge, no previous study has compared eccentric and concentric knee extensors training for its effects on insulin sensitivity and blood lipid profiles of older adults.</p><p>Therefore, the present study investigated the effects of a 12-week progressive eccentric training in comparison to concentric training of the knee extensors on muscle function, functional physical fitness, insulin sensitivity and blood lipid profiles in elderly men. It was hypothesized that eccentric knee extensors training could be prescribed to elderly individuals without muscle damage by progressively increasing its intensity, and it would produce greater improvement of all of the outcome measures when compared with concentric knee extensors training.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Participants</title><p>Twenty-six healthy men over 60 years of age (60&#x02013;76 years) were recruited for this study. The sample size was estimated by G<sup>*</sup>Power (G<sup>*</sup>Power 3.1.9.2, Heinrich-Heine-Universit&#x000e4;t D&#x000fc;sseldorf, D&#x000fc;sseldorf, Germany; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gpower.hhu.de/">http://www.gpower.hhu.de/</ext-link>) based on an effect size of 0.2, an &#x003b1;-level of 0.05, and a power (1-&#x003b2;) of 0.80 for a possible difference in the increase in maximal voluntary isometric contraction torque of the knee extensors between groups. It showed that a minimum of 11 participants were necessary for each group, thus considering possible dropouts, 26 men were recruited in total.</p><p>The participants received physical examinations including blood tests at a local hospital, and were confirmed that they did not have any chronic conditions (e.g., hypertension, metabolic disorders, cardiovascular diseases), did not take any medications, and did not have any muscle, joint or bone injuries of the lower extremities. They had not performed any structured physical training program at least in the past 5 years, but they had been physically active such that they walked regularly at least three times a week for 50&#x02013;60 min per day. Their mean &#x000b1; SD age, height, body mass, body mass index, body fat assessed by an Inbody 3.0 Body Composition Analyzer (Biospace Co. Ltd., South Korea), maximal voluntary isokinetic (30&#x000b0;/s) concentric contraction torque and isometric contraction torque of the knee extensors torque were 65.9 &#x000b1; 4.7 years, 164.7 &#x000b1; 5.0 cm, 70.5 &#x000b1; 8.0 kg, 25.9 &#x000b1; 2.4 m/kg<sup>2</sup>, 25.5 &#x000b1; 2.9%, 120.4 &#x000b1; 10.3 Nm, and 151.0 &#x000b1; 12.0 Nm, respectively. They were quasi-randomly allocated to either eccentric training or concentric training group (<italic>n</italic> = 13 per group), with an attempt to match the average baseline maximal voluntary isometric contraction torque between the groups as much as possible. No significant differences in any of the physiological characteristics shown above were observed between the groups at baseline. All participants read and signed a written informed consent form to participate in the present study, which had been approved by the Institutional Review Board Committee at the National Chiayi University. The present study was conducted in conformity with the policy statement for the use of human subjects of the Declaration of Helsinki.</p><p>The participants were requested and reminded to avoid performing any vigorous physical activities or unaccustomed exercises, maintain their normal dietary and sleep habits, and not to take any anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g., non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent) and nutritional supplements (e.g., vitamins, protein/amino acids) for 2 weeks before and during the experimental period. They were instructed to drink sufficient water (at least 1.5 L/day) after each exercise session to avoid a potential risk of acute renal failure due to rhabdomyolysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Experimental design</title><p>The participants of the eccentric training group performed only eccentric contractions of the knee extensors and those of the concentric training group performed only concentric contractions of the knee extensors with load in the 12 training sessions that were held only once a week over 12 weeks as detailed below. Thus, the independent variable of the present study was the muscle contraction mode during the resistance training: eccentric vs. concentric contractions.</p><p>The participants were familiarized with the testing procedures a week before the first exercise session. In the familiarization session, measurements of height, body mass and body fat were taken, and upper thigh circumference, and muscle soreness were assessed. The participants practiced maximal isokinetic (30&#x000b0;/s) concentric contractions of the knee extensors, and functional physical fitness tests often used to assess senior adults, which consisted of 30-s chair stand, 2-min step, 8-foot up-and-go, one-leg stance test with eyes-opened, 6-m tandem walk, and 6-min walk. The investigator demonstrated the eccentric exercise of the knee extensors, but no eccentric contractions were performed by the participants in the familiarization session.</p><p>All of the measurements shown above were taken again at 5 and 3 days before the first training session to establish the test-retest reliability for the baseline, and 4 days after the last training session to evaluate the effects of training from various aspects. For these time points, blood samples were also taken for the measurements of insulin sensitivity and lipid profiles after 10-h overnight fasting. The details of the blood analyses are provided in a section below. To assess muscle damage, muscle soreness was assessed before, and 1, 2, and 3 days after every training session, and maximal voluntary isokinetic concentric contraction torque and maximal voluntary isometric contraction torque were measured before, immediately after, 2 and 4 days, and plasma creatine kinase activity were measured before, and 2 and 4 days after the first and last training sessions. All of these measures were the dependent variables of the study, and changes in the variables from before to after the 12-week training, and changes in muscle damage markers before and after sessions were compared between eccentric training and concentric training groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Training protocol</title><p>The participants performed a progressive eccentric training or concentric training of the knee extensors using a leg extension machine (Model: A957, Efit Sports Co. Ltd., Taiwan) once a week for 12 weeks. The knee extensors were targeted since they are one of the major muscles used in daily activities, and the exercise only requires a machine that most of exercise gyms probably have. To determine the weight to be loaded, one repetition maximal of concentric knee extension contraction (1RM) from 100&#x000b0; to 5&#x000b0; (where 0&#x000b0; corresponds to a knee full extended angle) was assessed with the hip joint angle being set at 70&#x000b0; flexion on the leg extension machine for each leg (Ben-Sira et al., <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>; Ploutz-Snyder et al., <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Tracy and Enoka, <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). In the 1RM assessment, the load was progressively increased considering an estimated 1RM, with a 3-min rest between trials, and when a given load was not lifted to 15&#x000b0; in two successive trials, the previous load was recorded as 1RM (Ben-Sira et al., <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>; Ploutz-Snyder et al., <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>). The participants were verbally encouraged to maximally activate their knee extensors during the 1RM measurement. The 1RM was measured every week to determine the load for the week, at ~1 h prior to each training session. If the 1RM measure showed a lower value than that of the previous week, the load of the previous week was used. The number of concentric contractions in the 1RM measure was 3&#x02013;5 for each leg for each training session, thus the total number of the concentric contractions over 12 weeks was 36&#x02013;60 per leg. This means that eccentric training group also performed concentric contractions, but the number of concentric contractions in comparison to eccentric contractions performed in the training (540 for each leg) was small.</p><p>The load was increased from 10 to 100% of 1RM for eccentric training group, and from 50 to 100% of 1RM for concentric training group progressively over 12 weeks, and each session consisted of 3 or 6 sets of 10 eccentric or concentric contractions (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). To complete an exercise session, it took 30 and 60 min for a session consisting of 3 sets and 6 sets, respectively. In eccentric training group, the participants were instructed to lower the weight from a knee extended position (10&#x000b0;) to a knee flexed position (100&#x000b0;) in 3 s, guided by the investigator who was an experienced trainer, who counted 0, 1, 2, 3 for the movement. After each eccentric contraction, the investigator returned the lever arm of the leg extension machine to the extended position, thus the participants performed concentric contraction without load (Chen et al., <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). In concentric training group, the participants were instructed to lift the weight from a knee-flexed position (100&#x000b0;) to a knee-extended position (10&#x000b0;) in 3 s, guided by the investigator who counted 0, 1, 2, 3 for the movement. After each concentric contraction, the investigator supported the lever arm of the leg extension machine at the end of range of motion (10&#x000b0;) and returned the lever arm to the flexed position not to make the participants perform eccentric contraction. The interval between contractions was 10 s, and a 3-min rest between sets was inserted (Chen et al., <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p><bold>Intensity and volume (set x number of contractions) during the 12-week progressive concentric and eccentric training of the knee extensors (1st&#x02013;12th week), and the total number of contractions (TNC) for each leg (x 2 means two legs) and total weight lifted by both legs (TWL) in the 12 weeks (mean &#x000b1;

Insulin sensitivity markers included resting serum glucose and insulin concentrations, homeostasis model assessment (HOMA), HbAlC and oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Serum glucose concentration was assayed by a Beckman Unicel DxC 600/800 Chemistry Analyzer (Beckman Coulter Unicel DxC 600/800 SYNCHRON Clinical System, Beckman Coulter Inc., Fullerton CA, USA) using a commercially available kit (GLUCm; Beckman Coulter Ireland Inc., Galway, Ireland). Serum insulin concentration was analyzed by an immunoradiometric assay kit (INS-IRMA kit; Biosource, Nivelles, Belgium) using a gamma counter system (MIC Group, Inc., MN, USA). HOMA was calculated as fasting insulin (&#x003bc;U&#x000b7;mL<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) x fasting glucose (mmol&#x000b7;L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>)/22.5 (Paschalis et al., <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>).

The results showed that (1) no DOMS was developed after any sessions and no significant changes in blood markers of muscle damage were found after the first and last training sessions, and changes in maximal voluntary concentric contraction torque were minor, (2) knee extensor muscle strength (1RM, maximal voluntary concentric and isometric contraction torque) and some of the functional physical fitness tests (i.e., 30-s chair stand, 8-foot up-and-go, one leg stance) improved greater for eccentric training group than concentric training group (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), and (3) all markers of insulin sensitivity and blood lipid profiles showed improvement after eccentric training, but this was limited after concentric training (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). These support the hypotheses, and suggest that it is better to focus on eccentric than concentric contractions in resistance exercises of elderly individuals. It should be noted that the frequency of the training was only once a week, and the significant improvement of the outcome measures was achieved after only 12 training sessions in which the intensity and volume were not necessary high especially for the first 4 weeks.</p><sec><title>Muscle damage</title><p>The first eccentric training or concentric training session in which low-intensity eccentric (10% of 1RM) or concentric (50% of 1RM) contractions were performed, respectively, did not result in large changes in maximal voluntary concentric contraction torque, visual analog scale of muscle soreness, and plasma creatine kinase activity. Previous studies also showed that low-intensity eccentric contractions did not induce any symptoms of muscle damage (Chen et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), and muscle damage was not induced by high-intensity concentric contractions (Overend et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>). Even after the 11th and 12th sessions in which maximal load based on 1RM was used, no indication of muscle damage was observed after eccentric training. This was probably due to the protective effect conferred by progressive overload started from very low-intensity, by which the knee extensors became resilient to eccentric contraction-induced muscle damage (Clarkson et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">1992</xref>; Howatson and van Someren, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Hyldahl and Hubal, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; LaStayo et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). It should be noted that none of the participants experienced DOMS after any of the training sessions. This might be a reason why all participants completed all 12 sessions.</p><p>The present study is the first to show that eccentric exercise training using a resistance training machine can be introduced to elderly people without muscle damage by progressively increasing the intensity and volume. It is important to note that the intensity was based on the 1RM concentric strength, and the load was 100% of 1RM for both groups at weeks 11 and 12. This was thought to be challenging especially for the concentric training group, but all participants were able to complete 6 sets of 10 contractions. This may be due to the effect of the progressive overload protocol, and the long interval between contractions (10 s) and between sets (3 min) seems to contribute to it. Generally speaking, eccentric 1RM is greater than concentric 1RM (Hortob&#x000e1;gyi et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>; Ploutz-Snyder et al., <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Roig et al., <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Nogueira et al., <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Douglas et al., <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Thus it is possible to increase the intensity further for the eccentric exercise training, and to impose greater stimulus to the muscles by increasing the intensity and volume (e.g., number of sets). It seems unlikely that severe muscle damage is induced by further increasing the intensity and volume, because of the protective effects already conferred from the previous training sessions. Thus, it is interesting to investigate whether greater effects of eccentric training on health and fitness parameters are observed, if the intensity is further increased based on eccentric strength.</p></sec><sec><title>Muscle function and functional physical fitness</title><p>Eccentric training increased 1RM by 49%, maximal voluntary concentric contraction torque by 18% and maximal voluntary isometric contraction torque by 31%, whereas the respective values for concentric training were 35, 10, and 19% (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). It is important to note that the magnitude of the increase in concentric strength (i.e., 1RM, maximal voluntary concentric contraction torque) was greater for eccentric training group than concentric training group, which does not necessarily follow the training principal of specificity. The greater increases in muscle strength after eccentric training group than concentric training group are consistent with the findings of previous studies (Hortob&#x000e1;gyi et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>; Vikne et al., <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Marcus et al., <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Paschalis et al., <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) in which sedentary young women, middle-aged men and women with type 2 diabetes mellitus, and sedentary young women were used, respectively. It is possible that the greater gain in muscle strength after eccentric training than concentric training was partially attributed to the greater muscle hypertrophy after eccentric training than concentric training. Unfortunately, the present study did not assess muscle cross sectional area or muscle fiber cross sectional area changes, although the thigh circumference showed a greater increase after eccentric training than concentric training. Previous studies (LaStayo et al., <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Mueller et al., <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Roig et al., <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Gault and Willems, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) showed greater muscle hypertrophy after eccentric than concentric training in elderly individuals. It should be noted that the 1RM test was performed before each training session, thus eccentric training group also performed submaximal and maximal concentric contractions of each leg over 12 weeks, and the total number of concentric contractions was 36&#x02013;60 for each leg. This might have contributed to the training effects, but this was also performed by concentric training group. Thus, the greater increases in muscle function for eccentric training group than concentric training group were most likely due to the eccentric contractions performed by eccentric training group. This suggests that eccentric training is more effective than concentric training to attenuate sarcopenia and dynapenia, which supports the statement of Hoppeler (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>) in his recent review paper that eccentric exercise training is effective for prevention and reduction of sarcopenia.</p><p>In addition to the greater improvement of muscle strength after eccentric training than concentric training, greater improvement of 30-s chair stand, 8-foot up-and-go and one-leg stand test was observed after eccentric training than concentric training (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). It should be noted that some of the functional physical fitness tests presented a large variability between days as reported in previous studies (Rikli and Jones, <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>; Nelson et al., <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Lark and Pasupuleti, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Fang et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Lee et al., <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), thus this needs to be taken into account for the interpretation of the results. However, it appears that the comparison between eccentric training and concentric training groups is still valid. It is not surprising that 30-s chair stand and 8-foot up-and-go increased more for eccentric training than concentric training group, because of the greater increase in knee extensors strength for eccentric training group than concentric training group (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). However, it is noteworthy that balance ability assessed by the one-leg stand test increased more after eccentric training than concentric training. It is possible that motor control is improved better by eccentric training than concentric training. Considering the increased risk of falling with aging, improving balance ability is important for older adults (LaStayo et al., <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Roig et al., <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Gault and Willems, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). It should be also noted that walking ability improved similarly between eccentric training and concentric training groups, suggesting that improving skeletal muscle function is the key to improve aerobic exercise ability (LaStayo et al., <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Marcus et al., <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Roig et al., <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Gault and Willems, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Insulin sensitivity and blood lipid profiles</title><p>The effects of eccentric training on insulin sensitivity and blood lipid profiles are striking such that all measures showed significantly greater improvement after eccentric training than concentric training, and the improvement of insulin sensitivity was found only for eccentric training group (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). A previous study reported that an 8-week of knee extensors eccentric training but not concentric training decreased resting glucose and insulin concentration, HOMA and HbA1C in young women (Paschalis et al., <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). The present study was the first to show that this was also the case for elderly men using a resistance training machine, and both studies suggest that eccentric exercise training is more effective than concentric exercise training to improve insulin sensitivity. It is important to note that muscle damage has been shown to negatively affect insulin sensitivity (Asp et al., <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>), but no indication of muscle damage was observed after any training sessions. It is not known why only eccentric exercise training improved insulin sensitivity. More studies are needed to explore the underpinning mechanisms.</p><p>Regarding blood lipid profiles, the present study showed that the decreases in TG, TC, and LDLC were greater, and the increase in HDLC was also greater after eccentric training than concentric training (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Paschalis et al. (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) showed that bilateral knee extensor eccentric training performed once a week for 8 weeks improved resting blood lipid profiles (TG: &#x02212;15%, TC: &#x02212;12%, HDLC: +11%, LDLC: &#x02212;24%) in young women. It is possible that eccentric contractions increase fatty acid oxidation as shown by Pe&#x000f1;ailillo et al. (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Paschalis et al. (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) speculated that the reduction in serum TC and LDLC after eccentric resistance training was due to the outflow of cholesterol from plasma into muscle, providing substrate for the synthesis of new cell membranes. It should be noted that HDLC increased only after eccentric training. It seems possible that eccentric training increased lipoprotein lipase activity in the adipose tissue and adipose tissue capillaries to better regulate lipid metabolism. Future studies are needed to investigate mechanisms underpinning how eccentric training improved blood lipid profiles better than concentric training.</p></sec><sec><title>Efficacy of eccentric exercise training</title><p>The eccentric exercise used in the present study is relatively easy to perform, but a knee extension machine is required. It is interesting to investigate whether other types of eccentric exercises such as downhill walking and stair descending that people can perform without special equipment could also induce similar effects to those found in the present study. It should be also investigated if the number of resistance exercises is increased such that not only knee extensors exercise but also other exercises (e.g., arm, shoulder, trunk exercises) are included, any greater effects on functional physical fitness, insulin sensitivity and blood lipid profiles will be produced. In the present study, there was no group of participants who performed both concentric and eccentric contractions. Generally, to perform eccentric contractions, concentric contractions are also required. It is interesting to investigate whether a combination of eccentric and concentric contractions in resistance exercise training is better than performing eccentric contractions without concentric contractions with load. In the present study, a control group without any training sessions was not included, but it is assumed that changes in the outcome parameters would have been small, if any. More research is warranted to establish more effective exercise prescription, but it can be said from the present study that focusing on eccentric contractions in exercises is important.</p><p>The present study only examined healthy elderly men for their responses to the knee extensor resistance training. It is necessary to replicate this study using female participants. Potentially, the advantages of eccentric exercise training can be applied to clinical populations. Mitchell et al. (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) have recently stated that the strong anabolic stimulation produced by eccentric exercise training benefits patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart failure, coronary artery disease, and type 2 diabetes, as well as survivors of breast, prostate and colon cancer, and neurological conditions including Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis and stroke, whilst not exceeding the compromised cardiorespiratory capacity of these patients. Further, studies are warranted to investigate if the eccentric exercise protocol used in the present study and other types of eccentric exercise can be applied effectively to these clinical populations.</p><p>To summarize, the present study showed that eccentric exercise training was more effective than concentric exercise training to improve health and fitness of elderly individuals, when the eccentric exercise intensity was carefully and progressively increased not to induce any muscle damage symptoms. It is noteworthy that the exercise training was performed only once a week, and the exercise time was 30 (3 sets)&#x02013;60 min (6 sets) a session. It appears that the magnitude of the eccentric exercise training effects on insulin sensitivity and blood lipid profiles are much greater than those normally found in pharmacological interventions that could cost more. Thus, it can be stated that eccentric training of the knee extensors is very cost-effective. It has been shown by previous studies that conventional resistance training is beneficial for elderly population to minimize and prevent sarcopenia that could lead to chronic diseases (Booth et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Pedersen and Saltin, <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Ciolac and Rodrigues-da-Silva, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). It is well documented that exercise is medicine and many chronic diseases can be prevented and treated by exercises (Pedersen and Saltin, <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). However, it has not been well recognized that eccentric exercise is more effective than concentric exercise for many aspects associated with health and fitness, thus eccentric exercise could be more effective medicine. The present study showed that eccentric contractions in resistance training should be focused more to maximize its benefits. Further, studies are necessary to investigate the mechanisms underpinning the superiority of eccentric contractions to concentric contractions for the improvement of muscle function, functional physical fitness, insulin sensitivity and blood lipid profiles.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Author contributions</title><p>All authors contributed to the data analysis and interpretation of the data, drafting and revising the manuscript, and approved the final version of the manuscript.
