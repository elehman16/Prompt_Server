Using data from two clinical trials, the aims of this post hoc analysis were to describe the phenomenology of bipolar mania in terms of AIA and depressive symptoms, and to evaluate the influence of these symptoms on the likelihood of remission during treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">Patients with a BD-I manic or mixed episode (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV criteria) were randomised to 3&#x000a0;weeks of double-blind treatment with asenapine, placebo, or olanzapine (active comparator). Anxiety was defined as a score of &#x02265;3 on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale &#x02018;anxiety&#x02019; item, irritability as a score of &#x02265;4 on the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) &#x02018;irritability&#x02019; item, and agitation as a score of &#x02265;3 on the YMRS &#x02018;increased motor activity&#x02013;energy&#x02019; item. Depressive symptoms were defined as a score of &#x02265;1 on three or more individual Montgomery&#x02013;&#x000c5;sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) items, or a MADRS Total score of &#x02265;20.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">A total of 960 patients with BD-I were analysed, 665 with a manic episode and 295 with a mixed episode. At baseline, 61.4% had anxiety, 62.4% had irritability, 76.4% had agitation, and 34.0% had all three AIA symptoms (&#x02018;severe AIA&#x02019;); 47.3% had three or more depressive symptoms, and 13.5% had a MADRS total score of &#x02265;20. Anxiety, irritability, and severe AIA (but not agitation) were statistically significantly more common in patients with depressive symptoms. Patients with anxiety or severe AIA at baseline were statistically significantly less likely to achieve remission (YMRS total &#x0003c;12). In general, remission rates were higher with asenapine and olanzapine than with placebo, irrespective of baseline AIA or depressive symptoms.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">Assessment of AIA symptoms in bipolar mania could enable physicians to identify patients with more severe depressive symptoms, allowing for appropriate intervention. Assessment and monitoring of AIA may help physicians to predict which patients may be harder to treat&#x000a0;and at risk for self-harm.</p><p>

Mixed states were described by Kraepelin in the early 20th century, and have been well characterised and operationally defined in the 100&#x000a0;years since (Kraepelin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">1921</xref>; Swann et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2013</xref>). The fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) defined a &#x02018;mixed episode&#x02019; as the coexistence of the full symptomatology of a manic and a depressive episode&#x02014;a restrictive, categorical approach that neglects those patients with subsyndromal depressive symptoms (Vieta and Valent&#x000ed; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2013</xref>; American Psychiatric Association <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">1994</xref>). Since the DSM-IV, studies have shown that this definition does not reflect clinical reality and that patients with bipolar disorder [as well as patients with major depressive disorder (MDD)] have a complex symptom presentation (Suppes et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2005</xref>; Vieta and Valent&#x000ed; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2013</xref>; Targum and Nierenberg <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2011</xref>). Consequently, the fifth edition of the DSM (DSM-5) changed to a dimensional approach for the diagnosis of BD-I (Vieta and Valent&#x000ed; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2013</xref>). The DSM-5 includes a &#x02018;with mixed features&#x02019; specifier that applies to a manic or hypomanic episode with three or more depressive symptoms (or, alternatively, to a depressive episode with three or more manic symptoms) (American Psychiatric Association <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2013</xref>). In a retrospective chart review, three times as many patients with bipolar disorder were diagnosed with mixed features using the DSM-5 criteria compared with the DSM-IV text revision (DSM-IV-TR) criteria for a mixed episode (Shim et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2015</xref>). In an observational study, around half of patients with DSM-IV bipolar mania did not meet the criteria for DSM-5 bipolar mania, due to the additional requirement of increased activity or energy levels (Machado-Vieira et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2017</xref>). However, 45% of these patients now met the DSM-5 criteria for a major depressive episode with mixed features, showing the value of the mixed features specifier for making diagnoses across the continuum of mood disorders (Machado-Vieira et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2017</xref>).</p><p id="Par18">Patients with BD-I mixed states have a worse clinical course than those with &#x02018;pure&#x02019; manic states, since they tend to experience more episodes, and since episodes are of longer duration (Swann et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2013</xref>). Mania with depressive symptoms is also associated with a high rate of comorbid conditions, such as anxiety disorders and substance abuse (Swann et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2013</xref>). These patients are harder to treat and physicians of patients meeting the DSM-5 criteria for mania &#x02018;with mixed features&#x02019; report greater treatment dissatisfaction than do physicians of patients without mixed features (Swann et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2013</xref>; Young and Eberhard <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2015</xref>). Furthermore, there is a higher risk of suicidality among patients with mixed features; these patients are more likely to have made at least one suicide attempt during their lifetime, and during their current manic episode, compared with patients without mixed features (Swann et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2013</xref>; Young and Eberhard <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2015</xref>). Thus, the presence of depressive symptoms during a manic episode is indicative of a more severe form of BD-I.</p><p id="Par19">The symptoms observed in manic episodes and depressive episodes are not mutually exclusive, with anxiety, irritability, and agitation (AIA), for example, occurring in both mania and depression. Since they are not specific to either pole, AIA symptoms are not included in the DSM-5 &#x02018;with mixed features&#x02019; specifier (Cassidy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2010</xref>; Koukopoulos et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2013</xref>). [Anxiety is, however, covered by the DSM-5 &#x02018;with anxious distress&#x02019; specifier (American Psychiatric Association <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2013</xref>)]. According to physicians, AIA symptoms show an increased prevalence, and greater severity, in patients with mixed features in BD-I mania compared with those without mixed features (Young and Eberhard <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2015</xref>). Similarly, in an online survey, patients with mania with depressive symptoms self-reported the combination of &#x02018;anxiety or worry&#x02019; and &#x02018;irritability or agitation&#x02019; more frequently than those without depressive symptoms (Vieta et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2014</xref>). A recent prospective study from the Stanley Bipolar Network found increased irritability in bipolar patients with mixed depression compared with pure depression (Miller et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2016</xref>). Due to their high frequency among such patients, AIA symptoms could potentially be used as indicators (albeit non-specific indicators) to aid physicians in the identification of patients whose mania is complicated by depressive symptoms.</p><p id="Par20">Using data from two pivotal, randomised, placebo-controlled asenapine trials, the aims of the present post hoc analysis were (1) to describe the phenomenology of bipolar mania in terms of AIA and depressive symptoms, (2) to evaluate if the presence of AIA and depressive symptoms can be used to predict non-remission, and (3) to evaluate the effect of asenapine, placebo, and olanzapine on remission in patients with AIA, and in patients with depressive symptoms.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par21">This was a post hoc analysis of patient-level data from two 3-week, randomised, placebo-controlled trials (ARES 7501004 and ARES 7501005; ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers NCT00159744 and NCT00159796, respectively) of asenapine in patients with BD-I experiencing an acute DSM-IV manic or mixed episode (McIntyre et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2010</xref>).

In brief, eligible patients were aged &#x02265;18&#x000a0;years with a current DSM-IV diagnosis of BD-I. Patients were required to have a manic or mixed episode that began in the 3&#x000a0;months prior to screening, a Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS; Young et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">1978</xref>). Total score of &#x02265;20 at screening and baseline, and a documented history of at least one previous moderate-to-severe mood episode, with or without psychotic features. Patients were excluded if they had a primary diagnosis other than BD-I, a psychotic disorder, rapid-cycling bipolar disorder, or substance abuse or dependence.</p><p id="Par23">Eligible patients entered a single-blind placebo run-in (washout) period of up to 7&#x000a0;days in an inpatient treatment centre. Following the run-in period, patients were randomised in a 2:1:2 ratio to 3&#x000a0;weeks of double-blind treatment with oral asenapine (20&#x000a0;mg on Day 1, flexible-dose 10 or 20&#x000a0;mg/day thereafter; dose divided across morning and evening), placebo, or olanzapine (15&#x000a0;mg on Day 1, flexible-dose 5&#x02013;20&#x000a0;mg thereafter; once daily). Patients remained in the inpatient centre for at least the first 7&#x000a0;days of treatment, after which they could complete the trial as outpatients if they were deemed stable and suitable for discharge by the investigator. Benzodiazepines (lorazepam &#x02264;4&#x000a0;mg/day for agitation; temazepam &#x02264;30&#x000a0;mg/day for insomnia; or others with comparable half-lives) were permitted for the first 7&#x000a0;days of treatment only.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Assessments</title><p id="Par24">In the two primary studies, efficacy was assessed using psychiatric rating scales including the YMRS, the Clinical Global Impressions-Bipolar version (CGI-BP; Spearing et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">1997</xref>; Guy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">1976</xref>), the Montgomery&#x02013;&#x000c5;sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS; Montgomery and &#x000c5;sberg <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">1979</xref>), and the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS; Kay et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">1987</xref>).

</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par41">This post hoc analysis of two randomised, controlled trials revealed that symptoms of anxiety, irritability, and agitation were present in around two-thirds-to-three-quarters of patients with BD-I mania. In addition, around a third of patients had all three AIA symptoms. While different studies have defined the presence of AIA symptoms in different ways, there is agreement in the literature that AIA symptoms are common among patients with BD-I mania (Hantouche et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2006</xref>; Vieta et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2014</xref>; Young and Eberhard <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2015</xref>).</p><p id="Par42">The present analysis also showed that half of patients with BD-I mania had at least three depressive symptoms, whereas less than one in seven patients had a MADRS Total score of &#x02265;20. A previous post hoc analysis in the same dataset found that 4&#x02013;34% of patients met proxy criteria for the DSM-5 &#x02018;with mixed features&#x02019; specifier, depending on the severity cut-offs used (McIntyre et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2013a</xref>). In general, the incidence of depressive symptoms among bipolar disorder patients with mania is around 30&#x02013;40%, though the incidence varies widely according to how the presence of depressive symptoms is defined (McElroy et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">1992</xref>; Akiskal et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1998</xref>; Hantouche et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2006</xref>; Azorin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2009</xref>; Vieta et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2014</xref>; Young and Eberhard <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2015</xref>; McIntyre et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2015</xref>). In a prospective study of patients with bipolar hypomania, the likelihood of having depressive symptoms was significantly greater for women (72%) than for men (42%) (Suppes et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2005</xref>).</p><p id="Par43">With regard to the relationship between AIA and depressive symptoms, the analysis showed that anxiety, irritability, and the AIA combination&#x02014;but not agitation alone&#x02014;were more common in patients with depressive symptoms at baseline. This replicates the findings of a naturalistic study, in which anxiety and irritability were more common in BD-I patients with three or more depressive symptoms, whereas agitation was not (Young and Eberhard <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2015</xref>). Thus, anxiety and irritability, and the combination of all three AIA symptoms, could potentially be used as non-specific indicators, or &#x02018;gateway symptoms&#x02019;, to help psychiatrists identify bipolar mania with depressive symptoms (Eberhard and Weiller <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2016</xref>). At present, the DSM-5 does not highlight or discuss AIA symptoms in the &#x02018;with mixed features&#x02019; specifier section. Future iterations of the DSM may want to consider how to discuss the findings of this study and related studies in terms of the mixed specifier. While our findings are not definitive, given the retrospective nature of these analyses and limits of the studies themselves, they do highlight the need for further assessment of the best components to make up the mixed specifier for future DSM-5 editions.</p><p id="Par44">These results support the importance of assessing carefully any patient presenting with significant anxiety, irritability, and agitation for underlying symptoms of depression, especially during mania or hypomanic episodes. While it is routine practice to administer depression scales in some settings, this is not universal. The presence of these symptoms supports that it is a time to review carefully whether they herald less visible symptomology that could inform both clinical care and address patient concerns such as self-harm. As noted in a recent article by Sol&#x000e9; and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2017</xref>) and consistent with the findings reported here, indicators of mixity may be key to appropriate treatment choices and addressing suicide prevention effectively (Sol&#x000e9; et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2017</xref>).</p><p id="Par45">Of interest, a recent pilot study examined the use of actigraphy to assess prediction for different bipolar clinical states including mania, depression, and mixed (Scott et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2017</xref>). In this small sample with 24&#x000a0;h of observation, the researchers were able to predict with 79% accuracy which state a subject was experiencing (Scott et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2017</xref>). It is to be hoped these types of objective measures may assist us to understand, prevent, and treat mixed symptoms more efficiently.</p><p id="Par46">The presence of anxiety in patients with bipolar disorder has previously been associated with a longer time to remission (Feske et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2000</xref>). The present analysis extended this observation&#x02014;showing that patients with anxiety or a combination of all three AIA symptoms are less likely to achieve remission than those without the corresponding symptom(s). Thus, these data support the notion that AIA symptoms identify a more severe or complicated phenotype of mania that is less likely to respond to treatment.</p><p id="Par47">Similarly, patients with three or more depressive symptoms were less likely to achieve remission, although this outcome did not meet the criteria for statistical significance. However, patients with a MADRS Total score of &#x02265;20 showed similar remission rates to those below this depression threshold. The previous post hoc analysis in this same dataset also found that the remission rate (defined as a YMRS Total score of &#x02264;12) was not influenced by the number or severity of depressive symptoms (with the exception of the most severely depressed patients, who showed a <italic>higher</italic> remission rate) (McIntyre et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2013a</xref>). It may be that those patients who are the most ill may also be the most responsive to the medications under study; and thus most likely to show a larger degree of improvement.</p><p id="Par48">In BD-I (unlike in MDD) there has been relatively little prior investigation into whether patient characteristics (including AIA) within an episode can affect treatment response and other health outcomes (Feske et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2000</xref>). A recent analysis showed that the presence of AIA symptoms raises the already high suicide risk among patients with BD-I mania with depressive symptoms (Eberhard and Weiller <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2016</xref>). Additionally, a subtype of bipolar depression, characterised by anxiety and irritability among other symptoms, is associated with a greater likelihood of receiving government financial support, suggesting that this pattern of symptoms is particularly malignant (Perich et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2016</xref>). From a clinical point of view, given the hazards associated with&#x000a0;AIA, clinicians should routinely probe for AIA, and should systematically target these symptoms with treatment. In MDD, for example, many physicians reserve adjunctive antipsychotics for use in patients presenting with agitation or irritability, among other symptoms (McIntyre and Weiller <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2015</xref>). Furthermore, the 2015 update to the Florida Best Practice Psychotherapeutic Medication Guidelines provides different algorithms for the treatment of MDD according to the presence or absence of mixed features (University of South Florida <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2015</xref>); this is an unmet need for BD-I.</p><p id="Par49">In the present analysis, both asenapine and olanzapine demonstrated higher remission rates (defined as a YMRS score of &#x0003c;12) than placebo among patients with AIA symptoms. A more stringent definition of remission was also considered (a YMRS score of &#x0003c;8); remission rates were low (&#x0003c;25%) with this definition regardless of treatment, demonstrating the difficulty in reducing symptoms to this level over such a short time period. Asenapine and olanzapine also showed consistent benefits over placebo in terms of mean change from baseline in YMRS Total score among patients with anxiety and all three AIA symptoms. In general, second-generation antipsychotics are efficacious in the treatment of mixed episodes with predominant manic symptoms, and have been described as the treatment of choice in the management of bipolar disorder mixed states (Muralidharan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2013</xref>; Fagiolini et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2015</xref>). In mania with DSM-5 mixed features, asenapine, aripiprazole, and olanzapine have been evaluated and have shown efficacy as potential treatment options (McIntyre et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2013a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">b</xref>; Tohen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2014</xref>).</p><p id="Par50">In line with considerations of best treatment choices, a range of guideline efforts for the treatment of bipolar disorder have recently been developed (Stahl et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2017</xref>; Fountoulakis et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2016</xref>; Goodwin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2016</xref>) or are in revision, such as the CANMAT guidelines (Yatham et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2013</xref>). The importance of the results reported in this present post hoc analysis is highlighted as the best definition for mixed symptoms is sought and the understanding of the implications for treatment and course of illness is developed. It is clear from both past and more recent efforts that mixed symptoms herald a more severe course of illness, but the optimal definition is still under enquiry (Swann et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2013</xref>; Barbuti et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2017</xref>).</p><p id="Par51">This present study is limited in that it is a post hoc analysis of studies that were not designed for this purpose. In particular, as these were regulatory studies, patients with current suicidality or complex comorbidities were excluded from study entry, thus limiting generalizability. In terms of study design, participants were inpatients for at least the first week of treatment, which may have selected for agitation. The results may also have been influenced by the use of benzodiazepines for agitation. Benzodiazepines were not permitted beyond Day 7 of treatment; however, 131 patients (13.6%) in the FAS received one or more doses of benzodiazepines beyond Day 7. The use of proxies for AIA and depressive symptoms was another limitation of the analysis&#x02014;especially for agitation, which was based on the YMRS increased motor activity&#x02013;energy item because no agitation item was available. Since irritability and agitation were based upon YMRS items, they were not independent with regard to YMRS remission. It is important to keep in mind that this proxy for depression symptoms (MADRS &#x02265;3), and thus potential mixed symptoms, does not itself assess for the DSM-5 Mixed Specifier criteria and must be viewed as a limit of the study design. Finally, the analysis does not rule out the possibility of pseudospecificity: that AIA and depressive symptoms are discrete, overlapping phenomena.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par52">Assessment of AIA symptoms in bipolar mania could enable physicians to identify patients with more severe depressive symptoms&#x000a0;and who may be at increased risk of suicide, allowing for appropriate intervention. Furthermore, assessment and monitoring of AIA may help physicians to predict which patients may be harder to treat.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>AIA</term><def><p id="Par5">anxiety, irritability, and agitation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ANCOVA</term><def><p id="Par6">analysis of covariance</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BD-I</term><def><p id="Par7">bipolar I disorder</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CGI-BP</term><def><p id="Par8">Clinical Global Impressions-Bipolar version</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DSM</term><def><p id="Par9">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FAS</term><def><p id="Par10">full analysis set</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MADRS</term><def><p id="Par11">Montgomery&#x02013;&#x000c5;sberg Depression Rating Scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MDD</term><def><p id="Par12">major depressive disorder</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PANSS</term><def><p id="Par13">Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SD</term><def><p id="Par14">standard deviation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SE</term><def><p id="Par15">standard error</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>YMRS</term><def><p id="Par16">Young Mania Rating Scale</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>OL performed the statistical analyses.
