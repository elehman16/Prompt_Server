In addition, reduction of the MTX dose to 4&#x02005;mg/week was permitted at the investigator's discretion. All patients received concomitant oral folic acid 5&#x02005;mg/week. Patients who experienced a &#x0003e;20% increase from baseline in tender and swollen joint counts at weeks 12, 16 or 20 were to discontinue blinded treatment with adalimumab or placebo and were eligible for open-label rescue treatment with adalimumab 40&#x02005;mg every other week.</p><p>The primary endpoint was inhibition of radiographic progression assessed as the change from baseline (&#x00394;) in modified total Sharp score (mTSS) at week 26.

This is the first description of a clinical trial of anti-TNF therapy+MTX versus MTX alone in MTX-naive Japanese patients with early RA and high disease activity. It is also the first randomised trial evaluating the efficacy of anti-TNF therapy+low-dose MTX versus low-dose MTX alone for the inhibition of radiographic progression in any patient population. This study extends observations from Western studies of adalimumab by demonstrating the superiority of adalimumab+MTX to MTX alone for the inhibition of radiographic progression and improvement in clinical outcomes in Japanese patients with early RA. Moreover, the combination of adalimumab+MTX significantly improved a wide array of clinical and functional disease activity measures and responses versus MTX alone, with improvements observed as early as the first assessment (week 2) and maintained through the 26-week double-blind trial.</p><p>Following 26&#x02005;weeks of treatment, the mean &#x00394;mTSS (primary endpoint) in adalimumab+MTX patients (1.48) in the current study was significantly smaller than observed in MTX alone patients (2.38). In addition, a similar trend in inhibition of radiographic progression in patients with early RA was observed in the OPTIMA study, with a smaller mean &#x00394;mTSS in adalimumab+MTX patients (0.15) versus MTX alone patients (0.96; p&#x0003c;0.001).<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> The difference between the two treatment groups (0.8) at week 26 was similar to the difference observed in the current study (0.9 (observed)).<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Furthermore, baseline characteristics, including RA duration, in the two studies were generally similar, but the OPTIMA study had a lower percentage of previous DMARD use.</p><p>A similar trend in inhibition of radiographic progression in the current study was observed in the PREMIER study, with a smaller mean &#x00394;mTSS in adalimumab+MTX patients (0.8) versus MTX alone patients (3.5; p&#x0003c;0.001). However, the mean difference in radiographic progression between the two treatments groups, although statistically significant, was smaller in the current study (0.9 (observed); 2.0 (LE)) than in the PREMIER study (2.7).</p><p>In the current study, the SD for the mean &#x00394;mTSS at week 26 was generally high. When the median &#x00394;mTSS was compared using observed data, results were in good agreement between the PREMIER study (0.0 (adalimumab+MTX) vs 1.3 (MTX alone); data on file) and the current study (0.0 (adalimumab+MTX) vs 1.0 (MTX alone)). Alternatively, the smaller difference in improvement observed in the current study may also be related to the mTSS scoring method used, but this seems unlikely because only two joints assessed in PREMIER were omitted from scoring in the present analysis. The mean duration of RA was also shorter in the current study (0.3&#x02005;years) versus the PREMIER study (0.7&#x02013;0.8&#x02005;years), although the percentage of patients who had previously taken DMARDs was higher (43.3&#x02013;53.4% vs 31.5&#x02013;32.5%). There were also slight differences in mean baseline tender and swollen joint counts and CRP levels, which were higher in the PREMIER study and considered related to the longer duration of RA at baseline versus the current study. Furthermore, the MTX dose of 6&#x02013;8&#x02005;mg/week, although consistent with the dosage commonly administered in Japan at the time the study was conducted, was substantially lower than that commonly administered in Western countries (eg, 15&#x02013;20&#x02005;mg/week). In the PREMIER study, MTX was initiated at 7.5&#x02005;mg/week, increased to 15&#x02005;mg/week during weeks 4&#x02013;8, and increased to 20&#x02005;mg/week starting at week 9. In addition, the mean MTX dose during the 26&#x02005;weeks of the current study was significantly lower in the adalimumab+MTX group (6.2&#x000b1;0.8&#x02005;mg/week) versus the MTX alone group (6.6&#x000b1;0.6&#x02005;mg/week; p&#x0003c;0.001), thereby potentially impacting the &#x00394;mTSS and thus the maximal difference observed between the two treatment groups. Therefore, these multiple differences may have contributed to the small difference in radiographic outcomes between the current study and the PREMIER study. Whether the difference in radiographic outcomes can be explained by differences between Japanese and Western populations remains unclear, although this seems unlikely. Longer-term studies may help elucidate potential differences in outcomes.</p><p>Since this study was conducted, the maximum approved MTX dosage in Japan has been increased from 8 to 16&#x02005;mg/week in patients with RA. Therefore, this study provides important information on the efficacy of low-dose MTX and anti-TNF therapy versus low-dose MTX alone for the inhibition of radiographic progression. Data suggest that patients with early RA who may not tolerate higher doses of MTX will likely benefit from adalimumab+low-dose MTX combination therapy.</p><p>Given the lower MTX dose prescribed, one could question whether we might only be seeing natural progression in the MTX only arm. It is ethically difficult to include a true placebo arm in clinical trials of &#x02265;6&#x02005;months duration for early active RA, particularly when MTX is recommended as first-line therapy to achieve clinical remission/low disease activity. Although an important question to ponder, a placebo arm in long-term clinical trials in early active RA appears to be unrealistic, and further research using highly sensitive and reproducible imaging techniques during a short-term placebo-treatment period in early active RA is warranted.</p><p>It is also important to note that the current patient population had severe baseline symptoms, including baseline erosions, despite only several months since RA onset. This scenario is becoming increasingly less common in Western populations due to treat-to-target recommendations and earlier intervention. In Japan, general practitioners are still seeing many early RA patients and referrals to rheumatologists are often delayed. In addition, the diagnosis of RA in this trial was based upon 1987 classification criteria. Thus, these factors may have played a role in the conundrum of more severe baseline clinical symptoms yet shorter mean disease duration.</p><p>The clinical results of the current study are supported by the HARMONY study, which retrospectively determined the effectiveness and safety of adalimumab 40&#x02005;mg every other week with or without MTX (mean dose, 8.5&#x02005;mg/week) in Japanese patients with RA (mean RA duration, 9.0&#x000b1;9.5&#x02005;years) with or without prior biologic treatment.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Although patients in the HARMONY study had more established disease and the study design was retrospective, adalimumab+MTX patients (n=143) had an improvement from baseline in DAS28-ESR score at week 24 (baseline, 5.3; week 24, 3.3), which was within the range but slightly smaller than the improvement observed in the current study at week 26 (baseline, 6.6; week 26, 3.7; see online supplementary figure 1A). Clinical remission rates for adalimumab+MTX patients were also comparable between the HARMONY study (week 24, 35.0%) and the current study (week 26, 31.0%).</p><p>The safety profile of the current study was generally consistent with those in previous clinical studies of adalimumab in patients with RA conducted in Japan.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14&#x02013;16</xref> There were no reports of demyelination, tuberculosis or malignancy, and there were no statistically significant differences in the incidence of serious AEs, serious infections, opportunistic infections or lupus-like reactions between adalimumab+MTX patients versus MTX alone patients. There was a significantly higher incidence of injection-site reactions for adalimumab+MTX patients versus MTX alone patients, but the incidence (10.5%) was similar to that reported for the 167 adalimumab&#x000b1;MTX patients in the HARMONY study (12.0%). The incidence of injection-site reactions in both of these studies was lower than the 30.8% reported for the 91 adalimumab monotherapy patients (40&#x02005;mg every other week) in the CHANGE study,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> possibly related to the immunosuppressive effects of concomitant MTX in the current study and in some of the patients in the HARMONY study.</p><p>In the multivariate regression analyses (see online supplementary table 1), lower baseline CRP level was identified as a predictor of radiographic non-progression in adalimumab+MTX patients, whereas normal baseline CRP level (&#x02264;0.3&#x02005;mg/dl) appeared to have an increased likelihood of radiographic non-progression. However, no baseline predictors appeared to predict both the lack of progression and clinical remission. Furthermore, baseline mTSS was not an independent predictor for either treatment group in this study.</p><p>Overall, adalimumab+MTX was well tolerated in Japanese patients with early RA with no new safety signals and with a safety and tolerability profile similar to that observed in Western populations. Administration of adalimumab in combination with MTX was efficacious in improving radiographic and clinical responses in MTX-naive patients with early RA, high disease activity and poor prognostic factors (eg, rheumatoid factor positive or with baseline erosive damage) through week 26. Given its radiographic, clinical and functional superiority versus MTX monotherapy, consideration should be given to administration of anti-TNF-&#x003b1; and MTX combination therapy in patients with early RA and high disease activity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Web appendix</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="annrheumdis-2012-202433-s1.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e998" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><caption><title>Web figure</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="tif" xlink:href="annrheumdis-2012-202433-s2.tif" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e1003" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank all the patients, investigators and support staff who participated in the study, Sourav Santra, PhD, formally of Abbott, who provided statistical support, and Mary Beth C.
