rhythm (To-balance) exercises on the mental and physical functions of the elderly
requiring low level care. [Subjects] A total of 29 elderly persons requiring level 2
assistance to level 2 who were and using outpatient care services participated in this
study. [Methods] The participants were randomly allocated to 2 groups: To-balance, and
Sitting. The former group performed individualized and To-balance group exercises, while
the latter group performed individualized exercise, as well as group exercise while
sitting on a chair. The effects were evaluated through somatometric, physical fitness, and
mental function measurements before and 3, 6, and 9 months after the initiation of the
intervention. [Results] The lower-limb muscle strength and mental function significantly
improved in both groups. Particularly, in the To-balance group, early improvement in
balance and gait ability were observed. [Conclusion] The To-balance exercise may be useful
for quickly improving the elderly&#x02019;s static balance ability.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Elderly persons</kwd><kwd>Rhythm exercises</kwd><kwd>Balance ability</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The total population of Japan has been decreasing since 2011. In 1970, the proportion of
the elderly was 4.9%. It has increased to 25.2% in 2013, and it is expected to reach 40.5%
in 2055. Japan will become a super-aged society in the future, with 1 in 2.5 people aged 65
and over. In the 5&#x02005;years following the adoption of the Long-term Care Insurance System, the
number of elderly people requiring assistance and low levels (level 1) of care markedly
increased. Also, when the Long-Term Care Insurance Act was revised in April 2006, a new
category of prevention benefits was added, with a view to promoting independence and
preventing care dependency among the elderly requiring assistance. In terms of the new
category of prevention benefits, it is crucial to prevent motor function from decreasing to
maintain the independence of the elderly. Since Fiatarone<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup> reported the effects of muscle training for very old individuals,
the trainability of elderly people has been widely recognized. Similarly, the effects of
exercise-based intervention on an aging population have been examined on a worldwide basis
from diverse viewpoints in previous studies<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Exercise-based approaches for the elderly may be classified into 2 major categories:
individualized, and group. In addition to the effects of individualized approaches<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup> and the usefulness of group exercises<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>,
the appropriateness of intervention combining them has recently been reported<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Helbostad et al. reported individual exercise is effective at improving the physical
function of the elderly over the age of 75<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Yokoyama et al. performed a similar comparison, and emphasized the
usefulness of group exercise in improving mental function and its necessity in forming
exercise habits<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Nakagawa et al. also
compared individual and group exercises, and reported that combined exercise improved
balance ability in a static standing posture and mental function<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, the effects of exercise-based intervention,
focused on improvement of balance ability, as well as the long-term impact of group exercise
on mental and physical function, have not yet been fully examined. Furthermore, the effects
of intervention combining individualized and group exercises have mainly been examined using
general specific groups of elderly people, rather than those requiring assistance or low
levels of care. Under these circumstances, it may be necessary to examine the current status
of therapeutic exercises and review their effects.</p><p>Province and Whipple et al. recommended rhythm exercises for improving the balance ability
of the elderly<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Whipple also described the components of balance training as
movements sufficiently supporting the body weight, fast horizontal movements, and large
vertical movements, and concluded that they are easy to include in rhythm exercises<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>A previous study examining the mental function, of the elderly have reported a sense of
isolation and anxiety are experienced by approximately 60% of elderly people, confirming
that isolation is a factor closely associated with depression<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Another report suggested that the association between the mental
and physical functions may be stronger in the elderly than in other age groups, and the more
severe the sense of isolation, the lower the activity level<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Furthermore, Fader et al. reported that group exercise is more
effective than individualized exercise at motivating participants since it creates feelings
of joy, satisfaction, and fulfilment<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Based on these findings, we previously developed a group rhythm exercise called To-balance
exercise (&#x0201c;To&#x0201d; in the &#x0201c;To-balance&#x0201d; means &#x0201c;to balance&#x0201d;), and examined the effects of 6 month
intervention based on it. Lower-limb muscle strength, balance and gait abilities, and mental
function significantly improved through the intervention combining individualized and
To-balance exercises; however, the long-term effects of this intervention have rarely been
examined. Considering this situation, in this study we examined the long-term effects of an
intervention combining individualized and To-balance exercises, and 3 months withdrawal from
the latter exercise, on the mental and physical functions of elderly subjects receiving low
level care.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>A total of 29 (13 males and 16 females; mean age: 78.6&#x000b1;6.6) elderly persons requiring
level 2 assistance to level 2 care who were using outpatient care services participated in
this study. The inclusion criteria were as follows: ability to independently walk (with or
without a cane or prosthesis); not requiring assistance to perform daily activities;
ability to comprehend oral explanations about the exercises; absence of pain possibly
requiring withdrawal from exercises, or fast-advancing progressive or unstable chronic
disease; or a history of myocardial infarction or lower-limb fracture within the last 6
months. To confirm the effects of the intervention, the 29 participants were randomly
allocated to 2 groups: To-balance (15); and Sitting (14). The former group performed
individualized and To-balance group exercises, while the latter group performed
individualized exercise, as well as group exercise while sitting on a chair. The basic

and the Epidemiologic and Clinical Research Ethics Committee of Fujita Health University
after obtaining the participants&#x02019; consent.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The effects of intervention on the To-balance and Sitting groups were evaluated by
conducting somatometric and physical fitness measurements, and a questionnaire survey for
mental function 4 times: before, and 3, 6, and 9 months after the initiation of
intervention. During the final 3-month period, group exercise was not performed by either
group to examine the negative influence of withdrawal from it on the subject&#x02019;s mental and
physical functions.</p><p>The items of somatometric measurement were height (cm), body weight (kg), and body mass
index (BMI). For the physical fitness measurements grip strength (kg/W), was measured
using a digital grip dynamometer (Grip D, Takei Scientific Instruments Co., Ltd.), and
maximum isometric knee extension force (knee strength; N/W), was measured using a
hand-held dynamometer (Hoggan Health Industries). Single-leg standing time with the eyes
open (sec), the Timed Up &#x00026; Go (TUG; sec), and comfortable and maximum gait speeds
(m/min) were measured using standard procedures. Mental function was measured using the
36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36). The SF-36 assesses health-related QOL, and is
comprised of the following 8 sub-scales: physical function, role-physical, bodily pain,
social function, general health, vitality, role-emotional, and mental health. Total scores
were calculated for each sub-scale and converted into deviation values based on national
standards for comparison and analysis.</p><p>The intervention consisted of 3 exercises: an individualized exercise program developed
by Nakagawa et al.<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>, the To-balance
exercise, and a conventional group exercise which was performed while sitting on a chair.
They were usually performed when the participants visited the facility, 2 to 3 times a
week, except on Sundays and when special events took place. The participants were
instructed to report to the therapist in charge if changes in their physical condition,
such as the occurrence of pain or persistent fatigue, were experienced while performing
the exercises. On such occasions, the contents of exercises were changed.</p><p>The individualized exercise program was performed by both the To-balance and Sitting
groups. It consisted of 8 exercise items, including major trunk and lower-limb muscle
training, an exercise to be performed in the standing position, and 5 stretches<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. In consideration of the results of
physical fitness measurements, presence/absence of pain, and main complaint, 5 of the 13
items were individually adopted. The maximum number of stretches was set to 2, so that all
participants would equally perform the exercises. The duration of each exercise session
was approximately 10 minutes, and consisted of 3 sets of 10 repetitions. It was performed
with a weight belt for 9 months at an intensity level of 12 or 13 (somewhat hard) on the
Borg Scale. During the intervention, we periodically confirmed that the individualized
exercise was being appropriately performed, and, when necessary, the intensity level was
adjusted.</p><p>The To-balance exercise consisted of stages 1 to 3, and was performed only by the
To-balance group. The duration of each session was approximately 15 minutes, and the
intervention period was 6 months. The intensity level was set at 12 or 13 (somewhat hard)
on the Borg Scale. All stages were performed with music which was familiar to the subjects
and appropriate for rhythm exercises, at a tempo of 70 to 110 bpm in triple measure<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. The exercise was performed using
parallel bars or corridor handrails to prevent falls. One therapist took care of one
participant, and the maximum number of participants in each session was 8, including
therapists. To reduce differences in intervention approaches and communication methods
between therapists, which may influence participants&#x02019; mental function, the same four
therapists were in charge of the group. In stages 1 and 2, one of the therapists led the
group, while the others monitored the participants to guard against falls. In stage 3, the
participants performed exercise under the guidance of their therapists in charge.</p><p>In stage 1, exercise items, such as stepping, anterior/posterior and lateral weight
shifting with the weight-supporting face fixed, squat, and walking backwards, were
performed for approximately 3 minutes and 30 seconds with music at a tempo of 60 bpm and
handrails.</p><p>In stage 2, exercise was performed for approximately 2 minutes and 30 seconds, with music
with lyrics at a tempo of 100 bpm. To motivate the participants to perform the group
activity, they and the therapists formed a circle.</p><p>In stage 3, stepping was performed using handrails. This stage was divided into 2 halves.
In the first half, exercise was performed for approximately 3 minutes and 20 seconds, with
music at a tempo of 100 bpm, in line with stage 2, and was followed by an approximately
3-minute break. The second half lasted 2 minutes and 50 seconds, and was performed with
music at a tempo of 120 bpm. The following steps were performed: 1) taking the first and
second steps without body shift; 2) taking the third step in an instructed direction; and
3) taking the fourth step similar to 2) so that the foot used in the fourth step was
placed next to the one used in the third step. These sets of steps were repeated
throughout the exercise. The direction for the third and fourth steps was set to forward
beforehand for the first set. In the subsequent sets, the therapist instructed a new
direction immediately after each third step. When stepping laterally, the steps were taken
outwards to avoid crossing of the feet.</p><p>The conventional group exercise was performed while sitting on a chair. This exercise has
been adopted in a large number of care facilities, and it was performed only by the
Sitting group. The exercise mainly consists of uniformed muscle training for the major
trunk, and upper- and lower-limb muscles, and its duration was approximately 15 minutes.

and mental health significantly improved.</p><p>In both groups, significant decreases in role-physical, bodily pain, social function,
general health, vitality, role-emotional, and mental health were observed during the
withdrawal from group exercise, from 6 to 9 months after the initiation of the
intervention.</p><p>In the comparison of the effects of intervention on the mental function between the 2
groups, a significant difference was observed only in social function at 6 months after the
initiation of the intervention.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>This study examined the effects of a new intervention approach combining group and rhythm
exercises for the elderly requiring assistance or low levels of care, considering that
interventions based on individualized or group exercise or combining them have already been
examined in previous studies<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. The results of the present study show there were significant
improvements in the mental and physical functions of the To-balance group, which both
individualized and group rhythm exercises were performed. In particular, static balance
ability improved rapidly, and dynamic balance and gait abilities improved more markedly than
in the Sitting group.</p><p>In the aspect of physical fitness, knee strength had significantly improved in both the
To-balance and Sitting groups at 3 months after the initiation of the intervention. This
improvement was maintained even after the 3-month withdrawal from group exercise, without
differences in effect between the 2 groups. A significant improvement in knee strength was
also observed after three months intervention in our previous study, in which only the
individualized exercise program used in the present study was performed<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. This suggests that, the individualized exercise program
may have improved knee strength in the present study. Recently, the appropriateness of
performing 50% or less of 1RM of low-intensity resistance exercise or a weight-supporting
squat as a low-intensity resistance exercise to enhance the muscle strength has been
reported<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. The group rhythm exercise
performed in the present study also consisted of weight-supporting muscle training;
therefore, in future studies, it may be necessary to examine the muscle-strengthening effect
of an intervention based only on weight-supporting muscle training.</p><p>Regarding balance ability, significant improvements in the single-leg standing and TUG
times were observed in the To-balance group 3 months after the initiation of intervention.
While a number of reports have pointed out that 6 months or more are needed to improve the
elderly&#x02019;s balance ability<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>, balance
improved within 3 months of the start of the intervention in the present study, in which
individualized and group rhythm exercises were simultaneously performed. Furthermore, the
significant difference in the single-leg standing time observed between the To-balance and
Sitting groups suggests that it may be possible to improve the static balance ability of
frail elderly subjects within 3 months through this approach. It may be necessary to clarify
this point in future studies, in addition to the above-mentioned muscle-strengthening
effects as the effects of intervention based only on group rhythm exercise were not examined
in this study.</p><p>Some reports have emphasized the importance of developing programs to improve the balance
ability of the elderly with consideration of their individual characteristics<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Nakagawa et al. pointed out the necessity
of performing more dynamic movements in individualized exercises to improve dynamic balance
ability<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the present study,
stepping with continuous changes of direction was performed in the To-balance exercise, with
a view to improving the ability of subjects to change direction and appropriately deal with
instant stepping reactions. Rogers et al. reported that it is effective to intensively
perform fast anterior/posterior and lateral stepping movements, in order to improve lateral
stability and lower-limb control in the presence of involuntary stepping reactions<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. Steps are also assessed in detail in the
Basic Balance Ability Test developed by Mochizuki<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. The criterion-related validity of this test has been confirmed
(r=0.88) against the Berg balance scale. These findings support the usefulness of the
stepping exercise developed for the present study for improvement of balance ability. In
fact, after the 3-month withdrawal from group exercise, significant decreases in balance
ability were observed in both the To-balance and Sitting groups, suggesting that the balance
ability may have been more markedly influenced by exercise levels than by muscle strength or
flexibility. Therefore, it may be necessary to continuously provide the elderly with
exercise-based programs to maintain their balance ability.</p><p>Regarding gait ability, significant improvements in the comfortable and maximum gait speeds
were observed only in the To-balance group at 3 months after the initiation of intervention.
Gait ability has been reported to be closely associated with knee extensor strength and
balance ability. In a study conducted by Iguchi, a 6-month intervention with exercise at a
low frequency, such as twice a month, improved gait ability<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. Similarly, in the study of Hauer et al., a 3-month intervention
with balance training 3 times a week improved the subject&#x02019;s TUG times<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>. Similarly, the improved knee strength and balance ability
observed in the present study may also have improved the gait ability. After the 3-month
withdrawal from group exercise, a significant decrease in gait ability was observed in both
the To-balance and Sitting groups, highlighting the importance of continuously providing
intervention for abilities which are difficult to improve.</p><p>Mental function improved as assessed by all SF-36 items in both the To-balance and Sitting
groups, and role-physical, social function, vitality, role-emotional, and mental health
significantly improved. While a number of reports have pointed out that group exercise is
effective at activating the elderly&#x02019;s mental function<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>, in the present study, exercise-based intervention significantly
improved role-physical and general health, in addition to mental function. Considering that
social function and role-emotional are associated with social communication-related QOL,
their improvement in the present study may suggest a solution to the elderly&#x02019;s social
isolation and consequent development of depression. The importance of continuously providing
exercise-based interventions was also suggested in this respect. Furthermore, in this study,
communication among the participants may have been promoted, as initially aimed, as the
participants stated that &#x0201c;There&#x02019;s one more thing to look forward to&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;I would like to
invite a friend of mine to this session&#x0201d;. After the 3-month withdrawal from group exercise,
significant decreases in 7 of the 8 SF-36 items were observed in both the To-balance and
Sitting groups, suggesting the necessity of continuously providing group approaches for
improving and maintaining the mental function of the elderly requiring low level care.</p><p>Based on our present results, activating the mental and physical functions of the elderly
requiring assistance and low levels of care may need continuous provision of combined
exercise therapy with consideration given to individuals&#x02019; mental and physical functions.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Fiatarone</surname><given-names>MA</given-names></name><name><surname>Marks</surname><given-names>EC</given-names></name><name><surname>Ryan</surname><given-names>ND</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>High-intensity strength training in nonagenarians.
