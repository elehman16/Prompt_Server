Posture is a modifiable risk factor for LBP shown to reduce the prevalence of LBP. Our feasibility research suggests that postural feedback might help healthcare workers avoid hazardous postures. The Effectiveness of Lumbopelvic Feedback (ELF) trial will investigate the extent to which postural monitor and feedback (PMF) can reduce exposure to hazardous posture associated with LBP.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This is a participant-blinded, randomised controlled trial with blocked cluster random allocation. Participants will include volunteer healthcare workers recruited from aged care institutions and hospitals. A postural monitoring and feedback device will monitor and record lumbopelvic forward bending posture, and provide audio feedback whenever the user sustains a lumbopelvic forward bending posture that exceeds predefined thresholds. The primary outcome measure will be postural behaviour (exceeding thresholds). Secondary outcome measures will be incidence of LBP, participant-reported disability and adherence. Following baseline assessment, we will randomly assign participants to 1 of 2 intervention arms: a feedback group and a no-feedback control group. We will compare between-group differences of changes in postural behaviour by using a repeated measures mixed-effect model analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) at 6&#x02005;weeks. Postural behaviour baseline scores, work-related psychosocial factors and disability scores will be input as covariates into the statistical models. We will use logistic mixed model analysis and Cox's proportional hazards for assessing the effect of a PMF on LBP incidence between groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Posture is a modifiable risk factor for low back disorders.

<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Non-specific LBP (NSLBP) is a multifactorial disorder, considered to have complex interactions between mechanical, psychosocial and biological factors, which can influence the onset and maintenance of symptoms.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4&#x02013;6</xref> Numerous risk factors for NSLBP are identifiable in the literature, with postural behaviour being one modifiable risk factor.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Change to workplace posture is commonly targeted by ergonomists, clinicians and researchers during rehabilitation and prevention programmes for NSLBP.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>

LBP is highly prevalent in healthcare workers, and it is suggested that sustained and repetitive flexed postures are underestimated as potential causes of occupational LBP in this workforce.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Despite the extensive amount of research on LBP, prevention and rehabilitation continues to be a challenge.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></p><p>New strategies for prevention and rehabilitation of LBP are required.

<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> The Spineangel (Movement Metrics, Hamilton, New Zealand) is one example of a wearable postural monitor and feedback (PMF) device. It was designed to monitor lumbopelvic movements and to provide audio feedback whenever the user adopts a specific lumbopelvic posture and sustains it for a predetermined duration.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> This type of audio feedback is characterised as intermittent feedback,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>
