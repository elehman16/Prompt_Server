In healthy young individuals, the negative SA of the lens is partially compensated by the positive corneal SA, resulting in a low level of SA for the entire eye. With aging, the SA of the lens becomes positive and, added to the corneal SA, it increases the total aberration of the eye.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>The spherical intraocular lens (IOL) implant after cataract surgery has a tendency to increase the overall positive SA. Standard IOLs have a positive SA, which, increasing the total SA, produces a pseudophakic eye with a total aberration not better than that recorded in an aged eye with transparent lens.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>In this prospective study, we analyzed the visual performance of both eyes of 22 patients who underwent bilateral cataract surgery, implanted in one eye with an aspherical IOL, whereas the contralateral received the same standard type of spherical IOL. The aim of this work was to verify the quality of vision and the contrast sensitivity, throughout subjective and objective tests, after implantation of spherical and aspherical IOLs.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Subjects</title><p>Forty-four eyes of 22 patients who underwent bilateral cataract surgery were recruited prospectively from August 2007 to October 2008. The exclusion criteria were: age less than 50 years, severe systemic disease, pregnancy, any uncontrolled ocular disease, presence of ocular pathology other than cataract, and previous history of ocular surgery. Patients with incomplete follow-up were also excluded. The patients received an aspherical IOL (AcrySof IQSN60WF, Alcon Laboratories Inc. Fort Worth, TX) in one eye and the same standard spherical IOL (AcrySof SA60AT; Alcon Laboratories Inc) in the other eye. Demographic characteristics of patients are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>.</p><p>Contrast sensitivity has been tested by CSV-1000E, Vector Vision, Arcanum, OH, USA (25% and 12.5% contrast level) at 6 and 12 cycles per degree. Every patient was examined with the best spectacle correction under mesopic conditions. Measurements of ocular wavefront error were performed 3 months after cataract surgery using the OPD Scan-II aberrometer/topographer NIDEK Co Ltd, Gamagori, Japan. We analyzed total, corneal, and internal wavefront errors for pupil diameters of 3.5 and 6 mm focusing mainly on SA (Z4,0).</p><p>Vision quality has been expressed by the point spread function (PSF) and the modulation transfer function (MTF). The PSF describes the light distribution on the retina of a point source and it can be expressed with the Strehl ratio. The Strehl ratio expresses the ability of the eye to produce a point imagev on the retina when a point object is observed.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>The MTF is reported as a percentage of the contrast of the image that is transmitted to the retina at various spatial frequencies.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] We also calculated MTF A/B ratio (the area ratio of the MTF curve of the examined eye over the MTF curve of the ideal eye) and MTF H/B ratio (the area ratio of the MTF curve of the examined eye without low-order aberrations over the MTF curve of the ideal eye). We analyzed the Strehl ratio and the MTF graph with a 4.5 mm pupil and 6<sup>th</sup> Zernike order of aberrations. A P &#x02264; 0.05 was considered to be significant.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-2"><title>Results</title><p>The mean age of the 22 patients was 67.6 years, 6.1 SD (range: 56-75).

If the overall SA is not excessive, there will be a slight loss in contrast, with an improvement in the depth of the field due to the multifocal effect of the SA.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>In our prospective series, a significant lower SA in the eyes implanted with aspherical IOL as compared to the spherical ones, without any real gain in terms of vision, was detected. We have also found a significant difference between the groups for total aberrations, whereas no differences were found regarding internal aberrations. We believe that the decentration of aspherical IOL may induce an increase in total aberrations no more compensated by corneal aberrations. In respect to the parameters analyzed for the quality of vision (best corrected visual acuity, PSF, MTF), there were no differences between aspherical IOL and standard type of spherical IOL.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil.</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None
