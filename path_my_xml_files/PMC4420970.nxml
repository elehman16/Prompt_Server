<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> or testing of novel devices.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Among the advocated benefits of anatomical 3D models, it has been suggested<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12&#x02013;14</xref> that being able to visualise the location and dimensions of the area of interest can aid in communication, both within a surgical team and, crucially, between the physician and the patient.</p><p>Communication is vitally important to doctors and patients,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> with aspects concerning the clarity of language, integrating frameworks, and researching the relationship between communication and interpersonal skills impacting on patient care.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> The complex nature of congenital heart disease (CHD) and the communication challenges it poses are particularly good examples of this. There is there an &#x02018;expert to non-expert&#x02019; interaction, with little likelihood of shared knowledge between participants, as well as a situation where the unshared knowledge is highly technical and difficult to communicate verbally or with traditional media. It is well known that such circumstances increase the chances of unsuccessful communication.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p><p>From a technical point of view, congenital heart defects frequently involve complex surgical operations and anatomical arrangements. Furthermore, for parents (ie, the non-expert individual) there is an additional emotional component of distress and anxiety further impinging on the exchange of knowledge during a consultation. 3D patient-specific models offer a potential new medium for improving communication in this challenging setting, improving parental understanding and possibly reducing the stress of the consultation.</p><p>The aim of this study was to produce a range of models of congenital heart lesions and test their impact on communication between parents and cardiologists. This study presents considerations about the feasibility and acceptability of manufacturing patient-specific 3D models for cardiac consultations, and their use in improving engagement of parents of children with CHD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Participants</title><p>One hundred and three parents of children with CHD who were attending clinics for routine outpatient follow-up were approached for the study. Parents identified as suitable for recruitment were sent a letter prior to their child's clinic appointment explaining the study rationale and what was involved. Parents were then randomly allocated (by simple randomisation) to one of two groups:
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>&#x02018;Model group&#x02019;: a 3D patient-specific model was manufactured for use during each visit;</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#x02018;Control group&#x02019;: no model was used during consultation.</p></list-item></list></p><p>The parents gave informed consent to take part in the study; however, due to the requirement to print the models in advance of the clinic visit, parents were randomised before they had been consented.</p><p>As data on parental knowledge is sparse, it was difficult to estimate differences between the groups and SDs in order to power the study appropriately; a power calculation was instead performed retrospectively to verify that the study was sufficiently powered for the observed results to be statistically significant.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Model manufacturing</title><p>The 3D patient-specific models were derived from medical imaging data. For CHD, the most commonly used imaging modalities are cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) or CT. In the present study, CMR data alone were used, to avoid having to accommodate substantial differences in spatial resolution between the two modalities. CMR studies were performed based on medical indication and were retrieved retrospectively for the 3D reconstructions. Timing between CMR and consultation was 1.7&#x000b1;1.6&#x02005;years.</p><p>The process of model manufacturing for this specific application has been described and discussed in detail elsewhere.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>
<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Briefly, CMR data are segmented using the commercial software Mimics (Materialise, Leuven, Belgium), the thresholding being based on the pixel greyscale. Then, following operations of segmentation and region growing, the 3D model of the desired area can be obtained and, if necessary, surface irregularities can be smoothed. Having added an arbitrary wall thickness of 1&#x02013;1.5&#x02005;mm to ensure model robustness using another type of software (Abaqus V.6.13, Dassault Syst&#x000e8;mes, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA), the model can finally be exported in a stereolithography (.stl) file format to the printer. The 3D printer used for the models in this study was an EOSINT P360 machine (EOS Electro Optical Systems, Krailling, Germany) based on selective laser sintering (SLS) technology.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> All models were produced in white nylon, chosen as a neutral colour/material.</p><p>A visual summary of these steps is provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2014007165F1">figure 1</xref>.

In cases in which both parents of a child were attending, only one was asked to participate. Parents were asked to rate their understanding of their child's heart condition on a scale from 1 (&#x02018;extremely poor&#x02019;) to 10 (&#x02018;extremely clear&#x02019;), and to name and identify their child's heart defect(s). Parents were able to mark information on a diagram of the heart, identify relevant words from a list of key words and provide free text answers. They were also asked to provide some basic demographic information (relationship to patient, age and highest level of education). Questionnaires took less than 5&#x02005;min to complete and were anonymised.</p><p>Following the consultation, parents were asked to complete a second brief questionnaire that included the same questions about their understanding and description of their child's heart defect. There were also questions about the clarity of the explanation of their child's condition that they had been given and, if applicable, about any planned procedure or intervention (rating from 1 &#x02018;extremely unclear&#x02019; to 10 &#x02018;extremely clear&#x02019;). They were also asked to rate any tool that the cardiologist used during the consultation, such as video, drawings, leaflets, 3D model and medical images (ie, echocardiography, CMR and X-rays). Participants were also given the opportunity to provide free text comments.</p><p>Additionally, cardiologists were asked to rate how clearly they felt the parent understood their child's anatomy and, if applicable, the procedure. If they used a 3D patient-specific model, they were also asked whether it took a long time to explain, whether it helped with communication (1&#x02013;10 rating) and how well the participant engaged with the model (1&#x02013;10 rating).</p><p>The duration of each consultation was timed for an objective evaluation to be compared with the clinicians&#x02019; subjective evaluation on whether the use of a 3D model impinged or not on this time.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Sample size</title><p>Pilot data were not available to power the study. A retrospective power calculation based on clinicians&#x02019; rating, as a more objective measure than perceived parental knowledge, showed that given the observed mean difference, SDs and the number of participants included in each group, the study was sufficiently powered at 80% with p=0.05.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Data analysis</title><p>With regard to parental knowledge, three different measures were used to obtain indicators of their understanding of their child's heart condition, as follows:

Specifically, a group of parents of children with CHD was targeted as a particularly interesting and challenging scenario in which to assess the potential of the 3D models, manufactured with the technique known as rapid prototyping (ie, &#x02018;3D printing&#x02019;). The rationale of the study was that, given the complexity of repaired CHD (in terms of anatomy, future/additionally required treatment and non-generalisability of the conditions), a real replica of the area of interest would be helpful for the parents to better understand, manipulate, and ultimately visualise:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Where the anatomical structures of interest are located and are positioned with respect to each other;</p></list-item><list-item><p>A specific area that the cardiologist is describing (eg, appreciating the severity of a narrowing in a vessel);</p></list-item><list-item><p>What the repair has been or what it will entail (eg, the area where a stent was inserted or might be inserted in the future).</p></list-item></list></p><p>Parents responded enthusiastically to the use of 3D models. This transpired both from the questionnaires that they completed after their consultations&#x02014;scoring the 3D models as very helpful tools&#x02014;and from the feedback they were encouraged to provide. In particular, parent feedback highlighted that 3D models are perceived as more immediate and user-friendly than medical images (eg, echocardiograms), whose importance the parents recognised (for the clinician) but which they themselves found difficult to comprehend. Furthermore, in three quarters of cases, parents asked to keep the model, which might be taken as a sign of their appreciation of and interest in the models.</p><p>Cardiologists also rated the models as very useful for engaging parents in discussion of their child's condition and noted generally that parents interacted well with the 3D models.</p><p>As a communication tool, models may lead to a more detailed explanation being provided, and this was borne out by the finding that consultations involving the use of a model lasted, on average, 5&#x02005;min longer. This additional time is unlikely to impinge significantly from a clinical point of view on the overall duration of the visits. Indeed, clinicians did not feel that consultations involving a model lasted longer than usual. However, although the longer consultation may mean that more detailed information was transmitted as a result of the models, it cannot be claimed that 3D models reduce consultation times by making communication more effective.</p><p>Despite parental appreciation for the models, there was no objective evidence that parents' understanding of their child's heart condition was improved. Their perceived knowledge as well as a basic quantification of their understanding from the questionnaires did not indicate a marked increase in the group in which 3D models were used. Knowledge is, however, very difficult to quantify. While the questionnaires provide some indication of overall parental understanding of the anatomy and the condition (ie, correct name of diagnosis or correct use of diagrams), a deeper appreciation of the complications and lifestyle implications does not emerge from this kind of assessment. However, their feedback is important and highlights:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Their difficulty in relating to medical images (seen as a tool more for the expert than for the non-expert) and sketches (which may be intuitive in some conditions, eg, septal defects, but less in others, eg, complex circulations such as Fontan or repaired transposition of the great arteries);</p></list-item><list-item><p>Their concern with facing the real anatomy of their child (ie, an element of initial shock), which is then balanced by the perceived improved understanding;</p></list-item><list-item><p>The need for a reference model to better appreciate what is abnormal or what has been modified by surgery/interventions, a point that will be included in our future work.</p></list-item></list></p><p>An interesting dichotomy also emerged from this study, which, while focused on assessing the 3D models, also looked at the clinician&#x02013;parent interaction, overall. In fact, while parents felt that the received explanations were always extremely clear, in 40% of cases, blinded clinicians were not able to identify even the primary diagnosis based on information provided by the parents after the consultation! Albeit a strikingly high proportion, this is interestingly in keeping with previous observations in the literature. A 2004 questionnaire survey focused on parental understanding of CHD reported that, out of 156 parents, only 59% could correctly name their child's CHD, and only 29% could correctly indicate the lesion on a diagram.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></p><p>Models were all printed in white nylon. This was considered to be a neutral option, especially for a first evaluation of this kind of communication device. However, it may be interesting to explore the use of colour in model manufacturing. Coloured models may result in more intuitive representations, for example, red and blue rendering for veins and arteries, respectively, which is often used even in non-specialist textbooks and websites.</p><p>This study does not include a detailed cost-effectiveness analysis, as it focused on assessing the feasibility of using models in clinical practice, and the acceptability of the tool from the parent and clinician perspectives. The models printed in this study each cost approximately &#x000a3;50 to make. It should be noted that price varies depending on the size of the model, reflecting the amount of material being used; this study comprised a wide range of sizes (eg, from infants with hypoplastic left heart syndrome to teenagers with tetralogy of Fallot) and thus a broad price range. Nevertheless, the average price appears reasonable and it might be desirable to perform a cost analysis in the future to investigate this aspect further. It is also sensible to speculate that, with the very recent technical advances in 3D printing, models might be cheaper in the near future, although their quality for this specific medical application would need to be verified. From a practical perspective, it is feasible to produce these patient-specific models in a timely manner: image reconstructions take approximately 0.5&#x02013;3&#x02005;h, depending on the image quality and the complexity of the anatomy being reconstructed, while printing time is of the order of 24&#x02005;h.</p><p>This study has focused on a relatively small population composed exclusively of parents of children with CHD. As a next step, it would be interesting and important to involve the patients themselves, perhaps initially targeting the teenage population. The possibility that keeping the model as a reminder of the anatomy might lead to long-term improvements in the parents&#x02019; and patients&#x02019; understanding of the condition should also be tested. This may be particularly important for future medical consultations where the parents or patients may need to communicate the nature of the diagnosis to healthcare professionals who are not aware of it. Indeed, the literature has reported that a large number of parents of children with CHD lack knowledge regarding lifelong congenital cardiac care but demonstrate a desire to learn.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Personalised models could facilitate this learning process, with a potential long-term impact on lifestyle adjustments that would be important to observe and quantify in future studies.</p><p>From a psychological standpoint, other factors (eg, deflecting anxiety) could also be investigated in future studies.</p><p>While it would be interesting to assess the usefulness of 3D models for specific diagnoses or interventions (eg, pulmonary valve replacement), the number of cases in this study is too small to allow for subgroup analysis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Parents of children with CHD and cardiologists both appreciated the use of 3D patient-specific models during routine/follow-up consultations. &#x0201c;I'm still looking at the heart [model] in absolute amazement and am guarding it like a Doberman! [...] It really does help knowing and understanding what is planned&#x0201d; (<italic>email communication from one of the parents of a patient</italic>). These models are useful for enhancing engagement with parents and, importantly, for improving communication between cardiologists and parents. In turn, this may also have a positive impact on parents&#x02019; and patients&#x02019; psychological adjustment to living with CHD.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors gratefully acknowledge the support of the following funding bodies: UK National Institute of Health Research (NIHR), Heart Research UK, Fondation Leducq, British Heart Foundation and Royal Academy of Engineering/EPSRC.
