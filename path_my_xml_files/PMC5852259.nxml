The study from Syria reported that a communication skills training intervention for resident doctors was not associated with higher satisfaction reported by women. In the UK study, patient-actors&#x02019; (experienced midwives) perceptions of safety and communication significantly improved for postpartum haemorrhage scenarios after training with patient-actors in local hospitals, compared with training using manikins in simulation centres, but no differences were identified for other scenarios.

Very low quality evidence was found on effectiveness of communication training of maternity care staff.

Consideration also needs to be given to how organisations prepare, monitor and sustain interventions to support effective communication, which reflect outcomes of priority for women, local culture and context of labour and birth care.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="author-highlights" id="ab0015"><title>Highlights</title><p><list list-type="simple" id="li0110"><list-item id="u0295"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0315">The review found only two studies on interventions for effective communication.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0300"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0320">Neither study considered clinical outcomes of interventions.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0305"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0325">Satisfaction with care was considered in both studies.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0310"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0330">Neither study presented qualitative data on women's and clinicians&#x02019; experiences.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0315"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0335">Current evidence is inadequate to inform content of training or practice.</p></list-item></list></p></abstract><kwd-group id="keys0005"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Communication</kwd><kwd>Intrapartum care</kwd><kwd>Childbirth</kwd><kwd>Labour</kwd><kwd>Obstetric delivery</kwd><kwd>Interpersonal relations</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s0005"><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0340">Current national (such as in the United Kingdom) and international guidance proposes that effective communication, support and compassion from maternity care staff can help a woman during labour and birth to feel in control, feel her wishes are respected, and contribute to a positive birth experience (e.g. <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">White Ribbon Alliance, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">WHO, 2016;</xref>
<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">NICE, 2017</xref>). The provision of good communication is at the core of recent international and national guidance for improving women's outcomes of birth. The recently published World Health Organization (WHO) framework for improving quality of care for mothers and newborns around the time of childbirth in health facilities recognizes two important components of care: the quality of the provision of care and the quality of care as experienced by women and their families (<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">World Health Organization (WHO), 2016</xref>, <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Tuncalp et al., 2015</xref>). The framework contains eight domains of quality, one of which is communication, with the standard that &#x02018;communication with women and their families is effective and responds to their needs and preferences&#x02019; (Standard 4, <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">WHO, 2016</xref>).</p><p id="p0345">The importance of effective communication in healthcare has long been recognised, and there is extensive literature on this in general healthcare. Recent examples include reviews of the role of communication in decision making (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Ames et al., 2017</xref>) and a review of how patient experiences may impact on clinical safety and effectiveness of outcomes (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Doyle et al., 2013</xref>). In maternity care, authors have explored the role of communication in the provision of respectful care (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Vogel et al., 2016</xref>). Communication is at the core of health professional education, with training and assessment in communication skills included in medical, midwifery and nursing curricula in the United States of America (USA), United Kingdom (UK) and some European countries (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Deveugele et al., 2005</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Butler et al., 2008</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Bosse et al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">King and Hoppe, 2013</xref>). In some countries, demonstrated competency to provide good communication, including verbal, non-verbal and written communication, is a requirement for registration to practice as a clinician (for example, &#x02018;UK Standards for Pre-Registration Education&#x02019;, <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Nursing and Midwifery Council, 2015</xref>). However, despite the acknowledged importance of communication, there is no consensus definition of &#x02018;effective communication&#x02019; in general health care or in maternity care.</p><p id="p0350">Global support for scaling up midwifery-led care includes the potential to improve women-centred communication (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Homer et al., 2014</xref>), with women reported as wanting consistent, high quality information, and better communication about their care <italic>between</italic> maternity staff they encounter (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">National Maternity Review, 2016</xref>). Despite these endeavours, there is widespread evidence of women's perceptions of the continuing failure by clinicians to effectively communicate with them during labour and birth, with adverse consequences including women not feeling in control and not being listened to (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Green and Baston, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Care Quality Commission, 2013;</xref>
<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Alderdice et al., 2016</xref>)). Experiences of poor or disrespectful care, including how women felt they were treated during labour, could trigger the onset of postpartum post-traumatic stress disorder (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Ayers et al., 2016</xref>), impact on a woman's relationship with her infant (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Hauck et al., 2007</xref>) and adversely impact on a woman's experiences and satisfaction with her birth (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Mannava et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, if not addressed, these issues could discourage women and communities from using facilities to give birth, particularly in lower-resource settings where access to this care may be vital for maternal and newborn health (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Bohren et al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Bohren et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p id="p0355">An initial scoping search for this review identified no clear evidence to underpin recent policy recommendations with respect to the impact of effective communication on labour and birth outcomes or women's experiences. This systematic review therefore aimed to assess whether interventions to support effective communication between maternity care staff and healthy women in labour with a term pregnancy could improve birth outcomes and experiences of care. It also aimed to synthesize information related to the feasibility of implementation and resources required. This formed one of a series of linked reviews commissioned by the WHO to underpin forthcoming global guidance on effective intrapartum care of healthy women going into labour at term (<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">WHO, in press</xref>). Other reviews in the WHO series included respectful maternity care during labour and birth, pain relief and the presence of a companion of choice at birth. No current or planned reviews on effective communication during labour and birth were identified through a search of the Cochrane Library, Joanna Briggs Institute and PROSPERO.</p></sec><sec id="s0010"><title>Methods</title><p id="p0360">A mixed-methods synthesis methodology was planned (see PROSPERO registration CRD42017070485 for detail).

The training content related to characteristics and principles of effective communication, how to overcome barriers to effective communication and improve interactions with women during labour and birth. Data collection included 2,000 women who gave birth between April 2008 and January 2009. Participatory methods were applied in the training workshops, led by a member of the research team described as a national trainer with experience in communication skills who, together with members of the research team, observed and facilitated the training. Each workshop lasted twenty hours in total and was delivered over three days. The training package was rolled out at four time points separated by two months each. Each hospital contributed one cluster to the control arm, and (during the last time period) one to the intervention arm.</p><p id="p0440">Timing of implementation of the training package in each hospital was determined when clusters &#x02018;switched&#x02019; from the control to the intervention arm.

Secondary outcomes included the communicative behaviour of doctors, as documented using a checklist based on the Al-Galaa observational checklist which was developed in Egypt to record normal labour and birth practices (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Sholkamy et al., 2003</xref>).

Clinicians were randomized to one of four obstetric emergency training interventions: a one-day course at a local hospital; a one-day course at a simulation centre; a two-day course with teamwork training at a local hospital; and a two-day course with teamwork training at a simulation centre. Training at local hospitals used a patient-actor, while training at the simulation centre was conducted using computerised patient manikins. The two-day training courses included additional teamwork training on communication, roles and responsibilities, and situational awareness (an individual's perception of what is happening around them in terms of surroundings, environment, time, space, and threats to safety which could impact on decision making (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Mackintosh et al., 2009</xref>)) with lectures, video clips and activities to demonstrate each component of team work.</p><p id="p0450">Pre- and post- training, participants were asked to manage three standardised simulated obstetric emergencies (eclampsia, post-partum haemorrhage (PPH), shoulder dystocia) in a room in the labour ward of their own hospital. Outcomes assessed included the quality of care in relation to communication, safety and respect, in the three simulated emergencies three weeks after training. A five-point Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree) captured patient-actor responses to statements such as &#x0201c;I felt well informed due to good communication&#x0201d;.

The evidence gap persists, despite nearly two decades since a review of effectiveness of interventions in maternity care to improve communication between health professionals and women reported a lack of evidence for labour and the postnatal period (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Rowe et al., 2002</xref>). The absence of evidence in the current review was particularly surprising as the importance of &#x02018;good communication&#x02019; has been consistently highlighted in recent studies and successive national and international policy publications.</p><p id="p0530">Evidence of what contributes to &#x02018;effective communication&#x02019; remains undefined despite this also being promoted as a core skill for maternity care staff. In <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Nicholls and Webb's (2006)</xref> integrative review which included 33 methodologically diverse studies, the authors reported that good communication skills were considered to be a principal attribute of a good midwife. A later Delphi study from the same researchers which presented women's, midwives&#x02019; and midwifery educators&#x02019; perceptions of a &#x02018;good midwife&#x02019; found &#x02018;communication skills&#x02019; was one of the highest scored statements (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Nicholls et al., 2011</xref>). Communication is persistently cited as a component of high quality maternity care in major policy frameworks to improve women's experiences and other outcomes of maternity care, including WHO Quality of Care Framework for Maternal and Newborn Health (<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">WHO, 2016</xref>), Lancet Framework for Quality Maternal and Newborn Care (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Renfrew et al., 2014</xref>), and respectful maternity care (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">White Ribbon Alliance, 2012</xref>).</p><sec id="s0115"><title>Training to improve communication between maternity care staff and women during labour</title><p id="p0535">Both studies included in the review evaluated effectiveness of training interventions to improve communication. <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Bashour et al. (2013)</xref> showed that the training package in communication skills for doctors was not associated with higher satisfaction with labour scores recorded by women, despite high satisfaction with the training workshops reported by the doctors who attended.</p><p id="p0540">Although <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Crofts et al. (2008)</xref> reported that improvements in all scores in the three clinical scenarios were statistically significant after training, this was based on a pre- and post- intervention analysis with no comparison groups. Perceptions of safety and communication significantly improved after training with patient-actors, compared with training using manikins for postpartum haemorrhage scenarios, but it is unclear why no statistically significant improvements were found in perceptions of communication in the eclampsia and shoulder dystocia scenarios using different training methods and settings (patient-actors in local hospitals vs manikins in simulation centres). Furthermore, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Crofts et al. (2008)</xref> found no benefits of additional teamwork training on patient-actors&#x02019; perceptions of care related to safety, communication and respect. Although there seems to be some evidence for simulation training on obstetric emergencies in maternal and neonatal outcomes (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Crofts et al. 2011</xref>), more robust evaluation is needed to establish not only outcomes of communication and team skills through simulation-based training but content and &#x02018;dose&#x02019; of simulation training needed to support effective communication.</p></sec><sec id="s0120"><title>Considerations for implementation of communication training</title><p id="p0545">In <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Bashour et al.'s (2013)</xref> trial, possible barriers to implementation of a communication intervention in the clinical environment included long working hours, crowded wards, and high volume of patients. Low social status of women, environment of birth, lack of midwifery support and cultural attitudes were also likely to have impacted on feasibility of implementation. <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Crofts et al. (2008)</xref> had a low take-up of training due to staff illness and clinical commitments. As <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Bashour et al. (2013)</xref> suggest, wider systems change is likely to be needed alongside communication training if outcomes are to improve. How organisations prepare, monitor and sustain interventions to enhance communication, including time to embed and sustain change in practice, require further investigation.</p><p id="p0550">The environment and context of maternity care in the two studies (i.e. centres in Syria and UK) are likely to be different to those in other settings. <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Bashour et al. (2013)</xref> reported that labour and childbirth largely took place in overcrowded hospitals (two participating hospitals had over 10,000 births per year) and in most cases, the women were not allowed to be accompanied by any relatives during labour and birth. Eye-to-eye contact was not acceptable between the woman and her care provider if this was a male. This suggests that there is a need to consider context and culturally specific communication training when developing and implementing interventions. Communication interventions which reflect &#x02018;cultural norms&#x02019; as perceived by local women and maternity care staff, could more appropriately inform outcomes of importance for both groups.</p></sec><sec id="s0125"><title>Women's, family members&#x02019; and maternity care staff's experiences and views of communication interventions</title><p id="p0555">No qualitative evidence was found on women's, family members&#x02019; or maternity care staff's experiences or views of interventions to improve communication during labour. Considering the limited research identified, this is perhaps not surprising. How communication is defined, when and how outcomes are assessed and whether assessment is to provide an overall view of maternity care, or to inform a specific component of care (for example, antenatal screening tests) differs between published studies (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Rowe et al., 2002</xref>, <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Nieuwenhuijze et al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">O'Brien et al., 2017</xref>). A review of literature from developing countries which aimed to identify determinants of women's satisfaction with maternity care showed that therapeutic communication which included components such as listening, politeness, prompt pain relief, kindness, approachability and a smiling demeanour, could enhance maternal satisfaction with care (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Srivastava et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p id="p0560">A systematic qualitative review of evidence of what women want and need during childbirth highlighted that women expected staff to be sensitive, caring and kind, and fear of staff being distant, insensitive or rude (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Downe et al., in preparation</xref>). A recently conducted qualitative evidence synthesis aimed to develop a conceptualization of respectful maternity care during childbirth in health facilities globally from the perspectives of key stakeholders (including women, providers, and administrators); this review included 67 studies from 32 countries ranging from high to low income settings (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Shakibazadeh et al., 2017</xref>). One of the domains of respectful maternity identified was &#x02018;engaging with effective communication&#x02019; which was assessed as including interventions such as &#x02018;talking and listening to women&#x02019;, &#x02018;practicing and encouraging effective non-verbal communication&#x02019;, &#x02018;being honest&#x02019;, &#x02018;availability of interpreters due to language proficiency and cultural differences&#x02019;, and &#x02018;providing empathy&#x02019;. These were clearly important to women and their maternity carers in a range of settings. However, the extent to which women experienced this level of care and how it could be supported by their care providers remains unknown. Furthermore, there was evidence that negative impacts of maltreatment during labour and birth included increased risk of maternal and infant morbidity and mortality (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Mannava et al., 2015</xref>), and may dissuade women in some country settings from planning a subsequent birth in a facility setting (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Kumbani et al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Moyer et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p id="p0565">National maternity surveys in England of women's experiences of maternity care, including care in labour, have included questions on communication, including <italic>&#x02018;At the very start of your labour, did you feel that you were given appropriate advice and support when you contacted a midwife or the hospital?&#x02019;, &#x02018;Thinking about your care during labour and birth, were you spoken to in a way you could understand?&#x02019;</italic> (e.g. <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Care Quality Commission, 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Care Quality Commission, 2013</xref>). In the USA, national surveys of women's experiences of childbearing have also included questions relevant to communication in labour, including women's views of involvement in decision making (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Maternity Center Association, 2002</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Declercq et al., 2007</xref>). These illustrate how effective communication may be perceived from the perspectives of different stakeholders, including maternity service funders or providers. Communication in maternity care is usually more likely to be assessed as part of a &#x02018;package&#x02019; of questions aimed at supporting overall feedback, as illustrated by these national surveys. This is perhaps why this current review which <italic>specifically</italic> targeted communication interventions between maternity care staff and healthy women at term during labour, birth and the immediate postnatal period found so few relevant studies.</p><p id="p0570">Recent studies have started to explore the extent to which women, partners and families feel able to &#x02018;speak up&#x02019; when, for example, women are aware of a deterioration in their health (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Carter et al., 2017</xref>) or that their safety is at risk as a consequence of staff failing to listen and respond to them (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Rance et al., 2013</xref>). This area of work could potentially support and inform effective communication in labour to enhance women's experiences and outcomes of birth. Organisational support to achieve and sustain effective communication by maternity care staff is likely to be crucial, with evidence of level, type and characteristics of intervention urgently needed.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0130"><title>Implications for future research</title><p id="p0575">This review identified a lack of studies on interventions to support effective communication between healthy women with a term pregnancy in labour and maternity care staff, despite communication being referred to as a &#x02018;core&#x02019; component of high quality, respectful maternity care. This is a major and unexpected research gap that needs to be addressed. The gap suggests an assumption that benefits are self-evident, or taken for granted by stakeholders; potentially research has not been prioritized for this area. We suggest there is an urgent need to improve understanding of key components of effective communication and robust studies to test these. The evidence identified in this review was assessed as very low quality, and the two included studies provided contrasting findings.</p><p id="p0580">The constraints in practice reported in the two studies (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Crofts et al., 2008</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Bashour et al., 2013</xref>) demonstrate the importance of a systems perspective which reflects political, cultural, social and economic factors and impact on the preparation, delivery, impact and sustainability of the intervention. Research is needed from different resource and infrastructure settings to build a body of evidence to inform global policy and practice. As no qualitative studies on women's or providers&#x02019; experiences of such interventions were identified, effectiveness studies might usefully incorporate high quality qualitative evidence. In the context of resource limitations in many maternity settings, evidence on resource use, feasibility of implementation for staff and providers, and implementation of different approaches to support effective communication would also be useful.

Although the two included studies were randomised trials, methodological limitations resulted in high risk of bias and very low quality evidence, which prevented conclusive recommendations for practice being made. Due to heterogeneity of included studies, findings could not be statistically pooled which further prevented generalisability of the results. As the current review targeted interventions to promote effective communication between maternity care staff and healthy women at term during labour, birth and the immediate postnatal period, our remit was specific. This meant that research evidence which considered communication in other areas of maternity care, newborn and child health care or health care more generally was not included. A future broader review on maternal and newborn health might usefully provide evidence to inform research and training as a basis for communication interventions and allow integration of evidence from other related areas including breastfeeding.</p></sec><sec id="s0140"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="p0590">There is a dearth of evidence on interventions to inform effective communication between maternity care staff and healthy women with term pregnancies during labour, birth and immediate postnatal period. Policy ambitions which recommend effective communication to support high quality, safe maternity care may not be achievable unless robust research is undertaken which reflects women's preferences, birth setting, care providers and the context of care in which labour and birth take place.</p><p id="p0595">Potential barriers to implementation of effective communication interventions would need to be addressed at individual, health facility and system level if outcomes associated with benefit are to be achieved. Some barriers (ie high workload) may be common across all settings, whilst other barriers (e.g. role of women in society) are likely to be specific to particular cultures or settings and would need to be addressed individually. Research is needed to define what an effective communication intervention in labour means to women and their families, what outcomes women and their families consider to be high priority, how outcomes are assessed and timing of assessment in relation to the birth.</p></sec><sec id="s0145"><title>Funding</title><p id="p0600">This work was commissioned to King&#x02019;s College London, UK by the UNDP/UNFPA/UNICEF/WHO/World Bank Special Programme of Research, Development and Research Training in Human Reproduction (HRP), Department of Reproductive Health and Research, World Health Organization, Switzerland as part of the evidence base preparation for the WHO recommendations on intrapartum care.
