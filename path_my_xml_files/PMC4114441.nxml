The adverse effects can be manifested in attenuated effects of exercise and training, as the antioxidants may shut down some redox-sensitive signaling in the exercised muscle fibers. However, conditions such as age may potentially modulate the need for antioxidant intake. Therefore, this paper describes experiments for testing the hypothesis that high dosages of vitamin C (1000&#x000a0;mg/day) and E (235&#x000a0;mg/day) have negative effects on adaptation to resistance exercise and training in young volunteers, but positive effects in older men.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>We recruited a total of 73 volunteers. The participants were randomly assigned to receiving either vitamin C and E supplementation or a placebo. The study design was double-blinded, and the participants followed an intensive training program for 10&#x02013;12 weeks. Tests and measurements aimed at assessing changes in physical performance (maximal strength) and physiological characteristics (muscle mass), as well as biochemical and cellular systems and structures (e.g., cell signaling and morphology).</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Dietary supplements, such as vitamin C and E, are used by many people, especially athletes. The users often believe that high dosages of supplements improve health (resistance to illness and disease) and physical performance. These assumptions are, however, generally not supported in the scientific literature. On the contrary, some studies have indicated that high dosages of antioxidant supplements have negative effects on exercise-induced adaptation processes. Since this issue concerns many people and few randomized controlled trials have been conducted in humans, further studies are highly warranted.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.anzctr.org.au/Trial/Registration/TrialReview.aspx?ACTRN=12614000065695">ACTRN12614000065695</ext-link></p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Protocol paper</kwd><kwd>Antioxidants</kwd><kwd>Muscle mass</kwd><kwd>Muscle strength</kwd><kwd>1 repetition maximum</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Exercise and training have indisputably demonstrated impressive potential in inducing physiological adaptations in both the cardiovascular and muscular systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Nonetheless, researchers still strive to elucidate the most efficient ways to exercise for certain adaptations, such as increased strength and endurance. A prerequisite for optimal effects of training is adequate nutrition, and indeed, the intake of certain types and amounts of macro- and micro-nutrients may modulate the effects of training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Whey protein and creatine supplementation are two examples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Antioxidants constitute a central group of micro-nutrients. Several studies have been conducted to explore their effects on health, physical performance, exercise and training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The human body definitely requires a variety of antioxidants, but an unanswered question is whether it is beneficial or not to supplement the diet with isolated, highly concentrated antioxidant products, such as vitamin C and E pills [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>Supplementation with different types of antioxidants has been variably shown to have positive effects, no effect, and even negative effects on training adaptation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Because intensive exercise generates stress in the working muscles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], it seems logical that antioxidant supplementation could beneficially reduce this stress. On the other hand, it has become clear that cellular stress, which includes increased production of free radicals and oxidative stress, in fact works as a signal to induce important adaptions in muscle cells, including mitochondrial biogenesis and myofiber hypertrophy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Thus, if the cells are exposed to high levels of antioxidants this signaling may be blunted or blocked, which in turn may inhibit physiological adaptations. In line with this, Makanae et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] recently reported that high dosages of vitamin C attenuated hypertrophy of overloaded plantaris muscles in rats. The diminished muscle growth appeared to be related to reduced overload-induced phosphorylation of p70S6K. Similar human studies are currently lacking, but Morales-Alamo et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] have recently reported that an antioxidant mix (vitamin C, E and alpha-lipoic acid) blunted the activation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) and AMP-activated protein kinase after maximal sprint exercise. Such signaling could be important for initiating training adaptation, and could explain the abolished training effects observed in anaerobic training combined with antioxidant supplementation (Q-10; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]).</p><p>Hitherto, most investigations on antioxidant supplementation and training in humans have focused on endurance training (for reviews, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]). Only three human training studies have applied a high-force, resistance mode of exercise; i.e., traditional strength training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and eccentric exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. In a study by Theodorou et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], no effects of vitamin C and E supplementation (1000&#x000a0;mg and 400&#x000a0;IU, respectively) were found on either recovery after eccentric exercise or adaptation to 4&#x000a0;weeks of eccentric training. Chuin et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] supplemented elderly women (Vitamin C: 1000&#x000a0;mg/d, vitamin E: 600&#x000a0;IU/d) who concomitantly participated in strength training or control groups. The authors only reported results on bone mineral content (BMC), which allegedly was preserved better with C and E vitamin supplementation, but there was no interaction between training and supplementation. Bobeuf et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] observed that vitamin C (1000&#x000a0;mg/d) and E (400&#x000a0;IU/d) supplementation affected neither body composition nor strength gain in elderly participants. Notably, Bobeuf et al. found no clear muscle gain in the placebo group, which means that the antioxidant effect on muscle growth is uncertain.</p><p>The effect of antioxidant supplementation and exercise in elderly individuals is indeed elusive. However, Ryan et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] observed that vitamin C and E supplementation improved concentric work capacity in old rats, but not young rats. This suggests that antioxidant supplementation could exert different effects in young and aged muscles; possibly because of low levels of inflammation and augmented oxidative stress levels in aged muscles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Consequently, aged muscles seem more likely to respond positively to antioxidant supplementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><p>In the present study, we aimed to investigate the effects of antioxidant supplementation, in the form of vitamin C and E supplementation, recruiting both young (20&#x02013;40 years) and elderly (60&#x02013;80 years) volunteers. The effects of both a training period (10&#x02013;12 weeks) and an acute exercise session with recovery were examined. Biochemical analyses of blood and muscle were combined with physiological measurements and performance tests.</p><p>Based on the notion that antioxidants blunt exercise-induced redox sensitive signaling in young, healthy muscles, but reduce unfavorable oxidative stress in aging muscles, we hypothesized that vitamin C (1000&#x000a0;mg/day) and E (235&#x000a0;mg/day) supplementation would:</p><p>(1) inhibit the adaptation to strength training in young, healthy men and women; and (2) augment the adaptation to strength training in healthy, elderly men (60&#x02013;80 years). Moreover, we hypothesized that &#x0201c;hypertrophic&#x0201d; cell signaling and protein synthetic rate would be blunted in the hours after a single session of strength training in young persons, and, thus, reflect the long-term effects.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>This study comprises three experiments and involves the potential interference of antioxidant supplementation in exercise-induced responses and adaptations to strength training in young and elderly participants.</p><sec><title>Participants</title><p>A total of 73 participants were recruited to the study (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Flow chart of recruited and allocated participants.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="2052-1847-6-28-1"/></fig><p>The young participants (20&#x02013;45 years of age), both males and females, were healthy and did not use any form of supplements or medications, except contraceptives for women (menstrual cycle was not controlled for).

Each vitamin pill contained 250&#x000a0;mg of ascorbic acid and 58.5&#x000a0;mg DL-alpha-tocopherol acetate (all-rac-alpha-tocopheryl acetate); in addition to cellulose, di/tri-calsium phosphate and magnesium stearate. Similar-looking placebo pills contained the same ingredients, except for the vitamins, and were produced by the same manufacturer. The pills were analyzed by a commercial company, Vitas (Oslo, Norway) ~2&#x000a0;years after production, with no sign of degradation of the vitamins (per pill: vitamin C: 255&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;7&#x000a0;mg, vitamin E: 62&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2&#x000a0;mg).

Several endogenous antioxidants, such as glutathione, superoxide dismutase and catalase, will counteract most of the adverse effects of acute exercise. In addition, cells will take up exogenous antioxidants in the form of vitamins C and E, alpha-lipoic acid, carotenoids, ubiquinones and a range of phytochemicals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>], which will reinforce the cellular antioxidant system.

Others have chosen two intakes per day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. In order to maximize the influence of the antioxidant supplementation, it thus seemed reasonable to time the intake so that the plasma concentration was highest just before and during the first hours of recovery after the exercise sessions.</p><p>We administered dosages of 1000&#x000a0;mg vitamin C and 235&#x000a0;mg of vitamin E (DL-alpha-tocopherol) per day. These amounts are in line with other recent studies, although our vitamin E dosages could be considered moderate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Participants</title><p>In the experiment with young volunteers we included both sexes. This was partly due to there being no obvious reasons to exclude one of the sexes, and partly because it is interesting to look for sex differences, as most studies on antioxidant supplementation and training adaptation have been conducted on males [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>].</p><p>In the experiment on the elderly, we chose males only. The main reason for this was that very few studies have investigated interactions between exercise and antioxidant supplementation in elderly participants; however, Bobeuf et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] have conducted studies on elderly males, and we wanted to follow up this study. The second reason was that elderly females appear to have less potential to respond to high intensity resistance exercise with three exercise sessions per week [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. Thus, in order to increase the likelihood of inducing robust muscle growth, we selected elderly males.</p><p>We recruited recreationally trained young volunteers, but untrained elderly volunteers. Our motivation for choosing young, trained individuals was that we hypothesized that antioxidant supplementation would affect adaptations in the muscle. Thus, we assumed it was better to test this in trained individuals in whom muscular adaptations are expected to dominant over neural adaptations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. We chose untrained elderly volunteers, as we expected it would be very difficult to recruit the needed number of trained elderly participants. Furthermore, since we hypothesized that the elderly need more antioxidants to combat an increasing redox state in the aftermath of developing sarcopenia, we included untrained elderly individuals.</p></sec><sec><title>High intensity exercise</title><p>Based on the theory of hormesis, the advantage of antioxidant supplementation should be largest during high intensity training that induces large oxidative stress; and conversely, low intensity training &#x02013; that produces low oxidative stress &#x02013; in combination with antioxidant supplementation should increase the likelihood of blunting or blocking training effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In our study we wanted to apply training programs that were similar to what dedicated strength-trained individuals use in practice. We therefore designed the training protocols to induce high metabolic and oxidative stress. Accordingly, the strength training program consisted of an energy-demanding, full range of motion exercises and repetition maximum (RM) intensity, as well as short inter-set/-exercise rest periods (see Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).</p><p>We designed a periodized strength training program, which has been suggested to be superior to non-periodized programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>]. However, there is no consensus concerning what type of periodization is better [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. For practical reasons, we designed a linear program for the young and an undulating (non-linear) program for the elderly.</p></sec><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>Supplementation with vitamin C and E is a conservative choice, but the dosages chosen, 1000&#x000a0;mg vitamin C and 235&#x000a0;mg vitamin E (DL-alpha-tocopherol acetate), are in line with previously published studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. Ideally, a dosage titration would be preferable (i.e., 400&#x000a0;mg, 800&#x000a0;mg and 1600&#x000a0;mg of vitamin C). Moreover, it was of interest to test vitamins C and E both separately and together; and in a stronger study design we would also include groups that received vitamins, but did not follow an exercise intervention. Unfortunately, we did not have the resources to design a study that took all these aspects into account.</p><p>We supplemented our participants with DL-alpha-tocopherol acetate, the synthetic form of vitamin E. It has been shown that the biological response to natural (D-alpha-tocopherol/RRR- alpha-tocopherol) may be different [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>]. Thus, we must be careful when discussing our results alongside studies that have administered the natural form of vitamin E.</p><p>Training supervision was optional for the young participants in this study; while the elderly participants were supervised in all sessions. All participants were, however, instructed to keep a training diary in which they logged loads and perceived exertion, and they could request assistance whenever needed. Moreover, the young participants were familiar with strength training before entering the study. Nevertheless, full training supervision is preferable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>], to ensure that all participants follow the training as prescribed and exercise with appropriate lifting techniques and effort.</p><p>The training programs for young and elderly participants differed. This means that we cannot easily compare results from young and elderly participants. Such comparisons were not part of our hypotheses, but equal training programs could potentially give more information about the effects of the supplements. However, several practical reasons made us use different training regimes for the two groups of volunteers. Thus, we tried to optimize the training for the two groups independently of each other.</p><p>We monitored the influence of antioxidant supplementation over a rather short period of time, and long-term effects cannot be extracted. However, the most significant physiological changes occur typically in the first weeks after embarking on a new training program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>].</p><p>In the acute experiment we tested the response to a single session of strength training. The intention was to investigate the immediate cell signaling (e.g., redox sensitive mitogen activated kinases, MAPKs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>]) and the protein synthetic rate, in order to get a mechanistic insight into the hypothesized effects of the supplements. As the experiment was conducted midway into the intervention period, on the young participants, we realize that we cannot easily differentiate between the potential effects of the supplementation before/after the session and the potential effects of the preceding&#x02009;~&#x02009;4&#x000a0;weeks with supplementation.</p></sec><sec><title>Relevance for investigating the effects of vitamin C and E</title><p>Vitamin C and E supplements are widely used in the general population and even more so amongst athletes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>]. The most common motivation for using antioxidant vitamins such as vitamin C seems to be strengthening the immune system and thereby preventing and treating diseases, especially upper-respiratory infections such as the common cold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">72</xref>]. Intriguingly, vitamin C supplementation seems at best to have limited clinically relevant effects on &#x0201c;the common man&#x0201d; and on athletes who are otherwise healthy and have a normal diet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">72</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">73</xref>]. Some groups, such as the elderly population, are more susceptible to dietary deficiencies of some vitamins and therefore supplementation may be defensible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">73</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">74</xref>].</p><p>Amongst athletes and people engaged in recreational sport activities, dietary supplements are also used to improve performance and recovery after exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>]. Equivocal observations have been reported, but vitamin C and E do not seem to have appreciable/consistent ergogenic effects or effects on recovery from exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">75</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">76</xref>].</p><p>Regardless of the motivation for use, vitamin C and E supplementation is widespread. This fact, combined with recent studies that indicate adverse effects on adaptation to exercise and training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>], clearly illuminate and justify further research into the biological effects of vitamin C and E supplementation in humans.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Antioxidant supplementations, such as vitamin C and E, are commonly used by large and divergent groups worldwide (e.g. athletes, elderly, patients etc.). Recently the potential interaction between antioxidant supplementation and training has received increased scientific interest and become a debated topic. Indeed, both animal and human studies have indicated negative effects when vitamin C and/or E are administered in high dosages. The literature is, however, ambiguous and many important questions remain unanswered. Hitherto, human investigations have focused on endurance exercise and training, so the experiments described here should provide novel data and insight into the interactions between antioxidant supplementation and adaptations to strength training.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>GP contributed to all parts of the study.
