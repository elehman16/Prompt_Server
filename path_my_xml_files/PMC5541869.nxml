Splenectomy may alter responsiveness to treatment and/or increase the risk of thrombosis, infection, and pulmonary hypertension. The analysis herein evaluated the safety and efficacy of the thrombopoietin receptor agonist romiplostim in splenectomized and nonsplenectomized adults with primary immune thrombocytopenia. Data were pooled across 13 completed clinical studies in adults with immune thrombocytopenia from 2002&#x02013;2014. Adverse event rates were adjusted for time of exposure. Results were considered different when 95% confidence intervals were non-overlapping. Safety was analyzed for 1111 patients (395 splenectomized; 716 nonsplenectomized) who received romiplostim or control (placebo or standard of care). At baseline, splenectomized patients had a longer median duration of immune thrombocytopenia and a lower median platelet count, as well as a higher proportion with &#x0003e;3 prior immune thrombocytopenia treatments <italic>versus</italic> nonsplenectomized patients. In each treatment group, splenectomized patients used rescue medications more often than nonsplenectomized patients. Platelet response rates (&#x02265;50&#x000d7;10<sup>9</sup>/L) for romiplostim were 82% (310/376) for splenectomized and 91% (592/648) for nonsplenectomized patients (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001 by Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test). Platelet responses were stable over time in both subgroups. Exposure-adjusted adverse event rates were higher for control <italic>versus</italic> romiplostim for both splenectomized (1857 <italic>versus</italic> 1226 per 100 patient-years) and nonsplenectomized patients (1052 <italic>versus</italic> 852 per 100 patient-years). In conclusion, responses to romiplostim were seen in both splenectomized and nonsplenectomized patients, and romiplostim was not associated with an increase in the risk of adverse events in splenectomized patients. <italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov">clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link> Identifier: 00111475(A)(B), 00117143, 00305435, 01143038, 00102323, 00102336, 00415532, 00603642, 00508820, 00907478, 00116688, and 00440037</italic>.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), increased platelet destruction and suboptimal platelet production result in low platelet counts, with bleeding symptoms that range from minimal to severe.<sup><xref rid="b1-1021342" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b2-1021342" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> The thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor agonist romiplostim stimulates platelet production.<sup><xref rid="b3-1021342" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Romiplostim is approved in The USA for the treatment of chronic ITP in adults who have had an insufficient response to corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIGs), or splenectomy,<sup><xref rid="b4-1021342" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> and in Europe for adults with chronic ITP who are refractory to other treatments (e.g., corticosteroids, IVIGs).<sup><xref rid="b5-1021342" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Across 13 clinical studies of romiplostim in patients with primary ITP,<sup><xref rid="b6-1021342" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b16-1021342" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> romiplostim improved platelet counts, reduced bleeding, and reduced the use of concomitant medications compared with placebo or standard of care (SOC).

For each comparison, the confidence intervals around the rates for romiplostim and placebo/SOC did not overlap, showing a significant reduction in the event rates. The rate ratio for exposure-adjusted AE rates for romiplostim compared with placebo/SOC was 0.81 among nonsplenectomized patients (852 <italic>versus</italic> 1052 per 100 patient-years) and 0.66 among splenectomized patients (1226 <italic>versus</italic> 1857 per 100 patient-years).

The exposure-adjusted rate of any serious AE tended to be highest among splenectomized patients in the placebo/SOC group, followed in turn by nonsplenectomized patients in the placebo/SOC group, splenectomized patients in the romiplostim group, and nonsplenectomized patients in the romiplostim group. The relatively low number of fatal AEs made comparisons difficult.</p><p>Several prespecified AEs of interest were analyzed separately (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t4-1021342">Table 4</xref>). Splenectomized patients had a higher incidence of bleeding than nonsplenectomized patients within each treatment group. However, the incidence of bleeding was lower in the romiplostim group than in the placebo/SOC group in both cohorts. AE rates for infections were similar between the romiplostim and placebo/SOC groups, with a small increase in infections in splenectomized patients in each treatment group. Rates of AEs reported as bone marrow reticulin fibrosis, myelofibrosis, or reticulin increase were too small for meaningful comparisons between treatment groups or across subgroups. The overall rate of any thrombotic AE was similar between the romiplostim and placebo/SOC groups and similar between splenectomized and nonsplenectomized patients within each treatment group.</p><table-wrap id="t4-1021342" position="float"><label>Table 4.</label><caption><p>Rates of AEs of interest per 100 pt-yr (95% CI).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1021342.tab4"/></table-wrap><p>Types of thrombotic AEs (<italic>Online Supplementary Table S1</italic>) were also similar between treatment groups and between splenectomized and nonsplenectomized patients within each treatment group.

The median platelet count at the last measurement before a thrombotic AE was 150.0&#x000d7;10<sup>9</sup>/L in patients who received romiplostim and 52.5&#x000d7;10<sup>9</sup>/L in patients who received only placebo/SOC, and the platelet counts before a thrombotic event were similar between splenectomized and nonsplenectomized patients in the romiplostim group. The percentage of time that patients in the romiplostim group had a platelet count of 50&#x000d7;10<sup>9</sup>/L or greater, or 200&#x000d7;10<sup>9</sup>/L or greater, was similar between patients with or without thrombotic AEs (<italic>Online Supplementary Table S2</italic>).</p><p>Neutralizing antibodies to romiplostim were reported for 6 patients: 2 before romiplostim treatment and 4 after treatment was initiated. All 6 patients had a platelet response and a sustained platelet response, and none lost response to romiplostim following the detection of neutralizing antibodies.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this analysis of 1111 patients across 13 completed clinical studies of the TPO receptor agonist romiplostim, more than 1 in 3 patients underwent splenectomy before they entered the parent study. Platelet response rates following treatment with romiplostim were high in both splenectomized and nonsplenectomized patients, and median platelet counts were generally maintained in the target range with long-term romiplostim treatment in both populations. The observed response rate was higher in nonsplenectomized patients than in splenectomized patients. A sustained platelet response for 9 out of 12 weeks was achieved by 68% of splenectomized and 80% of nonsplenectomized patients given romiplostim in this pooled analysis. In 2 pivotal phase 3 studies, 38% of splenectomized and 61% of nonsplenectomized patients given romiplostim achieved durable platelet responses.<sup><xref rid="b10-1021342" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> In those studies, a durable platelet response was defined as platelet counts &#x02265;50&#x000d7;10<sup>9</sup>/L for &#x02265;6 of the last 8 weeks. Although the same ratio (75% of the weekly assessments) was used to define sustained platelet responses in this pooled analysis, the start of the 12-week interval was based on a platelet count of &#x02265;50&#x000d7;10<sup>9</sup>/L. Thus, the pivotal studies examined the proportion of patients who achieved durable platelet responses during a specific 8 week interval after dose stabilization, while this analysis examined the proportion of patients who sustained the response over any 12-week interval that began with a platelet response.</p><p>Interpretation of these results is complicated by the fact that the efficacy analysis pooled data across 9 studies (4 dose-finding studies used off-label doses of romiplostim and were not included in the efficacy analyses), and the splenectomized and nonsplenectomized patients were not balanced for other baseline characteristics. Splenectomized patients had more severe disease at baseline, as shown by the longer duration of ITP, a higher proportion that had used more than 3 prior ITP treatments, and a lower baseline platelet count at study entry compared with nonsplenectomized patients. The timing of splenectomy relative to other prior treatments was uncertain. Therefore, patients might have undergone splenectomy as second-line therapy or after multiple lines of therapy had failed.<sup><xref rid="b1-1021342" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b2-1021342" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="b41-1021342" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> Although the platelet responses to prior treatments were not recorded in these studies, the fact that 38% of splenectomized patients and 12% of nonsplenectomized patients received more than 3 prior lines of therapy suggests that the splenectomized patients in this analysis included more patients with treatment-resistant ITP. Exposure-adjusted rates of AEs and serious AEs were lower in the romiplostim group than in the placebo/SOC group. The difference in AE rates between the treatment groups was greater among splenectomized patients than among nonsplenectomized patients. Specifically, although splenectomized patients appeared to have more severe disease than nonsplenectomized patients at baseline, the responses to romiplostim were similar between the cohorts. Moreover, treatment with romiplostim was associated with a reduction of approximately 70% in the use of rescue medication compared with the placebo/SOC group in both splenectomized and nonsplenectomized patients. This reduction appeared to occur after initial dose titration for romiplostim, based on analyses of ITP medication use over time. The substantially greater use of concomitant medications in the placebo/SOC group may have contributed to the higher rates of AEs and serious AEs compared with patients treated with romiplostim. Notwithstanding the higher rate of AEs in splenectomized patients, the rate of serious AEs among this cohort who were treated with romiplostim was lower than that in nonsplenectomized patients in the placebo/SOC group. Thus, treatment had a greater impact on reducing the rate of serious AEs than did a prior history of splenectomy. No new safety issues or major increases in AEs were seen among romiplostim-treated splenectomized patients compared with romiplostim-treated nonsplenectomized patients in this analysis, which included the examination of specific AEs such as bleeding, infection, thrombosis, and bone marrow fibrosis. Previous research has shown that splenectomized patients have approximately a 2-fold to 4-fold greater risk of thrombotic events than nonsplenectomized patients,<sup><xref rid="b26-1021342" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="b27-1021342" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> and the risk may remain elevated more than 1 year after splenectomy.<sup><xref rid="b27-1021342" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> In this analysis, patients with a prior history of thrombotic events were excluded from some of the studies but were permitted to enroll in other studies.<sup><xref rid="b25-1021342" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> Therefore, we cannot speculate on how many patients with prior thrombotic events were not enrolled in these studies, which could have influenced the risk of subsequent thrombotic events after initiation of romiplostim or placebo/SOC treatment.</p><p>Rates of bone marrow reticulin fibrosis, myelofibrosis, or reticulin AEs were too low for meaningful comparisons between the splenectomized and nonsplenectomized patients, or between the romiplostim and placebo/SOC groups, but no worrisome signals were observed. These analyses were limited by the fact that in most of the studies, bone marrow data were only collected for patients with a documented bone marrow AE. Additionally, the actual time at which bone marrow AEs occurred could not be evaluated; only the time of detection by bone marrow biopsy was known. One of the studies included in this pooled analysis was a single-arm study that was designed to evaluate bone marrow findings from biopsies 1, 2, or 3 years after initiation of treatment with romiplostim. A separate publication of those findings<sup><xref rid="b14-1021342" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> showed that bone marrow changes were observed in a small proportion of patients who received long-term romiplostim treatment, including 3 out of 60 splenectomized patients and 6 out of 109 nonsplenectomized patients.</p><p>Several limitations of this pooled analysis should be noted. First, comparisons of efficacy and safety between splenectomized and nonsplenectomized patients were not among the planned analyses within the individual romiplostim studies. Some of the phase 3 studies enrolled only splenectomized patients or only nonsplenectomized patients; other studies enrolled both splenectomized and nonsplenectomized patients. The studies that enrolled both splenectomized and nonsplenectomized patients did not collect data for splenectomy during the study, which made it impossible to examine splenectomy rates in the romiplostim and placebo/SOC groups. In a 52-week study that was designed to address this question in nonsplenectomized patients, the rates of splenectomy on-study were significantly lower for romiplostim than SOC (9% <italic>versus</italic> 36%).<sup><xref rid="b11-1021342" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Second, investigators were not asked to report if an AE was related to prior splenectomy, so it was not possible to confirm the relatedness of splenectomy to safety outcomes. Third, comparisons between the romiplostim and placebo/SOC groups were limited by the differences in exposure to study treatment in each group. Eight out of 13 studies in this pooled analysis were single-arm evaluations of romiplostim, including 2 long-term open-label extension studies. Consequently, the sample sizes in this pooled analysis were much larger for romiplostim than for placebo/SOC and the total exposure to placebo/SOC was limited to 6 months or less for individual patients, whereas exposure to romiplostim could continue for several years. To address these discrepancies, analyses of AEs and rescue medication use were based on exposure-adjusted rates. After subdividing the population by treatment and splenectomy status, total exposure to placebo/SOC was only 11.2 patient-years in splenectomized patients and 97.7 patient-years in nonsplenectomized patients, <italic>versus</italic> exposure to romiplostim of 702.0 and 1129.7 patient-years, respectively. For the patients who received placebo/SOC in a controlled study and later received romiplostim in an extension study, efficacy and safety outcomes after the first dose of romiplostim were considered to be related to that treatment, but it is possible that SOC treatment could have impacted subsequent efficacy or safety outcomes. Fourth, the use of medications prior to study entry could have impacted efficacy and safety during the studies, but one of the pivotal studies (approximately 40% of patients in the analysis) did not collect information on prior medications. Moreover, in the other studies the only information available was whether a patient had received a medication previously, without details on the nature, intensity, or duration of prior treatment. Lastly, patients were permitted to receive rescue treatment such as IVIG, but not other investigational products or other TPO mimetics, which complicated the interpretation of platelet responses. Notwithstanding these limitations, the analyses reported herein address an important data gap regarding the safety and efficacy of romiplostim in splenectomized patients for whom therapeutic options are more limited.<sup><xref rid="b23-1021342" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup></p><p>In conclusion, this pooled analysis of data from 13 completed studies showed that romiplostim has a favorable safety profile, regardless of splenectomy status before treatment with romiplostim. Long-term treatment with romiplostim maintained platelet counts in the target range in both splenectomized and nonsplenectomized patients, and no new safety signal emerged. Importantly, romiplostim did not increase the risk of thromboembolic events in splenectomized patients compared to placebo/SOC. Based on this <italic>post hoc</italic> analysis, romiplostim appears to be a treatment option for patients with ITP with or without a history of failed splenectomy.</p></sec>
