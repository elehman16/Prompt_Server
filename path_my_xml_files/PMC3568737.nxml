It is the most common chronic disease of childhood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], resulting in a significant medical burden and the resultant healthcare costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The burden of this disease is increasing rapidly, with the most striking increases seen among children, the prevalence rates in some populations being greater than 30% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Although a multitude of causes contribute to childhood asthma, maternal smoking during pregnancy is a well-established contributor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], and it is a major modifiable risk factor, the elimination of which could significantly reduce the prevalence of childhood asthma. However, given that the tobacco industry continues to spend billions of dollars on advertising to attract young smokers, it is unlikely that the problem of smoking during pregnancy will go away any time soon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Approximately 250,000,000 women smoke daily world-wide. Twelve percent of US women still continue to smoke during pregnancy, resulting in the births of at least 400,000 smoke-exposed infants per year in the US [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. This aspect of the smoking-induced asthma etiology is particularly important since there is emerging evidence that, following <italic>in utero </italic>exposure to maternal smoke, asthma can be transmitted multigenerationally. For example, a questionnaire in the Children's Health Study from Southern California reported that grandmaternal smoking during pregnancy increases the risk of asthma in grandchildren regardless of the presence of maternal smoking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Yet there is neither experimental evidence nor any mechanistic explanation for this phenomenon. Using a well-established rat model of <italic>in utero </italic>nicotine exposure for childhood asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], we aimed to determine if <italic>in utero </italic>nicotine exposure would transmit asthma to the second generation offspring, and if epigenetic mechanism(s) could be involved in this transmission.</p><p>The mechanism linking smoke/nicotine exposure during pregnancy to multigenerational (MG) transmission of asthma is unknown. Since transmission via the germline is the most likely explanation for the non-genetic MG transmission phenomenon, we rationalized that epigenetic modifications of the germline explain MG transmission of perinatal nicotine-induced asthma. For example, a change in the organism's environment, that is, smoke/nicotine exposure (of the F0 generation), can result in modifications in gene expression through alterations in DNA methylation, histone (H) modification, non-coding RNA, and/or protein structure and assembly without changing the DNA sequence of the F1 germline, which can be transmitted to subsequent generations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. However, whether epigenetic marks such as alterations in DNA methylation and/or H modifications acquired in one generation can be inherited by the next generation is not clear. While one study reported that the acquired DNA methylation marks are not transmitted to subsequent generations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], another study came to the opposite conclusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. We hypothesize that smoke/nicotine-induced epigenetic marks can become permanently programmed and transferred through the germline to subsequent generations, resulting in altered phenotypic changes at the cellular and consequent organismal levels (for example, asthma in the case of <italic>in utero </italic>smoke/nicotine exposure) in the offspring over multiple subsequent generations, for example, F2, F3, and so on.</p><p>Furthermore, the effect of the child's gender on asthma risk following perinatal exposure to cigarette smoke is not clear since an increased risk in both boys [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] and girls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] has previously been reported. However, since there is emerging evidence to suggest that finely-tuned developmental programs, such as that of the lung, may be sensitive to specific environmental challenges in a sex-specific manner, particularly during the developmental programming and gametogenesis stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], and since maternal smoking is known to affect fetal growth more profoundly in the male fetus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], we also hypothesized that there would be a sexual dimorphism in asthma risk following <italic>in utero </italic>smoke exposure, with males being more susceptible than females.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Materials</title><p>Nicotine bitartrate was acquired from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA) and rosiglitazone (RGZ) from Cayman Chemical (Chicago, IL, USA). DNA methylation (cat#: P-1034-96), H3 (cat#: P-4008-96) and H4 (cat#: P-4009-96) acetylation kits were obtained from Epigentek (Farmingdale, NY, USA).

Dams were randomized to receive placebo (diluent, normal saline), nicotine (1 mg/kg, s.c.) alone, or nicotine (1 mg/kg), and the PPAR&#x003b3; agonist RGZ (3 mg/kg, i.p.) in 100 &#x003bc;L volumes once daily from embryonic day 6 to postnatal day (PND) 21. The dams were allowed free access to water and pair-fed according to the previous day's intake by the nicotine group animals and were maintained in a 12:12-hour light-dark cycle. Following delivery at term, the F1 pups were allowed to breast feed <italic>ad libitum</italic>. At PND21 the pups were either subjected to pulmonary function tests (PFTs) and then killed, or killed and their lungs and tracheas collected for airway contractility protein levels, fibroblast isolation, and tracheal tension studies. The gonads were collected to determine epigenetic marks. Some F1 animals were weaned at PND21 and maintained as breeders to generate F2 rats, but without any exposure to nicotine in the F1 pregnancy. At PND21, F2 animals underwent studies similar to those performed on F1 animals. All studies were approved by the Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institutional Review Board and were conducted in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.</p><p>The dose (1 mg/kg) chosen for the nicotine treatment has previously been shown to result in an asthma phenotype in the offspring in a number of studies (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]) and is comparable to the dose of nicotine to which habitual smokers are exposed, that is, approximately 1 mg/kg/body weight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. As further support for the doses of nicotine and RGZ used in this study, pulmonary function changes induced following perinatal exposure to 1 mg/kg/day nicotine, administered s.c., were recently shown to be blocked by the concomitant i.p. administration of 3 mg/kg/day RGZ (20). It is also important to note that this dose of RGZ has previously been shown to block hyperoxia-induced neonatal lung injury as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Two animals were used for each condition per experiment, and each experiment was repeated at least three times.</p></sec><sec><title>Lung fibroblast isolation</title><p>PND21 rat lung fibroblasts were cultured according to previously described methods, with slight modifications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Briefly, the lungs were removed and put into Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) and chopped into small pieces. The HBSS was decanted and 5 volumes of 0.05% trypsin were added to the lung preparation. The lungs were dissociated in a 37&#x000b0;C water bath using a Teflon stirring bar to disrupt the tissue mechanically. Once the tissue was dispersed into a unicellular suspension, the cells were pelleted at 500 &#x000d7; <italic>g </italic>for 10 minutes at room temperature in a 50-mL polystyrene centrifuge tube. The supernatant was decanted, and the pellet was resuspended in minimal essential medium (MEM) containing 10% FBS to yield a mixed cell suspension of approximately 3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>8 </sup>cells, as determined using a Coulter particle counter (Beckman-Coulter, Hayaleah, FL, USA). The cell suspension was then added to culture flasks (75 cm<sup>2</sup>) for 30 to 60 minutes to allow for the differential adherence of lung fibroblasts. These cells are greater than 95% pure fibroblasts based upon vimentin-positive staining.</p></sec><sec><title>Pulmonary function testing</title><p>Measurement of respiratory function was performed with a plethysmograph for restrained animals (Buxco Inc, Troy, NY, USA); the pups were deeply anesthetized and sedated with ketamine (70 mg/kg, Bioniche Teoranta Inverin, Co., Galway, Ireland), and xylazine (7 mg/kg, Akorn, Inc., Decatur, IL, USA), tracheostomized and ventilated. Rats were exposed to increasing concentrations of aerosolized methacholine (0, 1.25, 2.5, 5, 10, and 20 mg/ml) over a period of 3 minutes. Lung resistance (Rrs) and dynamic compliance (Cdyn) were plotted as a function of the methacholine concentration administered.</p></sec><sec><title>Tracheal constriction studies</title><p>The trachea was excised <italic>en bloc </italic>immediately after sacrifice and dissected free of connective tissue in ice-cold modified Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer (in mM: 118.3 NaCl, 4.7 KCl, 2.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.2 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 1.2 KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 25.0 NaHCO<sub>3 </sub>and 11.1 glucose). Subsequently, an approximately 6 mm tracheal ring was resected from the midsection and used for tracheal tension studies. The tracheal ring was suspended in an organ chamber filled with 10 ml of modified Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate solution maintained at 37 &#x000b1; 0.5&#x000b0;C and aerated with 95% O<sub>2</sub>-5% CO<sub>2 </sub>(pH 7.4). Each ring was suspended via two stirrups that were passed through the lumen: one stirrup was anchored to the bottom of the organ chamber and the other stirrup was connected to a strain gauge (model FT03C, Grass Instrument, Quincy, MA, USA) for the measurement of isometric force, as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>At the beginning of the experiment, each tracheal ring was stretched to its optimal resting tension, which was achieved by step-wise stretching in 0.1-g increments until the contractile response to 100 mM KCl reached a plateau. The optimal resting tension was measured, and then each tracheal ring was allowed to equilibrate for one hour after it was brought to its optimal resting tension. The effects of acetylcholine were determined at least 30 minutes after the administration of nitro-L-arginine (1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-4 </sup>M, an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase).

Further, we determined if the nicotine effects on histone methylation and acetylation were affected by RGZ, which has been shown to normalize the structural and functional effects of nicotine on the offspring lung phenotype at F1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The nicotine-induced increase in lung H3 acetylation was blocked (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9b</xref>) by RGZ treatment, whereas there was no effect on global DNA methylation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9a</xref>) or on the nicotine-induced decrease in H4 acetylation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9c</xref>), suggesting a central role of H3 acetylation in mediating nicotine's effects on the pulmonary phenotype. Finally, it is reassuring to note that perinatal exposure of the gonads to RGZ by itself did not result in any significant changes in global gonadal DNA methylation or in H3 and H4 acetylation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>).</p><fig id="F9" position="float"><label>Figure 9</label><caption><p><bold>Effect of rosiglitazone (RGZ) in perinatal nicotine exposure-induced changes in global DNA methylation and histone (H) 3 and 4 acetylation in the lungs and gonads of F1 rats</bold>.

For example, in the lungs the nicotine-induced increase in lung H3 acetylation was blocked by RGZ, whereas there was no effect on global DNA methylation or on the nicotine-induced decrease in H4 acetylation; in the testes, the nicotine-induced increase in DNA methylation and H4 acetylation were blocked, without any effect on H3 acetylation; and in the ovaries, the nicotine-induced decrease in DNA methylation and increase in H4 acetylation were blocked without any effect on H3 acetylation.

In sharp contrast, nicotine treatment only affected the tracheal contractility of the male offspring. The functional effects of nicotine on the naive offspring were accompanied by increased expression of contractile proteins in the whole lung, as well as in the associated isolated lung fibroblasts, accompanied by decreased PPAR&#x003b3; expression. These nicotine-induced changes in lung function and mesenchymal protein expression, accompanied by decreased PPAR&#x003b3; expression, are consistent with the effect of nicotine on myofibroblast differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Even more importantly, along with the normalization of the asthma phenotype in the F1 and F2 offspring, most of the nicotine-induced lung and gonadal epigenetic changes were also normalized. For example, nicotine-induced increases in H3 acetylation in the lung, DNA methylation and H4 acetylation in the testis, and the decrease in DNA methylation and increase in H4 acetylation in the ovaries of F1 offspring were normalized by RGZ treatment, but it had no effect on lung H4 acetylation, providing further mechanistic specificity regarding the nature of the epigenetic mechanism. Given these insights, we will extend these studies to F3 and F4 generation offspring in future studies.</p><p>Since ruling out genetic and environmental confounders is extremely difficult in humans, there is only scant evidence for MG epigenetic effects for any condition in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]; and in fact, there is none for asthma. Recently emerging evidence suggests that the phenotype of an individual is the cumulative result of complex interactions between the genotype and its current, past and ancestral environments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Therefore, it is logical to speculate a role for ancestral cigarette smoke exposure in the child's asthma predisposition. Yet, as pointed out above, there is no evidence for this, other than the data from the Children's Health Study from Southern California [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>In contrast to other species, the evidence for fetal programming as a mode of MG transmission of traits in humans is very limited. For example, mothers from the Dutch Hunger Winter who were exposed to famine as fetuses delivered offspring of lower birth weights than those with no fetal exposure to famine, although this was not confirmed in a subsequent study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. There is also evidence of increased morbidity and mortality associated with parental and grandparental nutritional status, suggesting a role for fetal programming, possibly via epigenetic mechanisms to account for the MG effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. In contrast to the very limited data in humans, in a variety of animal models gestational exposure to carcinogens, endocrine disruptors, and other toxins has been shown to have MG effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>].</p><p>The present study is groundbreaking in our understanding of the mechanisms potentially involved in the transmission of epigenetic human diseases, which to date have only been speculated, albeit based on strong epidemiologic grounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. The observation that nicotine exposure <italic>in utero </italic>affects the F1 offspring DNA methylation of the testes and ovaries, and that H3 acetylation was increased in the lungs and testes of F1 male offspring in association with male-specific increased tracheal constriction is the first demonstration of an epigenetic effect of nicotine on both gametocytes and somatocytes. Furthermore, the specific inhibition of this effect of nicotine on H3 acetylation by RGZ, which we have previously shown to block the nicotine-induced asthma phenotype in F1 offspring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], provides a unique molecular genetic insight to the MG mechanism of nicotine action. It must be borne in mind, however, that these offspring's developing gonads had been exposed to nicotine <italic>in utero</italic>, leaving open the possibility that the effect was not a bona fide transgenerational effect, but was rather only MG. However, the transmission of the asthma phenotype to the F2 generation, both structurally and functionally, and its prevention by a specifically-targeted molecular intervention is the first unequivocal demonstration of MG transmission of an epigenetically-mediated effect on the offspring phenotype. The fact that the phenotypic effect was on asthma, a well-recognized epidemiologic example of epigenetic transmission of the cause of a public health epidemic, makes this series of experiments all the more significant and noteworthy. This, and the recent finding that even 'thirdhand smoke' can induce the asthma phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>], portends new and rational ways of thinking about effectively coping with the health hazards that abound all around us [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>].</p><p>At first glance, it might seem surprising that the nicotine effect on the asthma phenotype is sex-specific. However, there is a documented association between gender and airway size, first referred to as dysanapsis by Mead [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>], in which he showed that boys and women had self-similar airway structure that was distinctly different from that of men. Those data suggest that androgens may differentially affect airway development. We have previously shown that androgens affect the rate of lung development in rabbits and rats by inhibiting the glucocorticoid-induced differentiation of lung fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>], consistent with their effect on lipofibroblast differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>], which determines lung development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. The airway narrowing of dysanapsis has also been shown to be associated with asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. Therefore, androgens may precipitate asthma through a common genetic mechanism, since they, like nicotine, stimulate the Wnt pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>] and down-regulate PPAR&#x003b3; expression in lung fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p><p>The compelling epigenetic data presented here potentially shift the current paradigm for our understanding of childhood asthma, and for the first time implicate epigenetics as the underlying cause for increased MG asthma following <italic>in utero </italic>exposure to maternal smoking. In fact, the data provided herein not only provide novel mechanistic information underlying the MG asthma risk, but also pave the way for studying the molecular mechanisms underlying MG effects for a host of other environmental toxins, agonists and antagonists as well.</p><p>It is important to point out that although there are many agents in cigarette smoke that may be detrimental to the developing lung, there is plenty of evidence to support nicotine as the main agent that alters fetal lung development: nicotine crosses the human placenta with minimal biotransformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]; it accumulates in fetal blood, maternal milk, amniotic fluid, and several fetal tissues, including the respiratory tract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>], and has been shown to have direct effects on pulmonary alveolar epithelial cells and interstitial fibroblasts isolated from the developing lung [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>]. Therefore, it is not surprising that nicotine exposure during pregnancy is an extensively utilized and well-accepted model to study the effects of cigarette smoke on the developing lung in general, and on asthma in particular [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. It is also important to emphasize that the main effects of <italic>in utero </italic>nicotine exposure on lung growth and development are due to specific alterations in signaling pathways involved in lung development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>], rather than being due to irreversible disruption by teratogenic or toxicological effects. This feature offers the opportunity for targeted interventions to modulate the effects of <italic>in utero </italic>nicotine exposure, in contrast to toxic or teratologic effects, which would be unlikely to be effectively blocked by any intervention.</p><p>It could be argued that the epigenetic marks in the gonads and lung are epiphenomena, and that the RGZ 'rescue' of the normal lung phenotype is an artifact. However, there is experimental evidence that methylation of H3/H4 results in down-regulation of PPAR&#x003b3; expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>], mechanistically linking the epigenetic effect of nicotine with decreased lipofibroblast expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>From the data included here we conclude that the pulmonary effects of nicotine exposure during pregnancy are not restricted only to the offspring of the exposed pregnancy, but are also transmitted to subsequent generation, possibly through germline epigenetic alterations, and, even more importantly, these effects can be blocked by targeted molecular interventions. Moreover, these data not only provide novel mechanistic information underlying the multigeneration transmission of asthma risk following exposure to maternal smoke during pregnancy, but also set precedence for studying other such environmental toxins that might have multigenerational or transgenerational effects.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>BSA: bovine serum albumin; Cdyn: dynamic compliance; F0, F1, F2: parent, first, and second generations; FBS: fetal bovine serum; HAT: histone acetyl transferase; HBSS: Hanks' balanced salt solution; HDAC: histone deacetylase; H3, H4: histones 3 and 4; MEM: minimal essential medium; MG: multigenerational; PFT: pulmonary function test; PND: postnatal day; PPAR&#x003b3;: peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; RGZ: rosiglitazone maleate; Rrs: lung resistance; RT-PCR: reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction; &#x003b1;-SMA: &#x003b1;-smooth muscle actin.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>VKR conceived the study, participated in study design, helped and coordinated the acquisition of data and its interpretation, and wrote the first draft the manuscript.
