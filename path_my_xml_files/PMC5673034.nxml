In a bioequivalence study, ETV from Dong-A ST (Baracle<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) was found to have a pharmacokinetic profile equivalent to ETV from Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS) (Baraclude<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>). The present study was conducted to evaluate the antiviral activity and safety of ETV from Dong-A ST in comparison to ETV from BMS in patients with CHB.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In this multicenter, double-blind, active-controlled, stratified-randomized, parallel group, comparative trial, 118 treatment-na&#x000ef;ve patients with CHB were randomly assigned to receive either 0.5 mg of ETV from Dong-A ST or ETV from BMS once daily for 48 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was virologic improvement (a mean reduction from baseline in serum HBV DNA levels) at 24 weeks. Secondary efficacy endpoints included a mean reduction in serum HBV DNA levels at 48 weeks, proportion of patients with undetectable levels of serum HBV DNA, rates of hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) loss and seroconversion, rates of HBsAg loss and seroconversion, and rates of normalization of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>From baseline to week 24, HBV DNA levels (log<sub>10</sub>) decreased by 4.81 and 4.63 with ETV from Dong-A ST and with ETV from BMS, respectively. The upper limit of two-sided 95% confidence intervals (CI) (equivalent to one-sided 97.5% CIs) for the difference between the treatment groups was 0.208, which was below the noninferiority margin of 1, thus supporting the noninferiority of ETV from Dong-A ST in comparison to ETV from BMS. No statistically significant differences were noted between the treatment groups in all secondary and tertiary efficacy endpoints. Safety profiles were also similar between the two groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In patients with previously untreated HBeAg-positive or negative HBV infection, the efficacy of ETV from Dong-A ST was noninferior to that of ETV from BMS, and there were no significant differences in efficacy or safety between two groups.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>chronic hepatitis B</kwd><kwd>generic</kwd><kwd>ETV from Dong-A ST (Baracle<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>)</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Hepatitis B is a chronic liver disease caused by hepatotrophic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Approximately 2 billion people worldwide are exposed to HBV and more than 350 million people are chronically infected therewith.<xref rid="b1-dddt-11-3145" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> HBV is also a major cause of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The prevalence of HBV infection worldwide differs among geographic areas, and proportions of carriers vary from 0.1% to 15%. In Korea, HBV infections have gradually decreased since commercialization of the hepatitis B vaccine (1990s), although 3.7% of the population is still infected.<xref rid="b2-dddt-11-3145" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b4-dddt-11-3145" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p><p>The goal of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) treatment is to suppress the proliferation of HBV. By inhibiting HBV proliferation, inflammation is relieved, and fibrosis, cirrhosis, liver failure, or HCC can be prevented. Thereby, it is possible to reduce mortality due to liver disease and to improve the survival rate thereof.<xref rid="b5-dddt-11-3145" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Although the ideal treatment goal is loss of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), complete treatment of HBV is almost impossible, because nuclear covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) remains after treatment. In clinical practice, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) normalization, nondetection of serum HBV DNA, serum hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) loss or seroconversion, and histologic improvement are used as treatment response indicators.<xref rid="b6-dddt-11-3145" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p><p>Entecavir (ETV) is a deoxyguanosine nucleoside analog that is converted to its active form, ETV-triphosphate, in vivo. ETV-triphosphate exerts antiviral effects by inhibiting three steps of replication: priming of HBV DNA polymerase, reverse transcription of the HBV DNA negative strand from pregenomic mRNA, and synthesis of the HBV DNA positive strand.<xref rid="b7-dddt-11-3145" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="b8-dddt-11-3145" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p><p>In a Phase III clinical trial, ETV was shown to be superior to lamivudine in terms of histologic improvement, reduction of HBV DNA levels from baseline, proportion of patients with undetectable HBV DNA, and ALT normalization.<xref rid="b9-dddt-11-3145" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="b10-dddt-11-3145" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> ETV is now widely used as a standard therapeutic agent for CHB and is recommended as a first-line treatment by international and domestic guidelines, including the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD), European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL), Asian Pacific Association for the Study of the Liver (APASL), and Korean Association for the Study of the Liver (KASL).<xref rid="b6-dddt-11-3145" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b11-dddt-11-3145" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="b12-dddt-11-3145" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p><p>Baracle<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> is a ETV product developed by Dong-A ST based on a pharmacokinetic profile equivalent to ETV from BMS in bioequivalence tests. However, studies have yet to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of ETV from Dong-A ST in comparison with ETV from BMS for CHB patients.

The proportions of patients with HBV DNA &#x0003c;300 copies/mL at weeks 24 and 48 were also not different between the two groups (66.7% vs 50.0% at week 24, 81.5% vs 71.0% at week 48). Thus, the overall antiviral activity was deemed to be comparable between ETV from Dong-A ST and ETV from BMS. In particular, the rates of undetectable serum HBV DNA levels in the present study were similar with ETV pivotal clinical trials, wherein the rates were 67% in HBeAg-positive patients and 90% in HBeAg-negative patients.<xref rid="b9-dddt-11-3145" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="b10-dddt-11-3145" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p><p>Because of relatively short treatment period of 1 year, the rates of HBeAg loss might not be fully evaluated or compared in HBeAg-positive patients. Nonetheless, the HBeAg loss rates at week 48 were not different between two groups: 9.7% in ETV from Dong-A ST and 8.3% in ETV from BMS group.</p><p>A major concern regarding generic antiviral agent for HBV infection would be whether it can show bioequivalence, comparable efficacy, and safety in real patients. First, ETV from Dong-A ST demonstrated an equivalent pharmacokinetic profile to ETV from BMS in bioequivalence tests. When ETV from Dong-A ST or ETV from BMS 0.5 mg Tab was administered in 36 healthy male adults, the two-sided 90% CI of C<sub>max</sub> and AUC<sub>t</sub> were 1.0366&#x02013;1.1740 and 0.9605&#x02013;1.1149, respectively. Thus, it was confirmed that they were within the acceptable bioequivalence range of 0.80&#x02013;1.25. Second, in this multicenter, prospective randomized trial, antiviral potency indicated by serum HBV DNA declines at weeks 24 (primary endpoint) and 48 (secondary endpoint) and the proportions of patients with HBV DNA &#x0003c;300 copies/mL (secondary endpoint) were not different between the two drugs. Lastly, there was a similar safety profile in the ETV from Dong-A ST and ETV from BMS groups. Most of adverse events were mild, and there were rare ADRs or SAEs. In addition, there was no case of SADR. In particular, ETV is known not to be related to nephrotoxicity or loss of bone density. In our study, both ETV from Dong-A ST and from BMS did not result in elevation of serum creatinine or decrease of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) during study period (data not shown).</p><p>Although regulation authority does not request a manufacturer to conduct clinical trials to approve a generic drug, data comparing efficacy and safety between generic and branded drugs are sometimes necessary. This is because, in a survey, 25% of physicians stated that they would only increase prescribing generic drugs if additional clinical trials were presented.<xref rid="b20-dddt-11-3145" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></p><p>This study has a strength in that efficacy and safety were compared between original and generic anti-HBV drugs by a well-designed randomized trial. This is the first report to show the comparable efficacy and safety of generic anti-HBV drug. A limitation of this study is a relative short (1 year) duration of drug administration, which may not allow for the comparison of long-term virologic and/or biochemical responses between the two drugs.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, we demonstrated that ETV from Dong-A ST is not inferior to ETV from BMS in treatment-na&#x000ef;ve HBeAg (+) or HBeAg (&#x02212;) patients in terms of HBV DNA reduction, rates of HBeAg seroconversion, ALT normalization, and efficacy profile.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This study was sponsored by Dong-A ST Co., the manufacturer of Baracle<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>.
