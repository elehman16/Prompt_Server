The present management of DM it not satisfactory. Hence, alternative systems of medicine are also being explored. <italic>Prameha</italic> as described in Ayurveda is a disease synonymous with today's DM. The patients of <italic>Prameha</italic> inherently carry the risk of impaired <italic>Agni</italic> and depleted <italic>Ojas</italic> status, that is, hypometabolic and immuno-compromised state. Now the primary goal is not merely to achieve normoglycemia, but also to minimize its complications. In this context, many Ayurvedic drugs are undergoing extensive research.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Aim:</title><p>To evaluate the anti-diabetic, immune-enhancer and biofire balancing effects of <italic>Naimittika Rasayana</italic> drugs viz. <italic>Silajatu</italic> and <italic>Mamajjaka</italic> in type-2 DM.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>A total of 95 patients of type-2 DM were registered; in which 84 patients turned up for full follow-up. Patients were randomly allocated into three groups; Group-A was treated with <italic>Mamajjaka</italic> (500mg twice a day) and Group-B with <italic>Silajatu</italic> (500mg twice a day) and Group-C was treated with modern drug and assessment was done at monthly intervals for three months.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Results:</title><p>The selected <italic>Rasayana</italic> drugs have shown good response on subjective and objective parameters.

The etymology, etiology, pathogenesis, clinical features, complications, prognosis and treatment of this disease are described in an extremely rational perspective. The concept of DM as known in conventional western medicine would reveal that this disease was fairly well-known even in the classical period of Ayurveda.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>The role of genetic and hereditary factors as described in the context of <italic>Sahaja Prameha</italic> (simulating juvenile type-1 diabetes) and the role of high-calorie diet and sedentary habits have been described as the sheet anchors of <italic>Madhumeha</italic> diathesis. This idea seems to be amazingly contemporary. Similarly, the description of two types of diabetes under the terms, (1) <italic>Krisha Pramehi</italic>, that is, thin diabetic and (2) <italic>Sthula Pramehi</italic>, that is, obese diabetic warranting distinctly different lines of management in Ayurveda again appears quite similar to the classification of diabetes as type-1 and type-2 in modern medicine suggesting the quality treatment modalities.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>The Ayurvedic texts describe the prodromal features and characteristic symptoms of <italic>Prameha/Madhumeha</italic> with great clarity and objectivity. The texts also deliberate on the prognosis of this disease putting emphasis on the fact that this disease is difficult to treat. Several complications, including neuropathy, angiopathy, uropathy, retinopathy and proneness to infections, including the formation of carbuncles have been described with their diagnosis and treatment in Ayurvedic classics.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>Ayurveda largely involves <italic>Nidana Parivarjana</italic>, that is, elimination of the cause, dietary restrictions and exercise besides a range of herbal and herbo-mineral formulations for the treatment of different kinds of diabetes.

The Ayurvedic dietetics, lifestyle management including <italic>Sadvritta</italic> and <italic>Achara</italic> (code of conduct) are emphasized.</p><p>The Ayurvedic texts describe <italic>Silajatu</italic> as a <italic>Naimittika Rasayana</italic> for <italic>Prameha</italic> and hence it is advisable to use <italic>Silajatu</italic> in prediabetics and/or in diabetic management as an adjuvant therapy for promotive and preventive measure.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Classically <italic>Silajatu</italic> is well known for its <italic>Naimittika Rasayana</italic> effect, <italic>Ojovardhaka</italic> and <italic>Pramehaghna</italic> property.

Possibly, because of such morbid factors, the propounders of Ayurveda considered <italic>Ojas</italic> as an important <italic>Dusya</italic> (morbid factor) of <italic>Madhumeha</italic>, hence it is also termed as <italic>Ojomeha</italic>. <italic>Medas</italic> or the bodily lipids have strong association with DM and obesity, which may lead to a variety of other disorders.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] <italic>Medas</italic> with or without <italic>Ama</italic> is predicted to play a major role in the development of DM and its complications.</p><p>Conventional modern medicine is not always successful to control diabetes in all cases. Insulin is not always indicated due to the development of insulin resistance and generation of Insulin antagonists in the body, whereas the oral hypoglycemic drugs are found to be of limited use in many cases due to the major side-effects. Therefore, search for better remedies from Ayurvedic resources continues. The present study identifies a treatment strategy that not only corrects the metabolic derangements, but also helps in maintaining the <italic>Agni</italic> and <italic>Ojas</italic> status, that is, metabolic stability and immune strength in diabetic patients.</p><p>This study is based on investigations of 95 diagnosed cases of <italic>Madhumeha</italic> (DM-2), out of which 11 patients dropped out mostly because of change of place and only 84 patients could be studied under clinical trial of the two selected drugs along with a group of patients under conventional treatment for comparative purpose. In this study, <italic>Mamajjaka</italic> shows better results as compared to other groups. It is suggested that a combined treatment of DM with <italic>Mamajjaka</italic> and <italic>Silajatu</italic> could give still better results. <italic>Silajatu</italic>[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] being a <italic>Naimittika Rasayana</italic> and <italic>Mamajjaka</italic>[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] being a therapeutic agent for this purpose could jointly form the full treatment modality for DM.</p><p>This study also suggests that the selected drugs help in preventing or delaying the complications in DM. The selected <italic>Rasayana</italic> drugs (<italic>Silajatu</italic> and <italic>Mamajjaka</italic>) by virtue of their <italic>Rasayana</italic> properties act at the level of <italic>Agni</italic>, <italic>Srotasa</italic> and <italic>Rasa</italic>, providing nourishment to the <italic>Sapta Dhatu</italic> [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">Table 5</xref>].[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</p><p>The <italic>Mamajjaka</italic> treated patients have shown better percentage of fall in FBS (19.47%), in comparison to <italic>Silajatu</italic> treated patients (8.93%) while in case of PPBS the percentage of fall was almost equal in both the groups, that is, 24.03%, but the patients on conventional treatment showed more or less equal percentage of fall in both fasting and PPBS level. The special pattern of blood sugar response to <italic>Silajatu</italic> treatment (in relation to fasting and PP) deserves special consideration [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>].</p><p>Clinically, it was also observed that <italic>Mamajjaka</italic> treated patients showed a noticeable response in overall neurological symptoms. <italic>Silajatu</italic> treated patients showed significant and modern medicine treated patients showed an insignificant response in neurological symptoms in intergroup comparison.</p><p>The probable mode of action of the trial drugs in terms of conventional bio-sciences, cannot be explained at this stage. This study is largely an efficacy-validating investigation. It is not a mechanism testing study. <italic>Silajatu</italic> has been described as <italic>Naimittika Rasayana</italic> for <italic>Prameha</italic> by <italic>Susruta</italic> and <italic>Dalhana</italic> and <italic>Mamajjaka</italic> is in practice and being used by many Ayurveda physicians in India.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The present clinical study shows that the selected <italic>Rasayana</italic> drugs may help to control blood sugar levels in mild to moderate diabetic patients and may retard the complications of DM. However, further longitudinal studies are warranted to explore the mode of action of these drugs in preventing neurological complications of DM. Although it is difficult to presume the possible mechanism of action of these drugs at this stage of study, but the authors are inclined to suggest that in view of their <italic>Naimittika Rasayana</italic> impact these drugs are likely to promote insulin production. Beside this, these drugs have capacity to improve overall health status of diabetic subjects. It was also observed that these <italic>Rasayana</italic> remedies not only correct the hyperglycemic episodes, but also produce their effect by enhancing the <italic>Agni</italic> and <italic>Ojas</italic> status in these patients, meaning thereby an improved metabolic and immune status. The <italic>Rasayana</italic> drugs used in this study seem to be safe, because no side-effects were noted in trial period in the present study.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn
