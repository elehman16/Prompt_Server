Even though it is a benign and self-limiting disease, in many patients it can lead to significant physical, social and psychological morbidity.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] A variety of treatment options has been tried with varying results. It has been postulated that Bell's palsy occurs as an inflammatory reaction to viral infection. However, the role of antiviral drugs is controversial.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Corticosteroids, currently, remain the single most important treatment option.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Bell's palsy, usually, occur rapidly, and any pharmacological intervention is difficult. Intravenous (IV) corticosteroids are of proven value in similar acute inflammatory neurological illness such as multiple sclerosis, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis and transverse myelitis. Hence, it is worthwhile to study the value of IV corticosteroids vis-&#x000e0;-vis oral corticosteroids. In this study, we compared the efficacy of a single dose of 500 mg of IV methylprednisolone with a 10 days oral prednisolone regime on recovery of patients with Bell's palsy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>The study was designed as an open labeled, randomized controlled trial. The study was conducted between August 2011 and October 2013. Patients were enrolled from the outdoor services of the Department of Neurology, King George's Medical University, Lucknow, India. Institutional Ethics Committee approved the study. Informed consent was taken from all the patients before inclusion in the study.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title/><sec id="sec3-1"><title>Inclusion Criteria</title><p>We recruited adult patients with unilateral acute facial palsy of no identifiable cause, within 1-week of onset.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-2"><title>Exclusion Criteria</title><p>Patients with any of the following conditions were excluded: pregnancy, diabetes, severe hypertension, renal or hepatic disease, gastric or duodenal ulcer, presence of acute otitis media or ipsilateral chronic otitis, recent head injury, psychiatric disease or any other condition where the use of corticosteroids was contraindicated.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-3"><title>Randomization and Treatment Allocation</title><p>The patients were divided into two groups, according to a pre-generated computerized randomization table. Patients in group 1 received a single dose of 500 mg of IV infusion of methylprednisolone while those in group 2 received oral prednisolone in a tapering dosage schedule (60 mg daily for initial 5 days, tapered by 10 mg daily over next 5 days).</p></sec><sec id="sec3-4"><title>Follow-up and Outcome Assessment</title><p>All patients were followed for a minimum of 3 months after inclusion, and the outcome analysis was done at 1-month and at 3 months. Cut-off at 1-month and 3 months were used to study the short-term recovery patterns, defined as recovery occurring in &#x0003c;4 months.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] The primary outcome was assessed using the House&#x02013;Brackmann grading system for facial nerve function, which assigns patients to 1 of 6 categories. Grade 1 indicates normal function, while Grade 6 indicates no facial function. Intermediate severity grades were defined as slight (Grade 2), moderate (Grade 3), moderately severe (Grade 4) and severe (Grade 5) depending upon the loss of tone, magnitude of weakness, and presence of synkinesis, contracture or hemifacial spasm.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Patients were also advised to communicate telephonically or report immediately in case of any serious adverse event. Possible adverse events were evaluated at each study visit. Assessment of the patients was carried out on the basis of grade of palsy as well as early (&#x02264;3 days) versus late (between 4 and 7 days) initiation of treatment regimes. Final outcome was measured in terms of complete recovery of the facial nerve function (Grade 1 of House&#x02013;Brackmann grading system) at 3 months.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-5"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>The results were expressed as percentage and mean &#x000b1; standard deviation. The Chi-square Fisher exact test, where ever applicable, was used to compare the dichotomous variables. The Chi-square for trend analysis was used to compare categorical variables. The unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test was used to compare continuous variables. <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered as significant.

We observed that a single dose administration of IV methylprednisolone is as effective as 10 days treatment with oral prednisolone in patients with acute Bell's palsy. Treatment options for patients of Bell's palsy are aimed to facilitate functional recovery. Treatment options include corticosteroids and antiviral drugs, alone or in combination. Even without treatment, a large number of patients (approximately 70%) recover completely within 6 months and approximately 30% of patients may not recover completely.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] We noted that approximately 80% patients recovered completely at 3 months of treatment with either IV methylprednisolone or oral prednisolone. Intravenous methylprednisolone resulted in nonsignificantly better functional recovery rate especially at 1-month when assessed against oral prednisolone and in terms of early institution of treatment (&#x02264;3 days). Combined treatment with a corticosteroid and an antiviral agent has been shown to be more effective in treating severe to complete Bell's palsy than corticosteroid treatment alone.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Physical therapy appears to be effective only in the more severe Bell's palsy, whereas less severe Bell's palsy might result in complete spontaneous recovery, regardless of physical therapy.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>We showed that grade of Bell's palsy (severity) is the most important prognostic determinant for recovery. Our results are similar to those reported by Sullivan <italic>et al</italic>. who found that patients with facial palsy of lower grades had a better outcome.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Grade 6 patients infrequently had complete recovery. In patients with Bell's palsy, early treatment with prednisolone significantly improves the chances of complete recovery at 3 and 9 months. Consistent with these findings; our results also suggested that treatment of Bell's palsy should be commenced promptly.</p><p>In majority number of patients, facial nerve spontaneously and completely recovers. The limitation of our study was the non-inclusion of a control group owing to an ethical concern of depriving patients of a recommended form of treatment.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] The study was targeted to look for short-term recovery patterns; an extension to 6 months would have provided more details of patients with incomplete recovery or those in the process of recuperation.</p><p>A multicentric double-blind study, with a longer follow-up, may be done to study the efficacy of the two corticosteroids. A 5 days regimen of IV methylprednisolone, for severe Bell's palsy, also needs to be investigated.</p><table-wrap id="T3" position="float"><caption><p>CONSORT 2010 checklist for clinical trials</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJPharm-47-143-g004"/></table-wrap></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Single dose of 500 mg of IV methylprednisolone may be an equally efficacious alternative to a 10 days course of oral prednisolone.
