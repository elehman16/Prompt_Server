Analysis of covariance was used to compare mean changes from baseline in DASH scores, as well as the secondary continuous outcomes. The primary model included change from baseline as the dependent variable, with treatment group (PHLE or LLE), corticosteroid status (yes or no), and center site (Nos. 1-3) as the main effects and with baseline score as additional covariate.

This interaction resulted in an increased, although not significant, effect in favor of PHLE for patients receiving corticosteroid injection. The interpretation of the results based on the interaction of exercise and cortisone injection should be considered in relation to the lack of power necessary to prove this secondary aim.</p><sec id="section19-2325967117723292"><title>Explanation of Results</title><p>This study did not find a significant effect of PHLE in comparison with LLE. In contrast, Lombardi et al<sup><xref rid="bibr38-2325967117723292" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> and Holmgren et al<sup><xref rid="bibr20-2325967117723292" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> evaluated the effect of PHLE and eccentric exercises in comparison with a waiting list (passive control) or an unloaded movement exercise program with no progression (active control). Both studies showed a significant difference in the between-group analyses on DASH. However, it is questionable whether Holmgren et al (active control) defined the control exercise program sufficiently to conclude a significant effect of eccentric exercises over general exercises. In comparison, Maenhout et al<sup><xref rid="bibr40-2325967117723292" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> also evaluated the effect of eccentric exercises, in comparison with an active general exercise program, and they found no between-group differences.</p><p>The current lack of effect between exercise groups could arise from several reasons, such as the intervention length, diagnostic criteria, compensation strategies, and equal workload. First, in relation to the length of the intervention, 12 weeks of PHLE exercise may not be long enough to improve the patient&#x02019;s tendon health, as tendon healing may take a longer time. Therefore, a longer exercise period may have been preferable to evaluate the efficacy of PHLE. Second, as the biomechanics of the shoulder girdle are complex and the differential diagnosis between SIS and rotator cuff tendinopathy is challenging, it remains unknown whether the absence of between-group differences is due to a proportion of patients not having rotator cuff tendinopathy as their main source of pain. The results of this study should be interpreted with this in mind. However, we did follow thorough inclusion procedures to ensure the presence of tendinopathy in the rotator cuff. Based on these methods&#x02014;consisting of a general assessment performed by experienced orthopaedic specialists to exclude differential diagnoses, a combination of orthopaedic clinical tests to confirm pain arising from the subacromial structures, and a standardized ultrasound procedure<sup><xref rid="bibr25-2325967117723292" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>&#x02014;the risk of a heterogeneous study population was considered to be small. Third, the absence of between-group differences may also be explained by the fact that tendon loading is biomechanically different in the complex shoulder joint, as compared with patellar and Achilles tendon loading, where PHLE has shown equal or superior effects versus eccentric exercises in treatment of tendinopathy.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-2325967117723292" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bibr7-2325967117723292" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="bibr31-2325967117723292" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="bibr32-2325967117723292" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> Although rotator cuff tendinopathy shows similarities with patellar and Achilles tendinopathy,<sup><xref rid="bibr3-2325967117723292" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="bibr9-2325967117723292" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="bibr30-2325967117723292" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="bibr36-2325967117723292" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> the tendon loading on painful rotator cuff muscles may evoke inhibition of rotator cuff muscle activity.<sup><xref rid="bibr11-2325967117723292" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="bibr44-2325967117723292" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup> As compensation, the deltoid muscle may increase its activity to perform the required task.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-2325967117723292" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bibr44-2325967117723292" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup> Consequently, the absorbed load of the rotator cuff tendon may be less than expected in a pain-free shoulder. As loading of the tendon appears important,<sup><xref rid="bibr7-2325967117723292" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> this potential protection/compensation mechanism may explain why the present study and others of eccentric/PHLE in rotator cuff tendinopathy<sup><xref rid="bibr40-2325967117723292" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> generally do not result in superior effects when compared with LLE. Fourth, another question may be whether the groups trained with different loads. According to exercise diaries from the per-protocol population, the PHLE group actually exercised with twice the amount of load (normalized to 1-repetition maximum at baseline) of the LLE group in the 2 rotator cuff exercises (data not shown).</p><p>This study found a significant interaction effect of corticosteroid injection and exercise type, which resulted in a higher effect of PHLE versus LLE in those patients who had a corticosteroid injection, while the opposite effect was present for those who did not have an injection. This may indicate that concomitant use of corticosteroid injection opens a &#x0201c;window of opportunity,&#x0201d; resulting in decreased pain inhibition in the rotator cuff muscles. This window may ensure that the rotator cuff muscles receive optimal stimulation, resulting in clearer changes, as those previously found in patellar and Achilles tendinopathy.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-2325967117723292" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bibr31-2325967117723292" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="bibr32-2325967117723292" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> The role of inflammation within tendinopathy is controversial,<sup><xref rid="bibr7-2325967117723292" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> but recent evidence supports the occurrence of active inflammation.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-2325967117723292" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="bibr52-2325967117723292" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></sup> Conversely, the addition of corticosteroids in relation to degenerative tendons is reported to negatively influence regenerative processes in tendons.<sup><xref rid="bibr16-2325967117723292" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="bibr17-2325967117723292" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="bibr59-2325967117723292" ref-type="bibr">59</xref></sup> The combined risk and benefit must therefore be assessed when administering corticosteroid injection.

The signs of neovascularity disappeared in significantly more patients after the PHLE intervention versus LLE. Furthermore, more patients had decreased tendon thickness in the PHLE group (increased tendon thickness: 33% at baseline and 20% at follow-up in the PHLE group vs 24% and 22%, respectively, in the LLE group), although this difference was not statistically significant. Reduced tendon thickness is anticipated to be a strong indicator of improved function and diminished pain because of the reduced volume occupied by nonedematous tendon in the subacromial space.<sup><xref rid="bibr34-2325967117723292" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> However, per-protocol analyses are prone to bias, and results should be investigated further before accepting these conclusions.</p><p>The current within-group change in DASH score of 7.1 to 8.4 points (29% to 34%) is below the minimal clinically important difference (MCID), which for the DASH has been suggested to be 10.5 points for patients with general shoulder disorders.<sup><xref rid="bibr15-2325967117723292" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> However, the MCID should generally be considered in relation to the specific population, the specific intervention, and the baseline value.<sup><xref rid="bibr42-2325967117723292" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup>
</p><p>The current baseline DASH was lower than in previous studies of patients with SIS,<sup><xref rid="bibr4-2325967117723292" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bibr8-2325967117723292" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="bibr20-2325967117723292" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="bibr27-2325967117723292" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="bibr33-2325967117723292" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="bibr42-2325967117723292" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="bibr55-2325967117723292" ref-type="bibr">55</xref></sup> indicating less discomfort in the current population at inclusion. The addition of recruitment by external advertisements did not appear to cause lower baseline scores, since exploratory analyses (data not shown) showed no differences in baseline scores between recruitment types. Another reason for the low baseline DASH score may be the minimal resting pain and largely preserved ROM often seen in patients with rotator cuff tendinopathy,<sup><xref rid="bibr36-2325967117723292" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="bibr37-2325967117723292" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> in contrast to higher DASH scores in SIS patients being attributed to a greater variety of symptoms. Camargo et al<sup><xref rid="bibr4-2325967117723292" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> evaluated the effect of eccentric exercises in a cohort study with similar inclusion criteria, including ultrasound, as in the current trial.

Since none of the previous randomized controlled studies<sup><xref rid="bibr20-2325967117723292" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="bibr38-2325967117723292" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="bibr40-2325967117723292" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> evaluating eccentric/PHLE used ultrasound measurements to confirm structural abnormalities in the rotator cuff tendon at inclusion, comparisons between the present and previous studies are difficult to perform. In the Holmgren et al<sup><xref rid="bibr20-2325967117723292" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> study, only clinical signs were used as inclusion criteria. After inclusion, ultrasound measurements of the rotator cuff showed 31% of patients having either partial- or full-thickness rotator cuff tear, which may be the reason for a more heterogenic population and higher baseline score on the DASH. Also, Lombardi et al<sup><xref rid="bibr38-2325967117723292" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> used only clinical tests to include patients, with equally high levels of DASH baseline results as in the Holmgren et al<sup><xref rid="bibr20-2325967117723292" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> study. Since no further evaluations of potential differential diagnoses were presented in these studies, the specific differentiation among tendinopathy, bursitis, and rotator cuff tears remains uncertain. Furthermore, the current within-group change of 29% to 34% in PHLE and LLE, respectively, is larger than or similar to the percentage change in the intervention group from Lombardi et al<sup><xref rid="bibr38-2325967117723292" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> and Camargo et al,<sup><xref rid="bibr4-2325967117723292" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> indicating that the MCID change in relation to baseline values is similar across studies for rotator cuff tendinopathy, and the results of these studies may therefore seem more consistent.</p></sec><sec id="section20-2325967117723292"><title>Strengths and Limitations</title><p>A major limitation is the clinical criteria for rotator cuff tendinopathy, which could explain some of the reasons for the lack of between-group differences. However, as described, this problem was approached by strict inclusion procedures, including ultrasound-confirmed structural changes. Another limitation was the inability of blinding the treating physical therapists to the primary hypothesis, which could have influenced administration of exercise. However, because several physical therapists were involved and standardized information for patients was provided through written material and as an exercise DVD describing exercises and progression, this potential bias was minimized. Additionally, the number of compliant participants (60%) was relatively low. However, given that the requirement for being compliant was 80% completion of the exercise sessions, in addition to a high total number of visits to the physical therapists, the current compliance rate is acceptable. Other studies (eg, Holmgren et al<sup><xref rid="bibr20-2325967117723292" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>) found approximately 85% compliance on number of days trained, but completion of exercise sessions was not recorded, making comparisons difficult.</p><p>A significant interaction occurred between exercise and concomitant administration of corticosteroid injection. However, the current study did not achieve sufficient power to detect a significant between-group difference in the area of concomitant corticosteroid injection. Therefore, further investigation of this interaction is warranted.</p><p>The strengths of the current study are the inclusion of an active control group and the blinding of patients. Furthermore, vital methodological strengths of the current study include blinding of the primary examiner, a blinded outcome analysis performed by an external statistician, interpretation of the results prior to unblinding, publication of a detailed study protocol, and a standardized public exercise protocol (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-2325967117723292">Appendices A</xref> and <xref ref-type="app" rid="app2-2325967117723292">B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="section21-2325967117723292"><title>Deviations From Protocol</title><p>See <xref ref-type="app" rid="app5-2325967117723292">Appendix E</xref>: &#x0201c;Deviations From Protocol.&#x0201d;</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="section22-2325967117723292"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our results showed there was no superior benefit of PHLE over traditional LLE in patients with rotator cuff tendinopathy.

This is normal and OK. What you must be aware of is how high the pain is. That is, if the pain rises &#x0003e;5 on a scale of 0 to 10 (VAS: 0 = no pain, 10 = worst pain imaginable), it should not be any higher. Five on the scale corresponds approximately to a pain that you can tolerate without feeling that it is directly harmful.</p><p>In addition, the pain is expected to decrease to about the level that it was before the training within a maximum of 30 minutes. Furthermore, the pain must not be increased the days following training. If pain does not decrease after training or gets worse in the following days, you should approximately reduce the load of your exercises by half and, over 3 or 4 exercise sessions, increase toward the planned load again. If this does not help, please contact the physiotherapist who initially instructed you.</p><p>If you take pain medication, the pain may be lower than normal, but you should follow the same guidelines in terms of how long the pain may last and worsen from day to day.</p></sec><sec id="section27-2325967117723292"><title>Why We Believe This Training Works</title><p>The training is believed to have a positive effect on the muscles called the <italic>rotator cuff</italic>.

The exercises are believed to awaken the muscles and make them progressively stronger and more enduring, so they can work a entire day without getting overloaded and tired.</p><p>The difficulties that you are experiencing in the shoulder are partly due to one of the tendons of the rotator cuff, called the <italic>supraspinatus tendon</italic>, not being as functional as it used to be&#x02014;there are signs that the tissue in the tendon is worn and needs to be reinforced. In the third and fourth exercises, you must gradually train with heavier and heavier loads over the 12 weeks. The heavy load is expected to help reinforcement of the tendon by actively stimulating tissue in the tendon to make it stronger.</p><p>In performing the heavy loaded exercises, it is not necessarily how much movement you can perform but, more so, the load on the muscle that is considered to be important. Therefore, it may be enough just to perform a small movement and hold this position static to apply load on the muscle/tendon.
