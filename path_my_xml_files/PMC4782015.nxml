It is still unknown whether their combination can produce synergistic and more consistent improvements. Safety and efficacy of this combination has been assessed within a proof-of-principle, double-blinded, semi-randomized, sham-controlled trial. Inhibitory continuous Theta Burst Stimulation (cTBS) was delivered on the affected hemisphere, in order to improve the response to the following robot-assisted therapy via a homeostatic increase of learning capacity. Twenty severe upper limb-impaired chronic stroke patients were randomized to robot-assisted therapy associated with real or sham cTBS, delivered for 10 working days. Eight real and nine sham patients completed the study. Change in Fugl-Meyer was chosen as primary outcome, while changes in several quantitative indicators of motor performance extracted by the robot as secondary outcomes. The treatment was well-tolerated by the patients and there were no adverse events. All patients achieved a small, but significant, Fugl-Meyer improvement (about 5%). The difference between the real and the sham cTBS groups was not significant. Among several secondary end points, only the Success Rate (percentage of targets reached by the patient) improved more in the <italic>real</italic> than in the <italic>sham</italic> cTBS group. This study shows that a short intensive robot-assisted rehabilitation produces a slight improvement in severe upper-limb impaired, even years after the stroke. The association with homeostatic metaplasticity-promoting non-invasive brain stimulation does not augment the clinical gain in patients with severe stroke.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>stroke recovery</kwd><kwd>robot-assisted rehabilitation</kwd><kwd>non-invasive brain stimulation</kwd><kwd>homeostatic plasticity</kwd><kwd>robotic assessment of motor performance</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="5"/><table-count count="1"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="28"/><page-count count="9"/><word-count count="6035"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Severe upper limb impairment in chronic stroke patients does not respond to standard rehabilitation strategies; for this reason there is the need of new treatments that might be effective in patients with drastically limited residual movement capacity. In patients with moderate to severe upper-limb impairment, a slight improvement have been reported using robot-assisted rehabilitative treatment, even years after a stroke (Lo et al., <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Another innovative approach for the enhancement of motor recovery is represented by non-invasive human brain stimulation techniques, such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). These techniques can induce long-lasting changes in the excitability of central motor circuits via long-term potentiation/depression (LTP/LTD)-like phenomena (Di Pino et al., <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2014b</xref>). A recent study reported a mild motor improvement after 10 sessions of rTMS in a group of severe chronic stroke patients (Demirtas-Tatlidedea et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>).</p><p>Aim of present study was to explore whether the combination of these two approaches might enhance their positive effects on motor recovery. To the end of assessing safety and potential efficacy of the combination of robot-assisted rehabilitation and non-invasive brain stimulation in a group of chronic stroke patients with severe upper limb impairment, we designed a proof-of-principle double blinded semi-randomized sham-controlled trial. We used continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS), a robust form of inhibitory rTMS inducing LTD-like changes lasting for about 1 h [8]. The choice of employing cTBS on the affected hemisphere was based on the findings of our recent study, which suggested that this inhibitory protocol can improve the response to physical therapy (Di Lazzaro et al., <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Moreover, rTMS protocols suppressing cortical excitability have been shown to strongly facilitate motor learning in normal subjects (Jung and Ziemann, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Jung and Ziemann suggested that such enhancement might involve the phenomenon of &#x0201c;homeostatic&#x0201d; plasticity, which can be induced in the human brain using a variety of brain stimulation protocols (Karabanov et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Considering the close link between LTP and mammalian learning and memory (Malenka and Bear, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>), an enhancement of learning after LTD induction might appear a paradox. However, the experimental studies by Rioult-Pedotti et al. demonstrated the existence of a homeostatic balance between learning and the induction of LTP/LTD (Rioult-Pedotti et al., <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>), thus showing that the ease of producing synaptic LTP/LTD depends on the prior history of neural activity. In the context of stroke, this predicts that by delivering a rTMS protocol that induces LTD-like effects on the stroke-affected hemisphere before performing rehabilitation, would luckily result in better relearning (Di Pino et al., <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2014a</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>The study was performed according to the Oviedo Convention and approved by the Ethics Committee of Universit&#x000e0; Campus Bio-Medico of Rome. Participants provided written informed consent. Inclusion criteria were: (a) first-ever ischemic stroke at least 1 year earlier; (b) severe hand function impairment, defined as score of 3&#x02013;28 on the Fugl-Meyer Assessment of sensory motor recovery after stroke, a scale with scores for upper-limb impairment ranging from 0 (no function) to 66 (normal function); (c) ability to give informed consent and comprehend instructions. Exclusion criteria were: (a) concomitant neurological conditions, including any history of epilepsy and significant comorbidities; (b) cognitive impairment or any substantial decrease in alertness, language reception, or attention that might interfere with understanding instructions for motor testing; (c) apraxia; (d) excessive pain in any joint of the paretic extremity; (e) contraindications to TMS such as metal head implants; (f) advanced liver, kidney, cardiac or pulmonary disease; (g) history of significant alcohol or drug abuse; (h) depression or use of neuropsychotropic drugs such as antidepressants or benzodiazepines. The National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and the Barthel Index (BI) were used to evaluate neurological impairment and disability at the enrolment.</p><p>The study was proposed to patients attending the outpatient clinic for cerebrovascular disorders of Campus Bio-Medico University Hospital. From April the first, 2013, to September the 30th, 2014, we screened 143 patients, 13 of whom declined, 110 were excluded, and 20 underwent randomization (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Common reasons for exclusion of patients from the study were a baseline Fugl-Meyer score outside the required range, history of epilepsy, and haemorrhagic stroke. Other causes of exclusion were previous ischemic strokes, stroke occurring &#x0003c; 1 year before, severe cognitive impairment, contraindications to TMS such as metal head implants or pacemaker, use of neuropsychotropic drugs such as antidepressants or benzodiazepines.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Figurative illustration representing the algorithm of the study design, the evaluations carried out, and the treatments delivered</bold>.

Patients were stratified by using at baseline measures to ensure that both groups had a similar distribution regarding degree of impairment. Researcher randomizing patients and researchers delivering cTBS were not involved in outcome assessments and data analysis; rehabilitation doctors, patients, and researchers involved in data analysis were blind to the type of cTBS delivered (i.e., sham or real), in order to obtain a double-blinded sham-controlled study design.</p><p>Each day, for 10 consecutive working days, each patient received a session of robotic therapy following the real or sham stimulation. Patients were evaluated at four time points: baseline (Baseline), just after the treatment (Post), after 1 (1 Month), and 3 months (3 Months). For all these evaluation points we assessed the Fugl-Meyer score and Robotic measures of motor performance (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). At baseline we also included the following scales: NIHSS, Rankin Scale, Barthel Index, and Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS). Spasticity was assessed by MAS at four different joint of affected arm: shoulder, elbow, wrist, and fingers. For each patient, a cumulative score was obtained by summing the scores obtained in the four joints. The cumulative score ranges from 0 (no spasticity) to 16 (maximum spasticity, i.e., score 4 in all the considered joints).</p><p>The combined effect of robotic rehabilitation and brain stimulation was evaluated on (a) the Fugl Meyer score after intervention, as compared to baseline (primary outcome measure of clinical improvement) and (b) robot derived measures of motor performance (secondary outcome measures).</p><p>After the 2 weeks of intervention, patients did not receive any additional physical therapy until the last follow-up visit (at 3 months). Pharmacological therapy was also unchanged.</p></sec><sec><title>Interventions</title><sec><title>Transcranial brain stimulation</title><p>rTMS was applied over the hand motor area of the affected hemisphere using a DUOMAG XT stimulator (DEYMED Diagnostic, Czech Republic) and a figure-of-eight shaped coil, with the handle pointed posteriorly and approximately perpendicular to the central sulcus.</p><p>Active rTMS used cTBS, in which 3 pulses are given at 50 Hz, repeated every 200 ms for a total of 600 pulses. Stimulation intensity was 80% active motor threshold (AMT) of the affected hemisphere, defined as the minimum single pulse intensity required to produce a motor evoked potential &#x0003e;200 &#x003bc;V on more than 5 out of 10 trials from the contracted contralateral first dorsal interosseous muscle. Whenever AMT over the affected hemisphere could not be determined because TMS at maximum stimulator output (MSO) failed to evoke any response, cTBS intensity was performed at an intensity corresponding to unaffected hemisphere AMT. Sham rTMS was performed using the same stimulator at an intensity of 3% of MSO and with the coil tilted at 90&#x000b0;; this intensity of stimulation, with this orientation of the coil, produces auditory sensation similar to the active stimulation, but has no stimulating effect on the cortex.</p></sec><sec><title>Robotic therapy</title><p>The Robot was exploited for the two-fold purpose of delivering therapy and measuring, objectively and quantitatively, patients' motor performance. Shoulder-elbow robotic therapy was delivered with the InMotion2 robotic machine (Interactive Motion Technologies, Inc.) (Krebs et al., <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>). The InMotion2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) is based on a direct-drive five-bar-linkage SCARA mechanism that provides two translational degrees of freedom for elbow and forearm motion. Impedance control enables the robot to move, guide or perturb the patient's movement. Absolute encoders at each motor and a 6-axis force/torque sensor at the end effector allow measuring robot joint position, robot Cartesian position (via forward kinematics) and interaction forces.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>The InMotion2 robotic machine (Interactive Motion Technologies, Inc.)</bold>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fnins-10-00088-g0002"/></fig><p>In the evaluation phase, the robot was completely passive while position sensors recorded subject kinematic data. Patients were asked to perform five blocks of unassisted 16 point-to-point movements from the center to eight outbound targets along a circle at a distance of 0.14 m. Patients were required to move with a self-paced speed in a maximum time slot of 3 s.</p><p>Robot data were offline processed to compute quantitative indicators of temporal and spatial features of motor skill recovery (Zollo et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2011a</xref>; Papaleo et al., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), i.e.:</p><p><bold><italic>Motion Accuracy&#x02014;</italic></bold>It is assessed by means of the area index and the normalized mean deviation, defined below:

Robot assistance at each session was tuned on patients' performance during the 16 point-to-point sessions. Both during evaluations and during training, patients were required to move with a self-paced speed in a maximum time slot of 3 s. Robotic treatment was delivered daily for 10 consecutive working days. A physical and rehabilitation medicine doctor attended and assisted patients both during evaluations and treatment.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Statistics</title><p>Statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS v22.

One real patient and 1 sham patient withdrew because of difficulty in reaching the hospital after the third and after the fifth day of treatment, respectively.

Indeed, considering the primary outcome, there was no significant difference between real and sham-cTBS patients. The improvement in Fugl-Meyer was significant for both groups immediately after the intervention and at 1 month follow-up, while it was not significant at 3 months. At 3 months there was a slight further increase in the average scores, and the lack of significance was probably due to the high variability of the measures.</p><p>The mean change in the Fugl-Meyers score was rather limited, about 5% (3&#x02013;4 points). However, this might be considered meaningful in chronic patients, especially in those with severe impairment (Lo et al., <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). In a more general sense, a minimum increase of about five points is required to make a clinically significant difference (Page et al., <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), but this threshold was established in patients with minimum to moderate impairment and does not fit well with our group of patients with severe impairment.</p><p>It should also be noted that, assuming that a Fugl-Meyers score difference of at least four points is of clinical interest, in order to find a significant difference between our two groups a much larger sample size might be needed (50 patients per group, Power = 80%, Type I error = 0.05). In any case, the percentage of the patients assigned to real cTBS who achieved a gain of at least five points, was slightly higher than the percentage of patients who achieved this gain in the sham group [3 out of 8 (38%) in the real group vs. 2 out of 9 (22%) in the sham group].</p><p>Interestingly, the mean improvement in the Fugl-Meyer score is comparable to what has been achieved previously with longer lasting interventions (12 weeks with 36 1-hour/day sessions of robot-assisted rehabilitative therapy in the study of Lo et al., <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>); 8 weeks with a total 24 sessions in the study by Klamroth-Marganska et al. (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). In contrast with present findings, our previous study in chronic stroke patients with moderate upper limb deficits suggested that cTBS might enhance the gain from a late rehabilitation with a standardized protocol of physical rehabilitation (Di Lazzaro et al., <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). One possible explanation for this discrepancy is that robot assisted rehabilitation attains a maximal benefit in patients with severe deficits and this cannot be enhanced by brain stimulation because of a ceiling effect. Another possibility, is that, as suggested by Daly et al. (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>), a more prolonged robotic therapy is needed to obtain a consistent improvement in patients with severe impairment and thus, it cannot be excluded that prolonging the association of robotic treatment and brain stimulation for a longer period might result more effective. Finally, a further possibility could arise from the fact that the affected and unaffected hemispheres seems to play a different role in mild vs. severe strokes, so that the hemisphere mainly responsible for motor recovery in severe stroke is the unaffected one (Di Pino et al., <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2014b</xref>). If this is the case, in patients with severe brain damage, it may be not useful to attempt to promote ipsilesional reorganization because the manipulation of the excitability of the affected hemisphere may not produce any advantage in terms of promoting relearning from rehabilitation. Instead, in these patients, our future efforts should target the unaffected hemisphere being its role in recovery more relevant (Di Pino et al., <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2014b</xref>).</p><p>It should be considered that, for safety concerns, stimulus intensity was estimated from the unaffected hemisphere, because this might be hyperexcitable (Di Lazzaro et al., <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>), it might be that this intensity was below the one needed to activate intracortical networks of the affected hemisphere. Although cTBS after effects are produced by stimulus intensities well below motor threshold (Huang et al., <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>), and although this intensity produced significant effects in our previous study in patients with less severe stroke (Di Lazzaro et al., <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), we cannot exclude that higher intensity cTBS could produce a more pronounced effect also in patients with severe stroke.</p><p>The study of the robotic measures of motor performance (secondary outcomes) allowed us a more sensitive and accurate evaluation of the effects of robotic rehabilitation and brain stimulation on motor recovery (Pellegrino et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). These measures complement the clinical scales and show that our rehabilitation strategy achieves a significant benefit up to 3 months after the end of the treatment, confirming previous studies (Prange et al., <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Kwakkel et al., <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Lo et al., <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). A significant improvement was achieved in multiple domains of motor control in both groups (Motion accuracy, Motion Direction, Smoothness, Speed, Movement Duration, Success Rate) with no significant difference between groups. Only the Success Rate, representing the percentage of times that the patient reaches the target, improved significantly more in the <italic>real cTBS</italic> group than in the <italic>sham cTBS</italic> one: this might suggest a mild benefit of cTBS on rehabilitation. Nevertheless, this finding should be taken extremely cautiously, since the difference between real and sham groups was not significant on the other robot-derived measures. Despite the secondary outcome measures have been analyzed in an independent fashion, we cannot rule out that the Success Rate, being a broader measure of motor performance, capitalizes the slight improvements in multiple domains of motor control, resulting statistically significant (Zollo et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2011a</xref>,<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>). However, it should also be considered that the success rate was different at baseline between the groups, this imbalance might influence the changes observed in the two groups, and this is a further reason that led to consider with caution the more pronounced improvement in success rate after real cTBS.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our study confirms that robot-assisted rehabilitative treatment produces a slight improvement years after a stroke and it shows, for the first time, that an improvement can be obtained even in patients with severe upper-limb impairment treated daily for only 10 working days. Moreover, it shows that non-invasive brain stimulation delivered as cTBS of the affected hemisphere to promote homeostatic metaplasticity, is not effective in patients with severe deficits as those enrolled in present study, while our previous study showed that this approach might be effective in patients with moderate deficits. It might be that in severe patients the unaffected hemisphere is more involved in recovery, thus, the modulation of the excitability of this hemisphere could produce positive effects. In these patients, it could also be that the facilitation of the affected hemisphere is more effective than inhibition. Also, it might be that different strategies for promoting homeostatic plasticity might produce positive effects (e.g., protocols of so-called primed stimulation in which low-frequency rTMS is preceded by a bout of high-frequency rTMS; Cassidy et al., <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>).</p><p>The implementation of non-invasive brain stimulation techniques as an additional tool to promote recovery in chronic stroke patients requires further studies in order to identify the subgroups of patients that most likely will respond to a particular intervention.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Author contributions</title><p>VD designed the study, made the preliminary recruitment of patients and wrote the manuscript.
