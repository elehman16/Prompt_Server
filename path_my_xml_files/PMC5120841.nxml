The World Health Organization has multiple recommendations in order to curb the obesogenic environment, and these include improving intake of healthy foods and physical activity levels [<xref rid="pone.0166996.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0166996.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Influencing the food environment is complex, requiring a co-ordinated approach across all of society [<xref rid="pone.0166996.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. International focus has recently been placed on limiting free sugar intake in order to help prevent unhealthy weight gain, with the World Health Organization recommending a reduction of free sugars to &#x0003c;10% of total energy intake, both in adults and children [<xref rid="pone.0166996.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>New Zealand has the 3<sup>rd</sup> highest prevalence of overweight and obesity in children and adults among OECD countries [<xref rid="pone.0166996.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. M&#x00101;ori (New Zealand&#x02019;s Indigenous population) aged 2 to 14 years of age are 1.6 times more likely to be obese compared with non-M&#x00101;ori counterparts, and Pacific children 3.6 times more likely than non-Pacific children [<xref rid="pone.0166996.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Despite this, there have been few in-depth surveys of child nutrition in New Zealand [<xref rid="pone.0166996.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0166996.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Differences in eating patterns have been noted between ethnic groups; M&#x00101;ori and Pacific children were more likely to have a less healthy diet when compared with New Zealand European (NZE) children. The median daily energy intake for M&#x00101;ori children was higher than NZE and Pacific children, and M&#x00101;ori had the highest intake of sucrose [<xref rid="pone.0166996.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Factors that were independently associated with the likelihood of eating breakfast at home every day were ethnicity (M&#x00101;ori and Pacific children less likely) and socioeconomic status (children living in more deprived households less likely) [<xref rid="pone.0166996.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Eating behaviours play an important role in healthy eating. Studies have shown that a variety of eating behaviour traits are associated with weight in children [<xref rid="pone.0166996.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Satiety responsiveness/slowness in eating (combined to form a single subscale) and food fussiness in children were negatively associated with body weight, whilst food responsiveness, enjoyment of food, emotional overeating and desire to drink were positively associated with weight [<xref rid="pone.0166996.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Obese children have been noted to eat faster than their non-obese counterparts [<xref rid="pone.0166996.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In a New Zealand study, a healthy diet (defined by specific items assessing healthy eating behaviours) was associated with better emotional health in 12- to 17-year old children [<xref rid="pone.0166996.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>When tackling childhood obesity, a multi-disciplinary approach is recommended, working with families to address food habits, physical activity and (lifestyle) behaviour [<xref rid="pone.0166996.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Our primary objective in reporting the data in this manuscript was to describe the eating behaviours of the children and adolescents referred to the &#x02018;Wh&#x00101;nau Pakari&#x02019; programme, and how these compared with regional and national cohort data. Our secondary objective was to determine whether eating behaviours differed between the Indigenous (M&#x00101;ori) and non-Indigenous children and adolescents enrolled in the programme.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Methods</title><p>Recruitment was from participants referred to a community-based, unblinded randomised controlled trial of a multi-disciplinary obesity intervention programme, based in Taranaki, a region of New Zealand (population of 23,139 children aged 0&#x02013;15 years, of which 81% identify as NZE, 28% as M&#x00101;ori, and 1% as other ethnicity) [<xref rid="pone.0166996.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Details of the study methods including sample size and power calculations have been previously published [<xref rid="pone.0166996.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Recruitment period was between January 2012 and August 2014. Eligibility was defined by residence in Taranaki, aged from 5 to 16 years, and being either obese or overweight as defined by a modification of the United Kingdom Cole definitions of BMI &#x02265;98<sup>th</sup> centile, and &#x0003e;91<sup>st</sup> centile with weight-related comorbidities respectively [<xref rid="pone.0166996.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].

The NZHS included a random sample of predominantly non-obese children aged 5 to 14 years (n = 4,699) with data collected from their caregivers, allowing comparisons with our dataset for the number of breakfasts eaten per week, the number of take away meals per week, and number of fruit servings per day [<xref rid="pone.0166996.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Measures</title><p>BMI percentile and BMI standard deviation score (SDS) were calculated using UK Cole normative data [<xref rid="pone.0166996.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] with the KIGS auxology software (Pfizer Endocrine Care TM). Socioeconomic deprivation was measured at the household level using the New Zealand Deprivation Index 2006, and socioeconomic status was coded as decile of household deprivation [<xref rid="pone.0166996.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].

Energy requirements, as based on the participant&#x02019;s age, gender, and ideal weight for height percentile were calculated to determine if energy intake was above the participant&#x02019;s recommended daily intake.</p><p>The number of serves per day from each of the four main food groups (vegetables and fruit; breads and cereals; milk and milk products; and lean meat, poultry, seafood, eggs, legumes, nuts and seeds) were determined from the dietary recall. In New Zealand, the recommendations for daily food group consumption for children aged 5 to 14 years include 3 servings of vegetables and at least 2 servings of fruit; 5 servings of breads and cereals; 2 to 3 servings of milk and milk products and 2 servings of lean meat, poultry, seafood, eggs, legumes, nuts and seeds [<xref rid="pone.0166996.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Adequate intake across the four food groups was then determined.</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Data Analyses</title><p>To investigate variables associated with categorical outcomes of interest including hyperphagia, lack of satiety after food, night waking for food, comfort eating, and energy intake above the recommended daily intake, binary logistic regressions, with models including variables that described age, sex, ethnicity, and socioeconomic deprivation (as well as BMI SDS where appropriate) were run. For continuous outcomes: number of breakfasts consumed per week; total energy intake; percentage of energy intake from carbohydrate, fat, and protein; number of daily servings of fruit, vegetables, and snack foods, general linear models were run including the same explanatory variables as above. A two-sample t-test was used to examine differences between Wh&#x00101;nau Pakari and New Zealand Health Survey data as well as to look at differences in age and BMI between M&#x00101;ori and NZE participants. Differences between the latter ethnic groups were also examined using the following methods: a chi-squared test for sex ratio; a Kruskal-Wallis test for specific outcomes (i.e. socioeconomic status; daily milk, water, and sweet drink consumption); and a general linear model or a binary logistic regression (both including age, sex, and socioeconomic status as predictors) for the remaining continuous and binary outcomes, respectively. Analyses were performed in Minitab (v.16, Pennsylvania State University, State College, PA, USA) and SAS v.9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). All statistical tests were two-tailed with a significance level maintained at p&#x0003c;0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec010"><title>Results</title><p>Enrolled participants (n = 239) had a mean age of 10.7 years (SD = 3.2, range 5&#x02013;17 years), 52% of whom were females.

Ethnic differences between Indigenous and non-Indigenous participants were also present. However, we expected the differences in our participants to be greater, and believe that three factors may have contributed to this. The first was the inability to undertake food diaries where prospective data could be collected; whilst we attempted these, participants and their families did not reliably complete them and we were left undertaking 24-hour recall. Secondly, intake is likely to be under-reported in our cohort. Finally, whilst there is minimal difference in caloric intake between our participants and national population-based surveys, this does not reflect the quality of calories such as fat and carbohydrate consumed in the data collected.</p><p>We saw abnormalities in the psychological aspects of eating behaviours in obese children and adolescents. Excessive hunger, eating large amounts of food, comfort eating, and lack of satiety were commonly reported in this cohort. Emotional eating behaviour and shorter duration of eating have been found to be associated with increased weight in previous studies [<xref rid="pone.0166996.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Clinicians dealing with obese children need to be aware of the psychological dimensions of dietary behaviours, in order to tailor any intervention effectively [<xref rid="pone.0166996.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>A key difference we observed between Indigenous versus non-Indigenous participants was that M&#x00101;ori obese children and adolescents drank twice the volume of sweet drinks of their NZE counterparts. With a median sweet drink consumption across the whole cohort of 250 ml per day, the obese children and adolescents in this cohort are gaining an additional load of 100kcal per day from sweet drinks. Whilst this may not appear to be a large amount when compared with total energy intake, extra energy intake of 120kcal per day is estimated to lead to a 50-kg increase in body mass over 10 years [<xref rid="pone.0166996.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. A greater consumption of sugar sweetened beverages is associated with obesity [<xref rid="pone.0166996.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Importantly, this includes not only carbonated sweet drinks, but also powdered fruit drink which were the most popular non-dairy beverage among New Zealand children in the National Children&#x02019;s survey in 2002 [<xref rid="pone.0166996.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. We were unable to directly compare sweet drink consumption with national data as the NZHS asked only about carbonated (&#x0201c;fizzy or soft&#x0201d;) drinks rather than all sweet drinks.</p><p>Replacement of sugar sweetened beverages with non-caloric artificially sweetened beverages has been shown to reduce weight gain and fat accumulation in normal weight children [<xref rid="pone.0166996.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. However, diet drinks are not recommended in children as they can cause tooth erosion due to their acidity, and maintain a preference for sweetness [<xref rid="pone.0166996.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Therefore, a population-based move towards artificially sweetened beverages is controversial. Emerging evidence, mostly in animals, shows artificial sweeteners can alter sweet preferences, interfere with learning of the relationship between sweet tastes and delivery of calories, and can alter the composition of gut microbiota, negatively affecting metabolic regulation [<xref rid="pone.0166996.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>This study demonstrated alterations to dietary composition that are utilised as overall indicators of a healthy diet, such as number of servings of fruit and eating breakfast. These were below national guidelines and intake in national surveys. Fruit and vegetables contribute (in part) to satiety, provide many nutrients, and are also a source of dietary fibre [<xref rid="pone.0166996.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Ways to improve fruit and vegetable intake in obese children and adolescents need to be considered, and given the diversity in fruit and vegetable intake in different ethnic groups of children in New Zealand [<xref rid="pone.0166996.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], a more culturally responsive approach may need to be adopted than conventional dietary guidelines can provide [<xref rid="pone.0166996.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Some countries, for example Brazil, are now using guidelines as an opportunity to promote the health and well-being of people, an avenue which may garner broad appeal, especially across multiple ethnic groups [<xref rid="pone.0166996.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Availability and accessibility of healthy food varies [<xref rid="pone.0166996.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], as does food security between families based upon their household deprivation and ethnicity. These factors need to be taken into account in any attempt to address eating behaviours in the obese child and adolescent population [<xref rid="pone.0166996.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>Children who miss breakfast are less likely to meet recommendations for fruit and vegetable consumption, and are more likely to have a raised BMI [<xref rid="pone.0166996.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Participants in our cohort ate fewer breakfasts per week compared with national data. As the NZHS asked how many breakfasts were eaten at home in the past 7 days, whereas we asked the number of breakfasts eaten in the past 7 days, the differences reported here between our cohort and the national data are likely to be an underestimate. Our findings that older children are more likely to miss breakfast were consistent with previous research findings [<xref rid="pone.0166996.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0166996.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Of note, M&#x00101;ori children and adolescents were more likely to miss breakfast compared with NZE. This is important, given that &#x0201c;breakfast skippers&#x0201d; are more likely to have inadequate dietary intake [<xref rid="pone.0166996.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p>A strength of this study was our high participation rate from M&#x00101;ori, allowing for robust comparison between Indigenous and non-Indigenous participants. The key limitation of our study (and of many dietary studies) is the use of 24-hour food recall with proxy report and self-report. Self-report has been questioned due to many notable inaccuracies, and some are now arguing that this method is so unreliable that it should not be utilised at all, given implications for policy on findings published in the literature [<xref rid="pone.0166996.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. There are many factors that affect accuracy of recall of dietary intake in children, including BMI and retention interval [<xref rid="pone.0166996.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Given our data is likely to represent under-reporting of intake, it is probable that the dietary intake of many of these children is worse than we have reported [<xref rid="pone.0166996.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Some data points were not directly comparable with the NZHS, which limited the ability to compare our cohort directly with national data; an example being vegetable servings per day (NZHS included potato) [<xref rid="pone.0166996.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>In this cohort, dietary composition as reported by 24-hour recall was not dissimilar to that described in previous childhood population studies in New Zealand [<xref rid="pone.0166996.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0166996.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. However, over half of the children and adolescents we studied had an energy intake greater than their RDI. Interestingly, there was no association between energy intake and BMI SDS, although it is important to note the high entry BMI SDS of participants. Firm conclusions with regard to portion size cannot be made, given the known challenges of dietary under-reporting, especially in obese individuals [<xref rid="pone.0166996.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. It is likely that quality of carbohydrate, fat and other dietary sources is also an important factor in this cohort. This highlights the need for observational methods (such as wearable digital cameras) for gathering dietary information in such a cohort to improve accuracy of reporting in future research.</p><p>In conclusion, this study highlights there are specific eating behaviours that need targeting for obese children, adolescents, and their families, and approaches that appeal to all ethnic groups need to be considered. Future research utilising observational methods to determine more accurate food intake is necessary.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors acknowledge Statistics New Zealand for the New Zealand Health Survey data.
