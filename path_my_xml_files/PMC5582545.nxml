Therefore, the current study aimed to compare the effectiveness of two intervention including Benson's relaxation and systematic desensitization methods for decreasing the anxiety score of nurses against the control group in a randomized clinical trial.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>In a randomized clinical trial, 110 female nurses recruited in Borujerd, Iran, at 2015. First, informed consent was taken from all eligible individuals, and the Ethical Committee of Arak University of Medical Sciences approved the study protocol. Moreover, this study is registered in the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials. The primary data including demographic characteristics such as age, gender, education, marital status, job history, and the employee status were obtained. Then, the status of anxiety of individuals determined and who have the anxiety score higher than 43 included in the study. Individuals who did not affect to anxiety based on the Spielberger anxiety scale and who did not consent for participating in the study were excluded from the study. Therefore, 72 female nurses of 84 who have the anxiety score higher than 43 were assigned randomly into three different groups.</p><p>The sample size calculated based on the standard deviation and acceptable power and alpha error. According to sample size calculation, 24 individuals should be assess in each group. For the first group, Benson's relaxation method was applied, and for the second group, systematic desensitization was used. In Benson's relaxation group, the guideline of muscular relaxation heard by headphone and fulfilled for three sessions and each session continued for 20 min. Moreover, in systematic desensitization group, a skilled, trained therapist the participants&#x02019; nurses for three sessions and 20 min in each session. Third group was the control. The anxiety score measured among the individuals of three groups at the baseline and 1 month after the study inception.</p><p>Spielberger state-trait anxiety inventory (STAI) was used for measurement the anxiety score in both intervention and control groups. This questionnaire measured the two important dimensions of anxiety including state anxiety and trait anxiety. The state anxiety scale measures the emotions of the individuals in the snapshot time as time of responding to the questionnaire. Moreover, the trait anxiety scale evaluates the general emotions of individuals.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] The STAI scale include forty items comprising twenty items measuring the state anxiety and twenty other items measuring trait anxiety. Each item score varied between 1 and 4 and the total score of each dimension of Spielberger questionnaire changes from 20 to 80. The higher score shows more anxiety of the individuals. The anxiety was defined as the Spielberger questionnaire calculated for a individual higher than 43. A score of &#x0003c;43 represented normal. The reliability and validity of the Spielberger questionnaire is assessed in Iran by Abdekhodae and Mahram study.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Mean and standard deviation were used for description of data and variables.
