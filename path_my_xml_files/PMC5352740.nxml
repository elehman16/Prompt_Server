One of the major symptoms of this disease is episodic memory impairment, with impaired learning and recollection of new events. According to the cholinergic hypothesis formulated by Bartus et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">1982</xref>), memory and other cognitive problems arise from degeneration of the basal forebrain cholinergic neurons. Traditionally, the non-selective cholinergic antagonist scopolamine has been used as a pharmacological model to mimic episodic memory impairments as seen in dementia (Ebert and Kirch <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">1998</xref>).</p><p>However, it has been suggested that scopolamine is a non-selective muscarinic receptor antagonist and has widespread effects in the brain and the body. Consequently, it can be anticipated that scopolamine may be associated with non-specific effects on cognitive performance (Klinkenberg and Blokland <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2010</xref>). Therefore, a more selective drug may be more preferable as a pharmacological model for memory deficits. Biperiden (BIP) is a selective muscarinic M1 antagonist used for the adjunctive treatment of Parkinson disease (i.e., Akathisia). Cholinergic M1 receptors are located mainly in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus and to a lesser extent in the body and may therefore have less peripheral side effects (Klinkenberg and Blokland <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2010</xref>). For example, in rats, BIP impaired short-term memory without impairing motor function (Ebert and Kirch <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">1998</xref>). In humans, similar results have been found (Sambeth et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2015</xref>; Wezenberg et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2005</xref>).</p><p>Although most research has investigated the role of acetylcholine in AD, cognitive impairments in AD may not be limited to impaired cholinergic functioning. AD is associated with a decrease in different neurotransmitters, including serotonin and noradrenaline (Trillo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2013</xref>). Moreover, these neurotransmitters have also been found to play a role in cognitive functions. For example, the acute lowering of the amino acid tryptophan (ATD) has been used as a model for low central serotonin functioning (Young et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">1988</xref>). It has been established that ATD impairs episodic memory functioning in patients as well as in healthy subjects (Mendelsohn et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2009</xref>; Sambeth et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2007</xref>). Since 5-HT is also reduced in AD brains (Trillo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2013</xref>), it could be assumed that ATD could also be considered as a pharmacological model to test the effects of novel cognition enhancing drugs (e.g., van Donkelaar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2008</xref>).</p><p>It is well known that the cholinergic and serotonergic systems interact anatomically and neurochemically (Cassel and Jeltsch <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">1995</xref>; Jeltsch-David et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2008</xref>; Lehmann et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2000</xref>; Richter-Levin and Segal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">1993</xref>; Steckler and Sahgal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">1995</xref>). However, a previous human study showed that administration of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) citalopram in combination with the muscarinic antagonist BIP did not confirm this finding, since the BIP-induced impairment was not reversed after administration of citalopram (Sambeth et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2015</xref>). This finding does not support an interaction between acetylcholine and serotonin on memory. On the other hand, it could be argued that this study was not conclusive since citalopram alone had no effects on memory and that therefore no interaction effects could be observed.</p><p>The aim of the current study was to further examine the interaction between acetylcholine and serotonin. We tested the effects of BIP and ATD alone and in combination on episodic verbal memory performance. Since BIP and ATD clearly impair episodic memory performance in healthy volunteers, we hypothesized that the combination of both treatments would decrease the scores on a verbal learning task more than treatment with either BIP or ATD alone would. Although BIP is a relatively selective model to induce episodic memory impairments and ATD is a more general model, both models have shown to be effective deficit models. ATD has shown to produce selective effects on episodic memory without affecting attention (Mendelsohn et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2009</xref>). To our knowledge, ATD is the only model to lower central 5-HT levels and induce memory impairments in healthy humans. Although the exact nature of the effects of ATD on the molecular level may not entirely be understood (van Donkelaar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2011</xref>), experimental studies suggest a relation with brain 5-HT (Crockett et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2012</xref>).</p><p>Next to the behavioral tests, electrophysiological measurements were done, because these have shown to be more sensitive to changes than behavior alone (Luck <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2005</xref>). Of particular interest were the P3a and P600 components of the event-related potential (ERP). The P3a has traditionally been linked to novelty processing, a prerequisite for memory encoding and a process that is influenced by the cholinergic system (Rangel-Gomez and Meeter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2016</xref>). We expected BIP to impair the P3a component more than ATD. Related to the P600 component, we expected both BIP and ATD to reduce its amplitude, because this component is related to memory encoding and retrieval (Jackson and Snyder <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2008</xref>; Olichney et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2011</xref>), a process that was hypothesized to be impaired in this study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Method</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Participants</title><p>Healthy volunteers were recruited from Maastricht University through poster advertisements. Participants were required to be aged between 18 and 35&#x000a0;years. We decided on a restricted age range because EEG and ERPs can change with age and can be differentially sensitive to cholinergic modulation (Bennett et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2004</xref>; Fjell and Walhovd <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2004</xref>; Pekkonen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2005</xref>). Participants were also required to have a body mass index of 18.5&#x02013;30.0. Female subjects were tested in the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle. They underwent medical screening before testing, consisting of a medical questionnaire and physical examination.</p><p>Exclusion criteria were past or current psychiatric, neurological, cardiac, gastrointestinal, hematological, hepatic, pulmonary, or renal illness; pregnancy; lactation; and excessive alcohol consumption (intake of &#x0003e;20 glasses/week). Subjects using any medication other than oral contraceptives, having a first-degree relative with a current or past psychiatric disorder, and presence of other deficits that could be expected to influence performance were also excluded. Participants were also excluded when they smoked more than ten cigarettes per day. On test days, participants were not allowed to smoke.</p><p>All subjects gave a signed informed consent before inclusion and were financially rewarded for their participation. The study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Maastricht University.</p><p>In total, 17 participants of which 10 were female completed the study (mean age 22.4&#x000a0;years (S.D.&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;3.0, range 19&#x02013;29)). Four additional participants were recruited but did not complete all test sessions. Three of them discontinued due to the disliking of the taste of the protein drink and one stopped after two test days due to nausea. These participants were excluded from the analyses.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Treatment and study design</title><p>The study was a double-blind, placebo controlled, four-way crossover design. The order of treatments was balanced over four test days and separated by a wash out period of at least 7&#x000a0;days.</p><p>BIP (Laboratorio farmaceutico S.I.T., Mede, Italy) is a muscarinic M1 antagonist used for the treatment of Parkinson symptoms. Peak plasma concentrations are reached 1&#x02013;2&#x000a0;h after a single dose administration followed by a rapid decline to 12% of the peak value 6&#x000a0;h after intake. Common side effects on the central nervous system are drowsiness, vertigo, headache, and dizziness. Peripheral side effects consist of blurred vision, dry mouth, mydriasis, impaired sweating, abdominal discomfort, and obstipation. In this study, a dose of 2&#x000a0;mg was used, a dose well within the range of the recommended doses for BIP. Furthermore, research has found that an oral dose of 2&#x000a0;mg impaired cognitive performance in healthy adults (McShane et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2006</xref>; Sambeth et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2015</xref>; Wezenberg et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2005</xref>).</p><p>The tryptophan depletion treatment consisted of a protein drink containing 100&#x000a0;g of gelatin powder without tryptophan (TRP&#x02212;); the composition of the mixture was the same as the one used in previous studies in which cognition impairing effects were found (e.g., Evers et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2005</xref>). Previous studies in man have shown that this treatment consistently leads to a 70&#x02013;75% decrease in plasma TRP levels (Evers et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2005</xref>; Stenbaek et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2016</xref>). The placebo treatment consisted of an identical protein drink to which 1.21&#x000a0;g tryptophan is added (TRP+). The protein drink was prepared by adding 200&#x000a0;ml of tap water to 100&#x000a0;g of gelatin powder (Solugel P, PB Gelatins, Belgium). Both drinks had an identical taste.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Procedure</title><p>After inclusion in the study, the participants first performed a training session. During this session, all cognitive tests were practiced to familiarize the participants with the study procedures and minimize procedural learning effects.</p><p>Each test day started with the assessment of the general status, filling in questionnaires and taking a blood sample. This was followed by the intake of either the ATD or balanced drink. Three hours after the intake of the drink, the participants received the capsule containing either BIP or a placebo. During the waiting period, participants were placed in a room where they could study, read, use their laptop, or watch television.</p><p>After this, the participants were offered a low-TRP, low-protein lunch. Four hours after the intake of the drink, the experiment was started.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Questionnaires</title><p>To assess subjective alertness, the Bond and Lader mood scale was used (Bond and Lader <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">1974</xref>). Adverse effects were assessed with a self-report questionnaire consisting of 31 possible complaints to be rated on a 4-point scale. Only dry mouth, sleepiness, nausea, headache, dizziness, fatigue, and drowsiness were analyzed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Verbal learning task</title><p>The used test is an adapted version of the Rey auditory verbal learning test (Lezak <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">1995</xref>), which assesses short- and long-term memory function for verbal information. The test consisted of a list of 30 monosyllabic words (18 nouns and 12 adjectives) in English, which were presented on a computer screen for 1&#x000a0;s. The words were presented three times in the same sequence, and immediately after presentation, a free recall phase followed (immediate recall; sum of words recalled in three trials). Thirty minutes after the third trial, the participant was asked to freely recall as many words as possible (delayed recall). Subsequently, a recognition test was presented, consisting of all former words and 30 new but comparable words (distracters). The words were shown on a computer screen for&#x000a0;a max of 1500&#x000a0;ms, and participants were asked to rate whether they were presented in the learning trials by a &#x0201c;yes/no&#x0201d; response. A new trial started 3500&#x000a0;ms after presentation of the previous word.</p><p>Each session, a different word list was presented to the participants. The order of the lists was balanced across assessments. Outcome measures were the number of words correctly recalled in the three immediate recall trials and delayed recall phase. In the recognition test, mean reaction times were measured in milliseconds as well as the number of correct recognized words.</p><p>The main behavioral outcome measures were based on recall scores. In contrast, the ERP-related measures were extracted during encoding and recognition. The ERP components P3a, P3b, N400 and P600 were compared to examine whether the initial stimulus processing during the learning trials differs from word to word. Finally, ERPs for the old and new items during the recognition task were measured.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>EEG acquisition</title><p>An EEG cap was used to place a set of 32 EEG electrodes according to the international 10&#x02013;20 system (Jasper <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">1958</xref>), but only the midline electrodes (Fz, FCz, Cz, CPz, Pz) were used in the statistical analysis. A reference and a ground electrode were placed at the linked mastoids and at the forehead, respectively. Eye movements were detected by horizontal and vertical electro-oculogram (EOG) recordings. Before electrode attachment, the positions were cleaned with alcohol and slightly scrubbed with a gel in order to provide good conductance. Both EEG and EOG were filtered between 0.01 and 100&#x000a0;Hz and sampled at 1000&#x000a0;Hz.</p><p>The EEG data was analyzed using Vision Analyzer 2 (Brain Products, Gilching, Germany) software. Epoch files were made from 100&#x000a0;ms before stimulus onset until 1000&#x000a0;ms after onset, using the last 100&#x000a0;ms before stimulus onset as baseline. High-pass (1&#x000a0;Hz) and low-pass (30&#x000a0;Hz) filters were applied offline. The segments were checked for EOG activity (visually and by using the Gratton and Coles method in Vision Analyzer) and other artifacts and excluded if an artifact occurred during the first 1000&#x000a0;ms after stimulus presentation. Next, averages were calculated for each stimulus type and treatment. The grand average was used to determine the ERP components. For the VLT, peak detection windows were defined as the most positive or negative value between the following intervals: P3a 210&#x02013;290&#x000a0;ms, P3b 290&#x02013;360&#x000a0;ms, N400 340&#x02013;470&#x000a0;ms, and P600 450&#x02013;700&#x000a0;ms. For the VRT, the windows were P3a 210&#x02013;280&#x000a0;ms, P3b 280&#x02013;350&#x000a0;ms, N400 310&#x02013;460&#x000a0;ms, and P600 430&#x02013;720&#x000a0;ms.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>In this study, a 2&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;2&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;5 factorial design was used to analyze the outcome variables using repeated measures multivariate analyses of variance (MANOVA). The two treatment conditions (ATD: ATD or placebo and BIP: BIP or placebo) and electrode positions were entered as within-subject factors. Finally, effect sizes (&#x003b7;<sup>2</sup>
<sub>partial</sub>) were calculated to determine the magnitude of the effects (see Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). All statistical analyses were done by using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences for Windows (version 24; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).</p><p>Adverse effects and the Bond and Lader were also analyzed using ANOVA. For this analysis, differences between effects at test vs. at baseline were taken into account. Post hoc testing was performed with a least significant difference (LSD) test.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Questionnaires</title><p>B&#x00026;L alertness: No significant effects of BIP or ATD (F(1, 16)&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1.21, <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;.288 and F(1, 16)&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;2.755, <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;.116, respectively).

Additionally, the interaction between the serotonergic and cholinergic system was examined by combining both treatments. BIP significantly decreased the scores for the delayed recall but not for the immediate recall. ATD resulted in lower scores for the immediate recall as well as for the delayed recall. However, the combination of BIP and ATD did not impair the memory performance more than for each treatment alone. Thus, no interactions between BIP and ATD were found. Analysis of the EEG data revealed that BIP increased the amplitude of the P3a component for both the acquisition phase and the recognition phase of the verbal learning task.</p><p>The current study again confirms that an M1 antagonist is effective in inducing memory impairment in a verbal word learning task. However, in our study, BIP only impaired delayed recall whereas in two other studies, immediate as well as delayed recall was impaired (Wezenberg et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2005</xref>; Sambeth et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2015</xref>). In all studies, similar doses and drug-test intervals were used. Of note, a more detailed analysis revealed that BIP impaired the performance at the third trial of the immediate recall (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05). Thus, there is some support that BIP also impaired immediate recall, although not as robust as in previous studies.</p><p>During the memory encoding phase and the recognition trials, a significant effect of BIP was found for the amplitude of the P3a component. The amplitude of this component was larger after BIP than after the other treatments. As mentioned previously, this component is involved in novelty processing; larger amplitudes correspond with stimuli that are perceived as more novel (Rangel-Gomez and Meeter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2016</xref>). This may relate to a poorer immediate recall performance after BIP treatment since the stimuli remain more novel even after three presentations.</p><p>According to the literature, the amplitude of the N400 decreases after repeated stimuli, thus indicating that stimuli are consolidated (Olichney et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2011</xref>). Surprisingly in this study, even though the N400 amplitude was as expected increased during encoding, the amplitude was less negative after BIP compared to the other treatments during the verbal recognition task. This suggests that in the BIP condition, words were consolidated better compared to the other condition. This is against our expectations and behavioral findings since we expected BIP to impair memory-related components. Possibly, the relatively large amplitude of the P3b component may have influenced the N400 amplitude in this condition. However, this probably does not fully explain the decreased N400 amplitude. Lastly, we hypothesized that the P600 amplitude would be decreased after BIP; however, we did not find any effects on both encoding and recognition. Altogether, EEG data suggest BIP mostly affects novelty processing, whereas other memory-related ERP components were not affected by BIP.</p><p>It is presumed that ATD impairs cognition by lowering central serotonin levels (Klaassen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">1999</xref>; but see van Donkelaar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2011</xref>). According to a review (Mendelsohn et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2009</xref>), most studies using acute tryptophan depletion report impaired delayed recall but not immediate recall. Also, they concluded that ATD impairs the consolidation and to a lesser extent encoding of episodic memory. The present study corroborates these previous studies and further supports the notion that ATD has a robust effect on verbal memory performance. The impairment is consistently found on delayed recall, whereas the effects on immediate recall seem to depend on the sex of the subjects (Sambeth et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2007</xref>), larger impairments being found in females. In the current study, 10 of 17 subjects were female, which may explain the effect on immediate recall in our study.</p><p>Even though memory performance on both the immediate and delayed recall was decreased after ATD, the task-related ERPs were less affected by ATD. Unlike BIP, ATD did not affect the P3a component that reflects novelty processing. This could indicate that ATD and BIP both act on different processes in the brain. Apparently, ATD has a different effect on brain processing and 5-HT may not be involved in novelty processing (Rangel-Gomez and Meeter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2016</xref>). On the other hand, some genetic studies suggest a role of the 5-HT2 receptor (Schott et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2011</xref>) and the 5-HT transporter (Enge et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2011</xref>). These mixed findings on the role of 5-HT on novelty processing is likely to be related to the type of manipulation of the 5-HT system. The N400 was more negative after ATD as compared to placebo during the encoding phase. Given that it should decrease after repeated stimulation (Olichney et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2011</xref>), the increased N400 indicates that ATD likely impairs processes related to consolidation.</p><p>The objective of the current study was to examine whether there would be additive effects of BIP and ATD treatments (i.e., an interaction effect). We expected that the scores for the verbal learning task would be decreased more as compared to both the ATD and BIP alone conditions. In contrast to our hypothesis, the behavioral results did not reveal an additive effect of the combined ATD BIP treatment. No interaction effects were found for the behavioral data for the immediate and delayed recall or the recognition test. The ERP data resulted in mixed outcomes which are difficult to interpret in relation to the memory performance. Some interactions between BIP and ATD were found for the amplitudes of the P3b, N400, and P600 components on the encoding trials. However, the interpretation of this interaction is not easy since no interaction on memory performance was found. During the verbal recognition task, no interactions on amplitude were found at all.</p><p>The ATD method is based on the assumption that the depletion of tryptophan, a precursor of 5-HT, leads to decreased levels of 5-HT in the brain. Currently, this appears to be the most relevant model to affect central 5-HT functioning. However, the notion that ATD influences memory only by lowered central 5-HT levels was questioned recently (van Donkelaar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2011</xref>). It was suggested that alternative pathways may also lead to memory impairments (e.g., LTP/NMDA related mechanisms). For example, ATD leads to lower kynurenic acid levels and has been associated with cognitive performance (Kennedy et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2015</xref>). However, there is no clear evidence that the changes in kynurenic acid levels affect the cholinergic neurotransmission (e.g., Stone and Darlington <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2013</xref>). On the other hand, it has been claimed that the observed effects after ATD are closely related to 5-HT-related functions (Crockett et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2012</xref>). Although the exact nature of the molecular effects of ATD is not fully understood, the current study provides no support for an interaction between ATD (5-HT or NMDA-related) and BIP (ACh/M1 receptor) on memory performance. Further studies are needed to further examine whether this lack of interaction between neurotransmitter systems is related to NMDA or 5-HT.</p><p>Related to the discussion above, it should also be noted that BIP has a selective affinity for the M1 and M4 receptors (Perez et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2006</xref>), whereas ATD has a global effect on serotonin and kynurenine (Badawy and Dougherty <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2016</xref>; Kennedy et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2015</xref>). Even though in this study a selective and a global challenge were combined, both methods are assumed to act on different neurotransmitter systems in the brain. Since both treatments impair memory performance, we expected a stronger impairment after a combined treatment. However, the present study did not find support for an additive interaction effect. On the other hand, this does not exclude that both systems could interact, as was shown with the EEG-related measures. Further studies could explore the interaction between acetylcholine and more specific serotonergic drugs (e.g., Wingen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2007</xref>).</p><p>The lack of relation between EEG measures and behavioral measures could be explained by at least two factors. First, the ERPs were recorded during the encoding phase and the recognition phase, whereas the effects on memory performance were observed during the immediate and delayed recall test. Since these are independent processes of memory, the ERPs may not directly relate to the recall scores. Secondly, the effects of ATD and BIP could be related to processing in brain areas that were not detected by the scalp electrodes. For example, it has been found that the hippocampus is important for word learning (Shtyrov <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2012</xref>).</p><p>The results for the treatment effects on the ERP components are more ambiguous compared to the behavioral data. Most effects were found related to the amplitude of the P3a component, implicating that novelty detection was affected. Related to BIP treatment, this indicates impaired encoding. Likewise, the P3a amplitude was increased for the recognition trials in the presence of BIP, indicating that impaired encoding is a longer lasting process that can last up until the delayed recall. The N400 was impaired after ATD, indicating that this manipulation rather leads to impaired consolidation. Significant interactions were found for the amplitude of the P3b, N400, and P600 during encoding. Altogether, we can conclude that the presence of BIP and ATD alone did impair episodic memory. However, against our expectations, an interaction between BIP and ATD was not found.</p><p>In conclusion, this study does not support the notion that the serotonergic and cholinergic systems interact in processes related to learning and memory on the behavioral level. On the electrophysiological level, there are indications that a possible interaction exists. Further research is needed to scrutinize the exact nature of the interaction between the cholinergic and serotonergic systems in relation to memory functions.</p></sec></body><back><notes
