Muscle function is considered one of the most important epigenetic factors guiding facial bone growth.<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> According to the &#x0201c;hard chewing hypothesis,&#x0201d; the distinctive shape of the Inuit skull is a result of vigorous chewing.<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Clinically, individuals with vigorous chewing habits have larger muscle attachments and mandibles than do individuals with delicate chewing habits.<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p><p>Surgical and non-surgical methods have been used to treat masseteric hypertrophy. However, surgical interventions, such as external/internal angle approaches, for masseteric reduction in patients with masseteric hypertrophy evidently entail many risks, including asymmetry, condyle fracture, and inferior alveolar nerve injury. More reversible and conservative non-surgical methods, such as muscle relaxants and occlusal splints, have been used to treat slight masseteric hypertrophy.</p><p>Botulinum toxin type A (BoNT-A) injection is an effective non-surgical treatment for masseteric hypertrophy. BoNT-A produced by <italic>Clostridium botulinum</italic> induces muscle paralysis and atrophy by blocking acetylcholine secretion in neuromuscular junctions,<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> and is effective in striated muscles.<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> BoNT-A injection is a noninvasive masseteric hypertrophy treatment option that is safer than the surgical treatment options. Kim et al.<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> reported that inducing atrophy with a BoNT-A injection causes masseteric reduction in cases of masseteric hypertrophy. Another report suggested that BoNT-A injection reduced the masseter muscle, as indicated by ultrasonography and computed tomography (CT).<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><p>The induction of localized masticatory muscle atrophy by BoNT-A injection is known to alter craniofacial growth and development.<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Accordingly, several studies have investigated the effect of BoNT-A injection on bony changes in adult animals.<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Studies on adult rabbits have reported significant bony changes associated with muscle atrophy that lasted 12 weeks after the injection of BoNT-A.<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Despite the differences in metabolic rates, anatomic structures, and the relative dose of BoNT-A between humans and animals, these animal studies suggest the possibility that the clinical use of BoNT-A in masseteric hypertrophy may also result in bony changes in humans.</p><p>To our knowledge, only one previous human study has investigated the effect of BoNT-A injection in the masseter muscle on bony changes.<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> That study was a cross-sectional study performed on patients with temporomandibular joint disorder (TMD), in which cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) was used to assess the effects of BoNT-A on condylar trabecular changes based on the subjective ratings of trabecular bone patterns provided by two oral and maxillofacial radiologists. However, because that study recruited patients with TMD who had received a variable number of BoNT-A injections, they could not adequately evaluate the effect of BoNT-A because of the lack of proper controls (pretreatment CBCT images). Therefore, the effect of BoNT-A injection in the masseter muscle on bony changes has not been fully investigated in healthy human adults.</p><p>In this study, we evaluated the effects of BoNT-A injection in the masseter muscles on muscular and bony changes in the mandibular angle area in healthy adult humans by using three-dimensional (3D) CBCT images. We compared the pretreatment and posttreatment images as well as the groups receiving either single or repeated injections of BoNT-A.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>The study sample comprised 20 healthy volunteers who requested lower facial contouring at Yonsei Dental Hospital in Seoul, Korea. They were randomly assigned to one of two groups of 10 patients each. Patients in group I (4 men and 6 women; mean age, 28.5 years; range, 23&#x02013;40 years) received a single BoNT-A injection, and those in group II (2 men and 8 women; mean age, 28.5 years; range, 22&#x02013;48 years) received two sets of BoNT-A injections, with the second injection being administered 4 months after the first one. The exclusion criteria were the presence of notable facial asymmetry, severe malocclusion, pregnancy, a history of any serious medical illness or TMD, and drug allergy.</p></sec><sec><title>BoNT-A injection</title><p>BoNT-A in the form of a freeze-dried powder (Neuronox; Medytox Inc., Seoul, Korea) was reconstituted at a concentration of 50 IU/mL (100 IU in 2 mL of sterile saline), and used immediately after preparation. This BoNT-A preparation was injected into each masseter muscle (bilaterally) at a dose of 25 IU (0.5 mL) per muscle by using a 1-mL syringe with a 29G 1/2-inch needle. Injections were performed at two points, 1 cm apart at the center of the lower third of the masseter muscle.</p></sec><sec><title>3D-CBCT</title><p>CBCT scans (Alphard 3030; Asahi Roentgen Inc., Kyoto, Japan) were performed before and 6 months after the first injection in both groups. The CBCT scans were acquired from the maxillofacial region for 17 s at a field of view of 20.0 &#x000d7; 17.9 cm, tube voltage of 80 kVp, and tube current of 5 mA. Patients were instructed to sit in an upright position with maximum intercuspation. The CBCT data were converted into digital imaging and communication in medicine (DICOM) files at a 0.39-cm slice thickness and reconstructed into 3D images by using the InVivo Dental software program (version 5.2; Anatomage, San Jose, CA, USA). For the hard-tissue measurements, reconstructed images were visualized using a threshold value of 176 Hounsfield units. The images were edited to separate the mandible from the whole image, and to remove the teeth above the alveolar bone.</p></sec><sec><title>3D measurements</title><sec><title>Masseter muscle thickness and cross-sectional area</title><p>The mandibular CBCT images were digitally cut into 5.0-mm-thick sections parallel to the mandibular plane and were designated as C5, C10, C15, C20, C25, and C30 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). Maximum thicknesses and cross-sectional areas of the masseter muscles were calculated for each section of a CBCT image (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Width of the mandibular angle area</title><p>The reference points used to measure the widths of the mandibular angle area were the Go post (Gonion posterius: the most posterior point of the posterior border of the ramus) and Go inf (Gonion inferius: the most inferior point of the inferior border of the ramus). The widths of inter-Go post right-left (Rt-Lt) and inter-Go inf Rt-Lt were measured bilaterally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A and 2B</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Volume of the mandibular angle area</title><p>The volume of the mandibular angle area was calculated along two planes: a plane connecting the Go inf, distobucco-occlusal point angle, and distolinguo-occlusal point angle of the second molar; and a plane connecting the Go post, distobucco-occlusal point angle, and distolinguo-occlusal point angle of the second molar. The volumes within the border were measured bilaterally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C and 2D</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The data were analyzed using SAS (version 9.3; SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) and the cut-off for statistical significance was set at <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.05. To evaluate the reproducibility of measurements, all landmarks were measured twice by the same person with a 2-week interval between measurements. The intraclass correlational coefficients ranged from 0.890 to 0.937, indicating excellent intraexaminer reliability. The Wilcoxon signed-rank sum test and Wilcoxon rank sum test were used to compare the measurements before and 6 months after the first injection within the two groups and between the two groups, respectively.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Soft-tissue changes: Masseter muscle thickness and cross-sectional area</title><p>Masseter muscle thicknesses and cross-sectional areas differed statistically significantly before BoNT-A injection and 6 months after injection in both groups.

It blocks action potentials at neuromuscular junctions by inhibiting acetylcholine release. It does not damage the nerves or muscle structures, and muscle function is restored after the toxin is neutralized.<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> BoNT-A rapidly (within hours) and irreversibly binds to presynaptic neurons at the neuromuscular junctions. After being internalized, it acts on a zinc-dependent endoprotease to disrupt some of the peptides necessary for acetylcholine release.<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> This action may take up to 2 weeks to complete, and effectively destroys the affected neuromuscular junction, thereby causing muscular paralysis.<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>We demonstrated that the mean masseter muscle thicknesses and cross-sectional areas decreased after BoNT-A injection; this finding is consistent with those of previous studies. Park et al.<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> reported that the average decrease in muscle thickness was typically 18&#x02013;20% of the preinjection thickness, as determined by ultrasonography and CT. Kim et al.<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> reported that the volume of the masseter muscle decreased after the injection of BoNT-A on each side, as determined by CT.</p><p>Shim et al.<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> reported that the associated reductions in volume and thickness in the lower facial contour were highest at 12 weeks after BoNT-A injection. After muscle paralysis, there is ongoing turnover at the neuromuscular junction, even though toxin exposure enhances this activity such that muscular function begins to return after several weeks and is usually complete by 6 months.<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Thus, muscle atrophy is a temporary event and new neuromuscular synapses can be resynthesized over a period of a few months.<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> This means that additional injection of BoNT-A is required to sustain its effect in the lower facial contour. In the present study, we found that repeated injections of BoNT-A induced a greater reduction of masseter muscle thickness and cross-sectional area than did a single injection, as reported by Lee et al.<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> This indicates that repeated injections of BoNT-A were more effective in improving masseteric hypertrophy, and suggests that repeated injections might induce more bony changes.</p><p>We observed no significant changes in the width of the mandibular angle area after BoNT-A injection in either group. However, we observed a significant change in the volume of the angle area in group II. This result implied there was no change in the shape of the mandible after a single set of bilateral BoNT-A injections, but repeated BoNT-A injections could affect the bone volume of the mandibular angle area. This finding is in agreement with the results of previous animal studies on Wistar rats and mice, which showed bone loss after BoNT-A injection into the muscles.<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> BoNT-A injection into the hind limb muscles of mice caused a decrease in bone mineral content and volume in the hind limb bone.<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> However, we observed fewer bony changes in our subjects than was observed in the abovementioned study on mice.<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> This difference in findings could be attributed to the dose of BoNT-A injected in the present study, which could not reduce the masseter muscle force enough to cause bony changes in the mandible. This was supported by the fact that we did not observe a change in group I in which the patients received a single BoNT-A injection. However, we observed a change in the volume of the angle area and additional reductions in muscle thickness and cross-sectional area among the patients in group II, which received an additional BoNT-A injection.</p><p>This study had several limitations. First, the sample size was too small to identify small changes in parameters such as the mandibular angle volume. Larger studies may find a more significant reduction in the mandibular angle volume in the single injection group. Nevertheless, we demonstrated that multiple injections of BoNT-A led to a greater reduction than did a single injection, and this might be an unwanted side effect of BoNT-A injection into the masseter muscle. Second, the present study only analyzed CT images captured 6 months after BoNT-A injection; changes in the mandibular angle area beyond this time-point were not investigated. Rafferty et al.<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> investigated the short-term (4 weeks) and long-term (12 weeks) effects of BoNT-A injection into the masseter muscle of adult rabbits on the underlying bony changes. They reported a reduction of bone volume and functional parameters at 4 weeks, which partially recovered at 12 weeks after injection. Considering the difference in metabolic rates between humans and rabbits, the reduction of mandibular angle volume in the present study would be expected to increase gradually after 6 months.<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Future studies should investigate the effects of BoNT-A injection on bony changes beyond 6 months after injection, and whether increasing the number of BoNT-A injections leads to greater bone loss.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>The results of this study demonstrated that repeated injections of BoNT-A into the masseter muscle decreased bone volume in the mandibular angle area in human adults. If multiple injections of BoNT-A into the masseter muscle are planned, the abovementioned unwanted side effect should be carefully monitored.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>The authors report no commercial, proprietary, or financial interest in the products or companies described in this article.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Moss</surname><given-names>ML</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The primacy of functional matrices in orofacial growth</article-title><source>Dent Pract Dent Rec</source><year>1968</year><volume>19</volume><fpage>65</fpage><lpage>73</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">5246590</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Collins</surname><given-names>HB</given-names></name></person-group><source>The origin and antiquity of the Eskimo</source><publisher-loc>Washington, D.C.</publisher-loc><publisher-name>Smithsonian Institution</publisher-name><year>1951</year></element-citation></ref><ref id="B3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Proffit</surname><given-names>WR</given-names></name><name><surname>Fields</surname><given-names>HW</given-names></name><name><surname>Nixon</surname><given-names>WL</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Occlusal forces in normal- and long-face adults</article-title><source>J Dent Res</source><year>1983</year><volume>62</volume><fpage>566</fpage><lpage>570</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">6573373</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Burgen</surname><given-names>AS</given-names></name><name><surname>Dickens</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>Zatman</surname><given-names>LJ</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The action of botulinum toxin on the neuro-muscular junction</article-title><source>J Physiol</source><year>1949</year><volume>109</volume><fpage>10</fpage><lpage>24</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15394302</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Klein</surname><given-names>AW</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Complications, adverse reactions, and insights with the use of botulinum toxin</article-title><source>Dermatol Surg</source><year>2003</year><volume>29</volume><fpage>549</fpage><lpage>556</lpage><comment>discussion 556</comment><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">12752527</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B6"><label>6</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>NH</given-names></name><name><surname>Chung</surname><given-names>JH</given-names></name><name><surname>Park</surname><given-names>RH</given-names></name><name><surname>Park</surname><given-names>JB</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The use of botulinum toxin type A in aesthetic mandibular contouring</article-title><source>Plast Reconstr Surg</source><year>2005</year><volume>115</volume><fpage>919</fpage><lpage>930</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15731696</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B7"><label>7</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>To</surname><given-names>EW</given-names></name><name><surname>Ahuja</surname><given-names>AT</given-names></name><name><surname>Ho</surname><given-names>WS</given-names></name><name><surname>King</surname><given-names>WW</given-names></name><name><surname>Wong</surname><given-names>WK</given-names></name><name><surname>Pang</surname><given-names>PC</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>A prospective study of the effect of botulinum toxin A on masseteric muscle hypertrophy with ultrasonographic and electromyographic measurement</article-title><source>Br J Plast Surg</source><year>2001</year><volume>54</volume><fpage>197</fpage><lpage>200</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">11254408</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B8"><label>8</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Kiliaridis</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Engstr&#x000f6;m</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Thilander</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The relationship between masticatory function and craniofacial morphology.
