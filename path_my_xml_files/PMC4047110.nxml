Variations between currently used test protocols preclude meaningful comparisons between studies. We determined the optimal sampling period and related this to intestinal residence.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Half-hourly lactulose and mannitol urinary excretions were determined over 6 hours in 40 healthy female volunteers after administration of either 600 mg aspirin or placebo, in randomised order at weekly intervals. Gastric and small intestinal transit times were assessed by the SmartPill in 6 subjects from the same population. Half-hourly percentage recoveries of lactulose and mannitol were grouped on a basis of compartment transit time. The rate of increase or decrease of each sugar within each group was explored by simple linear regression to assess the optimal period of sampling.</p></sec><sec><title>Key Results</title><p>The between subject standard errors for each half-hourly lactulose and mannitol excretion were lowest, the correlation of the quantity of each sugar excreted with time was optimal and the difference between the two sugars in this temporal relationship maximal during the period from 2&#x000bd;-4 h after ingestion. Half-hourly lactulose excretions were generally increased after dosage with aspirin whilst those of mannitol were unchanged as was the temporal pattern and period of lowest between subject standard error for both sugars.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results indicate that between subject variation in the percentage excretion of the two sugars would be minimised and the differences in the temporal patterns of excretion would be maximised if the period of collection of urine used in clinical tests of small intestinal permeability were restricted to 2&#x000bd;-4 h post dosage. This period corresponds to a period when the column of digesta column containing the probes is passing from the small to the large intestine.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was funded by the Ministry of Business Innovation and Employment (formerly Science and Innovation), New Zealand, contract number C06X0807, awarded to The New Zealand Institute for Plant and Food Research Limited.

All three probe sugars are passively absorbed from the intestine, not extensively metabolised, and excreted unchanged in urine in proportion to the quantities absorbed <xref rid="pone.0099256-Bjarnason1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p><p>The division of the quantity of lactulose excreted by the quantity of mannitol excreted i.e. the use of ratios, was postulated to compensate for any differences in the surface area of the intestinal mucosa between subjects <xref rid="pone.0099256-Arrieta1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0099256-Hollander1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. However subsequent work has demonstrated a number of factors that may confound the basis of such comparisons as they render the result dependent upon the type of sugar used and the time period over which the cumulative urinary excretion was determined. Firstly, the rate of excretion of the two &#x02018;reference&#x02019; sugars that are assumed to reflect surface area i.e. mannitol or rhamnose, is relatively reduced in a number of inflammatory conditions, a phenomenon that has been attributed to villus atrophy <xref rid="pone.0099256-Menzies1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Secondly, the overall rates of excretion of the two reference sugars differ, that of mannitol being significantly higher than that of rhamnose <xref rid="pone.0099256-Sequeira1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Thirdly, the rates of excretion of lactulose and mannitol vary with time from dosage due to the differing permeabilities of the small intestine and colon to these sugars <xref rid="pone.0099256-Rao1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0099256-Sequeira2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> These differences cause the ratio of the quantities of the two sugars to vary with the period of time over which their excretion is determined. Thus, the early peak in mannitol excretion causes the LMR to be lower when cumulative excretion is assessed over 2 hours whilst the later peak in lactulose excretion and lower rate of mannitol excretion 4 hours after dosage will cause the LMR to increase when cumulative excretion is assessed over 4 or more hours <xref rid="pone.0099256-Sequeira1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. These effects may be magnified in the presence of a pro-inflammatory condition <xref rid="pone.0099256-Hollander2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0099256-Farhadi1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> or a pro-inflammatory stimulus such as a single 600 mg dose of aspirin <xref rid="pone.0099256-Lambert1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0099256-Hilsden1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> as these will cause the overall excretion of lactulose to increase <xref rid="pone.0099256-VanElburg1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0099256-Ma1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> and that of mannitol to be reduced <xref rid="pone.0099256-Sequeira1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. These various problems have led researchers to suggest that temporal profiles of absorption of the two sugars should be considered separately as well as in a ratio <xref rid="pone.0099256-Rao2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.</p><p>In view of these complexities there is a need for the test protocol to be standardized to facilitate meaningful comparisons between populations. Further, to adopt a time at which urine samples should be collected during which the rates of excretion of the probe sugars are broadly similar between subjects so as to the maximise sensitivity of the test.</p><p>Hence the purpose of the current work was to assess the temporal profiles of absorption of lactulose and mannitol in a large sample of fit subjects following administration of either placebo or aspirin in a randomized sequence. Thereby to determine the optimal period over which urine samples should be collected, so as to minimise between subject experimental error with due regard to the maximum retention times of the sugar probes in the stomach and in the small intestine as determined with the &#x02018;SmartPill&#x02019; <xref rid="pone.0099256-Rao1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Use of Aspirin</title><p>Aspirin was used as a pro-inflammatory stimulus on the grounds that it induces a reproducible temporary elevation in permeability as determined by lactose mannitol permeability tests <xref rid="pone.0099256-Sderholm1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0099256-Farhadi2" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>.

Female subjects were chosen so as to avoid any gender differences that could influence the recovery of the sugars due to differences in gastric emptying times <xref rid="pone.0099256-Datz1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. The subjects were screened by a health questionnaire and a clinical interview to exclude participants with GI disorders, those taking ongoing prescriptions or over the counter (OTC) medication, prebiotic, probiotic or vitamin supplements and those who had more than a moderate alcohol intake. Similarly, the screening procedure excluded subjects with any history of current urinary tract infections, vaginal discharge, aspirin sensitivity and a history of smoking. Written consent was obtained from all participants before the start of the study as outlined by the Massey University Human Ethics Committee approval procedure.</p><p>Although the menstrual cycle has not been shown to have any effect on the recovery of the sugars <xref rid="pone.0099256-Prytz1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> or on gastric emptying <xref rid="pone.0099256-Horowitz1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, all experimental sessions in both studies were conducted during periods when the participants were not menstruating. This was done to avoid contamination of the urine samples with blood. Participants were instructed to refrain from taking any NSAIDs for at least a week prior to the test, to refrain from consuming alcohol for three days prior to the test, to avoid exercise on the day prior to and on the morning of the test and to fast overnight before attending the test. Each experimental session commenced at 8.00 am when a baseline urine sample was collected from each subject. The order of administration of the treatments (aspirin or placebo) was randomized and double blinded between the two sessions. Each participant received either a placebo drink (100 ml of water) or 600 mg of soluble aspirin (<italic>Dispirin; Reckitt Benkinser Healthcare, UK</italic>) in 100 ml of water at each session. One hour after receiving the treatment, each subject consumed a solution containing 10 g lactulose (<italic>Duphalac, Solvay Pharmaceuticals, NSW, Australia</italic>) and 5 g D-mannitol (<italic>Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA)</italic> followed immediately by a drink of water. A total of 500 ml of fluid (including the treatment and sugar solution) was therefore consumed by each participant over the first hour. Half-hourly urine collections were commenced after the ingestion of the sugar solution and continued for a period of 6 hours. No food was consumed during the entire urine collection period but a further 200 ml of water was given three hours after the ingestion of the sugar solution. Hence the total amount of fluid administered over the seven hour period was 700 ml. This regime was adopted so as to facilitate half-hourly urine sample collection.</p><p>Ethics approval for this part of the study was granted by the Massey University Human Ethics Committee Southern A: 09/79, 11/37. Urinary lactulose and mannitol were quantified with an HPLC system (Shimadzu, Japan) with a refractive index detector using a method described and validated in a previous trial <xref rid="pone.0099256-Sequeira1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0099256-Sequeira2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Determination of Transit Time of the Sugars Solutions through the Stomach and Small Intestine</title><p>Gastric and small intestinal transit time were determined using a wireless pressure and pH sensitive capsule, the SmartPill (SmartPill Corporation, Buffalo, NY) <xref rid="pone.0099256-Rao1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> (see below) in six healthy female subjects between 20&#x02013;40 years of age (mean age: 30 years) who were recruited from the same population and who had been similarly screened. As in the permeability study, each participant attended the laboratory at 8.00 am following an overnight fast. On arrival at the laboratory, each participant consumed a 250 ml drink of water. Fifteen minutes later they were fitted with the SmartPill receiver/data-logger which was attached to a lanyard that maintained it in close proximity to the stomach. They then swallowed the activated and calibrated SmartPill device along with a 250 ml drink containing 10 g lactulose, 5 g mannitol and 5 g glucose. Hence the volume of water consumed was identical to that used in the first study. Each participant was subsequently monitored for seven hours <xref rid="pone.0099256-Kloetzer1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. As in the permeability study, the participants were not allowed to eat or drink during the study period but were given a further 200 ml water mid-way through the session. Ethics approval for this part of the study was obtained from the Massey University Human Ethics Committee Southern A 12/42.</p><p>A body of work has been published describing the use of the SmartPill in determination of gastric and small intestinal transit times <xref rid="pone.0099256-Timm1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0099256-Cassilly1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> to solids and liquids and the device has been approved for the determination of these parameters in a clinical context <xref rid="pone.0099256-Rao1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. The use of the motility capsule is considered a viable alternative to scintigraphy in the assessment of whole gut transit time <xref rid="pone.0099256-Maqbool1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>.

Hence gastric residence time was determined as the interval taken from the time of ingestion of the capsule to that of the subsequent rise in pH above that of the asymptotic intra gastric decline on entry into the duodenum <xref rid="pone.0099256-Maqbool1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref> (&#x0003e;3pH units). It is noteworthy that such retention time was likely to have been at or above the maximum residence time of the ingested liquid as a body of evidence indicates that particulate solids of greater than 1 mm in linear dimension exited the stomach after concurrently ingested liquid <xref rid="pone.0099256-Cassilly1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> i.e. during phase III of the MMC cycle <xref rid="pone.0099256-Mojaverian1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0099256-Mojaverian2" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>.

We determined cumulative recoveries over a 5 h period for each sugar, both after dosage with placebo and after dosage with aspirin, to allow meaningful comparisons with the five hour recoveries reported in these studies. Where possible, the percentage recoveries and associated standard errors were calculated from the reported values in the studies.</p><p>Comparisons of the temporal pattern of excretion of mannitol with that of published blood glucose values after standard glucose tolerance test were made by assuming that a blood glucose value in the latter represented the outcome of the instantaneous rate at which glucose was absorbed from the gut vs. that at which it was absorbed by the tissues from the blood. Hence the published temporal sequence of blood glucose values could be converted to quantities of glucose required to maintain the recorded glucose levels above fasting levels over a sequence of half-hour periods by calculating the requisite area under the curve according to the method of Tai <italic>et al</italic>

It is however noteworthy that the slope of the SLR for the decline in lactulose excretion during period III following consumption of aspirin was not significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0099256-g002">Figure 2</xref>). The between subjects standard error was minimised and the correlation coefficient optimised on SLR of values for excretion of both sugars during the 2&#x000bd; &#x02212;4 h of collection.

The variation in the LMR would be similarly minimised. Moreover, in the light of the concurrent SmartPill studies, the characteristics of the temporal profiles of the excretion of the two sugars suggest that this period is optimal as it avoids incorporation of gastric residence time which varies greatly between individuals. Hence, the commencement of collection at 2&#x000bd; will ensure that in the majority of subjects the bulk of the dose of each probe will have exited the stomach and the column of digesta containing them will be advancing steadily through the small and large intestine, the low inter-subject variation reflecting the relative lack of variability between subjects in the rates of passive absorption from these structures.</p><p>Given that the permeability of the small intestine (SI) to mannitol is higher than that of the large intestine (LI) <xref rid="pone.0099256-Rao2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> and that the permeability of the LI to lactulose is higher than that of the SI <xref rid="pone.0099256-Rao2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, the temporal profiles of the half-hourly percentage excretion of the two saccharidic probes, fit with a hypotheses that a column of digesta occupies an increasing length of small intestine as it leaves the stomach <xref rid="pone.0099256-Sequeira1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0099256-Lentle1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref> and that the leading edge of this column is transiting from the small to the larger bowel at the time when the trailing edge has left the stomach.</p><p>This conclusion, that a column of digesta containing the probe occupies and is absorbed from, a length of intestine, is supported by a body of data describing the quantitative dependence of hormonal feedback loops that modulate gastric emptying on the length of intestine that is occupied by nutrient containing chyme. Hence the rate of gastric emptying is dependent upon the rate of absorption of nutrients <xref rid="pone.0099256-Fink1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref> such as glucose <xref rid="pone.0099256-Lin1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref> or fat <xref rid="pone.0099256-Lin2" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref> from the volume of digestate <xref rid="pone.0099256-Lin3" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref> that is in contact with small intestinal mucosa and thus to the length of small intestinal lumen that contains it.</p><p>The fact that the mean retention time of the SmartPill (1.79 h) was close to the mean time when the absorption of mannitol was maximal (2 hours after dosage) also fits with this hypothesis given that the SmartPill is likely have been expelled from the stomach after the bulk of the fluid phase was expelled <xref rid="pone.0099256-Mojaverian1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0099256-Mojaverian2" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>
<monospace>. </monospace>Hence, as stated hitherto, the collection period that minimises variance between subjects will occur when, in most subjects, the column of digesta containing the probes is transiting from the small to the large intestine.

However mean gastric emptying time evaluated by the [<sup>13</sup>C] acetate breath test following a 250 ml liquid meal (Fresubin diabetes, Fresenius, Oberursel, Germany) containing protein, carbohydrate and fat (225kcal) is reported to be 1.28&#x000b1;0.31 h <xref rid="pone.0099256-Braden1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>.

However the importance of examining lactulose and mannitol excretion separately <xref rid="pone.0099256-Rao2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> as well as in simple ratio is manifest in these comparisons. Hence the cumulative 5 h lactulose excretion reported in subjects with Crohn&#x02019;s disease <xref rid="pone.0099256-Andre1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref> was similar to that in our study following dosage with aspirin whilst the cumulative 5 h excretion of mannitol was higher than that in our healthy subjects.

However, it is noteworthy that this study included patients with differing Harvey Bradshaw grades of Crohn&#x02019;s disease and included those in remission as well as those with mildly active disease. Again the sites of the lesions varied, some participants having both small and large bowel lesions <xref rid="pone.0099256-Andre1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. Further, the reported values are from studies that included both male and female patients whereas our study included only females.</p><p>The fact that the 5 h cumulative lactulose excretion reported in one study of subjects with frank coeliac disease was lower than those in our studies and their mannitol excretions higher giving LMRs of 0.146 <xref rid="pone.0099256-Fleming1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref> and 0.018 <xref rid="pone.0099256-Uil1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref> is further testament to the variability of the LMR and the variability of the excretion of component sugars with differing inflammatory stimuli. These examples likely indicate that inflammation from a disease and from a pro-inflammatory stimulus such as aspirin can have differing outcomes that may be better identified by comparisons based on the temporal profiles of the two probes rather than the ratios of cumulative excretion. Hence for example, inflammatory disorders of the intestine may have greater influence on the rate of transit of the column of digesta containing the probes through particular segments of the gut. In regard to the latter and in regard to the variability in gastric emptying there is a need for further research, for example to determine whether there is a place for simultaneous use of the SmartPill in determinations of permeability.</p><p>The absorption of mannitol is passive <xref rid="pone.0099256-Bjarnason1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0099256-Krugliak1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref> and dependent largely on the concentration of the sugar in the periphery of the lumen. As such it can provide an index of the extent of mixing the column of digesta within the lumen that is useful in assessing effects from the physical form of the food or pharmaceutical formulation on absorption. Unlike that of glucose, the temporal profile of mannitol absorption is not augmented by hormonal effects such as those from insulin/incretin <xref rid="pone.0099256-Holst1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0099256-Vilsbll1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref> on active transporters. This is readily illustrated by comparisons of the half-hourly percentage cumulative excretion profile of mannitol with published blood sugar values from oral glucose tolerance tests <xref rid="pone.0099256-Ehrmann1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref> that have been integrated <xref rid="pone.0099256-Tai1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref> to convert them from instantaneous rate of absorption/storage to the cumulative quantity of glucose required to maintain the half-hourly profile above the baseline value. Graphic comparison of integrated half-hourly glucose levels from twelve subjects with non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus <xref rid="pone.0099256-Ehrmann1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref> with those of half-hourly mannitol excretion obtained from our study shows that both peaked at approximately two hours post dosage as would be expected if the active absorption or disposal of glucose was inhibited. Conversely graphic comparison of the integrated half-hourly glucose levels of sixty seven healthy women <xref rid="pone.0099256-Ehrmann1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref> with those of half-hourly mannitol excretion from this study showed the glucose levels of healthy subjects peaked earlier and were subsequently attenuated, this presumably resulting from normal incretin and insulin mediated augmentation of glucose uptake and disposal.</p><p>In summary the results of this study indicate that in healthy subjects the quantities of lactulose and mannitol absorbed from the intestine and excreted in the urine, and the ratios between them, may be confounded by differences in the time periods over which they are collected. Hence collection periods should be standardized for use in clinical tests. In this regard the period of highest levels of consistency of absorption between subjects in assays of the absorption and urinary excretion of lactulose and mannitol was between 2.5 and 4 h judged on the basis of minimal standard error and maximal R<sup>2</sup> values of SLR. This period, was shown by concurrent dosage with the SmartPill to correspond to the period when the column of digesta containing the probes was passing from the small to the large intestine. Further, that comparison of the two sugars should include consideration of the absolute amounts of each sugar that are absorbed rather than be restricted to the ratio of the two, as the amounts of each may be influenced differently by disease. Finally, that comparisons of the temporal patterns of sugars that are passively absorbed such as mannitol with those that are actively absorbed such as glucose may be useful in understanding the effects of diseases such as diabetes mellitus on the mucosal dynamics of absorption.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0099256-Halme1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
