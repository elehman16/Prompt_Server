The aim of this study was to investigate whether video feedback using the Marte Meo method promotes a healthy early relationship between infants and vulnerable first-time mothers. Video feedback or usual care was delivered by health visitors during home visits in Danish municipalities.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">This quasi-experimental study included pre- and post-tests of 278 vulnerable families. Mothers were allocated to an intervention group (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;69), a comparison group (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;209) and an exactly matched video subsample from the comparison group (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;63). Data consisted of self-reported questionnaires and video recordings of mother-infant interactions. Outcomes were mother-infant dyadic synchrony (CARE-Index), maternal confidence (KPCS), parental stress (PSS), maternal mood (EPDS) and infant socialemotional behaviours (ASQ:SE). The data were analysed using descriptive and linear multiple regression analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">The levels of dyadic synchrony in the intervention group had significantly improved (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001) at follow-up with a mean score of 9.51 (95%CI;8.93&#x02013;10.09) compared with 7.62 (95%CI;7.03&#x02013;8.21). The intervention group also showed a higher level of maternal sensitivity with a mean score of 9.55 (95%CI;8.96&#x02013;10.14) compared with 7.83 (95%CI;7.19&#x02013;8.46) in the matched video subsample (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001). With respect to infant cooperation, similar improvements were found with a mean score of 9.43 (95% CI;8.88&#x02013;9.99) in the intervention group compared with 7.73 (95%CI;7.13&#x02013;8.33) in the matched video subsample from the comparison group (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001). Furthermore, mothers in the intervention group reported significantly lower levels of parental stress with a mean score of 32.04 (95%CI;30.13&#x02013;33.94) compared with 35.29 (95%CI;34.07&#x02013;36.52) in the comparison group (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.03), as well as higher levels of maternal confidence with a mean score of 41.10 (95%CI;40.22&#x02013;41.98) compared with 40.10 (95%CI;39.65&#x02013;40.56) in the comparison group (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.04). No significant differences were found in EPDS and ASQ:SE.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par4">The findings support the assumption that video feedback using the Marte Meo method early after birth may strengthen the relationship between infants and vulnerable firsttime mothers as well as improve maternal psychosocial functioning. Further research applying random assignment is needed to strengthen these conclusions; further research is also needed to assess any long term effects of the video feedback intervention using the Marte Meo method.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par5">This study was registered on 24 January 2013 in ClinicalTrials.gov with the identifier: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01799447?term=01799447&#x00026;rank=1">NCT01799447</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (10.1186/s12884-017-1568-1) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Mother-infant interactions</kwd><kwd>Health visitor</kwd><kwd>Infant</kwd><kwd>CARE-index</kwd><kwd>Marte Meo method</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007605</institution-id><institution>Aarhus Universitet</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>908792</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kristensen</surname><given-names>Ingeborg Hedegaard</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Central Denmark Region</institution></funding-source><award-id>12362</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kristensen</surname><given-names>Ingeborg Hedegaard</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004191</institution-id><institution>Novo Nordisk</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>11946</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kristensen</surname><given-names>Ingeborg Hedegaard</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par12">The postnatal period has been identified as particularly important for the establishment of early, healthy infant-mother relationships. The nature of this early relationship is associated with infants&#x02019; cognitive development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] as well as their physical [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and psychosocial health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Around 58% of infants in developed countries are securely attached to their mother [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In Denmark, 18% of 1&#x000bd;&#x000a0;year old children show symptoms of mental problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Research on attachment points to the quality of this early relationship as a possible source of such disturbances, and distinguishes between secure and insecure attachment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] where sensitive parenting may lead to secure attachment and insensitive parenting may lead to insecure attachment. Sensitive parenting is central to infants&#x02019; psychosocial functioning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. According to Ainsworth et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], the core features of sensitive parenting are acceptance, awareness, responsiveness and cooperation. Following Feldman [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], mothers&#x02019; sensitivity can be observed in their ability to engage in positive interactions of synchronous contact with their infants. Thus, sensitive parenting is highly dependent on the mother&#x02019;s psychosocial functioning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Insensitive parenting may be displayed by mothers who experience abuse, critical illness, domestic conflict and their own or their partner&#x02019;s mental illness. These mothers have a high risk of developing relationship disorders with their infant in the postnatal period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Mothers with low maternal confidence, lack of maternal experience and symptoms of postnatal depression and mothers who have experienced preterm delivery may also be insensitive in the parenting role and have a lower and more hidden risk of developing poorer relationships with their infant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. First-time mothers may be insecure about responding to the infant&#x02019;s cues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]; in particular, mothers who perceive their infant to be crying persistently or who sleep poorly have shown disturbances in establishing early relationships with their infants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Maternal insecurity appears to be most pronounced during the first weeks after birth, especially among first-time mothers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. A Danish study found that more than half of first-time mothers stated that they had difficulties in soothing their infant during this early period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Approximately 7&#x02013;14% of new mothers are affected by postnatal depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]; these mothers have been found to be less sensitive to their infants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Premature delivery, which is experienced worldwide by 11% of mothers and in developed countries by 6&#x02013;8% of mothers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], can also disturb the development of healthy early relationships because the premature infant&#x02019;s cues may be immature and difficult to read, and the mother may experience psychosocial problems such as crisis, sorrow, stress, uncertainty and helplessness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Thus, there is an extensive body of knowledge about vulnerable mother-infant interactions where mothers and infants may need extra support to build healthy early relationships.</p><p id="Par13">The World Health Organization (WHO) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] recommends that health professionals support parents in building healthy early relationships. Short standardised parenting programmes focused on new parents&#x02019; sensitivity and responsiveness to their infants have a positive impact on mothers&#x02019; psychosocial functioning and on mother-infant interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. In particular, methods using video feedback in home visits in a selected at-risk population of families have shown positive short term effects on infants&#x02019; responsiveness to mothers as well as on parental stress and confidence in the parenting role [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Van Doesum et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] also found evidence of a positive, long term effect. One meta-analysis found stronger positive effects of video feedback when the method was used with low-risk families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Another study found no effects of video feedback in a universal intervention that targeted fathers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. The Marte Meo method is a programme that builds on current knowledge of best practice using video feedback to target mothers&#x02019; sensitivity and is aimed at developing mothers&#x02019; healthy early relationships with their infants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. The method is widely used in Scandinavia in interventions that address the quality of the early parent-child relationship. A recent Norwegian randomised, controlled trial targeting families with children from 0 to 2&#x000a0;years with parent-child interaction problems found that the Marte Meo method had positive short term effects on parent-child interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. A Norwegian qualitative study of mothers with postnatal depression found that the Marte Meo method helped them develop in their parental role [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. However, no systematic effect evaluation of the Marte Meo in a community setting in the early months after birth has been conducted.</p><p id="Par14">The objectives of the present study were thus to explore whether a standardised video feedback intervention programme using the Marte Meo method in a community setting promoted the development of healthy early relationships between infants and vulnerable first-time mothers.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Method</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par15">A quasi-experimental design was used to compare and contrast an intervention group of vulnerable first-time mothers receiving feedback using the Marte Meo method during a 4-month period with a comparison group of mothers receiving standard care. The design included pre-tests at baseline, 2&#x000a0;months postpartum and post-tests 6&#x000a0;months postpartum. Both groups received standard care from health visitors. The intervention group received an additional programme with early intervention using the Marte Meo method designed for this study&#x000a0;(Kristensen: Early Intervention with the Marte Meo method - Manual, unpublished).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Setting</title><p id="Par16">Six municipalities representing 52% of the inhabitants of the invited 17 municipalities in the Central Denmark Region accepted the invitation to participate in the study. The study was conducted from September 2013 to December 2014. In Denmark, all new families receive visits by community health visitors as part of a universal prevention programme that is initiated at discharge from the hospital and continues throughout the first year. Mothers are allocated a health visitor who works within the geographical districts where they reside when the municipal authorities receive birth information from the hospital. Nearly all first-time parents (97&#x02013;99%) participate in this programme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. The programme emphasises health guidance related to infant and parental wellbeing, infant growth, development, nutrition and support in establishing an healthy early parent-infant relationship [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Health visitors are registered nurses with 1&#x000a0;year of additional education in infant and child health. Recently, about 20% of the health visitors in the participating municipalities received additional training in giving video feedback using the Marte Meo method.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Developing the video feedback intervention programme</title><p id="Par17">Elements from the Intervention Mapping approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>] were used to develop and plan this quasi-experimental study in a community setting. The method addressed the complexity of the intervention study with two study populations: a primary study population of first-time mothers who received the Marte Meo intervention programme or standard care only, and a secondary study population of health visitors who delivered the Marte Meo intervention programme or standard care. The results of the secondary study population of health visitors are described elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>].</p><p id="Par18">The video feedback intervention programme was based on the Marte Meo method, an approach developed by observation of numerous case studies of parent-infant interactions by Maria Aarts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. The Marte Meo method uses video feedback with parents who express concern and need support in relation to their infant and the parenting role [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. The programme includes video feedback focused on specific guidance aimed at promoting parents&#x02019; sensitivity and responses towards their infant. In the present Marte Meo programme, the health visitor video-taped 3&#x02013;5&#x000a0;min of a parent-infant interaction. This sequence was subsequently analysed by health visitors and prepared for the next home visit which focused on five elements in the parent&#x02019;s behaviour that were directly observable during the video-taped interaction: 1) waiting, observing and following the infant&#x02019;s initiative, 2) positively confirming the infant&#x02019;s initiative, 3) putting own and the infant&#x02019;s initiatives into words, 4) taking turns with the infant and 5) interacting with positively leadership [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. During the next home visit, the mother and the health visitor watched the edited replay of the video and subsequently discussed situations where the mother had concrete opportunities to connect with her infant as well as the infant&#x02019;s response to the mother&#x02019;s interaction. Afterwards, the mothers were given Marte Meo working points to practise until the next home visit. Similar to the video interaction guiding programme (VIG) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>] and video feedback intervention (VIPP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], the programme is intended to promote sensitive parenting. Unlike the VIPP video feedback method with standardised lessons, the number of sessions is flexible since the programme starts with the most pressing concern of the mother and continues until the mother and health visitor agree that the mother&#x02019;s initial concerns have been resolved. The programme consists of 2&#x02013;5 additional video feedback sessions in home visits between 2 and 6&#x000a0;months postpartum.</p><p id="Par19">The health visitors in the intervention group were all certified Marte Meo therapists who had recently participated in a 16-h training workshop to brush up on how to assess video interactions according to the Marte Meo method and learn how to use the programme manual developed specifically for the present study (Kristensen: Early Intervention with the Marte Meo method - Manual, unpublished).</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Participating health visitors</title><p id="Par20">All 186 health visitors employed in the six participating municipalities agreed to participate in the study. Among these health visitors, 36 were certified Marte Meo therapists and 90 health visitors had no additional parenting programme education. Together they formed the secondary study population who were to deliver the Marte Meo programme or standard care during the project period. Sixty health visitors were not included in the secondary study population study because they had participated in other standardised parenting programme education programmes than Marte Meo or because they were employed only in school health services.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Participating mothers</title><p id="Par21">All first-time mothers giving birth during the study period and who lived in a district with a health visitor participating in the study were invited to take part in the study when the health visitor paid her first ordinary home visit and filled in questionnaires at 2 and 6&#x000a0;months postpartum. Mothers were not invited if their Danish language skills were considered insufficient to be able to fill in a Danish language questionnaire. The study population from which the intervention group was recruited comprised mothers living in districts with health visitors certified as Marte Meo therapists. The study population from which the comparison group was recruited comprised mothers living in districts with health visitors without a parenting programme education. The inclusion and exclusion criteria were similar for the intervention and the comparison groups. Included mothers were defined as vulnerable if they met at least one or more of the following three criteria: 1) low parenting confidence score&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;40 on the Karitane Parenting Confidence Scale (KPCS), 2) moderate parenting mood score&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;=8&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;13 on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and 3) moderate preterm birth between &#x0003e;&#x02009;=&#x02009;32 and &#x0003c;&#x02009;37 gestational weeks. Mothers were excluded if they received treatment in other organisations, had an EPDS score of 13 or more, had given birth prematurely (i.e. &#x0003c;&#x02009;32 gestational weeks) or were referred to other sectors due to mental illness, abuse including medicine and alcohol, and lack of parental capacity. Also, mothers with infants who suffered from severe disabilities were excluded from the intervention. In the intervention group, invited mothers were screened for vulnerability during the health visitor&#x02019;s ordinary home visit 7&#x02013;9&#x000a0;weeks postpartum by asking the mother to fill in the KPCS and the EPDS scales. In the comparison group, mothers were identified as vulnerable based on their reply to the same questions in the baseline questionnaire.</p><p id="Par22">An exactly matched video subsample was ensured by matching one vulnerable mother from the intervention group with one vulnerable mother from the comparison group. The variables used for matching were the following three inclusion criteria: 1) low parenting confidence score&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;40 (KPCS), 2) moderate parenting mood score&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;=8&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;13 (EPDS) and 3) moderate preterm birth between &#x0003e;&#x02009;=&#x02009;32 and &#x0003c;&#x02009;37 gestational weeks.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Data collection</title><p id="Par23">Data consisted of video recordings of mother-infant interactions from the intervention group and matched video subsample from the comparison group, as well as the responses from self-reported questionnaires from the intervention group and the entire comparison group. Three-minute video sequences of mother-infant play were coded using a validated method, the CARE-Index [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>], to assess dyadic synchrony, mothers&#x02019; sensitive behaviour and infants&#x02019; cooperative behaviour in the interactions. In the intervention group, we used the last video recorded during the intervention programme 4&#x02013;6&#x000a0;months postpartum, and these videos were collected by health visitors in the intervention group. In the comparison group, the exactly matched video subsample from the comparison group of 63 vulnerable mothers was videotaped by a health visitor with a Marte Meo therapist education in the family&#x02019;s home 5&#x02013;6&#x000a0;months postpartum.</p><p id="Par24">Questionnaires were used to collect data on maternal socioeconomic group, preparation for parenting, maternal psychosocial functioning and infant birth and social-emotional behaviour. The questionnaires primarily included previously validated and pilot-tested questions, and the questions were reversed in order to ensure their comprehensibility, relevance and acceptability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. The baseline questionnaire was sent by e-mail after the researcher had received informed consent from study participants. The e-mail contained a link to a database where mothers could fill in the questionnaire at home 2&#x000a0;months postpartum and a follow-up questionnaire 6&#x000a0;months postpartum. One mother who had no e-mail account received the questionnaire by ordinary mail. Reminders were sent by e-mail and text message after 2 and 3&#x000a0;weeks, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Primary outcome measure</title><p id="Par25">The primary outcome measure was mother-infant interaction measured as dyadic synchrony on the CARE-Index [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Scores ranged from 0 to 14 with higher scores indicating better dyadic synchrony. In all, 132 video recordings were coded; 69 in the intervention group and 63 in the video subsample of the comparison group. Coding took place from August 2014 to January 2015; codings were performed by the first author and by two health visitors, all certified by Crittenden as research raters in 2014. To ensure inter-rater reliability, a random, blinded sample of 20% of the video recordings was initially coded by the three raters independently. The Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha coefficient test showed high reliability in rating dyadic synchrony (0.88). To prevent raters&#x02019; drift, 10% of the video recordings were drawn randomly from the sample during the coding period, and mother-infant interactions were assessed independently before they were discussed and coded in agreement between the three raters at monthly meetings.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Secondary observational outcome measures</title><p id="Par26">Maternal sensitivity and infant cooperative behaviour were coded using the CARE-Index [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>].

The programme was found to increase dyadic synchrony between mother and infant and to be conducive to a more cooperative infant interaction and a more sensitive mother interaction in the intervention group compared with the matched video subsample of the comparison group. The observational outcomes were supported by the self-reported data that showed a significantly higher level of maternal confidence and significantly lower level of parental stress among mothers in the intervention group than among mothers in the comparison group.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>The programme content</title><p id="Par43">The results of the programme may be explained by the combination of video observations and feedback from the health visitors where mothers became more sensitive towards their infants&#x02019; interactions when they were guided to read and understand infant cues and their own response to these cues. In a laboratory study, Leavitt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>] discovered that health professionals interpreting infants&#x02019; behaviour and cues towards the mother could facilitate maternal sensitivity and responsiveness towards the infant. In observational studies, Ainsworth et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] found that infants&#x02019; appearance aroused parents&#x02019; feelings and this has later been reported to be a core component in mothers&#x02019; understanding of and adequate response to her infant. Our programme included video feedback where health visitors had prepared a selection of video recordings showing where mothers were doing well in their contact with their infants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. This delayed video feedback may be superior to health visitors&#x02019; home visits because it allows the health visitor to prepare feedback with a selection of positive interactions, and positive feelings may be aroused when mothers observe their own infant&#x02019;s response. Dialogue may help the mother to see herself from the outside and understand her infant and consequently respond more adequately to the infant&#x02019;s cues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. Our findings showed that trained health visitors using video feedback in home visiting programmes as suggested in the Marte Meo approach may facilitate healthier mother-infant relationships among vulnerable first-time mothers. Further research is needed to determine the impact of video feedback compared with dialogue.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Results related to other studies</title><p id="Par44">Improved mother-infant interaction is consistent with previous effect studies of interventions that used video feedback in home visiting programmes. Both van Doesum et al. (2008) and H&#x000f8;ivik et al.

The higher levels of confidence and lower levels of stress among mothers in the intervention group 6&#x000a0;months postpartum in the present study may be explained by mothers attaining higher degrees of sensitivity in their interactions with their infants as well as the infants&#x02019; more cooperative behaviour. Kapp [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and Jones and Prinz [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] found that if mothers perceive their infants&#x02019; behaviour as being less difficult, this bolsters their confidence.</p><p id="Par46">In the present study, infants in the intervention group did not show significantly fewer social-emotional behavioral problems in the short term follow-up measured by the ASQ:SE than infants in the comparison group. However, in the study of the Marte Meo method targeting families with parent-child interaction problems, H&#x000f8;ivik et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] found long term effects in ASQ:SE measurements 6&#x000a0;months after the intervention. These findings may suggest that improvements in early infant behaviour may facilitate outcomes in social-emotional behaviour measured by the ASQ:SE in the longer term. A useful follow-up on the present study could thus be to explore whether immediate, positive outcomes in the form of infants becoming more cooperative in their interactions lead to improved social-emotional behaviour. Infants&#x02019; social-emotional behaviour may develop as a result of the programme&#x02019;s promotion of more sensitive parenting. Thus, infants may become more cooperative in their interactions at an early age and show more secure attachments in later life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Limitations</title><p id="Par47">The quasi-experimental design applied in the present study was the most rigorous method for evaluating the Marte Meo intervention which was already an established practice in some districts in this study. Thus, randomisation of mothers or districts to the intervention or control group was not an option. In order to study differences between groups in a homogeneous study population, we invited first-time mothers because they are characterised by greater insecurity than multiparous mothers and are therefore in need of greater support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The intervention and comparison groups were equal at baseline with regard to maternal confidence, mood and rate of preterm birth, but there were differences in terms of educational level and self-reported stress. To eliminate the possibility of confounding bias, we controlled the outcomes for baseline differences in multiple regression analyses. However, the absence of randomisation is a limitation because other unknown and non-identified confounders may not be balanced across the two groups under comparison. Further research with randomised controlled trials is required to determine whether the improved levels of psychosocial functioning among mothers and infants may be ascribed to participation in the programme. Further research is also needed to assess long term effects of the video feedback intervention using the Marte Meo method.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par48">This study investigated the effectiveness of a standardised home visiting programme using the Marte Meo method to ensure the establishment of early mother-infant interaction among vulnerable first-time mothers early after birth in a community setting. Although existing results favour the use of the Marte Meo programme in clinical contexts with vulnerable first-time mothers to promote healthy early infant-mother relationships and improve infants&#x02019; cooperation and mothers&#x02019; sensitivity and psychosocial functioning, more research is needed, such as a randomised controlled study to determine causality in a community setting. Further research is also needed to assess the long term effects of using the Marte Meo method early after birth.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec24"><title>Additional file</title><p id="Par55">
