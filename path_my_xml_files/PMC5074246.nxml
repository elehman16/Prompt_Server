Herein, we report long&#x02010;term safety and efficacy results of taliglucerase alfa in treatment&#x02010;na&#x000ef;ve adult patients with GD. Patients were randomized to receive taliglucerase alfa 30 or 60 U/kg every other week, and 23 patients completed 36 months of treatment. Taliglucerase alfa (30 U/kg; 60 U/kg, respectively) resulted in mean decreases in spleen volume (50.1%; 64.6%) and liver volume (25.6%; 24.4%) with mean increases in hemoglobin concentration (16.0%; 35.8%) and platelet count (45.7%; 114.0%), and mean decreases in chitotriosidase activity (71.5%; 82.2%). All treatment&#x02010;related adverse events were mild to moderate in intensity and transient. The most common adverse events were nasopharyngitis, arthralgia, upper respiratory tract infection, headache, pain in extremity, and hypertension. These 36&#x02010;month results of taliglucerase alfa in treatment&#x02010;na&#x000ef;ve adult patients with GD demonstrate continued improvement in disease parameters with no new safety concerns. These findings extend the taliglucerase alfa clinical safety and efficacy dataset. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov">www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link> identifier NCT00705939.

Study PB&#x02010;06&#x02010;003 was designed to be an extension study for patients completing trials PB&#x02010;06&#x02010;001 and PB&#x02010;06&#x02010;002 (a 9&#x02010;month multicenter, open&#x02010;label study of efficacy and safety in adults and children switching from imiglucerase to taliglucerase alfa; NCT00712348). Patients from Study PB&#x02010;06&#x02010;001 continued double&#x02010;blind treatment for an additional 15 months in Study PB&#x02010;06&#x02010;003 for a total of 24 months of double&#x02010;blind treatment, at which time the investigator could request unblinding of the patient's dose.

From baseline to 24 months, this patient showed improvements in spleen volume (&#x02212;49.5%; measured in MN), liver volume (&#x02212;29.5%; measured in MN), hemoglobin concentration (+7.3%), platelet count (+35.4%), chitotriosidase activity (&#x02212;73.0%), and CCL18 concentration (&#x02212;40.9%). The second patient (22&#x02010;030; 60 U/kg) discontinued because of logistical reasons; this patient experienced fatigue and sinusitis, which were considered to be AEs that were not related to treatment. This patient received taliglucerase alfa for a total of 24 months; from baseline to last observation, the patient showed improvements in spleen volume (&#x02212;43.5%; measured in MN), hemoglobin concentration (+13.3%), platelet count (+115.2%), chitotriosidase activity (&#x02212;70.3%), and CCL18 concentration (&#x02212;58.7%), while the liver volume remained in the normal range at 0.98 MN. The third patient (10&#x02010;013; 60 U/kg) discontinued at the investigator's request to investigate itching and rash on the arms, which were considered possibly related to treatment after the 38th infusion.

Most AEs (98.5%) were mild to moderate in severity and transient in nature, as were all treatment&#x02010;related AEs. Ten patients experienced a total of 36 AEs considered to be related to treatment. All of these events resolved and the patients continued the study with no change in dose. Four severe AEs, considered unrelated to treatment, occurred in three patients during the study: pain from a hemangioma in the left knee and surgical treatment for the hemangioma resulting in a pulmonary embolism (Patient 41&#x02010;022), immune thrombocytopenia (Patient 11&#x02010;007), and diabetes mellitus (Patient 40&#x02010;018). There were no safety issues that evolved as a consequence of low platelet count in the patient with the diagnosis of immune thrombocytopenia. Three patients experienced four serious AEs during the study: head injury in a patient with epilepsy (Patient 10&#x02010;013), immune thrombocytopenia (noted above), hemangioma, and pulmonary embolism (noted above), all of which were considered not related to treatment and all of which resolved.</p><table-wrap id="ajh24369-tbl-0001" xml:lang="en" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>AEs Occurring During the Extension Period (Safety Population; <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;26)</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><col style="border-bottom:solid 1px #000000border-right:solid 1px #000000" width="80pt" span="1"/><col style="border-bottom:solid 1px #000000border-right:solid 1px #000000" width="80pt" span="1"/><col style="border-bottom:solid 1px #000000border-right:solid 1px #000000" width="80pt" span="1"/><thead valign="bottom"><tr style="border-bottom:solid 1px #000000"><th align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="center" valign="bottom" rowspan="1" colspan="1">No. of AEs (No. of patients)</th><th align="center" valign="bottom" rowspan="1" colspan="1">% of total AEs</th></tr></thead><tbody valign="top"><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Total AEs</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">275 (24)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">100</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mild or moderate</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">271 (23)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">98.5</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Severe or very severe</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4 (3)</td><td rowspan="3" align="char" char="." valign="top" colspan="1">1.1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;30 U/kg</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2 (1)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;60 U/kg</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2 (2)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Non&#x02013;treatment&#x02010;related<xref ref-type="fn" rid="ajh24369-note-0002">a</xref>

All treatment&#x02010;related AEs were mild or moderate in severity and resolved.</p><p>Dose increases occurred in three patients: One patient (10&#x02010;001, 30 U/kg), with a baseline platelet count of 28,000/mm<sup>3</sup>, received blinded treatment through 30 total months after which the blind was opened and the dose increased to 60 U/kg for the remainder of the study. This patient's platelet counts were 28,000/mm<sup>3</sup> at 30 months and 31,000/mm<sup>3</sup> at 36 months. From baseline to 36 months, the patient's platelet count had risen by 10.7% and the patient also showed improvements in spleen volume (&#x02212;45.7%; measured in MN), liver volume (&#x02212;23.8%; measured in MN), hemoglobin concentration (+17.5%), chitotriosidase activity (&#x02212;54.6%), and CCL18 concentration (&#x02212;39.7%). The second patient (11&#x02010;014) received 30 U/kg through approximately 26 months of treatment, at which time a bone crisis occurred. This patient's dose was increased to 45 U/kg until the end of the study. The patient was treated with nonsteroidal anti&#x02010;inflammatory drugs, and the AE resolved after 1 month without recurrence of bone crisis throughout the remainder of the study. From baseline through 36 months, this patient experienced improvements in spleen volume (&#x02212;47.5%; measured in MN), liver volume (&#x02212;23.0%; measured in MN), hemoglobin concentration (+7.5%), platelet count (+42.0%), chitotriosidase activity (&#x02212;88.3%), and CCL18 concentration (&#x02212;77.7%). The third patient (42&#x02010;025) received blinded treatment through 24 total months at 30 U/kg. Due to a low baseline platelet count of 27,000/mm<sup>3</sup> and small increase to only 33,000/mm<sup>3</sup> (22.2%) at 24 months, the patient's dose was increased to 60 U/kg through the end of the study. At 36 months, the platelet count was 30,000/mm<sup>3</sup>. From baseline through 36 months, improvements were observed in spleen volume (&#x02212;43.6%; measured in MN), liver volume (&#x02212;17.9%; measured in MN), hemoglobin concentration (+23.3%), platelet count (+11.1%), chitotriosidase activity (&#x02212;66.4%), and CCL18 concentration (&#x02212;51.6%).</p><p>Although the dose increase in the patient experiencing bone crisis (11&#x02010;014) had a positive impact on the resolution of the bone symptoms, dose escalations did not make a clinically meaningful difference in the platelet counts of the other two patients.

While focal splenic lesions are associated with refractory thrombocytopenia <xref rid="ajh24369-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref>, magnetic resonance imaging scans of both patients' spleens did not reveal evidence of intra&#x02010;splenic lesions.</p><p>Development of neutralizing antibodies did not appear to result in a loss of efficacy, and no changes in treatment were initiated for either patient (15&#x02010;016 and 30&#x02010;008) with neutralizing antibodies; both patients completed the study. From baseline through 36 months, two patients (15&#x02010;016 and 30&#x02010;008, respectively) experienced improvements in spleen volume (&#x02212;41.1 and &#x02212;37.1%; measured in MN), liver volume (&#x02212;15.1 and &#x02212;25.9%; measured in MN), chitotriosidase activity (&#x02212;80.9 and &#x02212;60.5%), and CCL18 concentration (&#x02212;63.7 and &#x02212;27.2%). Hemoglobin concentration decreased nominally by 0.8% from 13.2 g/dL at baseline in Patient 15&#x02010;016 but remained in the normal range and increased by 10.3% in Patient 30&#x02010;008, who was anemic at baseline. Platelets increased by 71.8% in Patient 15&#x02010;016 and showed a clinically insignificant decrease from baseline in Patient 30&#x02010;008 (&#x02212;1.2% from 86,000/mm<sup>3</sup> at baseline). The numbers of patients reported as developing anti&#x02010;taliglucerase alfa IgG antibodies in Study PB&#x02010;06&#x02010;003 are higher than those seen in previous, shorter&#x02010;term studies <xref rid="ajh24369-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref>, <xref rid="ajh24369-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref>, and are likely due to increased sensitivity as part of assay modifications resulting in different antibody sample positivity reporting. These modifications were instituted to establish statistically based cut point definitions consistent with current industry practices.</p><p>In conclusion, these long&#x02010;term results of taliglucerase alfa demonstrated continued improvement in the clinical parameters with no new safety concerns through 36 months of treatment in treatment&#x02010;na&#x000ef;ve adult patients with GD. These results extend the clinical safety and efficacy profile of taliglucerase alfa in patients with GD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data"><caption><p>Supporting Information</p></caption><media xlink:href="AJH-91-656-s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="ajh24369-sec-0014"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Pfizer and Protalix entered into an agreement in November 2009 to develop and commercialize taliglucerase alfa.
