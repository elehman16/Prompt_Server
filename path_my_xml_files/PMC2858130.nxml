Disc degeneration may result in rupture or herniation, spinal instability, articular facet syndrome, or painful impingement on the nerves enclosed in the spinal visits in the United States, second only to the common cold. The resultant pain may also lead to significant disability.</p><p>Spinal fusion effectively eliminates the motion segment between two vertebrae by use of a bone graft, thereby providing improved stability and decreased pain. The success rate in spinal fusion has proven highly variable; averaging approximately 60 to 70% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The use of internal fixation generally increases the fusion rate but also increases the stiffness of the fused area. This may lead to increased stress on the adjacent nonfused segments and, in the case of L5/S1 fusions, on the sacroiliac joint.</p><p>Moreover, in addition to the potential failure to achieve fusion, the possibility of long-term adverse effects of fusion has been well documented in the literature. Long-term complications include bone graft donor site pain, pseudoarthrosis, spinal stenosis, spondylolysis acquisita, and, as a result of the increased stress on the adjacent spinal segments and the sacroiliac joint, accelerated degenerative changes in the disc and facet joints [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Segments adjacent to the spinal fusion may also manifest disc herniation, degeneration, spinal stenosis, spondylolysis, facet joint arthritis, or instability. The incidence of the adverse effects reported in the literature is significant, although highly variable. As many as one third of the patients who undergo fusion may develop significant short-term or long-term post-surgical complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>The Activ-L, ProDisc-L and Charit&#x000e9; devices are designed to provide a treatment modality as an alternative to fusion. These devices are modular systems and are intended to be used as intervertebral dynamic disc spacers in the lumbar vertebral region at the L3/L4 (ProDisc-L only), L4/L5 and L5/S1 levels. Disc replacement devices have the advantage of preserving spinal motion thus potentially avoiding adjacent level disease and complications secondary to lack of solid fusion.</p><p>The ProDisc-L and Charit&#x000e9; devices consist of two endplates composed of a CoCrMo alloy and an ultra high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) core. The endplates are available in a range of endplate and core sizes and endplate lordosis angles. All ProDisc endplates are plasma sprayed with calcium phosphate and titanium alloy. The Charit&#x000e9; device has both coated and uncoated endplates. The devices are modular so the surgeon can select the size and angulation that best fits the patient's unique anatomic and physiologic requirements. The Charit&#x000e9; CoCrMo endplates each have six fixation "teeth" on each side of the endplate for attachment to the adjacent vertebral bodies while the ProDisc-L has a central keel and two lateral spikes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>The Charit&#x000e9; UHMWPE core is a convex bearing surface that fits into a circular groove in the endplate. The mobile design provides a floating center of rotation. The ProDisc design incorporates a semi-constrained ball and socket joint. These devices are designed so that the endplates are inserted and secured without the core. After endplate placement, the disc space is distracted to allow the core to be seated in the inferior endplate. By comparison, the Activ-L is inserted as a single unit and therefore does not require this second distraction step. This difference in insertion method is intended to reduce the risk of over-distraction.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>The following study was reviewed and approved by the Yale University Human Investigation Committee.</p><p>The study proposed is a prospective, randomized, single-masked, controlled, multi-center clinical trial consisting of an estimated 414 subjects with single-level DDD of the lumbar spine (L4/L5, or L5/S1) who have failed to improve with conservative treatment for at least six months prior to enrollment. After enrollment, subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to either the Activ-L Disc (investigational device) or the control (Charit&#x000e9; or ProDisc-L). Each investigational site will have a separate, blocked randomization schedule. Fifteen (15) to 20 investigational sites will participate in the investigation. Sites will be encouraged to randomize a minimum of 10 subjects per site and to implant a minimum of four control devices and sites are bound by a maximum of 64 subjects. The first three subjects at each investigational site will receive the Activ-L Disc and will be not be randomized, these patients will be outside of the trial. The purpose of these procedures will be for Surgeon training. Investigators who have already undergone training in implantation of the control disc will be selected for participation; however, for any participating investigator who has not performed at least three prior control implantations, up to three nonrandomized control implantations may also be performed prior to enrolling randomized subjects into the study. This will ensure that experience and proficiency with the implantation method for both discs is comparable. Thus, the maximum total enrollment in the study, including both randomized and nonrandomized cases, is 414 consisting of 261 Activ-L (216 randomized and 45 nonrandomized) and 153 controls (108 randomized and 45 nonrandomized controls).

Technique</title><p>A standard anterior retroperitoneal approach to the lower lumbar spine is utilized. A vascular access surgeon will be used in all cases. The implant comes in two versions: a keel and a spiked variant. The keel version is used in cases of extreme concavity of the endplate. In cases where the endplates are sclerotic, the spike version is indicated.</p><p>After the appropriate level is identified under image intensification, the midline of the vertebral body is determined. The spinous process and pedicles serve as rotational aids in determining the midline. Using a curette, the endplates are cleared of disc residue. A distractor is then used to mobilize the disc compartment. Under AP and lateral x-ray views, the trial plates are then inserted. Care is used to avoid placing the plates too deeply. The disc space is distracted to a point where the implant will be held firmly in place, the height measurement is then read off the distractor. The implant is then assembled on the back table and attached to the inserter. During implantation it is imperative that the implant does not deviate from a central position. The inserter is disconnected from the implant and the position of the implant is checked using image intensification.</p><p>Both treatment and control devices will be implanted anteriorly to ensure comparability between treatment groups.

A decrease of one grade in either evaluation will be considered a failure.</p><p>&#x02022; Maintenance or improvement in motion at the index level, defined as:</p><p>24 month ROM - preoperative ROM &#x02265; 0 (with &#x000b1; 2&#x000b0; measurement error applied) in a patient who does not meet the definition of fusion.</p><p>Fusion as defined in the radiographic protocol will be considered a failure.</p><p>&#x02022; No device failures requiring revision, re-operation, removal, or supplemental fixation.</p><p>&#x02022; Absence of serious device-related adverse events (AEs). For purposes of this study, serious device-related adverse events are defined as serious device-related adverse events as adjudicated by the Clinical Events Committee.</p><p>For purposes of evaluating the primary endpoint, the Clinical Events Committee will determine if an adverse event is device-related. However, the investigator's assessment will also be reported.</p><p>For purposes of the above endpoint definition, the terms "revision," "re-operation," "removal," and "supplemental fixation" are defined as follows:</p><p>&#x02022; A <underline>revision</underline> is a procedure that adjusts or in any way modifies or removes part of the original implant configuration, with or without replacement of a component. A revision may also include adjusting the position of the original configuration.</p><p>&#x02022; A <underline>removal</underline> is a procedure where the entire original system configuration is removed with or without replacement.</p><p>&#x02022; A <underline>re-operation</underline> is any surgical procedure at the involved level(s) that does not include removal, modification, or addition of any components to the system.</p><p>&#x02022; A <underline>supplemental fixation</underline> is a spinal procedure in which additional instrumentation not under study in the protocol is implanted (e.g., supplemental placement of a rod/screw system or a plate/screw system). In addition, any subsequent procedures related to the index level should be reported. This would include posterior fusion, leaving or removing a motion retaining device in place, decompression, facet rhizotomy, etc at the same, adjacent or distant levels.</p></sec><sec><title>Powered Secondary Endpoints</title><p>&#x02022; Back Pain, measured at rest using a visual analog scale (VAS); improvement of 20 mm or more on a 100 mm VAS scale at 24 months compared to baseline will be considered clinically significant.</p><p>&#x02022; Leg Pain, measured at rest using a visual analog scale (VAS). The success rate will be formally tested for superiority in the Activ-L group. A patient will be considered a responder if, at the 24 month visit they achieve at least a 20 mm VAS improvement in the leg with the maximum pain at baseline, with no worsening in the other leg.</p></sec><sec><title>Unpowered Secondary Endpoints</title><p>&#x02022; The mean Oswestry Disability Index score, as well as the mean improvement, will be compared between groups across all study visits. The incidence of both 15% and 15 point improvements will also be compared.</p><p>&#x02022; Quality of Life, measured using the Short Form-36 Questionnaire (SF-36); improvement of 15% in the overall score at 24 months compared to baseline will be considered clinically significant.</p><p>&#x02022; Disc height (incidence of 3 mm change), as measured by standard lateral radiograph.

(NCSS Kaysville, Utah)The PASS 2005 output solves for what the true success rate must be in the Activ-L group in order to have 80% power to detect superiority relative to a number of possible success rates in the control group (plausible range 50-80%). All calculations assume a power of 80% and a two-sided significance level of 0.05. Note that for each case, the required margin of improvement is not particularly onerous. For example, if the true success rate in the control group is 50%, the true success rate in the treatment group need only be 68%. If the control rate is 80%, the Activ-L rate need only be 92%.</p><p>Therefore, with the sample size required to demonstrate the primary composite endpoint, this study is adequately powered to detect a reasonable, yet clinically meaningful difference in rates if Activ-L truly produces greater improvement in pain over time.

The appropriateness of pooling data from multiple centers is necessarily enhanced by training all participating centers to follow the same protocol, with clearly defined inclusion and exclusion criteria for study participation. However, if an interaction is present between treatment and center effects, the results will not be strictly poolable. Thus, in order to protect against improperly pooling data from all study centers, a formal analysis will be conducted to assess the appropriateness of pooling the data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>For the primary endpoint, a logistic regression will be constructed that models the success rate on three factors: treatment group, center, and the treatment group by center interaction. If the interaction term is significant at a two-sided &#x003b1; = 0.05 level of significance, then the offending center(s) will be identified and all analyses will be presented in a stratified fashion, since pooling the results would make interpretation of the trial difficult.</p><p>If, on the other hand, the interaction term is insignificant but the center term is significant, then fixed effects for center will be added to the final models for, at a minimum, the primary endpoint. Controlling for confounding center effects in this fashion is a well-accepted technique.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Present treatment for disc degeneration ranges from conservative modalities, such as rest, heat, electrotherapy, physical therapy, and analgesics to surgery. Currently, there are two main surgical techniques for treatment of disc degeneration: (1) nucleotomy or discectomy, i.e., excision of part or all of the degenerated disc, which is typically performed for treatment of radicular syndrome in the case of disc herniation; and (2) spinal fusion, i.e. grafting bone between the vertebrae adjacent to the degenerated disc to eliminate articulation at the damaged reduction of the intervertebral space. Rigid internal fixation may also be used to promote fusion.</p><p>The Activ-L Disc is designed to provide a new therapeutic option for treatment of degenerative disc disease as an alternative to spinal fusion to preserve function in the lumbar vertebral region. By allowing motion at the diseased segment the replacement disc would limit the advance of adjacent level disease as well as preclude the need for fusion.</p><p>The Activ-L, ProDisc-L and Charit&#x000e9; devices are designed to provide a treatment modality as an alternative to fusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. These devices are modular systems and are intended to be used as intervertebral dynamic disc spacers in the lumbar vertebral region at the L3/L4 (ProDisc-L only), L4/L5 and L5/S1 levels.</p><p>Our study will further allow the generation of results comparing fusions with the two types of disc replacements in treating degeneration in the lumbar spine. The results will have a relevant impact on providing additional safety and efficacy data in regards to a promising alternative to lumbar spine fusions.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>Dr James Yue is a consultant for Aesculap.
