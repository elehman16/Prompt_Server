Introduction</title><p>The &#x0201c;Western diet&#x0201d;, characterized by a high intake of processed food, animal protein, and refined carbohydrates, combined with poor intake of fruit and vegetables, has become widespread in recent decades. Dietary protein from animal sources is rich in the sulphur-containing amino acids cysteine and methionine, which when metabolized lead to production of the non-volatile acids hydrochloric acid and hydrogen sulphate [<xref rid="B1-nutrients-09-00861" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-nutrients-09-00861" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-nutrients-09-00861" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. This process, coupled with a deficiency in the buffering of potassium and magnesium salts due to inadequate fruit and vegetable intake, renders the Western diet acidogenic in nature. It has been suggested that the high acid load of the Western diet contributes to the development of &#x02018;mild metabolic acidosis&#x02019;, a state of relatively low blood pH or serum bicarbonate concentration within the normal range [<xref rid="B4-nutrients-09-00861" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. </p><p>Recent large cohort studies have suggested a link between high dietary acid load and insulin resistance or diabetes [<xref rid="B5-nutrients-09-00861" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-nutrients-09-00861" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In these studies, the indices of diet acidity potential renal acid load (PRAL, based on the dietary intake of protein, phosphorous, potassium, magnesium and calcium) and net endogenous acid production (NEAP, based on the dietary intake of protein and potassium) were associated with insulin resistance [<xref rid="B6-nutrients-09-00861" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and diabetes [<xref rid="B5-nutrients-09-00861" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B7-nutrients-09-00861" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, other studies reported no association between dietary acid load indices and insulin resistance or diabetes [<xref rid="B8-nutrients-09-00861" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-nutrients-09-00861" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The inconsistent findings in studies may relate to the different characteristics of the cohorts studied, and the inherent limitations associated with indices calculated from self-reported diet diaries.</p><p>In support of a link between body acidity and diabetes risk, a retrospective analysis of the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey found that lower serum bicarbonate concentrations were associated with insulin resistance, as measured by an index based on fasting serum insulin and triglycerides [<xref rid="B10-nutrients-09-00861" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Longitudinal evidence from the Nurses&#x02019; Health Study showed that lower concentrations of plasma bicarbonate were associated with higher type 2 diabetes risk over 10 years [<xref rid="B11-nutrients-09-00861" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. </p><p>Associations between acidosis and impaired glucose metabolism were originally identified almost a century ago [<xref rid="B12-nutrients-09-00861" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], and early studies demonstrated that administration of ammonium chloride for three days to healthy individuals resulted in mild metabolic acidosis and increased insulin resistance [<xref rid="B13-nutrients-09-00861" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Conversely, several studies reported that correcting overt metabolic acidosis in chronic renal failure patients with oral sodium bicarbonate improved insulin resistance [<xref rid="B14-nutrients-09-00861" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-nutrients-09-00861" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>Based on these findings, it has been suggested that adherence to a low PRAL (&#x0201c;alkaline&#x0201d;) diet or consumption of an alkaline supplement to offset the acid load of a meal may be used to improve glucose metabolism in at-risk individuals [<xref rid="B16-nutrients-09-00861" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, to have a chronic effect on glucose metabolism, the alkalizing effect of a low PRAL diet may, or may not, be mediated by acute (that is, immediately post-meal) mechanisms, relating to insulin secretion. Furthermore, it remains unclear whether an alkalizing intervention can affect postprandial glucose metabolism in individuals with normal renal function. In the present study, we performed a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled crossover study to determine the effect of pre-prandial oral sodium bicarbonate on postprandial glucose metabolism in non-diabetic participants with normal renal function. We hypothesized that buffering a high acid load meal will attenuate postprandial blood pH decrease and glycaemic response. </p></sec><sec id="sec2-nutrients-09-00861"><title>2.

Meal Study Procedures</title><p>Participants were asked not to exercise or drink alcohol for 48 h prior to the meal studies. To minimize variation between studies, participants were asked to follow a similar routine before the studies, with particular attention to the meal content on the night before the study. Participants reported to the Clinical Research Facility in the morning after an overnight fast, placed on a hospital bed, and an 18-gauge intravenous cannula inserted in the antecubital fossa. Baseline venous blood samples, blood pressure, arterial stiffness, and subjective satiety and hunger measures were ascertained at <italic>t</italic> = &#x02212;30 min before administration of the intervention (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-09-00861-f002">Figure 2</xref>). The study capsules were administered 15 min prior to ingestion of a meal consisting of two breakfast muffins (Sausage and Egg McMuffin, McDonald&#x02019;s Corporation<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Sydney, Australia) and 250 mL apple juice (Golden Circle<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Brisbane, Australia). Nutritional breakdown of the meal was calculated using FoodWorks 7 (Xyris, Spring Hill, QLD, Australia) based on the ingredients provided by the manufacturers (<xref ref-type="table" rid="nutrients-09-00861-t001">Table 1</xref>). </p><p>Participants were given 20 min to consume the meal, with the 3 h follow up commencing at the completion of the meal (<italic>t</italic> = 0, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-09-00861-f002">Figure 2</xref>).

Blood Pressure and Arterial Stiffness</title><p>Blood pressure was measured using a manual device (WelchAllyn, Arden, NC, USA) and arterial stiffness was measured by applanation tonometry of the radial artery with a highly-sensitive transducer (AtCor Medical, Sydney, Australia), as previously described [<xref rid="B18-nutrients-09-00861" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The augmentation index (a surrogate of arterial stiffness) was calculated by the instrument&#x02019;s program by dividing the difference between the second systolic peak and the diastolic pressure by the difference between the first systolic peak and the diastolic pressure (&#x000d7;100, %), as previously described [<xref rid="B19-nutrients-09-00861" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot5-nutrients-09-00861"><title>2.5.

Serum insulin and <italic>C</italic>-peptide were measured using radioimmunoassay (Merck Millipore, St. Charles, MO, USA; intra-assay CVs were 4% and 7%, respectively) and NEFA concentrations using a colorimetric assay (Wako Diagnostics, Richmond, VA, USA; intra-assay CV 5%). Blood for GLP-1 analysis was collected into chilled 4 mL ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)-coated tube with dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor and trasylol to minimize GLP-1 degradation after collection. Total GLP-1 concentrations were analysed by radioimmunoassay (Merck Millipore, St. Charles, MO, USA) after extraction of plasma with 95% ethanol according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s protocol (intra-assay CV 10%). </p></sec><sec id="sec2dot6-nutrients-09-00861"><title>2.6.

Statistical Analysis</title><p>A priori power analysis calculation was performed to detect a change in postprandial glucose excursions, measured by area under the curve of the glucose concentrations postprandially, based on a similar cohort studied by our group at the Clinical Research Facility at the Garvan Institute previously. Thirty participants were required to complete the study with &#x003b1; &#x0003c; 0.05 and statistical power 1 &#x02212; &#x003b2; &#x02265; 0.8 (two-sided). All data are expressed as mean &#x000b1; standard deviation (SD), unless when data were not normally distributed, in which data are presented as median and interquartile range (IQR). Data not normally distributed were logarithmically transformed prior to statistical analysis. Incremental area under the curve (iAUC) for the outcome measures was calculated using the trapezoidal rule [<xref rid="B20-nutrients-09-00861" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Differences between iAUC of outcome measures post sodium bicarbonate vs. placebo were tested using paired <italic>t</italic>-tests. Two-way repeated measure ANOVA tests were conducted to assess differences in the response to the meal with sodium bicarbonate vs placebo, where <italic>p</italic><sub>time</sub> indicates the main effect of time (i.e., the meal on its own), <italic>p</italic><sub>treatment</sub> indicates the main effect of the treatment throughout the meal, and <italic>p</italic><sub>interaction</sub> indicates the effect of the interaction between time and treatment. Blood samples, blood pressure, arterial stiffness and hunger and satiety scores were collected at <italic>t</italic> = &#x02212;30 min (baseline), then immediately after ingestion of the meal (0 min), then postprandially at 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-09-00861-f002">Figure 2</xref>). A sub-cohort (<italic>n</italic> = 15) had additional blood sampled 15 min after administration of the treatment (<italic>t</italic> = &#x02212;15) and 15 min post meal ingestion (<italic>t</italic> = 15; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-09-00861-f002">Figure 2</xref>). These time points were added after an interim examination of the blood pH data revealed that the predefined collection times (&#x02212;30 and +30 min) may miss a rapid effect on venous blood pH. Data collected at &#x02212;15 and 15 min were removed in the repeated measure ANOVA analyses, so that the tests were performed on the whole cohort (<italic>n</italic> = 30). One-sample <italic>t</italic>-test analyses were performed to assess the change in venous blood pH from baseline to 15 min (<italic>n</italic> = 15).

Discussion</title><p>This study reports that sodium bicarbonate treatment attenuates the post-meal decrease in pH observed with placebo in a cohort of non-diabetic individuals with normal renal function. Despite the attenuation in the pH decline achieved with sodium bicarbonate, no effect on postprandial glucose homeostasis was found. Interestingly, while it has previously been proposed that a high acid load diet decreased blood pH [<xref rid="B21-nutrients-09-00861" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], a search of the literature indicates that the present study is the first to demonstrate and quantify this phenomenon in the context of a meal tolerance test.</p><p>Postprandial insulin and <italic>C</italic>-peptide excursions were not different between the bicarbonate treatment and placebo, consistent with the overlapping curves observed for glucose excursions. Together, these findings indicate that there was no acute effect of the alkalizing treatment on insulin secretion. A non-significant increase in plasma GLP-1 excursion with the alkalizing treatment was identified. However, the GLP-1 rise did not elicit concomitant increases in insulin. Together with the trending effect of the alkalizing treatment on satiety, these findings may suggest slower gastric emptying with the treatment. However, this was not tested in the present study. The long term implications of postprandial circulating GLP-1 enhancement with bicarbonate and the mechanism(s) involved in this response require further investigation.</p><p>Several explanations to the lack of glycaemic effects with bicarbonate treatment observed here may be suggested. The first, and perhaps the best supported, would be that the pH change induced by the pre-prandial oral bicarbonate was not potent enough to elicit meaningful changes in glucose metabolism. This may be due to either the relatively low dose of bicarbonate employed or the potent buffering capacity of the body overcoming exogenous bicarbonate in healthy individuals. While more substantial venous blood pH increases have been documented with higher oral NaHCO<sub>3</sub> doses (0.3 g/kg body weight [<xref rid="B22-nutrients-09-00861" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], approximately 10-fold the dose administered here), such doses are associated with severe gastrointestinal side effects [<xref rid="B22-nutrients-09-00861" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-nutrients-09-00861" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], rendering any potential clinical application impractical. In any case, although the pH change induced in the present study is small, it closely reflects the degree of venous alkalization reported after a four-day adherence to low-PRAL (alkaline) diet [<xref rid="B24-nutrients-09-00861" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. </p><p>The alkaline diet is intended to remedy the excessive acid load of the Western diet, with many proposed health benefits. Advocates of the alkaline diet suggest that by increasing body pH (measured for example by increasing urine pH), individuals reduce their risk of conditions ranging from cancer to osteoporosis [<xref rid="B25-nutrients-09-00861" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Many of these claims have been challenged recently [<xref rid="B26-nutrients-09-00861" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-nutrients-09-00861" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], with most of the observed benefit of the alkaline diet possibly stemming from increased fruit and vegetable intake and the associated increase in dietary potassium-to-sodium ratio [<xref rid="B25-nutrients-09-00861" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. With regards to insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, some body of evidence suggests that adherence to an alkaline diet may be protective [<xref rid="B5-nutrients-09-00861" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-nutrients-09-00861" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B28-nutrients-09-00861" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The acute nature of the present study excludes the investigation of the long term effects of venous pH alkalization on whole body insulin resistance. However, our findings exclude an acute effect of body alkalization on glycaemia and insulin secretion, at least in healthy individuals. </p><p>Following a meal, arterial stiffness decreases as a component of the body&#x02019;s response to insulin, a drop that is attenuated in insulin resistance [<xref rid="B18-nutrients-09-00861" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In the present study, arterial stiffness tended to decrease after the bicarbonate treatment compared with placebo. Similarly, bicarbonate is known to decrease arterial stiffness when added to haemodialysis fluids [<xref rid="B29-nutrients-09-00861" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], however, the mechanism for this phenomenon has not been elucidated and requires further study. </p><p>The strengths of the present study are the robust randomized crossover placebo-controlled design and the direct measurements of blood pH and glucose metabolism in a high acid load meal context. However, the present study has some limitations. Firstly, this study did not target insulin-resistant individuals and, therefore, the findings can only be applicable to a relatively healthy population. While several studies have reported improvement in insulin sensitivity after correcting metabolic acidosis in chronic renal failure patients [<xref rid="B14-nutrients-09-00861" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-nutrients-09-00861" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], reparation of an abnormally low pH may be physiologically different to increasing pH within the physiological range in healthy individuals with respect to its impact on glucose metabolism. Additionally, this study only examined the acute effect of a relatively low dose bicarbonate supplementation on glucose metabolism. The effect on insulin resistance cannot be studied in the acute settings and, therefore, a chronic intervention is necessary to establish whether an alkalizing treatment will correct glucose metabolism in individuals with pre-diabetes. Furthermore, a low-acid load meal comparator was not tested, and finally, while increased venous blood pH was detected with the bicarbonate treatment, there was no detectable change in serum bicarbonate. While this was unexpected, it may be related to the sensitivity of the serum bicarbonate assay. </p><p>Importantly, the present study indicates that the beneficial glycaemic effects documented in populations adhering to low acid load diets are not likely to be explained by an acute effect on postprandial glycaemia. Further studies are required to elucidate the long term effects of buffering high acid load diets on type 2 diabetes risk and to shed light on the dynamics of body acid-base balance and glucose homeostasis.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank the study nurses Renee Richens and Jennifer Evans (Clinical Research Facility, Garvan Institute of Medical Research, Sydney, Australia) for their assistance in performing the studies.
