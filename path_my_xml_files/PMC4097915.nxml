Eligible students were randomly assigned to one of the two study groups. Treatment group assignments were made for the entire cohort at the same time, which allowed subjects to begin physical exercise (PE) versus yoga simultaneously.

The sequence of the yogic techniques practiced by the yoga group and the exercises performed by the PE group are summarized in Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref> respectively. The interventions were given for 3 months daily, except on Saturdays, Sundays and scheduled school holidays . In the yoga group, children were taught various yoga practices in a phased manner spread over 3 months. In the first month, the children were mainly taught stretching yogic exercises, which were easy to learn, and, in the second month, Surya namaskara was introduced, followed by various Asanas, Pranayama, and Dharana (concentration). The duration and components of yoga techniques were selected based on recommendations for 7-9 year-old school going children.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] The PE group did both passive stretching and aerobic exercises such as running, and the attendance in both the interventions was &#x0003e;90% across both groups.

All participants were recruited from a single school in Urban Bangalore, India. From a total of 200 participants who were a part of a larger interventional study on the effects of yoga practices on cognitive performance, 100 participants with even screening number were assessed for lung functions and pulmonary pressures. The school also provided written permission to conduct the study on its children on the school premises. The study was approved by the Institutional Ethical Review Board of St. John's National Academy of Health Sciences. Parents of all children aged 7-9 years were invited for a meeting, and the study procedures were explained. Consent form, drafted as per the policy guidelines of the Indian Council of Medical Research, was read out to parents because majority of them were illiterate, and their responses were entered by trained research assistants. The targeted enrollment was 25 subjects rounded off to 50 in each arm with an estimated 90% and 1% level of significance.

Since most studies are conducted on the adolescent and adult population, the effect of yoga in children is unknown. Our interest lies in the less explored age group of middle childhood (7-9 years) and also to quantify the sustained effect of yoga.</p><p>Respiratory function depends on several factors, including chest expansion, lung dimensions, respiratory muscle strength, air way resistance and alveolar surface area. Pranayama, one of the limbs of Asthanga yoga, is known to have profound effect on the pulmonary function than any other part of the human system. Pranayama consists of different kinds of breathing patterns such as alternate nostril breathing, Mukha bhasthrika pranayama, and Bhrahmari pranayama. Pranayama is essentially a breathing exercise against resistance, and its positive effects on lung functions is well documented.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</p><p>The FVC is an index of the volume of the respiratory apparatus, whereas the FEV1 is a reflection of the expiratory flow resistive properties. PEFR is the rate of air flow during expiration, measured in litres per minute. Yogasanas and pranayama exercises are performed by consciously altering the respiration. Studies have shown that breathing exercises open the small airways in the lungs and reduces the airway resistance.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Studies have revealed that even short-term (2 weeks) yoga training is sufficient to improve the lung function.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] In the present study, although significant increase was observed in FVC, FEV1, and PEFR in 7-9-year-old children in both the groups at the end of 3 months training, there was no significant difference between the yoga and the PE group post-intervention, expect for MIP.</p><p>In a study conducted on adolescents, 84 subjects were randomly allocated to 4 groups: Yoga and pranayama group, fast Suryanamaskara group, slow Suryanamaskara group, and sedentary control group, and each group was trained for 6 months in their respective regime. Significant improvement was observed in FVC, FEV1, and PEFR in the trained groups as compared to that in the control group, who studied in a classroom.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>In another study, significant improvement was observed in 20 hypothyroid patients (approximately aged 39 years) after 6 months of yoga and pranayama training. The author has mentioned that the hypothyroid patients had lower values of the pulmonary test when compared to the healthy control. Although the patients were on thyroxine supplements for 2 years, the improvement in the pulmonary parameters showed a significant improvement after 6 months of yoga training and attributes this change in the FEV1, PEFR, and the inspiratory capacity to the improved respiratory muscle strength.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</p><p>In another study, Godoy <italic>et al.</italic>, conducted a comparative study on the effect of aerobic exercise and yoga on FVC, FEV1, and MIP. Adults between the age of 18-40 years were recruited and trained in aerobic exercise and yoga separately for 1-2 times a week for 3 months. No significant improvement was observed in FVC and FEV1. Although the improvement in MIP was statistically insignificant, the absolute delta value of MIP was more pronounced in the yoga group than in the aerobic exercise group (yoga = 18.6% versus aerobic = 2.8% in males; yoga = 20.8% versus aerobic = 4.1% in females).[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] The present study observed a significant increase in MIP than in the PE group.</p><p>In a cross-sectional study, pulmonary function was compared among professional yogis, athletes, and sedentary people. Yogis-subjects who practiced yoga for at least 1 h everyday for 6 months, Athletes-marathon runners running at least 2 km everyday for 6 months, and sedentary subjects-who did not participate in physical activity at least 2-3 times week for 6 months. FVC and FEV1 values were similar in both yogis and athletes compared to the sedentary group and the highest PEFR was observed in yogis as compared to the other two groups. The author presumes that the improvement in the PEFR is due to the toned respiratory muscle. The forceful inhalation until total lung capacity (TLC) and forceful expiration until residual volume, both performed through the nostrils, offering resistance during the maneuvers, strengthens the respiratory muscles. The effect of resistance exercise on skeletal muscles is well known.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>In all of the above mentioned studies, the control group was sedentary,[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] except for[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] where the yoga group was compared with athletes apart from the sedentary group. All three groups significantly differed in FEV1 and PEFR, and yogis performed the highest in these parameters. The present study is inconsistent with the above-mentioned studies and suggests that yoga is at par with PE in improving the pulmonary functions.</p><p>Maximum respiratory pressures are simple, non-invasive, and accurate indices of respiratory muscle strength, which is important for the maintenance of the respiratory mechanics[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and can be easily measured and evaluated, as any change in the values are evident before any alterations in other commonly measured pulmonary function tests.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Thus, evaluation of pulmonary pressures becomes important physiologically and clinically. Respiratory pressures obtained in patients or healthy subjects are the combined result of the tension (force) generated by the muscle, which is dependent on the lung volume at which the maneuver is obtained and the chest wall and lung mechanics;[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] thus, this parameter should not be considered to be a measure of respiratory muscle strength only.</p><p>Studies conducted by Madanmohan <italic>et al.</italic>, suggests that 6 months of yoga training has favourable effect on the respiratory muscle strength in adolescent subject.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Our findings are consistent with the above study in that 3 months of yoga can improve the respiratory muscle strength in pre-pubertal children. Improved muscle strength helps increasing the lung dimension and chest expansion,[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] improving the breathing capacity.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Studies have shown that the effect of training significantly decreases by 4 weeks of detraining and that the rate of detraining is independent of the duration of the training, although the improvement observed does not regress to the baseline values.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] Our study, which is one of its kind, observed the detraining effect of yoga and PE after 3 months of the cessation of the training. In contrast to the previous studies, our present study presents a different picture. The effects of training did not fade off even after 3 months of detraining. In fact, the FVC and FEV1 continued to increase significantly (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c;0.005) in both the groups. After 3 months of detraining, a trend of decrease was observed in PEFR, MIP, and MEP. However, the improvement observed did not regress to the baseline value, which is in accordance with the results reported in other studies.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] Literature suggests that physical inactivity in humans can cause decrease in muscle mass within 4 weeks.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] However, this is not applicable to respiratory muscles as they cannot remain inactive. In addition, middle childhood is an active phase of life, where children tend to be independent and physically active, which may tend to promote respiratory muscle strength. This could explain the continued beneficial effect on the pulmonary function test after the cessation of the intervention.</p><p>Metabolic investigations in yoga practitioners suggest that performing yoga is equivalent to physical exercise of low aerobic intensity.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] In light of our observations, we can conclude that atleast 3 months of yoga training is as effective as the PE to bring changes in the pulmonary functions and pulmonary pressures in the pediatric group and the beneficial effect continues even after the cessation of training.</p><sec id="sec2-9"><title>Strength and limitations of the study</title><p>The study was conducted on a middle childhood group (7-9 years), which is sparsely explored. Although the immediate effect of 3 months of yoga training is known, the detraining effect of yoga has been mostly unknown. Thus, our study contributed to the pool of knowledge, the minimum duration of yoga training required to show a significant improvement in the respiratory muscle strength, and respiratory functions as well as the detraining effect of yoga. Further validation is required in this arena with a true control group, which was lacking in our study.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-10"><title>Contributors</title><p>STA and CD conceived and designed the study and revised the manuscript for important intellectual content.
