Evidence is lacking about how information on overdetection affects women's breast screening decisions and experiences. This study investigates the consequences of providing information about overdetection of breast cancer to women approaching the age of invitation to mammography screening.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>This is a randomised controlled trial with an embedded longitudinal qualitative substudy. Participants are a community sample of women aged 48&#x02013;50 in New South Wales, Australia, recruited in 2014. Women are randomly allocated to either quantitative only follow-up (n=904) or additional qualitative follow-up (n=66). Women in each stream are then randomised to receive either the intervention (evidence-based information booklet including overdetection, breast cancer mortality reduction and false positives) or a control information booklet (including mortality reduction and false positives only). The primary outcome is informed choice about breast screening (adequate knowledge, and consistency between attitudes and intentions) assessed via telephone interview at 2&#x02005;weeks postintervention. Secondary outcomes measured at this time include decision process (decisional conflict and confidence) and psychosocial outcomes (anticipated regret, anxiety, breast cancer worry and perceived risk). Women are further followed up at 6&#x02005;months, 1 and 2&#x02005;years to assess self-reported screening behaviour and long-term psychosocial outcomes (decision regret, quality of life). Participants in the qualitative stream undergo additional in-depth interviews at each time point to explore the views and experiences of women who do and do not choose to have screening.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>The study has ethical approval, and results will be published in peer-reviewed journals.

This occurs when screening detects a cancer that would not have presented clinically during the woman's lifetime, meaning she would never have acquired a diagnosis had she not attended screening. Overdetection and the resulting overtreatment are likely to cause harm in terms of emotional well-being,<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> physical health in the short term and long term<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> and implications for relatives consequently classified as high risk.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p><p>The problems of overdiagnosis and overtreatment in cancer screening<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> and the broader health context<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> are receiving increasing attention. In the UK, an independent expert panel was commissioned in 2011 to review evidence on important consequences of breast screening, including the challenging task of quantifying the level of overdetection. Wide variations among previous estimates had prompted extensive debate over the appropriateness of different observational methods and their associated biases.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7&#x02013;9</xref> Focusing on randomised trials as the best quality evidence, the panel concluded that invitation to screening leads to overdetection of breast cancer at a rate of 19% during the 20-year screening period.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p><p>Historically, information materials distributed by breast screening programmes worldwide have emphasised benefits and lacked explanation of overdetection.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11&#x02013;14</xref> The appropriateness of explicitly informing people about overdetection has been debated, with reluctance driven by concerns about dissuading women from screening.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> However, in the context of a growing international movement towards policies promoting greater involvement of patients and citizens in health decision-making<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17&#x02013;20</xref> it has been argued that people offered screening should have the opportunity to make informed decisions about whether to participate.</p><p>Making an informed decision about screening requires clear, balanced information on benefits and harms.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20&#x02013;23</xref> A new approach to public information was recently adopted in the UK with the aim of better supporting informed choice,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> and the new UK breast screening leaflet released in September 2013 acknowledges overdetection as &#x02018;the main risk of screening&#x02019;.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Given the current lack of awareness of overdetection,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26&#x02013;30</xref> such a change to public information is significant and there is a need for high-quality research into its effects. Breast screening is a highly emotive issue, as demonstrated by the public outrage unleashed when the US Preventive Services Task Force changed its recommendations in 2009.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31&#x02013;33</xref> Moves to include overdetection in screening information materials stand to affect large numbers of women around the world. Research is needed to ensure important messages are not misconstrued in ways that adversely affect women's health and well-being.</p><p>There is little research on public responses to overdetection. In a focus group study,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> we examined 50 women's understanding of overdiagnosis, screening attitudes and intentions and views on information provision. Participants were previously unaware of overdetection but able to understand it. Although surprised, women valued the information about overdetection. These findings were corroborated by a similar UK study.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> As some women in our study indicated that knowing about overdetection may change their screening or treatment decisions,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> a careful and balanced approach to communication is critical.</p><p>The current population-based trial extends our investigation of the impact of overdetection information into a real-life decision-making setting. Using a longitudinal, randomised design incorporating quantitative and qualitative methods, the trial examines the impact of written information about screening outcomes (breast cancer deaths averted and false positives, either including or excluding overdetection) among women close to the target age for entering Australia's screening programme. In addition to examining how the information affects women's decisions, attitudes, psychological responses and well-being in the short term, we will follow participants for 2&#x02005;years to assess effects on screening participation and to qualitatively investigate the long-term impact of this information in women who do and do not choose to be screened.</p><sec id="s1a"><title>Aims</title><p>We will examine and evaluate the impact of information about overdetection in breast screening on:

This design ensures we can (1) quantify the impact of overdetection information on women's immediate screening decision-making and (2) assess behaviour and psychosocial outcomes throughout the 2-year follow-up period, allowing us to contextualise experiences and capture changes over time among women who ultimately choose to screen or not screen.</p><fig id="BMJOPEN2014004990F1" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Design of randomised controlled trial with longitudinal qualitative substudy.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen2014004990f01"/></fig><p>Since it is plausible that the qualitative interviews could influence responses to the quantitative measures (even by simply reminding women of breast screening), we have separated the cohorts entirely so that our quantitative dataset will not include any women who are part of the qualitative component of the research. Both streams will follow the same procedure including all quantitative measures completed via telephone, but women in the qualitative stream will be invited for additional interviews at the time points specified.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Setting and participants</title><p>Study participants will be a community sample of women aged 48&#x02013;50&#x02005;years from the Australian state of New South Wales (NSW). The government-funded programme, BreastScreen NSW, offers a free biennial screening service and mails a personal invitation to all women when they turn 50 and enter the target age range. The study will therefore involve women who are approaching or at this decision point. This study focuses on women facing an initial decision about whether to screen, as our qualitative study found that women's perceptions of overdetection were influenced by their previous screening participation.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Eligibility criteria</title><sec id="s2c1"><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p>Individuals will be eligible if they are women; aged 48&#x02013;50&#x02005;years; residing in NSW and sufficiently fluent in English<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> to understand study materials and complete telephone interviews.</p></sec><sec id="s2c2"><title>Exclusion criteria</title><p>Individuals will be excluded from the trial if they have a personal history of breast cancer; have had any mammogram within the previous 2&#x02005;years or are at increased risk of breast cancer compared with the general population, for example due to a strong family history.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> Women at increased risk will be referred to their doctor or the Australian Cancer Council's telephone helpline.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Pilot study</title><p>Before the main trial, a pilot study will be carried out with approximately 30 women to test the recruitment and data collection procedures up to the 2-week telephone survey, including checking the suitability of the telephone interview scripts.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Participant recruitment</title><p>We will recruit by sampling from a random extract of women in the appropriate age group, drawn from the NSW electoral register.

Trained HVRF interviewers will telephone potential respondents and explain how and why their contact details were obtained. Interviewers will then briefly introduce the study and determine eligibility using a series of simple questions. Eligible women will be informed about what the main study involves and invited to participate. The trial's aims will be described in a general way, as &#x02018;a study to make sure that written information about breast cancer screening is clear and helpful to women&#x02019;, without specifically referring to overdetection. Consent will be obtained orally and documented by the interviewer.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Preintervention procedure and measures</title><p>To achieve a common baseline level of information about screening, immediately after recruitment to the study all women will be sent the BreastScreen NSW programme leaflet, a freely available leaflet that BreastScreen sends to women together with their invitations to attend screening.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> As well as outlining practical aspects of mammography screening, the leaflet describes benefits of early detection while acknowledging the possibility of a false negative (ie, missed cancer) or false positive result (ie, abnormal mammogram when there is no cancer). It does not provide quantitative estimates of the chances of these outcomes, nor does it mention overdetection.</p><p>After 1&#x02005;week HVRF will telephone each participant again, collect demographic information not already recorded, and check that the woman has received the leaflet and had time to read it. If so, the interviewer will collect the following baseline data and then proceed to randomisation:</p><sec id="s2f1"><title>Stage of decision-making</title><p>Women will be asked how far along they are with their decision about screening, using a single item with four response options, as used in previous trials of screening decision aids.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>

The purpose of only including women who have demonstrated a willingness to read study materials is to maximise the likelihood that the individuals randomised will read their allocated intervention and complete the trial, which is designed to detect any intervention effect under ideal circumstances.

<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> Informed choice is assessed by combining measures of knowledge, attitudes and actual choice,<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> and has been used successfully in previous decision aid studies.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>
<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>
<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> Selection of this primary outcome reflects recent international commitments to informed choice as a key marker of quality in screening programmes.</p><p>Informed choice will be assessed at 2&#x02005;weeks postintervention as a dichotomous outcome, and the intervention and control groups will be compared in terms of the proportion of women making an informed choice. To determine whether each woman makes an informed choice we will separately measure, and then combine, three components: knowledge, attitudes and intentions. An informed choice is one in which knowledge is adequate, with attitudes and intentions being consistent (ie, positive attitudes with positive intentions or negative attitudes with negative intentions). For the purposes of assessing informed choice, the knowledge, attitude and intention measures will be dichotomised using an a priori threshold (see below). The three component variables will also be examined and reported separately to enable more fine-grained understanding of the impact of the intervention on decision-making.</p><sec id="s3b1a"><title>Screening knowledge</title><p>We will apply a competency-based approach to assess knowledge<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> in line with our published knowledge assessment framework.<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref> Understanding of conceptual and numerical information provided in the study will be measured using items adapted from our previous decision aid trials.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>

<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> knowledge will be scored using a marking scheme developed a priori. The threshold score to be considered adequate for the purposes of determining informed choice will also be set a priori.

We judge an absolute difference of 10&#x02013;15% to be relevant. Assuming conservatively that one of the group proportions is 50%, in order to achieve 80% power to detect a group difference of 10% with a two-sided significance level of 5%, we require 407 women per arm at the 2-week follow-up. This sample size is sufficient to detect a 10&#x02013;15% difference in intentions and a mean difference smaller than 0.5 SDs in knowledge, attitudes and psychosocial outcomes (assuming SDs for these scales based on results from our previous trials) which is considered the minimum clinically important difference for psychosocial outcomes.<xref rid="R65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref></p><p>On the basis of our previous research using a similar protocol<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> and data from HVRF, we anticipate losing 10% of recruited women at the preintervention stage because they do not read initial study materials within the required time frame, and up to a further 10% who cannot be contacted for the 2-week follow-up survey. Therefore to achieve our 2-week follow-up target sample of 814 women in the quantitative stream and 60 in the qualitative stream (see below) we aim to recruit approximately 1078 women into the study.</p><p>On the basis of their extensive telephone survey experience, HVRF have estimated a further 20% loss to follow-up at 1&#x02005;year and an additional 10% at 2&#x02005;years (total loss to follow-up at 2&#x02005;years is 30%). The remaining sample should be sufficient to detect a difference of 12% in attendance at 2&#x02005;years among 285 women per arm (assuming a 30% attrition rate and 47% attendance rate at mammography screening).<xref rid="R66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref></p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Statistical analysis methods</title><p>Analysis will compare the intervention and control groups on an intention to treat basis (ie, all participants, as randomised) and will be carried out blinded to intervention status. We will use the &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test to analyse binary outcomes including informed choice, and the two-sample t test for continuous outcomes, with a significance level of 5%. We will use multiple imputation and sensitivity analyses to explore the impact of missing data.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Stream B: qualitative study</title><p>We will conduct a longitudinal qualitative evaluation among women randomised to stream B of the trial to explore in depth their responses to information about overdetection&#x02014;specifically, how they understand the information and integrate it with existing knowledge, and their subsequent intentions and decisions whether to participate in screening. Women will receive an identical protocol to those in the main trial (stream A), including quantitative telephone survey measures. However, we will also carry out face-to-face or telephone interviews among these women over 2&#x02005;years at time points corresponding with the assessment of self-reported screening behaviour in the main randomised controlled trial (6&#x02005;months, 1 and 2&#x02005;years). This will enable us to examine the experience of screening among women who choose to screen with and without exposure to overdetection information (ie, intervention and control groups), to assess whether the information has any positive or negative impact on women's screening experience (eg, the way in which women interpret, cope with and act on their screening results). This will allow a rich and contextualised understanding of women's experiences and decision-making to complement the quantitative data, and will also enable us to examine the experience of women who choose not to screen, including changes in their feelings over time and following the receipt of screening invitations. Based on current participation in BreastScreen we expect between 25% and 50% of the women will choose not to be screened, giving us a meaningful sample of women choosing to screen and not to screen within the qualitative stream.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Methods of data collection</title><p>All women will be interviewed either face to face or by telephone, 1&#x02013;2&#x02005;months postintervention, by an experienced qualitative interviewer.
