Cost-effective interventions aimed at preventing the development of preeclampsia are urgently needed. However, the pathogenesis of PE is not well known. Multiple mechanisms such as oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction and insulin resistance may contribute to its development. Regular aerobic exercise recovers endothelial function; improves insulin resistance and decreases oxidative stress. Therefore the purpose of this clinical trial is to determine the effect of regular aerobic exercise on endothelial function, on insulin resistance and on pregnancy outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and design</title><p>64 pregnant women will be included in a blind, randomized clinical trial, and parallel assignment.

The problem is especially important in developing countries, where maternal mortality ratio is up to twenty fold higher than in developed countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. In Colombia the high incidence of preeclampsia (5.1%), low birth weight (LBW; 13.2%), intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR; 7.9%) and perinatal mortality (3.68 per 1000 live births) is considered a serious public health problem that needs to be solved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Multiple conditions such as maternal age, nulliparity, previous personal and family history of PE, poor nutrition, sedentary life styles, residence at high altitudes, and lack of adequate prenatal care have been associated with an increased risk for PE. Multiple mechanisms as oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction, and insulin resistance, have been proposed to explain the pathogenesis of the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Changes in the production and in the action of nitric oxide (NO) have been proposed as the key cause of endothelial dysfunction in preeclampsia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Moreover, an increased oxidative stress has been proposed as the main responsible factor for the changes in the vascular reactivity observed during PE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. I It was originally proposed that the increased concentration and reactivity to vasoconstrictors observed in PE might be due to a reduction of vasodilator prostaglandins, that results in an imbalance between prostacyclin (PGI<sub>2</sub>) and thromboxane A<sub>2 </sub>(TXA<sub>2</sub>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. However, this imbalance in prostaglandins has not been found in early pregnancy in women who subsequently developed PE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>Epidemiological evidence suggests that women who participate in programs of regular physical activity have a reduced risk of developing PE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Several studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] have found beneficial effects of maternal physical activity during pregnancy on the delivery, the foetal growth and preterm delivery. Recently, Dempsey et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] reported that physically active pregnant women experienced a 40-70% reduced risk of gestational diabetes as compared with sedentary women. Other investigations have reported that recreational physical activity during pregnancy is associated with a reduced risk of PE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>Endothelial-dependent vasodilator function can be examined non-invasively in humans by measuring brachial artery mediated dilatation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and it has been demonstrated that exercise improves flow mediated dilatation (FMD). In normal pregnancy, flow mediated dilatation increases throughout pregnancy[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] but the effect of exercise on FMD has not been evaluated in pregnant women.</p><sec><title>Rationale of the study</title><p>Evidence supports an inverse association between physical fitness and several risk factors for PE, including glucose intolerance, hypercholesterolemia, high blood pressure, obesity, and markers of systemic inflammation like C-Reactive Protein (CRP). Furthermore, physical fitness may protect against PE by intervening at three key stages of its pathogenesis: 1) Protection against abnormal placental development, 222 2) Reduction of oxidative stress, and 3) Reversal of endothelial dysfunction (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). To date, only few studies have evaluated the effects of habitual physical activity on endothelial function, and results have been controversial. In addition, no studies assessing the influence of regular aerobic exercise on endothelium-dependent brachial artery flow-mediated dilatation in pregnant women have been published. The present study will be conducted in hope of filling this gap.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Expected benefits of exercise during pregnancy</bold>.

Randomization will be performed using a variable blocking desing with a permuted block of maximum 8 subjects. Exercise will start only when each block is completed; because it consists of supervised sessions in groups of 3 to 5 women. Randomization will be administrated only by the coordinator of study, who is not involved in the intervention or in the measuring of clinical parameters. Given the nature of the interventions, it is not possible to blind the participating individuals. Instead, a research assistant at each site will control all the primary and secondary outcome assessments in order to blind to treatment assigned. While no specific qualifications or experience are required of the research assistants, training will be provided prior to the initiation of the trial about protocol and measurement procedures and methods used to maintain the blind. These procedures are also detailed in the study operations manual. Moreover, the importance of maintaining the blinding and allocation concealment will be reinforced by regularly scheduled conference calls at the sites and daily meetings with the camp investigators.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], using the guidelines reported by Corretti et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. The diameter of the brachial artery will be assessed using a high-resolution ultrasound device (Siemens SG-60, USA), equipped with a 7.5 MHz linear array transducer and an integrated electrocardiography package. The ultrasound procedures will be performed with the subject resting quietly in supine position for at least 10 minutesAll measurements will be taken at end-diastole triggered by electrocardiogram. First, the diameter of the right brachial artery will be searched in a cross-sectional view and then scanned over a longitudinal section 5 to 10 cm proximal to the right elbow. The diameter of the brachial artery will be measured from the anterior to the posterior intima/lumen interface at a fixed distance. The mean diameter will be calculated from 4 cardiac cycles. After that, a pneumatic tourniquet placed around the right forearm will be rapidly inflated to at least 50 mm Hg above the systolic blood pressure for 5 minutesA sudden release of the cuff will induce an increase in blood flow in the brachial artery located proximal to the tourniquet. During reactive hyperemia, there will be an increase in shear stress, causing endothelium-dependent vasodilatation, mainly due to endothelial release of nitric oxide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. This secondary dilation enhances and prolongs the reactive hyperaemic phase. FMD of the brachial artery will be measured 45-60 s after cuff release. The change in diameter caused by the increased flow will be calculated as the percentage change relative to the baseline measurement (FMD%). The dilator brachial artery response due to shear stress has been shown to have a good accuracy and reproducibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].
