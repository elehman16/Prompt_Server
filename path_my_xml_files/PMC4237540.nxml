We compared once-daily IDeg and insulin glargine (IGlar), both in combination with metformin&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, in a 52-week, open-label, treat-to-target trial in patients with type 2 diabetes followed by a 52-week extension trial in which subjects [n&#x02009;=&#x02009;725/1030 (70.4%)] maintained their initial randomised treatment. Health status was assessed at baseline and 105&#x02009;weeks using the Short Form-36 (SF-36 v2) questionnaire. SF-36 scores were analysed (ITT population) using <sc>anova</sc>, with adjustments for covariates.

Thus, reducing hypoglycaemia and providing a more predictable treatment regimen might be expected to improve HRQoL. Insulin degludec (IDeg) is a new basal insulin that offers advantages over previous basal insulins. IDeg forms soluble multi-hexamers upon subcutaneous injection, achieving a stable time&#x02013;action profile, an ultra-long duration of action lasting beyond 42&#x02009;h, and low within-patient variability <xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>. Seven randomised, open-label, controlled, phase 3 trials of 26- or 52-weeks&#x02018; duration using a treat-to-target non-inferiority design, all confirmed similar glycaemic control for IDeg compared to insulin glargine (IGlar) as expected in treat-to-target trials. However, individual trials, as well as a prospectively planned meta-analysis, showed advantages for IDeg over IGlar with respect to hypoglycaemia <xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>. HRQoL, another important treatment outcome, was measured in all of these trials using the SF-36 v2 questionnaire <xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> and additional meta-analyses have shown that HRQoL <xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, health utility <xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> and mental health <xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> are improved with IDeg compared to IGlar.</p><p>The analysis presented here includes previously unreported data from insulin-na&#x000ef;ve patients with type 2 diabetes who were studied for a total of 2&#x02009;years in a 52-week trial with a 52-week extension; this was the largest of the phase 3 trials in the IDeg clinical development programme <xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>. As previously reported <xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, at 105&#x02009;weeks, HbA1c was similar for IDeg and IGlar (estimated treatment difference [ETD] 0.12%-points [&#x02212;0.01 to 0.25]<sub>95% CI</sub>, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.078). Observed mean reductions in laboratory-measured fasting plasma glucose (FPG) were greater with IDeg (ETD &#x02212;0.38 mmol/l [&#x02212;0.70 to &#x02212;0.06]<sub>95% CI</sub>, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.019). Importantly, these improvements in glycaemic control were accompanied by a lower risk of hypoglycaemia over the entire treatment period. Nocturnal confirmed hypoglycaemia was 43% lower with IDeg than with IGlar (estimated rate ratio [ERR], IDeg/IGlar: 0.57 [0.40; 0.81]<sub>95%CI</sub>, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.002) and rate of severe hypoglycaemia was 69% lower with IDeg (ERR 0.31 [0.11; 0.85]<sub>95%CI</sub>, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.023). Overall confirmed hypoglycaemia (plasma glucose&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;3.1 mmol/l or severe) was similar between IDeg and IGlar; estimated rate ratio (IDeg/IGlar): ERR 0.84 [0.68; 1.04]<sub>95%CI</sub>, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.115 <xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>.</p><p>Given that the clinical benefit of reduced hypoglycaemia occurred in conjunction with improved glucose control after 2&#x02009;years of treatment, improvements in HRQoL might also be expected. In the original 52-week trial, participants treated with IDeg showed improvements in clinical measures and reported greater improvements in &#x02018;overall physical&#x02019; and &#x02018;physical functioning&#x02019; Short Form 36 (SF-36) scores compared with IGlar <xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>.</p><p>The aim of this subanalysis at 105&#x02009;weeks was to compare IDeg versus IGlar with respect to change in health status from baseline (initiation of basal insulin therapy) in patients with type 2 diabetes, using the SF-36 v2 questionnaire.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Subjects provided informed consent and re-started treatment with IDeg or IGlar at the same dose levels at end-of-treatment in the main trial <xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> with optional adjustment at the discretion of the investigator. At the end of the core trial, patients were transferred to neutral protamine Hagedorn insulin for 7&#x02009;days to allow for insulin antibody evaluation. The insulin dose at the end of the core trial was used as a starting point, and was titrated to a target FPG of 3.9&#x02013;4.9&#x02009;mmol/l based upon the mean pre-breakfast self-measured blood glucose for the preceding 2&#x02013;3 consecutive days.</p><p>All assessments for efficacy and safety in this extension trial were as described for the core trial <xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>. Health status was measured at baseline (time of randomisation of the core trial), at 52&#x02009;weeks, and at 105&#x02009;weeks using the SF-36 v2 questionnaire. The SF-36 scale is a validated multi-purpose questionnaire that has raw, norm-based scores with a mean (standard deviation) of 50 (10). The SF-36 questions are grouped into eight domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1</xref>), including a physical component summary (PCS) score and a mental component summary score. The scales are compressed compared to the raw scores. The questionnaire was translated and linguistically validated in all languages relevant to the study. Patients were provided with instructions and given privacy to complete the questionnaires, which were sealed in envelopes and not reviewed by local investigators or study nurses.</p><fig id="fig01" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Overview of the Short Form 36 (SF-36 v2) questionnaire.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="dom0016-0869-f1"/></fig><p>Scores from the intent-to-treat population were analysed using <sc>anova</sc>, with treatment, therapy at screening, sex and region as fixed factors, and age and relevant baseline values as covariates.

In addition to sustaining the significant difference in PCS and physical functioning, the bodily pain domain also was significantly in favour of IDeg after 2&#x02009;years. These results are consistent with meta-analysis results of previous studies of IDeg reporting improvements in SF-36 scores <xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> and improvements in health utility versus IGlar <xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>. Similarly, earlier studies have reported improvements in various patient-reported outcomes when IGlar was compared against oral therapy or other basal insulins <xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>.</p><p>With respect to the clinical implications of these results, in diabetes, it has been estimated that a 1-point difference on PCS and physical functioning scores, for example, is associated with a 5&#x02013;9% increase in mortality risk, a 2&#x02013;4% increased risk of hospitalisation within 6&#x02009;months and a 7&#x02013;12% increased risk of being unable to work <xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>. Although the SF-36 does not have an established minimal important difference in diabetes, the SF-36 v2 user manual suggests that even small differences in these compressed scores (&#x0003c;1) are relevant in other chronic diseases. For example, having an allergy reduces the SF-36 scores by 0.1&#x02013;0.8 points <xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>.</p><p>The precise reason for the improvement in SF-36 scores has not been determined. However, as mentioned earlier, IDeg has been shown to have a beneficial effect on hypoglycaemia compared to IGlar <xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>. Hypoglycaemic events, both non-severe and severe, are known to be a key marker for reduced HRQoL in diabetes <xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>. Also, the SF-36 physical functioning score includes measures of vigorous activity, which may be enhanced if hypoglycaemia is less of a concern. Given that clinical trials exclude people at high risk of hypoglycaemia, the benefit may be even greater in real-world settings.</p><p>Although an open-label design could have affected results of this study, the baseline values for SF-36 were collected prior to randomisation, and the long duration of the main trial plus extension study should have allowed any bias associated with initiation of a particular therapy to be minimised. This study emphasises that patient-reported outcomes, which are an important measure of any diabetes treatment, can be improved with IDeg.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The study was sponsored by Novo Nordisk A/S.
