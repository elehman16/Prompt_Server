Yoga means union, as it harmonizes the body, breath, mind and spirit. It is a means of balancing and harmonizing the body, mind and emotion, and for enlightening the mind and upliftment of the total personality. The Yoga sessions involve the practice of floor, sitting, and standing postures, inversions (headstand, shoulder stand), breathing exercises (<italic>pranayama</italic>), and meditation. Specific <italic>asanas</italic> work on the various systems of the body, bringing alertness to mind, while soothing nervous system and glands, relaxing brain, and maintaining a physical, physiological, and emotional balance, and thus teach the brain, and body to work in harmony. Since, Yoga has a holistic approach encompassing body, mind and soul and therefore the Yoga is a combination of physiotherapy, psychotherapy, and spiritual therapy.</p><p>There is a large body of literature and scientific data regarding the pharmacological and psychosocial interventions and the rehabilitation of patients with schizophrenia. The efficacy of Yoga has not been much examined in schizophrenia. However, several features of Yoga make it an attractive option for improving psychopathology in schizophrenia. Yogic practices, though started to create discipline in an individual's holistic life, gradually experimented whether it could help to improve mental health of the patients suffering from various disorders starting from anxiety related disorders, to psychosomatic, to neurological disorders and presently reaching to major mental disorders like schizophrenia, and proved its efficacy.</p><p>Vahia[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] reported a study of patients comprising of anxiety neurotics, neurotic depression, conversion reaction, mixed neurosis and psychosomatic disorder and observed significant improvement, and further studies also well established its efficacy in various anxiety disorders like obsessive-compulsive disorder;[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] on anxiety, depression, and tension.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Yoga has proved its efficacy in treating patients suffering from mild to moderate level of depression,[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and is associated with improved mood, and may be a useful way of reducing stress during inpatient psychiatric treatment.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>Yogic practice, including physical postures, Yoga breathing, and meditation and guided relaxation improved delayed recall of spatial information in children.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Sharma <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] demonstrated that the yogic practice could improve executive functions such as manipulation of information in the verbal working memory, attention span and the visuo-motor speed of the depressives in patients suffering from major depression. The practice of Yoga regulates body physiology through control of posture, breathing, and meditation. Yoga could bring a significant reduction in scores on anxiety, depression and tension as well as an increase in well-being as found in Yoga group.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Duraiswamy <italic>et al</italic>., and Mukherjee <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] demonstrated that the yogic practice, in conjunction with conventional medical treatment, may improve schizophrenic symptoms, social and occupational functioning, quality of life, discipline, and adaptive functioning among schizophrenia patients. However, their assessment on psychopathology was restricted on limited parameters. Duraiswamy <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] used total scores of Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) for analyzing the effects of interventions, and also their participants were not evaluated with General Psychopathology Scale of PANSS. Similarly, Mukherjee <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] evaluated the efficacy of Yoga therapy by using Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS).</p><p>A study conducted by Visceglia and Lewis,[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] investigated the effects of a Yoga therapy program on symptomatology and quality of life in adults with schizophrenia. After the 8-weeks Yoga therapy program significant improvement were found in positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia, general psychopathology, activation, paranoia, depression, and in perceived quality of life in physical and psychological domains. Another study conducted by Behere <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] demonstrated that Yoga therapy could be a useful add-on treatment to improve facial emotion recognition deficits, psychopathology and socio-occupational functioning in antipsychotic-stabilized patients with schizophrenia. Recently Varambally <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] studied the efficacy of Yoga as an add-on treatment in outpatients with schizophrenia and their findings also suggested a significant improvement in PANSS and total PANSS scores as well as in the social functioning. The present study was conducted to determine the efficacy of Yoga therapy (package used by Mukherjee <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]) on reduction of psychopathology of patients with schizophrenia.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Aims of the study</title><p>The objective of the present study is to determine the efficacy of Yoga therapy as an adjunctive therapy for the management of psychopathology of patients having chronic schizophrenia.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Hypothesis of the study</title><p>There will be no significant difference in the baseline assessment and follow-up assessment of psychopathology between schizophrenia patients getting Yoga therapy along with medications and those getting only medications.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Design</title><p>Pre- and post-test control group design was used for the study.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Patients were assigned to Yoga therapy using block randomization, and same numbers of patients were also kept for the control group.

After 2 weeks of admission in the hospital, based on purposive sampling technique,[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] patients were screened from different wards of the institute and a total of 30 patients, who fulfilled inclusion and exclusion criteria were included in the study. All patients were having chronic schizophrenia and were not on regular medication before the admission in the hospital. The patients were on risperidone, and olanzapine, and the dozes were regulated according to the requirements of the patients. Only male schizophrenia patients in the age range of 20&#x02013;50 years with minimum 2 years duration of illness, who had mild to moderate level of symptoms, were included in the study. Patients with a history of substance dependence, mental retardation, organic mental disorder, head injury and other neurological disorders were excluded. One patient from each group dropped out. Demographic statistics were summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>. Both groups were comparable on age, sex, marital status, education, occupation, domicile, religion and family income variables.

PANSS is a 30-item rating scale designed to assess presence and absence, and severity of positive, negative and general psychopathology of schizophrenia patients. The scale was developed from the content of BPRS and the Psychopathology Rating Scale. All 30 items are rated on a 7 point scale (1 = absent, 2 = minimal, 3 = mild, 4 = moderate, 5 = moderate-severe, 6 = severe, and 7 = extreme).

Findings of present research study reveal that along with pharmacotherapy Yoga therapy is helpful in managing positive symptom such as delusions, and negative symptoms such as blunted affect, emotional withdrawal, passive social withdrawal and difficulty in abstract thinking. Present research findings are similar to that of Duraiswamy <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and they have also documented the effectiveness of Yoga therapy in schizophrenia patients. They compared Yoga therapy group with physical training group, and found that schizophrenia patients who were on Yoga therapy improved more than those with physical training group. They have reported that along with pharmacotherapy Yoga therapy is helpful in the management of negative symptoms of schizophrenia patients, but it is found less effective in the management of positive symptoms. Similarly, the recent study reported by Varambally <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] reported a significant improvement in PANSS and total PANSS scores as well as in the social functioning of patients having schizophrenia after Yoga therapy.</p><p>On general psychopathology domains such as somatic concern, guilt feelings, motor retardation, depression, unusual thought content, disorientation, preoccupation and active social avoidance Yoga therapy group showed better improvement in comparison to the control group. Findings of the present study are consistent with the findings of Mukherjee <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] who have reported that the practice of Yoga increases positive moods decreases negative moods. Shapiro and Cline[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] also reported that Yoga practice increases energy level regardless of the <italic>&#x000e2;sana</italic> practiced. Visceglia and Lewis,[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] found significant improvement in positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia, general psychopathology, activation, paranoia, depression, and in perceived quality of life in physical and psychological domains of adults with schizophrenia after the 8-week Yoga therapy program. Behere <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] also suggested that Yoga therapy could be a useful add-on treatment as they improved facial emotion recognition deficits, psychopathology and socio-occupational functioning in antipsychotic-stabilized patients with schizophrenia.</p><p>Since the schizophrenic disorder is associated with mood changes particularly depression, anxiety, fatigue, etc., above studies validate present findings. Improvements were observed in their positive emotional state with subjective reporting of decreased levels of negative mood and fatigue and a better mental function after yogic practices. Present research findings are similar to that of Duraiswamy <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Mukherjee <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Butler <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and Shapiro <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] they have also reported that Yoga can work well with the moderate level of depression and associated quality of life. The above findings suggest how well Yoga could be utilized to improve psychopathology of the patients. There are studies that proved Yoga could help positive mental health.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Stress is associated with the worsening of schizophrenic symptoms[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and Yoga could help to handle stress more effectively,[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and that may be resulted in better rating in the experimental group.</p><p>Before concluding, we would like to share to the future researchers on this topic in the beginning of our study we were frustrated because getting cooperation of the schizophrenic patients was found little hard. However, the things began to change after 1 week and could see that patients were waiting in the ward with properly dressed and encouraging others to participate in Yoga. Hence, it is very important to establish very good rapport with the patients and to impart motivation in them as we could. The current findings should be interpreted in light of the limitations in the study like small sample size, only male inpatients were included, groups could be controlled on limited parameters and Yoga interventions were given only for a limited period of time.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Considering the various positive effects of Yoga as revealed in this study, along with pharmacological management and psychosocial interventions the patients with schizophrenia could be exposed to Yoga therapy as a daily routine for improving psychopathology and overall functioning. In Indian cultural environment patients suffering from schizophrenia can possibly be more easily motivated to undergo Yoga therapy and internalize its beneficial effects.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None
