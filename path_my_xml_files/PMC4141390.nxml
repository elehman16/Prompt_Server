Introduction of cocaine (Karl Koller 1884) as a local anesthetic was a stepping stone in the development of spinal analgesia.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>Spinal anesthesia with bupivacaine is administered routinely for lower limb surgeries. The ensuring nerve block is sufficient to ensure painless surgery to the patient, while motor block facilitates the surgeons&#x02019; work. To prolong the duration of spinal anesthesia, a number of adjuvants have been added to local anesthesia, but these are associated with side-effects.</p><p>Spinal anesthesia can be prolonged in many ways, i.e., by using adjuvant like adrenaline, opioids, midazolam, neostigmine, etc., to the local anesthetic. Clonidine, either intrathecal or orally, can prolong spinal anesthesia and is free of the opioid-related side-effects. Clonidine hydrochloride, an imidazoline derivative, is a centrally acting &#x003b1;2 adrenergic agonist and was introduced more than two decades ago as an antihypertensive agent.</p><p>The present study was undertaken to evaluate the effects of intrathecal clonidine when administered together with hyperbaric bupivacaine 0.5% in unilateral spinal anesthesia for lower limb below-knee orthopedic surgery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><p>With the approval of the institutional ethical committee, 60 ASA I and ASA II patients of the age group of 1855 years undergoing elective surgery with time duration up to 90 min were studied.

It is not a result of altered systemic absorption, as the plasma level of bupivacaine was not altered after the addition of intrathecal clonidine to bupivacaine spinal injection.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] It may be an additive or synergistic effect secondary to the different mechanisms of action of the local anesthetic and the a2-adrenoceptor agonist.</p><p>The local anesthetic acts by blocking sodium channels, whereas the a2-adrenoceptor agonist acts by binding to the pre-synaptic Cfibers and the post-synaptic dorsal horn neurons. Intrathecal a2-adrenoceptor agonists produce analgesia by depressing the release of C-fiber transmitters and by hyperpolarization of post-synaptic dorsal horn neurons.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] This anti-nociceptive effect may explain the prolongation of the sensory block when added to spinal anesthetics.</p><p>On the other hand, Yaksh[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] has shown that intrathecal a2-adrenoceptor agonists can cause a dose-dependent decrease in motor strength in animals. The prolongation of the motor block of spinal anesthetics may result from the binding of a2-adrenoceptor agonists to motor neurons in the dorsal horn.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Most of the clinical experience gained in the use of intrathecal a2-adrenoceptor agonists has been described with clonidine. The use of intrathecal clonidine has a well-established synergistic effect with local anesthetics.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Clonidine is now an acceptable adjuvant to local anesthetics for the epidural route. Clinical trials provide evidence that less clonidine is needed intrathecally than epidurally to produce a nearly similar analgesic effect with fewer side-effects. The rationale behind the intrathecal administration of clonidine is to achieve a high drug concentration in the vicinity of a2-adrenoreceptors in the spinal cord. Clonidine produces analgesia at the spinal and supra-spinal sites. The other benefits are antiemetic effect, reduced post-spinal shivering, anxiolysis and sedation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Thus, it is concluded that a combination of 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine 12.5 mg (2.5 ml) with clonidine 50 mcg for producing unilateral spinal anesthesia for lower limb below-knee surgery of medium duration (&#x0003c;90 min) prolongs the sensory and motor block along with significantly longer-lasting post-operative analgesia without any clinically significant adverse effects.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Atkinson</surname><given-names>RS</given-names></name><name><surname>Rushman</surname><given-names>GB</given-names></name><name><surname>Davier</surname><given-names>NJ</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Spinal analgesia: Intradural and Extradural.
