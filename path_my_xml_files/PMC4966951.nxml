We report a pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT) of a web-based platform (Living, Eating, Activity and Planning through retirement; LEAP) promoting healthy eating (based on a Mediterranean diet (MD)), physical activity (PA) and meaningful social roles.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><p>A single blinded, two-arm RCT with individual allocation. Seventy-five adult regular internet users living in Northeast England, within two years of retirement, were recruited via employers and randomised in a 2:1 ratio to receive LEAP or a &#x02018;usual care&#x02019; control. Intervention arm participants were provided with a pedometer to encourage self-monitoring of PA goals. Feasibility of the trial design and procedures was established by estimating recruitment and retention rates, and of LEAP from usage data. At baseline and 8-week follow-up, adherence to a MD derived from three 24-hour dietary recalls and seven-day PA by accelerometry were assessed. Healthy ageing outcomes (including measures of physiological function, physical capability, cognition, psychological and social wellbeing) were assessed and acceptability established by compliance with measurement protocols and completion rates. Thematically analysed, semi-structured, qualitative interviews assessed acceptability of the intervention, trial design, procedures and outcome measures.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Results</title><p>Seventy participants completed the trial; 48 (96%) participants in the intervention and 22 (88%) in the control arm. Participants had considerable scope for improvement in diet as assessed by MD score. LEAP was visited a median of 11 times (range 1&#x02013;80) for a mean total time of 2.5 hours (range 5.5 min&#x02013; 8.3 hours). &#x02018;Moving more&#x02018;, &#x02018;eating well&#x02019; and &#x02018;being social&#x02019; were the most visited modules. At interview, participants reported that diet and PA modules were important and acceptable within the context of healthy ageing. Participants found both trial procedures and outcome assessments acceptable.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The trial procedures and the LEAP intervention proved feasible and acceptable. Effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of LEAP to promote healthy lifestyles warrant evaluation in a definitive RCT.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Trial Registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02136381?term=NCT02136381&#x00026;rank=1">NCT02136381</ext-link></p></sec></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>G0900686</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mathers</surname><given-names>John C C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This research was undertaken by the LiveWell Programme team which is funded by the Lifelong Health and Wellbeing (LLHW) Cross-Council research initiative in partnership with the UK Health Departments.

When longevity is increasing [<xref rid="pone.0159703.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and many governments are introducing policies to extend working life[<xref rid="pone.0159703.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], effective lifestyle interventions may offer potential to enhance healthy ageing. Life transitions represent windows of opportunity [<xref rid="pone.0159703.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] in which behaviour change interventions may be more effective [<xref rid="pone.0159703.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The retirement period may be particularly important for healthy ageing since this life transition is often associated with changes in PA [<xref rid="pone.0159703.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Behavioural interventions to change lifestyle and reduce the burden of age-related disease that have addressed target populations using a one-size-fits-all approach [<xref rid="pone.0159703.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], are of limited, or uncertain, long-term effectiveness [<xref rid="pone.0159703.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0159703.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and may widen inequalities [<xref rid="pone.0159703.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Interventions delivered via digital technologies are used increasingly and may help to overcome such limitations by offering advantages including convenience, scalability, personalisation/stratification, sustainability, and reduced costs [<xref rid="pone.0159703.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Other limitations of existing evidence include poor study design, absence of a theoretical basis and, importantly, no <italic>a priori</italic> demonstration of the feasibility of the intervention with respect to changing the specific targeted behaviours. Guided by the UK Medical Research Council&#x02019;s framework for developing and evaluating complex interventions [<xref rid="pone.0159703.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0159703.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], we developed a web-based intervention to promote healthy eating, PA, and meaningful social roles in the retirement transition. We designed and built this intervention based on systematic reviews of the literature reporting that interventions with people of retirement age are effective in increasing consumption components of the Mediterranean diet (MD) [<xref rid="pone.0159703.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], increasing PA [<xref rid="pone.0159703.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and promoting meaningful social roles [<xref rid="pone.0159703.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and from these we identified intervention components, including behaviour change techniques, appropriate for the target population [<xref rid="pone.0159703.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0159703.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Furthermore, our qualitative research suggested that lifestyle interventions that address challenges within the retirement transition are acceptable [<xref rid="pone.0159703.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and that personalised approaches to increase PA may be more successful [<xref rid="pone.0159703.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Using a sequential, iterative approach to intervention development and employing co-design methods, we developed an interactive, modular, web-based lifestyle intervention called LEAP (Living, Eating, Activity and Planning in retirement) [<xref rid="pone.0159703.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] which aims to change key lifestyle factors (diet, PA and social connections/roles) and to promote health and wellbeing. The benefit of such interventions needs to be assessed in terms of health gain and we have developed a suite of outcome measures capturing the healthy ageing phenotype (HAP) [<xref rid="pone.0159703.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] whose acceptability was evaluated in this study.</p><p>We report the results of a pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT) with people of retirement age recruited from workplaces, which tested the feasibility and acceptability of trial design and procedures including: randomisation, recruitment and trial retention; the feasibility and acceptability of LEAP; and the feasibility, acceptability and validity of outcome measures for a future definitive trial.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec007"><title>Methods</title><p>The Newcastle University Faculty of Medical Sciences Ethics Committee approved this study (registration number 00745/2014).

To minimise between-day variability, participants completed dietary recalls on the same days of the week at each time-point. To test the veracity of energy intakes (EI), the EI to Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) Ratio (EI/BMR) was calculated [<xref rid="pone.0159703.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. BMR was estimated using the sex-specific Henry equations[<xref rid="pone.0159703.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].

Volume described the number of steps per day, the number of bouts per day, ambulatory time per day (minutes) and the longest bout spent in walking during the assessment week (minutes). Alpha (&#x003b1;) describes the distribution of ambulatory bouts according to time and is described by the power law distribution exponent.

The intervention targeted participants in the retirement transition and our aim of recruiting via employers was successful in attracting participants from the appropriate life-stage.

Loss to follow-up was low with high rates of study completion (93%) and complete data collection, in contrast with reports from some other trials using digital interventions [<xref rid="pone.0159703.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0159703.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. The use of web-analytics to track use of the LEAP intervention provided objective evidence of the nature and extent of interaction with LEAP. Other strengths include the use of an objective method to assess PA patterns over 7-day periods. Dietary intake was assessed using a validated online 24-hr recall tool [<xref rid="pone.0159703.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and care was taken to avoid potential bias in respect of days of the week of dietary recording. The well-recognized limitations of widely used dietary reporting tools may be amplified when attempting to assess responses to interventions [<xref rid="pone.0159703.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] because, by necessity, study participants are aware of the expected dietary behaviour and because repeated measurements are burdensome, which may introduce reporting bias [<xref rid="pone.0159703.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. However energy intakes in this study were higher than the national average for the participants&#x02019; age group (energy intakes of 8.88 and 6.78 MJ for men and women respectively in the National Diet and Nutrition Survey [<xref rid="pone.0159703.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]) and represented an EI/BMR ratio of 1.5 suggesting little evidence of dietary under-reporting [<xref rid="pone.0159703.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>].</p><p>Relatively small proportions of men and of current smokers took part in the study, which may reduce the generalizability of results [<xref rid="pone.0159703.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. These groups have been identified as less likely to participate in health promotion programmes [<xref rid="pone.0159703.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0159703.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] and measures to increase their participation should be employed in a definitive trial. Targeting employers with higher proportions of male employees and using more gender sensitive recruitment strategies might help [<xref rid="pone.0159703.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Whether this approach would work with small to medium sized companies needs investigation. Other limitations include i) we did not employ a quantitative measure of social roles, ii) the HAP assessment may have had a positive impact on behaviour change and so reduced the potential difference between control and intervention groups, and iii) we acknowledge that there might be heterogeneity introduced by retirement status, however in this study we adopted a pragmatic decision in which we prioritised the recruitment of people around retirement. In a future larger trial we will need to stratify our sample to account for these effects.</p></sec><sec id="sec032"><title>Implications of findings and comparison with other studies</title><p>The results of this study are relevant to the development of future web-based lifestyle interventions targeting people of retirement age. This study generated user feedback to fine-tune the LEAP intervention. The feasibility and acceptability of the trial procedures, the intervention and recruitment of people in the retirement transition via workplaces were demonstrated successfully, indicate that these can be optimised and that a definitive trial is warranted [<xref rid="pone.0159703.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. In addition this pilot study provided data on the variability of the main outcomes enabling estimation of the sample size for a definitive trial.</p><p>This study adds to the scant literature on the development and implementation of lifestyle-related interventions targeted at people in the retirement transition period. To our knowledge only one previous trial used a computer-based programme to target health behaviours among Dutch retirees; a non-significant trend towards weight loss after 12 and 24 months was reported[<xref rid="pone.0159703.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Another study on Dutch adults compared the effect of interventions targeting a single behaviour (sequential approach) versus those targeting several behaviours (simultaneous approach); positive, but small, behavioural changes with both approaches were reported [<xref rid="pone.0159703.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>].</p><p>Participants visited LEAP on average 11 times in 8 weeks, a greater frequency than originally predicted (weekly visits). Other studies using internet delivered interventions report similar, or less, use e.g. a study promoting the MD among young Scottish women reported mean 16 visits over 6 months [<xref rid="pone.0159703.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>].</p><p>Web-based interventions are used increasingly and offer advantages including convenience, privacy, scalability, personalisation/stratification, sustainability, and reduced costs [<xref rid="pone.0159703.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. This approach to intervention delivery is becoming more attractive where internet usage e.g. the European Union is high [<xref rid="pone.0159703.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]). However, although the use of PCs and of the internet by middle-aged people has increased rapidly in recent years, barriers may limit the use of digital platforms by a minority [<xref rid="pone.0159703.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>] which will require the design of more tailored, and user-friendly, intervention platforms.</p><p>Previous evaluations of workplace interventions aiming to improve individual lifestyles indicate that these could be cost-effective in improving health and reducing sickness-absence from work [<xref rid="pone.0159703.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Digital lifestyle interventions can provide individualised behaviour change information at low cost and the implementation, and efficacy, of such interventions in real-life settings require testing at scale.</p></sec><sec id="sec033"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The findings from this pilot study suggest that people in the retirement transition are motivated to participate in an internet-delivered intervention to improve diet and PA and to strengthen social roles/social connections, lifestyle changes which are expected to enhance healthy ageing. In addition, we found that the web-based LEAP intervention was acceptable and that the study protocols (including those for recruitment and for assessment of behavioural and HAP outcomes) were feasible and acceptable. Findings from this feasibility study will inform further refinement of LEAP and of the trial procedures in preparation for a definitive RCT.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec034"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0159703.s001"><label>S1 Dataset</label><caption><title>Lara etal dataset.</title><p>(SAV)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0159703.s001.sav"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0159703.s002"><label>S1 File</label><caption><p>Table A.
