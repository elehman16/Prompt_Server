Performance measures included a 5&#x000a0;km time trial, upper and lower body reaction to visual stimuli, and multiple object tracking. Plasma caffeine concentrations, blood pressure (BP), heart rate and subjective measures of energy, focus and alertness were assessed at baseline (BL), 30-min following coffee ingestion (30+), prior to endurance exercise (PRE) and immediately-post 5&#x000a0;km (IP). Metabolic measures [VO<sub>2</sub>, V<sub><italic>E</italic></sub>, and respiratory exchange rate (RER)] were measured during the 5&#x000a0;km.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Plasma caffeine concentrations were significantly greater during TC (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001) at 30+, PRE, and IP compared to DC.

Coffee is a highly-concentrated source of caffeine (~2 %) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The stimulatory effects of coffee are attributed to the pharmacological activity of caffeine, acting as an antagonist of adenosine receptors in the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. However, the wide variety of coffee species, roasting conditions, and extraction procedures employed results in a considerable amount of biological variance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Unlike coffee traditionally consumed in the western world, Turkish coffee is not drip filtered, but rather its method of preparation involves slowly boiling water that is mixed with thin powdery grounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. This style of preparation results in a greater amount of biologically active components remaining in the liquid, and likely contributes to the higher concentration of caffeine found in Turkish coffee compared to other coffee types and preparation styles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>The ingestion of caffeine has been reported to spare muscle glycogen, and increase fat oxidation through increased sympathetic nervous system activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Several reviews examining the ergogenic benefits of caffeine use and endurance performance have concluded that caffeine use is positively related to greater performance in time trials and in exercise to exhaustion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Caffeine anhydrous has long been thought to be superior for improving endurance performance as compared to coffee due to the presence of chlorogenic acid in coffee [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Recently, Hodgson et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] compared the effects of decaffeinated coffee, regular coffee, caffeine anhydrous, and a placebo and demonstrated regular coffee to be as effective as anhydrous caffeine, when provided at the same relative dose, for improving endurance performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Differences in their study and others were partly attributed to the performance test used. Previous studies examining the ergogenic benefits of coffee have used prolonged submaximal runs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], or using time to exhaustion tests [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], however Hodgson and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] employed a time trial as their assessment. Considering that time to exhaustion tests have been shown to be highly variable from day to day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], the use of time trials may provide a more reliable measure of endurance performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Therefore, we hypothesize that the ingestion of Turkish coffee will improve 5&#x000a0;km time trial performance, reaction time, and subjective measures energy, focus and alertness, but will not change metabolic or cardiovascular measures as compared to a decaffeinated placebo treatment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Research design</title><p>Participants reported to the Human Performance Laboratory (HPL) for one familiarization session prior to experimental trials. During the familiarization session, participants were informed of all procedures and familiarized with all performance measures to reduce the possibility of a learning effect. Participants performed two experimental time trials with a minimum of 48&#x000a0;h between each trial. The average time between trials was 5.3&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2.7&#x000a0;days. During each trial, participants consumed either regular Turkish coffee (TC), or a decaffeinated Turkish coffee (DC) from the same manufacturer (Strauss Coffee, Lod, Israel).</p><p>Participants reported to the HPL 2-h post-prandial and had not exercised for at least 24&#x000a0;h prior to each trial. In addition, participants were asked to not alter their dietary habits, but to replicate their dietary habits for the day before and day of each trial, and were requested to avoid caffeine consumption the day of the trial. Upon arrival to the laboratory participants were asked to lie comfortably in a supine position prior to the insertion of a cannula. Participants were then requested to sit comfortably for 15&#x000a0;min prior to the baseline (BL) blood draw. Following the BL blood draw participants were provided either the TC or DC. Additional blood draws occurred 30-min following coffee ingestion (30+), prior to the 5&#x000a0;km run (PRE), and immediately following the 5&#x000a0;km run (IP). Cardiovascular and subjective measures were also assessed at similar time points. Performance measures included reaction assessment, 5&#x000a0;km time trial and cognitive function.

Coefficient of variation for each assay was 2.60 % for glucose and 0.79 % for lactate.</p><p>Plasma caffeine concentrations were quantified using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with chromatographic conditions based upon previous work done in our lab [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Chromatography was performed on an Agilent Infinity 1260 HPLC (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) consisting of a degasser, binary pump, auto-sampler, column thermostat, and photodiode array detector. A Zorbax Eclipse Plus C18 (4.6&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;150&#x000a0;mm, 5-&#x003bc;m) column and Zorbax analytical guard column (4.6&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;12.5&#x000a0;mm, 5-&#x003bc;m) were used for separation. Data were collected using OpenLAB chromatography data system, ChemStation edition.</p><p>All reagents were of HPLC grade. Caffeine, beta-hydroxyethyl-theophylline, sodium phosphate monobasic and sodium phosphate dibasic were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) to create the stock solution. Acetonitrile was purchased from Fisher Scientific (Pittsburgh, PA). HPLC grade water was prepared by reverse-osmosis and purified using a Milli-Q Direct 8 water purification system (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA).</p><p>A 40&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g&#x02219;mL<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> stock solution of caffeine, theobromine and beta-hydroxyethyl-theophylline was prepared in water and sonicated.

The appearance of the digits placed a cognitive demand on the information processing resources of the participant. The participant was instructed to successfully identify and touch each stimulus before it changed position and score as many touches as possible within 60&#x000a0;s.

The test was initiated when the participant placed and held his hand on an illuminated &#x0201c;home&#x0201d; button. At this point, a stimulus (light) was presented randomly in one of five locations, parallel to the home button. Visual reaction time was measured as the amount of time it takes to identify the stimulus (light) and initiate a reaction by taking their hand off the home button. Motor response time was measured as the amount of time it takes to physically touch the stimulus (light) with their hand following the initial visual reaction and was measured as the amount of time between the hand leaving the home button and touching the stimulus (light). Physical reaction time was measured as the total elapsed time from the introduction of the target stimulus (light) to the physical completion of the task (returning to the home button after touching the stimulus). All measures were recorded to the 1/100&#x02019;s of a second. Participants performed this assessment ten times. The average time for all ten assessments was recorded. In our laboratory, the ICC of this test has been shown to be 0.84 (visual) and 0.63 (motor) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Lower body reaction measurements</title><p>Lower body reaction time was measured using a 20-s reaction test on the Quick Board&#x02122; (The Quick Board, LLC, Memphis, TN) reaction timer.

The participant tracked 4 of the 8 balls that moved in three-dimensions. At the beginning of each trial, the 8 balls appeared frozen on the screen for 2&#x000a0;s while half of them turned grey indicating the balls the participant was to track. After the 2&#x000a0;s, the balls all became the same color again and began to move in three dimensions. At the conclusion of the trial (8&#x000a0;s), the balls froze and a number appeared on each ball. The participant called out the numbers of the four balls they were supposed to be tracking. Velocity of movement began at a slow tracking speed and increased or decreased depending on whether the participant correctly identified the 4 correct balls.

The results of this study indicated that plasma caffeine concentrations were significantly elevated within 30&#x000a0;min following TC ingestion. Participants consuming TC experienced significantly greater reaction performance and subjective feelings of energy. Although no significant differences were noted in time trial performance, during the TC time trial participants experienced a significantly higher average RER than that seen during the DC trial, suggesting a higher utilization of carbohydrate to meet metabolic demands. Our results are not consistent with previous investigations which have shown either a decrease or no effect of caffeine on RER [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Although speculative, differences in the exercise protocol utilized in this study may have contributed to these contrasting results. In the present study a time trial protocol was used, while other studies employed a time to exhaustion protocol. The goal of a time trial is to complete the distance in as fast a time as possible, whereas a time to exhaustion protocol requires the participant to exercise at a predetermined pace. As such, if the goal is to complete a given distance as fast as possible the RER would be greater than that seen during a set-paced trial. Previous research has reported that coffee ingestion can increase average power output during a time trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In addition, caffeine is a known central nervous system stimulator acting as an adenosine antagonist, and subsequently increasing sympathetic nervous system activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Although no significant differences were noted in time trial performance, the greater RER response, and a trend observed in the <italic>V</italic><sub>E</sub> response during the TC trial, does suggest a greater anaerobic effort during the run. This is also consistent with the greater perceived energy reported by participants during TC compared to DC. Interestingly, 60 % of the subjects (12/20) ran faster during the 5&#x000a0;km time trial during TC compared to DC. When comparisons between TC and DC were performed in the responders only, the time differentials between trials were significantly different. Although speculative, the 60 % responder rate is similar to the 61.1 % frequency observed in habitual coffee drinkers possessing a gene associated with enhanced cytochrome P450 1A2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Cytochrome P450 is a liver enzyme that is involved with caffeine metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Thus, those individuals with this polymorphism would potentially have a faster metabolism of caffeine, and potentially have a greater ergogenic response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p>Coffee and caffeine have been associated with enhancing the ability to perform mental tasks, including enhanced alertness and attention during activities of daily living and physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Results of this study showed significant increases in subjective measures of energy, with trends demonstrated in alertness, and focus during the TC trial. Greater feelings of energy at 30+ and PRE corresponded to the significant elevations in plasma caffeine concentrations. These results are in agreement with other investigations showing that a 300&#x02013;600&#x000a0;mg dose of caffeine can provide beneficial effects on measures of sleepiness, vigor, fatigue, and attentiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. The lower feelings of energy in conjunction with a 7 % increase in <italic>V</italic><sub>E</sub>, and greater carbohydrate utilization in TC compared to DC likely reflects a higher running velocity used during this trial. The differences in subjective feelings of energy at IP were more difficult to explain and may be spurious.</p><p>In the current study, average upper body reaction time, measured as the number of successful &#x0201c;hits&#x0201d; in 60&#x000a0;s, was significantly improved for the TC trial compared to DC. This is consistent with previous studies that have observed improved reaction performance with caffeine ingestion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Although improvements were not noted in all reaction drills, it is likely that the testing duration of the visual, motor and physical upper body reaction test, and the lower body quickness assessment was not sufficient to yield significant changes. Additionally no significant effects were noted in any of the cognitive function assessments. Although caffeine is known to have positive effects on simple reaction time and visuo-spatial reasoning in a dose-dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], the effects of caffeine on cognition is not as well supported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The present study enrolled participants who were regular consumers of caffeine. Chronic ingestion of caffeine (3&#x000a0;mg&#x02009;&#x000b7;&#x02009;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> BW) has been shown to have no beneficial effects on a four-choice reaction time test, or on measures of alertness and attention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. The present study may not have provided enough caffeine for habitual users to demonstrate beneficial effects on attention, which may have affected their performance on tests of cognitive abilities.</p><p>Circulating plasma glucose and lactate were elevated following exercise, but no differences were noted between trials. This is consistent with some studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], but in contrast to others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Hodgson and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] reported significant increases in plasma glucose concentrations at the end of a 30-min steady state cycling protocol following caffeinated coffee ingestion (5&#x000a0;mg caffeine&#x02009;&#x000b7;&#x02009;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> BW). Studies that did not see any difference in the glucose or lactate response, including the present study, provided equivalent caffeine doses ranging from 3.0&#x000a0;mg - 4.5&#x000a0;mg caffeine&#x02009;&#x000b7;&#x02009;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> BW dose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. It appears that caffeine doses of 5&#x000a0;mg&#x02009;&#x000b7;&#x02009;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> or greater appear necessary to significantly elevate plasma glucose.</p><p>The time course of caffeine elevation following the consumption of Turkish coffee seen in this study was similar to that seen following the ingestion of instant coffee [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], and similar to other investigations investigating caffeine pharmacokinetics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Acute and chronic ingestion of coffee or anhydrous caffeine has been shown to cause an increase in sympathetic nervous system activity and subsequent increase in systolic blood pressure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Although no significant interactions were noted between the trials in the systolic blood pressure response, when collapsed across time systolic blood pressures were significantly elevated for TC compared to DC, consistent with the known physiological response following caffeinated coffee ingestion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec27" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Acute ingestion of 3.0 caffeine&#x02009;&#x000b7;&#x02009;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> BW of Turkish coffee results in a significant elevation in plasma caffeine concentrations within 30&#x000a0;min of consumption. Elevations in plasma caffeine did appear to result in significant performance benefits in reaction time during a 60-s visual response stimulus and increased subjective feelings of energy in habitual caffeine users. Although no significant effects were noted in time trial performance during a 5&#x000a0;km run, 60 % of the participants were deemed responders and performed significantly faster (5 %) in the 5&#x000a0;km when consuming Turkish coffee compared to the decaffeinated trial. No significant benefits though were noted in measures of cognitive function. Considering the paucity of research on performance and Turkish coffee consumption, additional research examining the ergogenic benefits of pre-exercise ingestion appears warranted.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>DDC, JRH, DHF, and JRS were involved in study design, data analysis, manuscript preparation, and gave final approval of the manuscript.
