Revascularization relieves symptoms and may prevent or delay these complications. Over the last decades, endovascular repair has become the preferred treatment for femoral arterial obstructive disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. No definitive consensus has emerged concerning the best endovascular strategy, like the added value of stenting. Literature is most supportive of balloon angioplasty with stenting in longer segment lesions in the superficial femoral artery (SFA). However, even with stenting reported restenosis rates are between 35% and 45% after one and two years follow-up respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].

Given a power of 90% based on a two-tail test with an alpha error level of 0.05, a beta error level of 0.1, an anticipated loss to follow-up of 10%, and a sample size of 88 patients per group, a total of 176 patients will be needed. The analysis will be performed in accordance with intention-to-treat principle. For the primary endpoint, a chi squared test for univariate analysis and Cox proportional hazards model will be assessed to investigate the relation between co-variants and the endpoint. An interim analysis on the primary end point (that is, efficacy) will be at 6 months follow-up of the first 50 consecutive patients by the DSMB.

The study will not be stopped in case of futility. There will be a blinded outcome assessment by the DSMB for all patients. Missing data will be analyzed using multiple imputation.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Intervention</title><p>The aim of the treatment is to obtain a patent superficial femoral artery, with uninterrupted flow to the pedal arch. Therefore not only the SFA will be treated, but if indicated, the aorto-iliac inflow arteries may be treated additionally during the same procedure. However, for randomization of the SFA stenosis or occlusion, it is mandatory that the inflow artery is treated successfully (that is, a residual obstruction &#x0003c;30% or a translesional mean pressure gradient &#x0003c;10 mmHg). This strategy corresponds with daily practice. Invasive translesional pressure gradients will be measured to determine lesion characteristics.</p><p>Before the start of the interventional procedure, a radiopaque ruler must be placed under the leg to measure the length of the lesion. If the common femoral artery (CFA) needs additional treatment, the physician is free to choose a contralateral (cross-over) or ipsilateral (antegrade) technique. At the start of the procedure 40 ml of arterial blood will be drawn from the introducer sheath, just after sheath placement and samples will be collected by the Laboratory of Experimental Cardiology in the context of the Athero Express Biobank Study which has been approved in the past (study nr. C-01.18). DSA images will be made of the ipsilateral limb in at least two planes with a minimum of 30 degrees difference in angulation before and after angioplasty. Radiographic single shots must be made during inflation of the balloons, of the implanted stents, and during post-dilatation of the stents, if performed. All single shots must be stored.</p><p>Patients will be randomized to either the LPEB or conventional balloon PTA when the guide wire has successfully passed the SFA lesion. Predilatation with an undersized uncoated PTA balloon will be performed. This will be followed by PTA with LPEB or uncoated balloon, as randomized. To avoid geographic miss this balloon dilatation has to be performed with a longer balloon compared to the length of the lesion itself. Inflation time in either group is at least 45 seconds, allowing adequate drug transfer in case of the LPEB. Next an adequately sized stent (maximum 10% oversizing compared to the diameter of the native SFA below the lesion) is implanted according to instructions for use (IFU). Stenting will be performed using the Supera&#x000ae; wire interwoven nitinol stent (IDEV Technologies Inc., Webster TX). In cases of stenosis including the origin of the SFA, a Smart&#x000ae; stent (Cordis J&#x00026;J, Bridgewater NJ) will be implanted. The stent must be longer than the treated lesion, but shorter than the balloon that has been used for angioplasty. It is strongly preferred to use one stent to treat the entire SFA lesion. If necessary the stent may be tailored with an additional in-stent balloon dilatation at the discretion of the interventionalist, using a standard (non-drug eluting) PTA balloon of adequate size. A duplex scan of the target lesion must be performed before discharge.</p><p>All pre-procedural, procedural, and follow-up imaging studies (magnetic resonance angiogram (MRA), DSA) will be assessed using CAAS QVA 3D (Quantitative Vascular Analysis) software in a core lab.</p></sec><sec><title>Follow-up</title><p>All patients receive aspirin 100 mg daily and simvastatin 40 mg daily, indefinitely, starting at least one week prior to the procedure. During the intervention all patients receive 5000 international units of heparin. After the intervention all patients receive additional clopidogrel 75 mg daily for a period of 3 months. Thereafter, aspirin will be continued.</p><p>At 1, 6, 12, and 24 months, patients will undergo treadmill test, ABI, toe pressure, and TcpO<sub>2</sub> measurements of at least the ipsilateral leg.

Furthermore, DUS of the treated SFA will be performed. In case DUS reveals a symptomatic &#x0003e;50% restenosis, or a &#x0003e;75% asymptomatic restenosis additional digital subtraction angiography will be performed with any necessary re-intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Data collection</title><p>Data will be collected by means of an e-CRF during treatment in the participating centers.

The use of paclitaxel has proven to inhibit neointimal growth and thus reduce restenosis after percutaneous coronary interventions and SFA lesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Recent literature provides evidence that stenting after PTA is of importance to reduce restenosis in intermediate and long-segment SFA lesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The paclitaxel-coated balloons used in previous studies utilize iopromide as excipient, whereas in the current study shellac is the excipient. It is this carrier that distinguishes this balloon from other drug eluting balloons. Shellac might be superior to other excipients in binding the paclitaxel to the balloon and will facilitate a fast and effective delivery of paclitaxel in the arterial wall. In this way lower doses of paclitaxel are needed and shorter inflation time of the balloon itself is required [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Furthermore the results of the Thunder and Fempac trials are difficult to interpret on account of the significant heterogeneity in the study populations. Lesions of all lengths were randomized for treatment with paclitaxel-covered balloon or uncoated balloon with bailout stenting using different stents. Furthermore previously treated obstructions and in stent restenosis were included, as well as <italic>de novo</italic> SFA lesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The RAPID study is the first study designed to assess absence of binary restenosis after treatment of SFA lesions &#x0003e;5 cm with a paclitaxel/shellac-coated balloon versus uncoated balloon with stenting in both treatment arms. One of the strengths of this study is that all patients will be treated using the Supera&#x000ae; interwoven nitinol stent (IDEV Technologies Inc., Webster TX), except for lesions involving the origin of the SFA, which will be treated with a Smart stent (Cordis J&#x00026;J, Bridgewater, NJ). Furthermore the LegFlow&#x000ae; is a recently introduced device that requires a short inflation time of 45 seconds, and may reduce aneurysm formation in the treated segment due to the limited exposure to paclitaxel. Aneurysm formation is described with the use of paclitaxel in drug eluting stents in some case reports. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] Shellac is used in this device to obtain an equally distributed tissue concentration of paclitaxel, reaching an optimal dose at a short inflation time. This results in reduced neointimal growth, and reduces the risk of restenosis. In porcine models paclitaxel/shellac-coated balloons show a higher tissue concentration over time than other paclitaxel balloons, requiring a shorter inflation time for optimal tissue concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Recently, the use of the DIOR 2 balloon (also covered with paclitaxel/shellac and used in the coronary arteries) for in-stent restenosis of small coronary arteries proved safe at one year follow-up. TLR of the treated segments in this study was 12% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>The target lesions characterization will be using an anatomical description as advised by the Define group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. One of the drawbacks of the current Inter-Society Consensus for the Management of Peripheral Arterial Disease (TASC II) classification is the lack of inclusion of baseline anatomic characteristics of the target (in this trial the SFA) lesion itself and that it combines femoropopliteal lesions as well as below the knee lesions within the same nomenclature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Therefore, the TASC classification, although commonly utilized, may not be ideal. All devices, guide wires and catheters have CE-approval (1434-MDD-32/2011). The shellac used on the catheter is recognized as safe by the FDA (E904).</p><p>The RAPID trial is a randomized controlled patient blind trial that will provide evidence of whether the use of paclitaxel/shellac coated balloons with stenting reduces the frequency of restenosis in intermediate (5&#x02013;15 cm) and long (&#x0003e;15 cm) lesions of the superficial femoral artery.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial status</title><p>Approval of the study protocol from the central medical ethical committee has been obtained. Currently 20 patients are enrolled in the RAPID trial. The projected completion date for this trial is August 2015.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>ABI: Ankle-Brachial Indices; ACT: Absolute claudicating time; AE: Adverse event; CFA: Common femoral artery; CLI: Critical limb ischemia; COT: Claudication onset time; CRF: Case record form; DEB: Drug ellutin balloon; DSA: Digital subtraction angiography; DSMB: Data safety monitoring board; DUS: Duplex ultrasound; FDA: Food and Drug Administration; IC: Intermittent claudication; IFU: Instructions for use; LPEB: Legflow&#x000ae; paclitaxel eluting balloon; MRA: Magnetic resonance angiogram; METC: The ethics committee; PAOD: Peripheral arterial occlusive disease; PAQ: Peripheral Artery Questionnaire; PTA: Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty; PVR: Proximal peak velocity ratio; SAE: Serious adverse event; SFA: Superficial femoral artery; TASC II: Trans-Atlantic Inter-Society Consensus Document on Management of Peripheral Arterial Disease; TER: Target-extremity revascularization; TLR: Target lesion revascularization.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>AK and JPPMdV drafted the manuscript.
