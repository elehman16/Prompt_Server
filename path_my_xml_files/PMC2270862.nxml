No difference was found for knowledge by completion method, but telephone completion was associated with more positive attitude classifications than postal completion (87 vs 96%, 95% CI diff 0.006 to 15).

Acceptable questionnaire response rates are considered to be in the range of 60&#x02013;70%, with response rates of over 70% described as very good [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Self administered questionnaires sent and returned by post offer a cost effective way to obtain data from a large number of participants, but often has low response rates. A recent systematic review of methods to increase response rates to questionnaires identified a number of strategies such as shortening questionnaires, repeat mailing of questionnaires and telephone reminders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Intensive reminders by telephone and post were the most effective, improving response rates by an average of 24%. Financial incentives have also been used to increase response rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. For example a recent descriptive study reported that an unconditional payment of &#x000a3;5 increased the response rate from 78 to 88% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Some studies comparing telephone and postal response rates from patients have found that response rates from questionnaires administered by telephone are higher [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] while others have found no difference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Studies comparing responses from general practitioners have also shown varying results. One study reported a lower response rate for postal surveys than for telephone methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], while another found a higher response rate for postal surveys than for telephone methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Hocking and colleagues suggested that the lower telephone response rate in their study was because practice receptionists blocked telephone access to the general practioners who were the target of the survey. A consensus is emerging that a combination of direct contact and postal methods leads to higher response rates to questionnaires than the use of postal methods alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>Two areas of uncertainty exist about the use of telephone compared with postal administration of questionnaires. First, research studies not only need a good response rate, but also representative responses from different socio-economic, demographic and clinical groups. It is not known whether postal and telephone methods of administering questionnaires affect responses differently from different socio-economic, demographic or clinical groups. Second, responses to questionnaire items administered by post or telephone need to be equivalent. Only two randomised studies have examined this. One found a difference in responses to the same question, while the other did not [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>The observational study described here took place within SHIFT (Screening for Haemoglobinopathies in the First. Trimester), a cluster randomised controlled trial assessing the feasibility, effectiveness and acceptability of offering antenatal Sickle Cell and Thalassaemia (SCT) screening in primary care (ISRCTN00677850) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The trial was set in two inner city UK Primary Care Trusts (PCTs) with a large number of people from minority ethnic groups and with high levels of material and social deprivation. The questionnaires had been designed to assess informed choice about antenatal SCT screening in a population with low levels of literacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>At the start of the SHIFT trial, participants were posted questionnaires (in one of twelve languages, selected according to information provided at trial consent) to complete at home and return by post. Initial monitoring indicated that this method gave an unacceptably low response rate. Based on a literature search we developed a second strategy that was more likely to achieve a high response rate in a multilingual population namely, offering participants the opportunity to complete a questionnaire over the telephone with a researcher and an interpreter, if necessary. Participants offered the second strategy were also offered postal completion. This paper compares (i) the response rates of offering participants a choice of telephone and postal completion methods with those of offering postal completion only; (ii) the responses obtained from the method selected ie postal or telephone completion; (iii) the financial costs to the research team of offering postal and telephone administration of questionnaires in order that reliable estimates can be included in future research cost estimates.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>The study has a "before" and "after" design, comparing two methods of questionnaire completion. Eligible participants were asked by their GPs if the research team could contact them to invite them to take part in the trial evaluation and, if so, in which language they would like to be contacted. Women who agreed to be contacted by the research team were contacted in a language identified by the GP as the woman's preferred language, using a telephone interpreter if appropriate, and informed about the trial. For women consenting to take part two methods of questionnaire completion were used:</p><sec><title>Postal completion only</title><p>A written questionnaire was sent in one of twelve languages and women were asked to return it using a freepost envelope. Up to two reminders to return the completed questionnaire were sent.</p></sec><sec><title>Choice of telephone or postal completion</title><p>During a telephone conversation to recruit interested women to the trial, women were offered a choice of telephone or postal completion of the questionnaire: (a) telephone completion &#x02013; the questionnaire was read to women over the telephone in their preferred language using a telephone interpreter if necessary. Women were offered the choice of completing the questionnaire at the time consent was sought or at a later stage. A script was developed for telephone administration of the questionnaire detailing exactly how to present response options. Women who started, but did not finish the questionnaire over the telephone, were sent a written questionnaire in the post. Up to two reminders to return the written questionnaire were sent.</p><p>(b) postal completion &#x02013; as described above.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Setting</title><p>Twenty five general practices in two UK Primary Care Trusts (PCTs). The study represents the first eleven months of the evaluation phase of a cluster randomised controlled trial of offering antenatal SCT screening in primary care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The method of recruiting and retaining representative practices to the trial is described elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. A universal screening policy was operating during the data collection period, that is, antenatal SCT screening was offered to all pregnant women regardless of their ethnicity or family origin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. It is estimated that about 6% of pregnant women in the two PCTs carry a significant haemoglobin variant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The two PCTs are ranked among the most deprived in England (sixth and 13th out of 354 boroughs) and have about 40% of their total populations from minority ethnic groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The questionnaire comprised 32 items, including four items assessing attitudes towards antenatal SCT screening and ten items assessing knowledge about antenatal SCT screening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. It is estimated the questionnaire took participants between five and ten minutes to complete on their own.</p></sec><sec><title>Participants</title><p>Seven-hundred and sixty-five pregnant women consenting to take part in a questionnaire evaluation of antenatal sickle cell and thalassaemia screening. The only measure of social group available was "English speaking" or "non English speaking". Women were classified by their GP into these groups, based on whether the woman required an interpreter to speak to a member of the research team. In such cases the GP indicated the woman's preferred language. There were 571 women in the English speaking group and 204 women in the non English speaking group. Sixty one women were asked to complete and return questionnaires using postal completion only. Seven hundred and fourteen women were offered a choice of completing the questionnaire using telephone or postal completion. The uneven group sizes occurred because the response rate from sending questionnaires by post was recognised as unacceptable early in the evaluation phase of the trial and so was discontinued.</p></sec><sec><title>Measures</title><p>We report on</p><p>(i) response rates for women offered postal completion only compared with women offered a choice of completion methods</p><p>(ii) <underline>questionnaire responses on two sub scales of the questionnaire</underline></p><p>&#x02022; attitudes towards undergoing antenatal SCT screening based on four items.

Costs were based on the means of these two sets of data.

This study was not a  randomised trial and there could be other explanations for the observed  effect. The intervention was complex. It included offering a choice, and offering a choice of two methods that differed in several ways. While we cannot exclude the possibility that the mere offer of a choice was responsible for the effect, the pattern of results suggests that it is the opportunity to complete questionnaires by telephone that is crucial. Telephone completion compared with postal completion allows for ready translation to more languages and provides social support to complete the questionnaire. Perhaps most importantly it removes the reading obstacle to questionnaire completion thereby allowing the estimated 20&#x02013;25% of the UK population who are functionally illiterate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] to participate in the research process.</p><p>The increased response rate obtained by administering questionnaires by telephone raises two questions: first, did the increase in response rate vary by social group; and second, were responses obtained by telephone different to those obtained by post. Regarding differential response rates across social groups, the response from those offered a choice in this study was higher for English speakers than for non English speakers. The lack of data from non responders means, however, that we are not able to assess how representative the responders are of the telephone or postal groups overall.</p><p>The data do not identify a reason why non-English speakers were less likely to opt for completing the questionnaire by telephone than were English speakers. It may reflect a failure of the trial to engage non-English speakers in the research process. Alternatively, it may reflect cultural differences in, for example, willingness to talk to strangers over the telephone. Further work is required to understand why non-English speaking women were less likely to choose to complete questionnaires by telephone than were English speaking women. Understanding this may allow telephone administration to be offered in ways that increase acceptability, and hence, use for non-English speakers and thereby increase response rates further.</p><p>Comparing responses from the two modalities revealed differences in assessed attitudes: women completing the questionnaire over the telephone were more likely to be classified as having positive attitudes towards undergoing antenatal SCT screening than women completing the postal questionnaire. There were no differences in knowledge by completion modality. One explanation is that the difference may be due to the way the questions were asked or social desirability. Alternatively it may be because the study was not randomised. That is women who opted to complete the questionnaire over the telephone had more positive attitudes towards undergoing the test than women who completed the questionnaire by post.</p><p>There are financial costs involved in offering women a choice of telephone or postal questionnaire completion methods. These include the researcher time to administer the questionnaire over the telephone as well as the cost of using telephone interpreters. The use of telephone interpreters did not negate the need (or cost) for translating written materials. Research budgets should include funding to cover all these costs.</p><p>There are potential problems associated with administering questionnaires over the telephone. The person administering the questionnaire needs to be trained to ensure that the potential participant does not feel under any pressure to participate in the evaluation or to complete the questionnaire. Training is also required to ensure that questions are not asked in a leading way i.e. in a way likely to guide respondents to answer in a particular way.</p><p>For women who opted to complete the questionnaire by telephone, the use of interpreters did not appear to pose any problems. The use of telephone interpreters allows greater flexibility than using written translations because the languages required do not require specifying in advance. However the use of telephone interpreters does not allow for the use of quality control procedures such as back translation that are available with written translations.</p><p>There has been some debate about the use of translation services within the NHS which cost in the region of &#x000a3;55 million per annum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. It has been argued that the use of such services may compound rather than ameliorate the health problems of non-English speakers by reducing the need for them to learn English and thereby implicitly encouraging non-English speakers to remain outside of the dominant culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Others have argued that the lack of translation services results in poorer healthcare for non-English speakers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Whilst this debate is likely to continue within the context of service provision, it is important to acknowledge that this debate is not applicable in research settings. A prerequisite for reliable trials is that trial outcomes are obtained for all participants and are representative of the population in general [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. They therefore need to include people who do as well as those who do not speak English.</p><sec><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>The strength of this study is that it illustrates the acceptability and feasibility of offering respondants the option of completing questionnaires over the telephone with and without interpreters. A weakness of the study is that the effect of offering telephone administration, although large, is based on observational data, and so uncertainty remains about a causal link between offering women an opportunity to complete questionnaires over the telephone and the observed increase in questionnaire response rates. Whilst the study took place in areas with high levels of social deprivation, individual level markers of social deprivation were not available. It is therefore unknown by how much, if at all, offering telephone administration of the questionnaire increased the percentage of participants with high levels of material and social deprivation. The results also raise questions about the equivalence of responses to questions obtained using the two methods. More research is needed to determine if this is due to differences in types of people responding or differences in demand characteristics of the two methods.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Studies requiring data to be collected by questionnaire may obtain higher response rates from both English and non-English speakers when a choice of telephone or postal administration and where necessary, an interpreter, is offered compared to offering postal administration only. This approach will, however, incur additional research costs and uncertainty remains about the equivalence of responses obtained in the two methods.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>ED participated in the design of the study and performed the statistical analysis and drafted the manuscript; KB participated in the design of the study and conducted the telephone interviews; ER participated in the design of the study and helped with drafting the manuscript; TMM conceived of the study, participated in it's design and co-ordination and helped to draft the manuscript.
