It affects about 1% to 2% of children in France [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The allergy carries a risk of acute life-threatening reactions even after the ingestion of small amounts of peanut [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Peanut allergy spontaneously resolves in about 20% of children only [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and thus current guidelines for allergy management consist of strict avoidance of the allergen. Such a diet is challenging for children and their families because of the widespread presence of peanut in food preparations. Hence, in a study of Swedish children, despite theoretical strict avoidance, peanut was reported to be responsible for 19% of anaphylaxis reactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Anaphylaxis can be life-threatening and this risk justifies the holding of rescue medications such as self-injectable epinephrine at home and at school. Adolescents are particularly at risk because they have a high incidence of severe reactions following unwitting ingestion of peanut [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. These reactions account for most of the fatalities caused by food-induced anaphylaxis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However, adolescent behavior is unpredictable and can include consumption of alcohol, which makes it difficult to adhere to a strict avoidance diet. Several studies have indicated that early consumption of allergenic food like peanuts may be a more beneficial strategy. For example, in Israel, where infants are introduced early to peanuts, the prevalence of peanut allergy is lower in children than in the UK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In adolescent populations, specific oral immunotherapy is an interesting way of modifying the natural history of peanut allergy. Since 2009, peanut-specific oral immunotherapy protocols have been implemented with the aim of inducing desensitization, which was achieved in 61% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] to 84% of cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In a Cochrane review published in 2012 by Sheikh and Nurmatov [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], only one double-blind, placebo-controlled study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] validated the concept of oral immunotherapy for peanut allergy in children. However, this trial involved only children aged less than 10&#x000a0;years, and nothing is known about desensitization in adolescents with high-level peanut specific IgE. Recently, Anagnostou <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated the interest of tolerance induction versus strict avoidance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>Our aim was to assess the efficacy and safety of oral immunotherapy in a teenage population at risk of severe reactions to peanut in order to improve their quality of life and enable them to eat freely in any restaurant and in the school canteen. We also decided to investigate the length of the maintenance phase needed to induce long-term desensitization.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Objectives and design</title><p>The main objective is to investigate in an adolescent population the efficacy and safety of peanut oral escalating immunotherapy up to a maximum level of 2&#x000a0;g of peanut. The secondary objectives are to compare two maintenance durations (13 and 37&#x000a0;weeks) with 2&#x000a0;g daily of peanut intake, to investigate the immunologic effects of peanut oral immunotherapy, and to assess the safety of the procedure.</p><p>The study was designed in two phases: build-up and maintenance immunotherapy (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). After a baseline double-blind placebo-controlled oral food challenge (DBPCOFC), participants will be randomized (R1) in the build-up phase (24&#x000a0;weeks) to one of the two groups (treatment or placebo). At the end of the build-up phase, desensitized participants will be randomized (R2) for the maintenance phase (13 versus 37&#x000a0;weeks&#x02019; duration). During this second phase there will be no blinding.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Study design. Children aged 12 to 18&#x000a0;years with peanut allergy proven in a first double-blind placebo-controlled oral food challenge (DBPCOFC) will enter a double-blind placebo-controlled induction phase through a first 2:1 randomization (R1). After a successful build-up phase, the maintenance phase duration will be determined by a second 1:1 randomization (R2). Double arrow: DBPCOFC.

The participants will have a normal diet (trace of peanut and small quantities of peanut) after the penultimate DBPCOFC.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Consent statement</title><p>This peanut oral immunotherapy study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial. It was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University Hospital of Clermont-Ferrand (France). By 1 March 2013, the study had been approved for all centers by a central ethics committee (Comit&#x000e9; de Protection des Personnes Sud-Est VI, Clermont-Ferrand, France) with the registration number RBHP-2013-Fauquert and registered at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov">http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link> (NCT02046083). Before inclusion the patients (and their parents) are fully informed of the aims, procedures, safety measures, and practical aspects of the protocol. A written consent is mandatory before inclusion to confirm their agreement.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Study population</title><sec id="Sec6"><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p>Adolescents aged 12 to 18&#x000a0;years with a clinical history of reaction to peanut within 60&#x000a0;min of ingestion or a positive DBPCOFC to peanut below 2 cumulated g will be included.</p><p>Sensitization is proved by a positive skin prick test (SPT) (3&#x000a0;mm over the negative control) and/or a serum specific IgE level over 12&#x000a0;IU/mL for peanut or over 5.8&#x000a0;IU/mL for Ara h2 recombinant fraction to peanut.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Exclusion criteria</title><p>Patients with a history of severe peanut anaphylaxis requiring hospitalization in an intensive care unit, participants with severe persistent asthma or poorly controlled atopic dermatitis, or those with another concomitant severe food allergy (egg, milk, nuts, and so on) will be excluded, as will patients affected by lactose intolerance or sunflower allergy.</p><p>Participants who tolerate more than 2 cumulated g of peanut during the initial DBPCFC or those with an allergic reaction occurring below an intake of 100 cumulated mg peanut will not be included. Patients unable to follow a daily intake of capsules or to fill in a daily recording of clinical signs were not included as well as those living more far from a reference center to assume management of an acute reaction within 15&#x000a0;min, and those attending another clinical trial. The occurrence of a severe adverse event will lead to exclusion by the investigator or the expert committee.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Randomizations</title><p>After the initial DBPCOFC, attribution of active treatment (peanut) or placebo will be done by a first randomization (R1) at a ratio treatment/placebo of 2:1. Stratification will be performed every six participants. For the second randomization (R2), the ratio between the two groups will be set at 1:1. Randomizations will be stratified by location due to the multisite nature of the study.</p><p>Each patient will be identified by an identification number consisting of the number of permanent investigation center and an individual patient number. The patient number will be assigned chronologically on the randomization list. A comprehensive document describing the randomization procedure will be kept as confidential at the Children Clinical Research Centre, INSERM CIC 1405.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Procedures and interventions</title><p>Adolescents will be recruited from the pediatric allergy unit in the University Hospital, Clermont-Ferrand, France and from the pediatric departments of Saint-Etienne and Lyon hospitals.</p><p>In an education session, the patients and their parents will learn how to recognize food allergy symptoms, to evaluate their severity, and to use the rescue medications and self-injectable epinephrine.</p><p>A first DBPCOFC is managed according to national recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. It consists in the intake of incremental doses of peanut or placebo according to a randomized plan. A food challenge is declared positive as soon as an objective reaction occurs. At this time discontinuation and management of the clinical reaction should be considered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Blind is released after the second day of challenge. Patients with a peanut allergy threshold above 100&#x000a0;mg and below 2&#x000a0;g cumulative intake of peanut are included in the build-up phase.</p><p>During the build-up phase, doses will be administered by gradual up-dosing from 10&#x000a0;mg to 2&#x000a0;g of peanut with 2-weekly increments. Experimental treatment will consist in administration of doses of either peanut or placebo provided by the pharmacy department. The raw material of the peanut treatment is a mixture of peanuts (95.7%) and sunflower oil (4.3%), supplied by MENGUYS &#x000a9;. A certificate of alimentary confirmed the food as suitable for human diet. The doses contain 10&#x000a0;mg to 500&#x000a0;mg of peanut. Placebo will be similarly prepared and comprise the same raw material except for the peanut paste. The participants should take the treatment in the morning. Practice of any sport is prohibited for 2&#x000a0;h. During the protocol, adverse events and rescue medications are picked up in the patient&#x02019;s paper diary. They are quoted according to Ring and Messmer classification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In the event of a grade 1 reaction occurring during the build-up phase, the increments process will not be modified. If a grade 2 or 3 without anaphylaxis reaction occurs, the level of peanut intake may be maintained for three additional periods of 2&#x000a0;weeks, that is, for a maximum duration of 8&#x000a0;weeks. In all cases symptomatic drugs will be prescribed, depending on the severity of the reaction, H1 antihistamines in cases of a mild reaction (urticaria, rhinitis, conjunctivitis, oral syndrome, acute abdominal pain, and so on), inhaled betamimetics in cases of bronchospasm, and systemic steroids and epinephrine in cases of grade 3 or 4 reaction (systemic anaphylaxis, anaphylactic shock). In the event of a grade 3 adverse reaction without anaphylactic shock, disruption should be considered. Grade 3 with anaphylactic shock and grade 4 reactions should lead to questioning the independent committee and excluding the patient. During the entire protocol, the patients are allowed to take any medication including inhaled steroids and antihistamines if needed.</p><p>During the maintenance phase, children will receive a 2&#x000a0;g package of crushed peanut of the same origin. Clinical follow-up is performed in the investigation center every 4&#x000a0;weeks. A third DBPCOFC is performed 6&#x000a0;weeks after the end of this maintenance phase of 13 versus 37&#x000a0;weeks&#x02019; duration, depending on second randomization. Finally, a fourth DBPCOFC is performed after a 6-month period where diet is free, peanut intake is freely recommended. During the entire protocol, participants will follow a diet consisting of avoidance of peanut. A weekly meeting involving all investigators allows defining the management of adverse events and the protocol&#x02019;s achievements. Discontinuation of the protocol can be decided at any time by the investigator or the patient, and is mandatory when ordered by the independent data monitoring safety committee.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Complementary investigations</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>In vivo tests</title><p>Skin prick tests to peanut will be performed before each DBPCOFC, including a positive (histamine hydrochlorhydre 10&#x000a0;mg/mL) and a negative (saline solution) control.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>In vitro tests</title><p>The immunological profile will be monitored during the protocol before each DBPCOFC.

The aim of this new mode of treatment is to reduce severe reactions after unwitting ingestion of peanut and to improve quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The mechanism by which induced tolerance to food allergy works is still a subject of debate, as is the route of application of the allergen. Greater safety has been achieved since the adoption of slow increases in the increments of doses but as the treatment is still in its infancy stages it is not yet used in daily practice. In 2012 a Cochrane data analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] validated only one double-blind versus placebo study. In this study, most patients were children. However, adolescents are a population at risk in terms of serious adverse events and reduced quality of life. The incidence of accidents subsequent to unexpected intake remains high [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] at this age. In addition, spontaneous resolution of peanut allergy is unlikely after the age of 12&#x000a0;years.</p><p>As far as avoidance remains the sole treatment, its practice is hazardous. The term &#x02018;traces&#x02019; is commonly used on the labels of various foods. Its definition, however, remains unclear and varies according to countries. Since there are very few trials about oral immunotherapy for peanut allergy in children, there is no well-admitted method on doing such trial. In particular, the threshold to assess peanut tolerance is of importance. We chose the threshold of 2&#x000a0;g of peanut because it allows a security gap in relation to trace levels and is consistent with normal daily eating habits. This means that any amount over 2&#x000a0;g (4 peanuts), which is a common level of intake in West European countries, is not allowed. The patients who adhere to the protocol will improve their daily quality of life and reduce the risk of severe reactions after unwitting intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Inclusion criteria were drawn up on the basis of previous studies (unpublished observations): the wheal size of SPT is commonly accepted to be positive when greater than 3&#x000a0;mm. The threshold (PPV 100%) of specific IgE (over 12&#x000a0;IU/mL) and the ara h2 recombinant fraction of peanut were studied in a local population of children allergic to peanut.</p><p>Adverse events will be recorded and managed. If serious unexpected events occur, the independent security committee will decide on whether to suspend the protocol. The mechanisms involved in desensitization and tolerance induction will be investigated.</p><p>During the build-up and maintenance phases, patients will be asked to retain a strict avoidance of peanut. However, certain co-morbidity factors could interfere with the evolution of peanut allergy under peanut induction of tolerance, in particular associated food allergies, quality of control of asthma, and infectious concomitant diseases. There will be a 6-month follow-up period after the end of the protocol during which the patients will remain under observation in the outpatient clinic. We shall compare the two duration periods of the maintenance phase in our protocol with those of previous publications. The behavior of patients who are scheduled to return to a non-restricted diet is also an unknown factor. All patients will be invited to go on eating daily reasonable amounts of peanut. One cannot expect that all patients will behave similarly in terms of daily diet. DBPCOFC 4 will feed this debate.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Trial status</title><p>Recruitment started from September 2013 to December 2015.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ANSM</term><def><p>Agence Nationale de Securit&#x000e9; du Medicament</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CRF</term><def><p>case report forms</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DBPCOFC</term><def><p>double-blind placebo-controlled oral food challenge</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OFC</term><def><p>oral food challenge</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SPT</term><def><p>skin prick test</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>JLF is the overall study principal investigator; EM, EMe, and JLF followed the adolescents during the study.
