While surgery is effective in mild and moderate cases, nerve and functional recovery are often not complete in severe cases. Therefore, there is a need for adjuvant methods to improve nerve regeneration in those cases. Acetyl-L-carnitine (ALCAR) is involved in lipid transport, vital for mitochondrial function. Although it has been shown to be effective in various forms of neuropathies, it has not been used in traumatic or compressive peripheral nerve injury.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In this pilot study we will utilize a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled design. Inclusion criteria will include adult patients with severe CTS. This will be confirmed by nerve conduction studies and motor unit number estimation (MUNE). Only those with severe motor unit loss in the thenar muscles (2 standard deviations [SD] below the mean for the age group) will be included. Eligible patients will be randomized to receive 3,000&#x000a0;mg/day of ALCAR orally or placebo following carpal tunnel release surgery for 2&#x000a0;months. The primary outcome will be MUNE with supplementary secondary outcome measures that include: 1) two-point discrimination; 2) Semmes-Weinstein monofilaments for pressure sensitivity; 3) cold and pain threshold for small fiber function; 4) Boston self-assessment Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire and 5) Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaire for symptom severity; and 6) Purdue Pegboard Test for hand functional performance. To follow post treatment recovery and monitor safety, patients will be seen at 3&#x000a0;months, 6&#x000a0;months and 1&#x000a0;year. The outcome measures will be analyzed using two-way ANOVA, with treatment assignment and time points being the independent factors. If significant associations are detected, a post hoc analysis will be completed. We aim to recruit ten patients into each of the two groups.

Based on the clinical assessment of 3,000 randomly chosen individuals in Sweden, the prevalence of confirmed CTS was almost 3&#x000a0;% in the general population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Of those, 25&#x000a0;% had severe symptoms and nerve injury that could not be sufficiently managed through conservative means [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The large number of afflicted individuals poses a major healthcare cost and social economic burden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Indeed, it is estimated that up to half a million patients undergo surgery for CTS each year in the United States with an associated healthcare cost that exceeds $2 billion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Therefore, much effort has been spent on attempts to improve treatment outcomes. Although conservative measures such as wrist splinting can be effective in milder cases, surgery is needed to relieve pressure on the median nerve when conservative measures fail. However, even with surgery, the outcome in more severe cases in which substantial axonal degeneration has already occurred remains poor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. One major reason is that even though injured nerve fibers have an inherent ability to regenerate, the regeneration proceeds very slowly with rates of only 1&#x000a0;mm/day in ideal circumstances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The regenerative capacity of axons and the Schwann cell (SC) growth support decline with time and distance from injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>To improve the speed and extent of nerve regeneration, novel treatment strategies are being explored. While decompression surgery is useful in alleviating further mechanical injury to the median nerve, it does little to influence the underlying molecular mechanisms of peripheral nerve regeneration. Although a number of potential therapeutic agents including FK506 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], geldanamycin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and fibroblast growth factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] have been studied, their safety and tolerability for human application have challenges. In contrast, acetyl-L-carnitine (ALCAR) has an excellent safety track record for human use. It is a naturally occurring molecule that acts as an acetyl donor group that is critical for lipid transport and the maintaining of mitochondrial function. In vitro studies showed that ALCAR promoted cerebellar neuronal maturation and increased peripheral nerve regeneration in animal studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. These findings prompted the evaluation of ALCAR in various neuropathies to improve nerve regeneration. Clinical conditions studied include antiretroviral toxic neuropathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], diabetic neuropathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and chemotherapy-induced neuropathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Those studies showed that patients treated with ALCAR have less pain and better motor and sensory function. While this data is encouraging, the use of ALCAR in patients with compressive neuropathies remains largely untested. In an animal study, Kotil et al. found histopathological evidence of improvement when ALCAR was administered on its own or with concomitant decompression surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The only human study to date that includes compression neuropathies was primarily designed to examine the tolerability of ALCAR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. However, evidence of nerve regeneration was not a primary objective of that study.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Objective</title><p>The objective of the trial is to determine the efficacy of ALCAR on nerve regeneration in patients with severe CTS.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Hypothesis</title><p>ALCAR will significantly increase motor axonal regeneration, improve sensory function and more rapidly resolve CTS symptoms.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Basic trial design</title><p>This double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial has received ethics approval from the University of Alberta Health Ethics Research Board (Pro00045538).

A randomization sequence will be generated electronically and kept by a statistician not directly involved in patient care. Randomization will be kept on a computer under password encryption. The randomization code will only be broken if a patient experiences a severe adverse event. At the end of the study the statistician will provide the research team with the randomization codes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Blinding</title><p>The study will be administered in a double-blind manner. The randomization sequence will be kept confidential and only accessible to authorized personnel. The pharmacy will distribute identical pills in bottles labeled with A or B. The research team will be unaware of which contains the study drug or placebo. This will be maintained until the final follow-up has occurred, at which point the research team will be unblinded.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Primary outcome</title><p>The primary endpoint will be motor axon reinnervation in the thenar muscles. This will be done using MUNE, a non-invasive electrophysiological technique. Initially introduced in the 1970s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], multipoint stimulation, the most commonly used MUNE technique, has been shown to be a reliable test for measuring motor axon reinnervation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Apart from providing an objective assessment of large myelinated nerve fibers, MUNE will also serve as a screening tool for eligibility for the trial. To quantify treatment response, MUNE will be repeated at 3, 6 and 12&#x000a0;months post-operatively.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Secondary outcomes</title><p>Secondary outcomes of the study focus on sensory function restoration and functional outcomes. Measures will include:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Two-point discrimination (A&#x003b2; fibers) using Dellon-MacKinnon Disk</p></list-item><list-item><p>Pressure sensitivity (A&#x003b2; fibers) using Semmes-Weinstein monofilament</p></list-item><list-item><p>Cold threshold (A&#x003b4; fibers) and pain threshold (C fibers) using CASE IV quantitative sensory testing (QST) equipment</p></list-item><list-item><p>Boston CTS Questionnaire to monitor symptom severity</p></list-item><list-item><p>Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaire for functional outcomes</p></list-item><list-item><p>Moberg Pick-up Test to measure hand dexterity and functional performance</p></list-item></list></p><p>All outcome measures will be monitored at baseline, 3&#x000a0;months, 6&#x000a0;months and 12&#x000a0;months. Sensory testing of peripheral nerves provides more of a challenge, given the multiple fiber types that provide sensory feedback. The above list of tests is designed to capture the full range of sensory fiber functions. A major advantage of QST is that it provides an objective means of measuring the function of different classes of nerve fibers with good reliability. The DASH and the Boston questionnaires used to evaluate symptom severity are both well validated in CTS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Finally, to objectively measure hand functional performance, the Moberg Pick-up Test is a validated tool for CTS with good reliability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. All primary and secondary outcome measures will be performed by the same investigators (MC, KMC). To verify the inter-rater reliability of these tests, a subset of patients will undergo separate assessment by two investigators independently in a blinded manner.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Interventions</title><p>Patients will be assigned to either the placebo or ALCAR arm of the study. Both placebo and ALCAR will be fabricated by the same pharmaceutical company (Sigma-Tau, Rome, Italy). They are identical in appearance and taste. Upon arrival, the tablets will be packaged by the pharmacy into identical boxes labeled with a random sequence code. Both groups will undergo open carpal tunnel release without epineurolysis performed by experienced hand surgeons (JO, MM). Post-operatively, patients will take the medications for 2&#x000a0;months. Patients randomized to the ALCAR arm will take 3,000&#x000a0;mg orally divided in three times per day dosing, while the control group will take a matched placebo. The dosing schedule for the study drug was chosen based on previous work by Bianchi et al. (2005) that showed good tolerability and efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Sample size</title><p>Initially, a pilot study of 20 patients will be carried out. Evaluation of the effect size will be based on the primary outcome MUNE. This will provide the necessary data for the sample size calculation for a fully powered large-scale study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Demographic data will be compiled and analyzed for differences using a Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic>-test and Fisher&#x02019;s exact test. The primary and secondary outcome measures will be analyzed using two-way ANOVA with the treatment groups and time points being the independent factors. If significant associations are detected, a post hoc analysis will be done for pairwise comparisons. Due to the exploratory nature of the study, sample size calculations and formal analysis of missing data will not be undertaken.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Safety and potential risks</title><p>To monitor any potential adverse events, rigorous safety measures have been put in place to ensure patient safety.

Safety lab tests including blood chemistries will be done at screening, and periodically during follow-up visits. In addition, an electrocardiogram will be done at screening. The serum ALCAR level will also be monitored. In healthy subjects, the serum ALCAR levels had a range of 10&#x02013;70&#x000a0;&#x003bc;mol/L with a mean of 39&#x000a0;&#x003bc;mol/L. In a large study of over 333 patients with diabetic neuropathy taking 3&#x000a0;g of ALCAR/day (the same dose used in this study), the rise in serum level was only around 50&#x000a0;% compared to baseline. Since no sign of ALCAR toxicity was observed in any of the subjects, we anticipate that the chances of toxic effects in this study will be very small.</p><p>All adverse events will be documented at follow-up visits. Further laboratory investigations will be done depending on the nature and severity of the adverse events reported.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Trial management</title><p>The trial will be managed by a trial steering committee in accordance with Good Clinical Practice guidelines. The principle investigator, K. Ming Chan (KMC), will be primarily responsible for the overall trial functioning with assistance from Matthew Curran (MC).

It has been shown to be beneficial in a number of disease states including oligospermia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], hepatic encephalopathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] and dysthymia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. It has also been shown to have a positive impact on central and peripheral nervous system diseases. It can reverse signs of aging in rat brains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. In peripheral neuropathies it is thought that ALCAR enhances nerve growth factor receptor binding, allowing for neurite outgrowth through the ERK pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. This effect has been demonstrated in diabetic neuropathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and antiretroviral toxic neuropathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. ALCAR is very well tolerated. Large trials have shown minimal side effects. Its practicality is further enhanced by the fact that the drug is active in oral preparation.</p><sec id="Sec19"><title>Strengths</title><p>Vigorous measures have been built into the study design. To prevent potential bias, we utilize a double-blinded, placebo-controlled design. To further reinforce this, data entry and review will be handled by a monitoring committee that will be working at arm&#x02019;s length from the investigators who are directly interacting with the study subjects. Surgery will be performed by two experienced surgeons using a standardized technique for carpal tunnel release. To measure the effects of the therapeutic agent on nerve regeneration, we will be using MUNE as the primary outcome measure. This provides a physiological measure that can be directly compared with the data from animal studies. In addition, the protocol will also incorporate tests to provide comprehensive information on the full range of sensory nerve fibers.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Limitations</title><p>A potential limitation of our study is generalizability of the results. Since we will be deliberately focusing on only CTS patients with severe motor axonal loss, the results may not be applicable to those with mild and moderate disease. However, since severe carpal tunnel patients have the lowest potential for recovery even with surgery, it would be important to target this population. A second limitation of the study is that it is likely underpowered. However, since no prior studies on the effect size and variability of ALCAR in compressive neuropathy are available, data from this pilot study will be very useful in designing a full-scale study. The multiple comparisons would also reduce the statistical power of the study. Since this is meant to serve as an exploratory study, these considerations are not of primary concern.</p><p>Here we present a phase II randomized control trial design to determine the role of ALCAR in peripheral nerve regeneration in CTS. This is the first human study that looks at the efficacy of ALCAR in patients with compressive neuropathy. If effective, ALCAR will represent an important adjuvant therapy for patients with CTS. By improving motor and sensory recovery, patients could potentially return to their work and daily routines more quickly.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Trial status</title><p>Currently recruiting NCT02141035.</p></sec></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ALCAR</term><def><p>acetyl-L-carnitine</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ANOVA</term><def><p>analysis of variance</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CTS</term><def><p>carpal tunnel syndrome</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EMG</term><def><p>electromyography</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>JO</term><def><p>Jaret Olson</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>KMC</term><def><p>K.
