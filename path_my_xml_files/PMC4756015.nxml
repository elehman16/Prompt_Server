patients and determine its effects on respiratory function. [Subjects and Methods]
Twenty-one stroke patients were studied. Subjects were divided into a control group
(control group, n=11) who did not undergo thoracic and cervical joint mobilization, and an
experimental group (thoracic and cervical mobilization group, n=10) who underwent thoracic
and cervical joint mobilization. Forced vital capacity and forced expiratory volume in the
first second, well-known indicators of respiratory capabilities, were measured. Peak cough
flow was measured as an indicator of cough capability. [Results] After the exercise,
respiratory function in the thoracic and cervical mobilization group showed statistically
significant improvements demonstrated by increases in forced vital capacity, forced
expiratory volume in the first second, and peak cough flow. [Conclusion] The findings
indicate that thoracic and cervical mobilization can improve the thoracic movements of
stroke patients resulting in improved pulmonary function.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Thoracic and cervical mobilization</kwd><kwd>Stroke</kwd><kwd>Pulmonary function</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Addressing pulmonary function disorders is the most important measure in maintaining
quality of life in stroke patients, especially in those who experience asymmetrical
breathing due to impairment of respiratory muscles (such as the diaphragm) on the affected
side<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup> and abnormal thoracic
extension<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Impaired pulmonary function
limits physical activities<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>, and
compromises pulmonary hygiene due to the inappropriate removal of mucus inside the airway,
inducing complications such as pneumonia<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Abnormal respiratory function reduces forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume
in the first second (FEV<sub>1</sub>), and peak cough flow (PCF)<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Methods used to increase respiratory ability include
stretching the pectoralis major<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>,
pursed-lip breathing<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>, and inspiratory
muscular training<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Among stroke patients undergoing rehabilitation, trunk mobility is essential to balance
recovery<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Reduced trunk mobility and
thoracic space can lead to reduced respiratory function. Consequently, thoracic mobilization
may increase trunk mobility<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.Thoracic
movements are related to cervical movements<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, thoracic and cervical mobilization may increase trunk
mobility, improving respiratory function. However, few studies have examined the
relationship between thoracic and cervical mobilization and respiratory function in stroke
patients.</p><p>This study aimed to conduct thoracic and cervical mobilization in stroke patients and to
determine its effect on respiratory function.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects were 21 stroke patients admitted to M Rehabilitation Hospital in Daegu
Metropolitan City, South Korea. The purpose and scope of the study was explained, and
informed consent was obtained according to the ethical standards of the Declaration of
Helsinki. The study was conducted from June to August 2015. Subject selection was based on
the following: no previous respiratory disease, no diagnosis of lung disease based on
radiography and physical examination, and no cognitive dysfunction (i.e., MMSE-K scores
exceeding 24) that could lead to impaired cooperation (i.e., due to severe aphasia or
dementia). A physiotherapist blinded to the assessment results entered all demographic data
into a computer program designed to perform stratified randomization. Pre-randomization
stratification was based on gender and hemiplegic side. Subjects were randomly divided into
a control group (CG, n = 11), whose members did not undergo thoracic and cervical joint
mobilization, and an experimental group (TCMG, n = 10), whose members underwent thoracic and
cervical joint mobilization.</p><p>Subjects underwent one intervention per week for 4 weeks. Both groups were simultaneously
given physiotherapy treatments consisting of 30&#x02005;min of exercise, 15&#x02005;min of rehabilitation
ergometer training, and 15&#x02005;min of functional electrical stimulation. Additionally, members
of the TCMG had 30&#x02005;min of thoracic and cervical joint mobilization.</p><p>During thoracic mobilization, subjects were seated on a height-adjustable therapeutic table
and asked to cross their arms. The therapist conducted flexion, extension, lateral flexion,
and thoracic rotation while wrapping the patient&#x02019;s crossed arms with the therapist&#x02019;s left
hand, and the therapist&#x02019;s right hand on the patient&#x02019;s thoracic vertebrae. Movement of the
vertebrae was checked using the right hand<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Cervical joint mobilization followed. Subjects remained on the same table and in the same
posture. The therapist wrapped the right arm around the patient&#x02019;s face, up to the back of
the patient&#x02019;s neck, and put the hand on the segment to be mobilized. The segmental spinous
process just below the segment to be mobilized was fixed with the left hand using the index
finger and thumb. Mobilization was conducted using the right hand<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Respiratory function was measured using a pulmonary function calculator in a micro
spirometer (Micro Medical Ltd., UK). The FVC and FEV<sub>1 </sub>were measured while sitting
on the table. We defined FVC as the amount of air that can be forcibly exhaled from the
lungs after taking the deepest breath possible; additionally, we defined FEV<sub>1</sub> as
the volume of air that can be forced out in one second after taking the deepest breath
possible. A mean value was recorded after three measurements for each test.</p><p>PCF was measured using a peak flow meter (Cardinal Health 232 Ltd., UK) to measure cough
capability. The subjects assumed the same posture as previously described, taking breaths as
deep as possible followed by forcibly coughing as strongly as possible. A mean value was
recorded after three measurements for each test.</p><p>A paired t-test was conducted to compare changes in the values of respiratory and cough
function according to the length of time the groups had undergone mobilization. To test
statistical significance, the significance level was set to 0.05. The results, which were
statistically processed using PASW 18.0 for Windows, are expressed as mean and standard
deviations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Ten of the subjects were in the TCMG and 11 were in the CG. The general characteristics of

caused by reduced trunk mobility. This study sought to determine the effects of thoracic and
cervical joint mobilization on respiratory capabilities of stroke patients.</p><p>FVC and FEV<sub>1</sub>, are well-known indicators of respiratory capabilities; stroke
patients are known to have low FVC and FEV<sub>1</sub> values due to damage sustained by the
central nervous system&#x02019;s respiratory system regulators<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. In a previous study, the
FVC values of healthy male and female subjects were 3,600&#x02005;mL and 2,500&#x02005;mL, respectively,
while their FEV<sub>1</sub> values were 2,500&#x02005;mL and 1,800&#x02005;mL, respectively<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Comparatively, our study subjects had
lower FVC and FEV<sub>1</sub> values. This suggests that stroke patients needed appropriate
intervention to improve their respiratory functions.</p><p>The TCMG showed improved FVC and FEV<sub>1</sub>following the exercise, indicating that
thoracic and cervical mobilization can improve the respiratory function of stroke patients.
Thoracic mobilization increases facet joint sliding in the thoracic vertebrae and normalizes
the joint capsule, thereby improving thoracic flexibility while expanding the thorax<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Stroke patients have reduced thoracic
mobility<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Mobilization exercises help
facilitate thoracic movement during inhalation, increasing thoracic expansion and improving
pulmonary function.</p><p>Biomechanically, cervical and thoracic movements are related. Abnormal thoracic movements
can induce cervical dysfunction<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>, and
thoracic mobilization can increase cervical range of motion and reduce cervical pain<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, not only has the cervical or
thoracic spine been treated to correct deformation or relieve pain, but concurrent
mobilization of the cervical and thoracic spine has also been attempted in recent years<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. A recent report states that abnormal
cervical and thoracic posture&#x02014;such as a forward-leaning head and kyphosis&#x02014;are related in
stroke patients<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. This study treated the
cervical and thoracic spine concurrently, inducing thoracic expansion and increased
pulmonary capability through an effective increase in movement.</p><p>Impaired cough capability following a stroke can trigger a higher incidence of aspiration
and reduced cleaning ability in the cilia of the mucosa, increasing chest infection
susceptibility<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. A PCF of 300 l/min or
higher is typical among healthy persons. At 160&#x02013;270 l/min, patients are vulnerable to viral
infections. At less than 160 l/min, the self-cleaning action of the muco-ciliary pathways
may be significantly impeded<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
subjects had PCF lower than 160 l/min., thus indicating low cough capability. Thus,
appropriate intervention is required to improve their cough capabilities. To improve cough
capability, patients need to strengthen expiratory muscles, have an appropriate inhalation
ability prior to cough, and have the ability to maintain a small airway to increase
intrathoracic pressure<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. The exercises
used in this study can increase thoracic movement, helping patients inhale appropriately
prior to coughing. These exercises can also facilitate expiratory muscle (e.g., the
abdominal muscles) lengthening prior to contraction, increasing cough capability.</p><p>The finding sindicate that these exercises improve thoracic movement, resulting in improved
pulmonary and cough function. Pulmonary function is crucial to stroke patients. Future
research on improvements in the pulmonary function of stroke patients is needed. A
multifaceted study on trunk movements, posture, and respiratory functions should be
undertaken.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by the 2015 Gimcheon University Research Grant.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Agnarsson</surname><given-names>U</given-names></name><name><surname>Thorgeirsson</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Sigvaldason</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Effects of leisure-time physical activity and ventilatory
