The vaccine contains recombinant fusion proteins consisting of allergen-derived peptides and the hepatitis B surface protein domain preS as immunological carrier.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled AIT study to determine safety, clinical efficacy and immunological mechanism of three subcutaneous injections of three BM32 doses adsorbed to aluminum hydroxide versus aluminum hydroxide (placebo) applied monthly to grass pollen allergic patients (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;70). Primary efficacy endpoint was the difference in total nasal symptom score (TNSS) through grass pollen chamber exposure before treatment and 4&#x000a0;weeks after the last injection. Secondary clinical endpoints were total ocular symptom score (TOSS) and allergen-specific skin response evaluated by titrated skin prick testing (SPT) at the same time points. Treatment-related side effects were evaluated as safety endpoints. Changes in allergen-specific antibody, cellular and cytokine responses were measured in patients before and after treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Sixty-eight patients completed the trial. TNSS significantly decreased with mean changes of &#x02212;&#x000a0;1.41 (BM32/20&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g) (P&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.03) and &#x02212;&#x000a0;1.34 (BM32/40&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g) (P&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.003) whereas mean changes in the BM32/10&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g and placebo group were not significant. TOSS and SPT reactions showed a dose-dependent decrease. No systemic immediate type side effects were observed. Only few grade 1 systemic late phase reactions occurred in BM32 treated patients. The number of local injection site reactions was similar in actively and placebo-treated patients. BM32 induced highly significant allergen-specific IgG responses (P&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.0001) but no allergen-specific IgE.

However, current forms of AIT based on natural allergen extracts, induce side effects, require multiple administrations, inconvenient up-dosing protocols and thus patients compliance is poor. Our study is the first to investigate the effects of vaccination with a B cell epitope-based recombinant allergy vaccine in patients who were exposed to grass pollen in a pollen chamber. The vaccine contains recombinant fusion proteins consisting of allergen-derived peptides bound to a hepatitis B virus surface antigen as immunological carrier. It is demonstrated that three injections of the recombinant B cell epitope-based allergy vaccine are well tolerated and protect allergic patients against allergic symptoms by induction of allergen-specific IgG antibody responses without inducing allergic sensitization. Thus recombinant hypoallergenic B cell epitope-based vaccines have potential to improve safety and convenience of AIT when used as therapeutic vaccine and, due to low allergenicity, may be used even for prophylactic allergy vaccination.</p></abstract><kwd-group id="ks0005"><title>Key words</title><kwd>Vaccine</kwd><kwd>Grass pollen</kwd><kwd>B cell-epitope</kwd><kwd>Challenge chamber</kwd><kwd>Immunotherapy</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s0005"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p>Allergen-specific immunotherapy (AIT) is the only disease-modifying treatment for allergy which prevents the progression of allergic rhinitis towards asthma (<xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">Larch&#x000e9; et al., 2006</xref>, <xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">Jacobsen et al., 2007</xref>). Clinical and immunological effects of AIT are long-lasting, even after discontinuation (<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">Durham et al., 1999</xref>). Furthermore, AIT has a cost-saving effect when compared to symptomatic drug treatment (<xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">Hankin and Cox, 2014</xref>). However, several factors limit the broad application of AIT. Current allergy vaccines are based on natural allergen extracts which are often of poor quality (e.g., varying allergen compositions, lack of important allergens, contaminations) and may induce severe immediate and late phase side effects (<xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">Focke et al., 2008</xref>, <xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">Casset et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bb0235" ref-type="bibr">Winther et al., 2006</xref>, <xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">Focke et al., 2010</xref>). Accordingly current treatment schedules require inconvenient, multiple administrations of gradually increasing doses and, in sensitive patients, the therapeutically effective maintenance dose often cannot be reached due to side effects. As a result, the real-life adherence to AIT is low (<xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">Kiel et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Progress made regarding the molecular characterization of the disease-causing allergens has now opened the door for new forms of allergen-specific immunotherapy which allow reduced side effects and targeting of specific pathways of the allergic immune response (<xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">Niederberger et al., 2004</xref>, <xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">Creticos et al., 2006</xref>, <xref rid="bb0220" ref-type="bibr">Valenta et al., 2010</xref>). We have developed a strategy for AIT (i.e., B cell epitope-based allergy vaccines) which is based on fusion proteins consisting of non-allergenic peptides which are derived from the IgE binding sites of disease-causing allergens but do not bind IgE themselves and PreS, a surface protein from hepatitis B which serves as a non-allergenic carrier protein providing T cell help (<xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">Focke-Tejkl et al., 2015</xref>). The allergen-derived peptides used for the construction of the B cell epitope-based allergy vaccines lack IgE reactivity and therefore do not induce IgE-mediated side effects but focus blocking allergen-specific IgG towards the IgE binding sites of the allergen. In the vaccine allergen-specific T cell epitopes are reduced as much as possible (<xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">Focke-Tejkl et al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bb0175" ref-type="bibr">Niederberger et al., 2015</xref>) because, when present in previously engineered hypoallergenic allergen derivatives, they were found to cause late phase side effects (<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">Campana et al., 2015</xref>). In the B cell epitope-based allergy vaccine concept the T cell help for the induction of allergen-specific IgG antibodies comes from T cell epitopes of the non-allergenic PreS carrier protein (<xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">Focke-Tejkl et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Since grass pollen is one of the most important allergen sources world-wide and causes severe respiratory manifestations in allergic patients (<xref rid="bb0210" ref-type="bibr">Suphioglu et al., 1992</xref>), we constructed a grass pollen vaccine consisting of four recombinant derivatives of the four major timothy grass pollen allergens (i.e., Phl p 1, Phl p 2, Phl p 5, Phl p 6) based on the B cell epitope-based strategy. It has been demonstrated that with a combination of these four timothy grass pollen allergens all grass pollen allergic patients can be diagnosed (<xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">Linhart et al., 2005</xref>, <xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">Hatzler et al., 2012</xref>). The hypoallergenic peptides incorporated in the grass pollen allergy vaccine have been identified in combined approaches using epitope mapping and structural analyses of the allergens (<xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">Focke et al., 2001</xref>, <xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">Focke-Tejkl et al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">Focke-Tejkl et al., 2015</xref>). The <italic>in vitro</italic> immunological characterization, experimental animal data and a safety skin test study performed in grass pollen allergic patients indicated that the vaccine lacks allergenic activity and has the potential to induce allergen-specific IgG antibodies upon vaccination, which compete with allergic patients IgE antibodies for the binding sites on the natural allergens (<xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">Focke-Tejkl et al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bb0175" ref-type="bibr">Niederberger et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The current double-blind, placebo-controlled study was designed as a safety and dose-finding study carried out in the Vienna Challenge Chamber (VCC) to investigate the underlying immunological mechanisms and potential clinical effects of the B cell epitope-based grass pollen allergy vaccine in allergic patients for the first time.</p></sec><sec id="s0010"><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec id="s0015"><label>2.1</label><title>Patients, inclusion and exclusion criteria, randomization</title><p>Adult male and female patients (18&#x02013;60 years) suffering from grass pollen-induced allergic rhinoconjunctivitis for at least two years were recruited. Grass pollen-specific sensitization was confirmed by positive skin prick test to timothy grass pollen extract as well as by the presence in serum of grass pollen-specific IgE antibodies (at least 0.7kUA/l) as demonstrated by ImmunoCAP (Thermofisher, Uppsala, Sweden). Grass pollen-specific clinical reactivity with at least moderate symptoms of allergic rhinitis (itching, sneezing, rhinorrhea, nasal obstruction) documented by a TNSS of at least 6 within the first two hours of a 6 hour screening challenge in the Vienna Challenge Chamber (VCC) were required.</p><p>Patients with unstable asthma and other intercurrent diseases like perennial allergies or structural nasal abnormalities were not eligible. A detailed list of inclusion and exclusion criteria can be found in the study protocol (supplementary data).

The randomisation lists were generated by a CRO using a block size of 4 (Software RUNCODE Version 3.6, idv Gauting). Paper listings were used for performing the randomization and number allocation. Only the data manager generating the randomisation list at the CRO was unblinded. All other personnel at the CRO conducting data management and statistical analysis were blinded. Likewise, all personnel at the study site, in the laboratories performing analyses and at the sponsor were blinded.</p><p>One subject was excluded due to abnormal laboratory values before treatment.

Any concurrent medication had to be approved by the investigator and was recorded.</p><p>The effects of vaccination on responses to grass pollen allergen challenge in the Vienna challenge chamber (VCC) and by skin testing were tested. In addition, effects of vaccination on grass pollen-specific humoral and cellular immune responses were studied in detail.

It was conducted outside the grass pollen season between October 2011 (screening) and April 2012 (data base lock). The trial was approved by the Clinical Pharmacology Ethics Committee, Vienna, Austria and by the Austrian Regulatory Agency (AGES). Written informed consent was obtained from each patient ahead of any study specific procedure, and the study was conducted according to the principles of the declaration of Helsinki and the International Conference on Harmonization of Good Clinical Practice guidelines.</p><p>Seventy eight subjects were screened and 71 were randomized to the four treatment groups (S1, S2, S3, Placebo) (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>A) (<xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).

During the 6 hour challenge, the chamber was charged with fresh air, which was cleaned, cooled, dried and then loaded with a qualitatively and quantitatively determined load of mixed grass pollen from <italic>Dactylis glomerata, Lolium perenne, Phleum pratense</italic> and <italic>Anthoxanthum odoratum</italic>. According to continuous monitoring patients were exposed to constant humidity (approximately 40%), temperature (approximately 24&#x000b0;C) and allergen loads (approximately 1500 pollen grains per cubic meter) throughout the exposure period. Patients (up to 20 per session) were under constant supervision by medical staff outside the chamber.</p><p>TNSS comprised the four components of nasal itching, sneezing, rhinorrhea and nasal congestion.

Patients completed the TNSS assessment on a touch screen monitor immediately prior to entering the chamber, and at 15 minute intervals during the 6 h allergen challenge. TOSS was evaluated accordingly. Furthermore nasal air flow was measured using active anterior rhinomanometry immediately prior to entering the chamber and at 30 minute intervals during the challenge.</p><p>A titrated skin prick test was performed in duplicates before and 4&#x000a0;weeks after treatment.

It shows that three monthly injections of a vaccine consisting of four recombinant fusion proteins combining non-allergenic peptides derived from the four major timothy grass pollen allergens, Phl p 1, 2, 5 and 6 with the hepatitis B preS protein are effective in reducing allergen-induced immediate allergic reactions as demonstrated by the reduction of TNSS, TOSS and immediate skin responses in grass pollen allergic patients. We consider the reduction of the TNSS observed after vaccination with the 20 and 40 &#x003bc;g dose of BM32 as relevant because its magnitude is comparable to that observed after administration of systemic antihistamines in the pollen chamber model (<xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">Horak et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that a one point difference in the rhinoconjunctivitis total symptom score is clinically relevant in grass pollen-induced allergic rhinoconjunctivitis (<xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">Devillier et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The study further shows that the new B cell epitope based vaccine was very well tolerated although high doses of up to 160 &#x003bc;g of the four recombinant proteins per injection were administered without any up-dosing. In fact, the previous <italic>in vitro</italic> assessment of BM32 had shown that the vaccine exhibited almost no IgE reactivity and allergenic activity when exposed to basophils of allergic patients (<xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">Focke-Tejkl et al., 2015</xref>). It was found that allergic patients failed to exhibit any relevant immediate type skin reactions even when tested at the height of the grass pollen season (<xref rid="bb0175" ref-type="bibr">Niederberger et al., 2015</xref>). We also had reduced the presence of grass allergen-specific T cell epitopes in BM32 but a complete elimination of all T cell epitopes is not possible due to the diversity of allergic patients T cell epitope recognition. However, we found that the reduction of allergen-specific T cell epitopes in the vaccine resulted in a strong reduction of T cell and pro-inflammatory cytokine responses when BM32 was tested in PBMC cultures from grass pollen allergic patients (<xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">Focke-Tejkl et al., 2015</xref>). Accordingly, no late skin responses were found in grass pollen allergic patients when BM32 was applied by atopy patch testing (<xref rid="bb0175" ref-type="bibr">Niederberger et al., 2015</xref>).The latter study indeed suggests that BM32 has a strongly reduced potential to induce late phase, T cell-mediated side effects in patients.</p><p>Here, we treated 52 patients with doses of 40&#x02013;160&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g of the four recombinant proteins and thus administered 155 injections. Given that very high doses were injected, the vaccine was very well tolerated because very few (i.e., 9 events of late phase rhinitis, 6 events of late phase cutaneous reactions, 1 late phase conjunctivitis and one late phase flushing) and mild (i.e., grade 1) late phase systemic reactions were observed. In contrast, previous &#x0201c;hypoallergenic vaccines&#x0201d; which included allergen-specific T cell epitopes frequently induced late phase reactions (<xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">Niederberger et al., 2004</xref>, <xref rid="bb0190" ref-type="bibr">Purohit et al., 2008</xref>, <xref rid="bb0205" ref-type="bibr">Spertini et al., 2014</xref>).The analyses of recombinant hypoallergenic T cell epitope-containing derivatives of the major birch pollen allergen, Bet v 1 (<xref rid="bb0190" ref-type="bibr">Purohit et al., 2008</xref>) by atopy patch testing indicated that these reactions most likely originated from T cell activation (<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">Campana et al., 2015</xref>). Likewise, it was found that a T cell epitope-containing vaccine for birch pollen allergy (AllerT) based on peptides of the major birch pollen allergen Bet v 1 frequently caused late phase reactions (<xref rid="bb0205" ref-type="bibr">Spertini et al., 2014</xref>). During the administration of 75 injections of T cell epitope-containing peptides of Bet v 1, 31 events of late phase dyspnoe and 36 late phase cutaneous reactions were observed with AllerT (<xref rid="bb0205" ref-type="bibr">Spertini et al., 2014</xref>). We therefore think that the reduction of allergen-specific T cell epitopes in BM32 and their replacement by the allergen-unrelated carrier protein PreS has contributed to the tolerability of BM32. We have already constructed several hypoallergenic derivatives for allergens from different allergen sources (e.g., cat, birch, house dust mites) using PreS as carrier protein (<xref rid="bb0180" ref-type="bibr">Niespodziana et al., 2011</xref>, Marth 2012, <xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">Banerjee et al., 2014</xref>).The <italic>in vitro</italic> and experimental animal data collected for all these derivatives suggest a similar mode of action of these vaccines. Upon injection they induce allergen-specific IgG responses towards the IgE binding sites of the corresponding allergens with T cell help derived from the PreS carrier protein. In fact our study demonstrates for the first time in humans that BM32 induces strong allergen-specific IgG responses which appear to suppress immediate type allergic reactions as shown by the reduction of TNSS upon pollen exposure and by the reduction of immediate type skin responses. The reduction of allergen-induced basophil responses after treatment indeed suggests that the treatment induced IgG antibodies which prevent the allergens from interacting with IgE on the surface of mast cells and basophils and that this may be the major underlying mechanism. This was also mirrored by results from an <italic>in vitro</italic> assay in which we measured the reduction of IgE binding by therapy-induced IgG in an IgE binding assay in which we can visualize the IgE-blocking effect of IgG using small amounts of solid phase bound allergens using allergen micro-arrays (<xref rid="f0055" ref-type="fig">Fig. 11</xref>). AIT with BM32 such as subcutaneous AIT with natural allergens reduces IgE binding to micro-arrayed allergens through induction of IgG competing with IgE for allergen binding (<xref rid="bb0240" ref-type="bibr">Wollmann et al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bb0200" ref-type="bibr">Schmid et al., 2016</xref>, <xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">Lupinek et al., 2016</xref>). The analysis of the allergen-specific isotype and subclass responses showed that BM32 mainly induced allergen-specific IgG responses (IgG<sub>1</sub>=IgG<sub>4</sub>&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;IgG<sub>2</sub>) which is similar to allergen-extract based vaccines which are in clinical use and are formulated with Aluminum hydroxide (<xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">Gadermaier et al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">Gadermaier et al., 2011</xref>) or with Th1-driving adjuvants such as monophosphoryl lipid-A (<xref rid="bb0165" ref-type="bibr">Mothes et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>We furthermore observed previously that allergen-specific IgG responses induced by PreS-based vaccines can inhibit IgE-facilitated allergen presentation to T cells in <italic>in vitro</italic> studies (<xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">Marth et al., 2013</xref>). In this study we were able to demonstrate that this mechanism, which was earlier described for AIT with natural allergens (<xref rid="bb0230" ref-type="bibr">van Neerven et al., 1999</xref>), may be also operative in BM32-treated patients. In fact, the addition of post-treatment sera containing therapy-induced allergen-specific IgG to allergens significantly suppressed allergen-induced T cell proliferation suggesting that one can obtain &#x0201c;T cell tolerance&#x0201d; with a B cell epitope-based vaccine.</p><p>Another potential advantage is that BM32 induced selectively allergen-specific IgG responses but did not induce boosts of allergen-specific IgE production. In fact, allergen extract-based but also peptide-based vaccines have been shown to induce strong boosts of allergen-specific IgE production. For example, sublingual treatment with grass pollen extract induced a five-fold increase of allergen-specific IgE production (<xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">Durham et al., 2006</xref>) and a 3-fold increase of allergen-specific IgE was found upon AIT with hypoallergenic Bet v 1-peptides (<xref rid="bb0205" ref-type="bibr">Spertini et al., 2014</xref>). While this may not be a problem for therapeutic vaccination when much larger amounts of allergen-specific IgG are induced at the same time, it may be a prohibitive feature if one considers to use a vaccine strategy for prophylactic intervention in only sensitized but not yet symptomatic children or perhaps even for the prevention of sensitization (<xref rid="bb0225" ref-type="bibr">Valenta et al., 2012</xref>). It is therefore quite possible that BM32 and B cell epitope-based vaccines constructed according to a similar principle may be especially suitable for prophylactic intervention because our data suggest that they have low IgE sensitization capacity. In fact data from experimental animal models indeed indicate that preventive vaccination with carrier-bound B cell epitope peptides can prevent allergic sensitization (<xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">Linhart et al., 2014</xref>). A general limitation in the field of AIT is that different forms of AIT (e.g., SCIT, SLIT) have not been compared in controlled clinical studies and this also applies for the present study conducted with BM32.</p><p>We also found that BM32 induced PreS-specific IgG antibodies (<xref rid="f0035" ref-type="fig">Figs. 7</xref>A, <xref rid="f0040" ref-type="fig">8</xref>E). The mapping of the PreS-specific antibody responses using synthetic PreS-derived overlapping peptides revealed that the BM32 induced IgG antibodies reacted with peptides important for the infection of hepatocytes by hepatitis B virus and also suppressed <italic>in vitro</italic> the infection of hepatocytes by hepatitis B (<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">Cornelius et al., 2016</xref>). When we analyzed sera from the present study and another AIT study conducted in grass pollen allergic patients during two years of natural grass pollen exposure (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov" id="ir0025">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> number, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="ctgov:NCT01538979" id="ir0030">NCT01538979</ext-link>) we found no difference regarding persons who have received previous HBV vaccination and persons who had not been HBV vaccinated regarding the development of HBV-specific antibody responses or adverse events. This finding together with data from hepatitis B vaccination studies conducted with PreS-containing vaccines (<xref rid="bb0195" ref-type="bibr">Rendi-Wagner et al., 2006</xref>) would even indicate that BM32 may not only protect against grass pollen allergy, but eventually also against hepatitis B infections which would offer an additional advantage (<xref rid="bb9025" ref-type="bibr">Gerlich and Glebe, 2016</xref>). Persons with HBV-infections have not yet been treated with BM32 but it is planned to study if BM32 or one of its components can be used for therapeutic and eventually prophylactic vaccination against HBV infections.</p><p>Taken together our results encourage to further evaluate BM32 in larger clinical studies for its efficacy for treating grass pollen allergic patients. Data from a phase IIb study in which more than 150 patients have been treated with BM32 for two years indeed indicate that BM32 is clinically effective for the treatment of grass pollen allergy induced by natural grass pollen exposure (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov" id="ir0035">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> number, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="ctgov:NCT01538979" id="ir0040">NCT01538979</ext-link>). The present study provides evidence for clinical efficacy after a short course of treatment in a pollen chamber setting. A limitation of our study is that we do not have data if prolonged treatment with BM32 has long-term beneficial effects on grass pollen allergy. Therefore, future studies are necessary to investigate if vaccination with BM32 has such long-term and disease-modifying effects. Furthermore, work is in progress to move B cell epitope-based vaccines for house dust mite, cat and birch pollen allergy based on the PreS-fusion protein into clinical evaluation.</p><p>The following are the supplementary data related to this article.<supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="ec0010"><caption><title>Supplemental Fig. 1</title><p>IgE reactivity of study subjects to grass pollen allergens, recombinant BM fusion proteins and PreS.
