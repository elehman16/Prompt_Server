In cats observed for 8&#x000a0;months, the lung disease consists of bronchial, interstitial, and pulmonary arterial disease. After a one-time infection, cats with HARD develop an initial positive serologic HW antibody titer and radiographic lung disease that cannot be distinguished from cats with mature adult HW infection. An eosinophilic cytology on examination of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid is observed in both cats with HARD and cats with mature adult infections. Cats with HARD continued to have radiographic lesions consistent with HW disease but 50% were HW antibody negative and had no adults on necropsy at 8&#x000a0;months PI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Unfortunately, a mistaken inference has been that cats that are infected with <italic>D. immitis</italic> and seroconvert from positive to negative represent &#x0201c;self-cure&#x0201d; with no clinical consequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].

Further, the concept of HARD associated only with immature adult infections is supported by a study of random-sourced cats at necropsy, which demonstrated cats that had pulmonary artery lesions and were serologically positive, but had no evidence of adult HWs at necropsy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par22">The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical progression and consequences of HARD 18&#x000a0;months after infection.

Consistent with the results of the 8-month study, HARD was evident on thoracic radiographs of all Group B cats by Day 240.

The HW antigen positive result was only associated with mature adult infections and was negative in cats with dying immature adults in the pulmonary arteries. In a client-owned cat which is HW antibody positive with a radiographic bronchial/interstitial lung pattern, a negative HW antibody result at a later date would be consistent with HARD, and this study suggests partial resolution of the disease can be anticipated.

In Group C cats, after adult heartworms develop, the cat and heartworm would seem to develop a stable equilibrium. Eosinophilic BAL cytology was not a consistent observation in adult heartworm infections and was more associated with the arrival and early death of immature adults. Down regulation of the pulmonary intravascular macrophage system may have a role in the decreased response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] in mature infections. Early immature pre-cardiac stages of heartworms may initiate a pulmonary response based on eosinophilic BAL cytology in all three groups in this study.

The nature of the lesions in the 8&#x000a0;month HARD group was uniform in that most airways were affected to varying degrees allowing for statistical evaluation of bronchial wall to lumen ratios. However, in the 18&#x000a0;month HARD cat lung histopathology, random areas of disease were interspersed with relatively normal areas. In every category scored (bronchus, bronchiole, alveolus/smooth muscle, arteriole, pulmonary artery), Group B cats had significantly lower mean lesion scores than Group C cats. Even in mature adult HW infections (Group C), the lesion scores of bronchi and bronchioles in the cats in the 18-month study were lower when compared with the cats with mature adult HWs in the 8-month study. This is consistent with the hypothesis that early mortality of immature adults induces the significant bronchial and vascular lesions at Day 120 in both cats that develop mature adults and in cats in which no mature adult HWs develop.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Precardiac D.

On Day 110, 50% of the cats were antibody positive and one cat continued to be antibody positive up to Day 308. The elevation of eosinophils on BAL cytology in Group A would suggest a continued pulmonary response to precardiac larvae which was not reflected in the peripheral CBC. On Day 510, the mean lung histopathology scores were not significantly different between Group A and Group B cats, although the areas of interstitial disease were more consistently observed in Group B cats. When HW prevention is introduced 28&#x000a0;days after infection, the exact point in time at which a HW larvae dies and is physically removed is unknown in the cat or the dog. Based on the initial 8-month study and this 18-month study of a single infection, when HW prevention is introduced 28&#x000a0;days PI, precardiac stages of HW larvae survive for an unknown period of time but induce a pulmonary eosinophilic BAL response, positive HW antibody titer, and myofibrocyte proliferation in the interstitial and peribronchial areas and pulmonary arterioles which can be demonstrated 18 months after infection.</p><p id="Par54">A subsequent 8-month study was initiated to address these concerns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].

Precardiac stages and death of immature <italic>D. immitis</italic> in non-cardiac areas would appear to be associated with a pulmonary reaction as evidenced by the eosinophilic BAL cytology and pulmonary myofibrocyte proliferation.

Randomly distributed histologic evidence of myofibrocyte proliferation was still present, however, 18&#x000a0;months after infection in cats and a bronchial-interstitial lung pattern was evidenced in some HARD cats on radiographic examination at Day 505 PI.
