In response to this empirical void, researchers have recently begun to adopt a more functional approach to the study of memory (e.g., Nairne, Thompson, &#x00026; Pandeirada, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2007</xref>; Otgaar, Smeets, &#x00026; van Bergen, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2010</xref>; Weinstein, Bugg, &#x00026; Roediger, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2008</xref>). Taken together, the findings of this recent research line seem to indicate that fitness-relevant processing results in superior memorability. In their original study, Nairne et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2007</xref>) asked undergraduates to imagine themselves being in a survival situation without any basic necessities and in fear of dangerous predators. Next, they received nouns (e.g., <italic>pepper</italic>, <italic>chair</italic>, <italic>catfish</italic>) that had to be rated for their relevance to the imagined situation. Finally, they were presented with a surprise free recall test. Nairne et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2007</xref>) showed that relative to control conditions in which the same words were rated from a different perspective (i.e., imagining moving, pleasantness, self-reference), recall performance was superior when the words were encoded for their fitness relevance.</p><p>Since the first publication of Nairne et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2007</xref>), the issue of adaptive memory has rapidly attracted scientific interest. More specifically, researchers have examined under what conditions the survival recall advantage persists by comparing the survival scenario with a host of known memory enhancement techniques (e.g., Kang, McDermott, &#x00026; Cohen, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2008</xref>; Nairne, Pandeirada, Gregory, &#x00026; Van Arsdall, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2009</xref>; Weinstein et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2008</xref>). To give just a few examples, Nairne, Pandeirada, and Thompson (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2008</xref>) compared the survival scenario with conditions in which participants had to rate words for imagery and self-reference, while Kang et al. used a control condition that mimicked the survival scenario with respect to arousal, novelty, and media exposure (i.e., planning a bank heist). In both studies, the mnemonic advantage of the survival scenario remained present. Moreover, this superiority was even obtained when other classes of stimuli were employed (i.e., pictures; Otgaar et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2010</xref>) or when the survival scenario was compared with a modern survival situation (i.e., surviving in the city; Nairne &#x00026; Pandeirada, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2010</xref>). Overall, these studies indicate that the survival recall effect is a robust phenomenon.</p><p>There are a few studies that could not reproduce the survival recall advantage. Klein, Robertson, and Delton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2010</xref>), for example, showed that when the survival group was contrasted with a condition in which words were encoded for future planning (i.e., rating words for relevance to planning to take a camping trip in the forest), the survival group did not demonstrate superior memory performance. Instead, recall was highest for the group that processed words for future planning (see also Klein, Robertson, &#x00026; Delton, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2011</xref>). Although Klein and colleagues explained their finding as evidence that memory has adapted to preferentially process information for future times, one could likewise argue that the survival recall advantage is subject to certain boundary conditions. Indeed, in a recent study, Otgaar and Smeets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2010</xref>) showed that processing words for their survival relevance not only prioritizes true recollection, but also promotes false recollections in both adults and children (see also Howe &#x00026; Derbish, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2010</xref>). Furthermore, Otgaar and Smeets found that the survival recall advantage disappeared when net accuracy scores were used that took the total output (i.e., true + false recall) into account. Finally, in a study by Butler, Kang, and Roediger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2009</xref>), the survival recall effect vanished when type of processing and materials were congruent with each other.When the authors presented participants in the survival condition with survival-related words (e.g., <italic>rescue</italic>, <italic>fire</italic>, <italic>shelter</italic>), no survival recall advantage emerged (but see Nairne &#x00026; Pandeirada, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2011</xref>). Collectively, these studies provide evidence that the survival recall advantage operates within certain boundaries.</p><p>At this point, only a few studies have attempted to investigate the possible causes of the survival-processing advantage. Indeed, Nairne and Pandeirada (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2008</xref>) argued that &#x0201c;[a]t this point the data say very little about the proximate mechanisms that underlie the survival advantage in memory&#x0201d; (p. 242). A viable candidate for such a proximate mechanism could be stereotype activation, the idea being that survival processing is tied in with the activation of certain stereotypes that could be beneficial to later recall performance. In stereotype activation studies, participants typically have to imagine belonging to a certain stereotype (e.g., a professor; see, e.g., Dijksterhuis &#x00026; van Knippenberg, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">1998</xref>), and the instructions used for this are comparable with the survival instruction. Specifically, stereotypes are commonly regarded as schematic knowledge structures containing several trait concepts and are known to be able to guide individuals&#x02019; behaviors. Bargh, Chen, &#x00026; Burrows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1996</xref>, <xref rid="Sec8" ref-type="sec">Experiment 2</xref>), for example, showed that participants who were primed with an elderly person stereotype walked significantly slower down the corridor when leaving the lab room than did participants who were not primed. Dijksterhuis and van Knippenberg demonstrated in their study that the activation of stereotypes also impacts intellectual performance. They showed that participants who were asked to think of a college professor and write down everything that they considered typical professor characteristics subsequently answered more Trivial Pursuit questions correctly than did no-prime control participants.</p><p>There is additional evidence that stereotype activation affects memory performance. In a study by Levy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">1996</xref>), elderly participants were primed with positive (e.g., <italic>creative</italic>, <italic>alert</italic>, <italic>wise</italic>) or negative (e.g., <italic>decline</italic>, <italic>senile</italic>, <italic>dementia</italic>) words related to the elderly. Next, they were provided with several memory tasks. As was expected, participants demonstrated improved memory performance when confronted with positive words and showed deteriorated performance when they received negative words. Furthermore, Levy showed that this effect could not be explained by mood differences. This result was replicated by Hess, Hinson, and Statham (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2004</xref>), who also found that memory performance deteriorated when participants were primed with negative stimuli. In a related study, Dijksterhuis, Aarts, Bargh, and van Knippenberg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2000</xref>) demonstrated that after being primed with an elderly person stereotype, memory performance was poor for participants who indicated having a lot of contact with the elderly, as compared with participants who reported having little contact with the elderly.</p><p>Furthermore, Van Knippenberg, Dijksterhuis, and Vermeulen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">1999</xref>) found that stereotype activation affects memory for a criminal act. In their study, a negative (i.e., hard drug addict) or positive (i.e., respectable bank employee) stereotype was activated. Then participants received information about a crime (i.e., breaking into a private home and stealing various items) in either a low processing load (i.e., self-pacing) or a high processing load (i.e., information was presented very quickly). Finally, they were tested for their memory of this criminal action. The authors found that under high load, a negative stereotype resulted in a better memory for incriminating evidence than when a positive stereotype was activated.</p><p>Altogether, these findings clearly demonstrate that stereotype activation can impact behavior (e.g., motor behavior) and, more important for our study, even memory performance. In the present study, our hypothesis was that the survival recall advantage is caused by the survival instruction&#x02019;s eliciting a strong stereotype of a person who is mentally (e.g., excellent memory, intelligent) and physically (e.g., healthy, muscular) fit to survive. Our hypothesis was that these positive mental and physical connotationslead to superior memory performance. To examine this, we conducted a pilot study and two experiments.</p><p>The goal of our pilot study was to examine whether people would think of a strong stereotype when reading the survival instruction. Thus, we asked participants to read the original survival instruction and write down the type of person they were thinking of when reading the scenario, mentioning the specific (personality or physical) characteristics associated with a person in this survival situation. These descriptions were used for the construction of a survival stereotype instruction that we employed in <xref rid="Sec8" ref-type="sec">Experiment 2</xref> (see below).</p><p>In <xref rid="Sec5" ref-type="sec">Experiment 1</xref>, we compared the standard survival condition with two stereotype conditions (a professor or an elderly person), as well as with the standard moving condition. Our reason for including a professor and elderly person stereotype was twofold. To begin with, previous stereotype activation studies have demonstrated that these stereotypes have robust memory effects (Dijksterhuis &#x00026; van Knippenberg, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">1998</xref>; Levy, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">1996</xref>). Second, we included these stereotypes because we were interested in stereotypes that could lead to better (professor) or worse (elderly person) memory performance. Thus, <xref rid="Sec5" ref-type="sec">Experiment 1</xref> explored whether a survival recall effect would still emerge when pitting the survival scenario against a strong stereotype (professor) known to enhance memory performance. In the professor stereotype condition, participants had to imagine that they were a professor specialized in the functioning of memory, while participants in the elderly person stereotype condition were instructed to imagine being an elderly person with Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease. As is typical for survival recall studies, participants subsequently were presented with words that had to be rated for their relevance to the imagined scenario and, finally, were given a surprise free recall test. We predicted that the professor stereotype group would match the recall performance ofthe standard survival group and that both conditions would also lead to higher recall levels than would the standard moving scenario. We expectedthat the newly introduced elderlyperson stereotype condition would result in the worst recall performance.</p><p>In <xref rid="Sec8" ref-type="sec">Experiment 2</xref>, the standard survival condition was contrasted with a survival stereotype and the standard moving condition. In the survival-stereotype condition, participants were asked to imagine being a person who was mentally and physically strong enough to survive. Our prediction was that this survival-stereotype condition would match the survival group and lead to higher recall than would the moving condition.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Pilot study</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Method</title><sec id="d29e373"><title>Participants</title><p>Undergraduate participants (<italic>N</italic> = 15, <italic>M</italic>

This implies that the survival recall advantage cannot be accounted for in terms of a stereotype of a robust survival person. Next, we discuss and test two alternative explanations for these findings.</p><p>One could still argue that our replication of the survival recall effect might be related to the fact that the survival scenario induces more positive traits than do the other scenarios. To test this interpretation, we presented all scenarios (survival, moving, professor, elderly, survival-stereotype) in a random order to a new sample of participants (<italic>N</italic> = 41, <italic>M</italic>
<sub>age</sub> = 21.88&#x000a0;years, <italic>SD</italic> = 3.50; 12 men) and gave them the same instructions as the ones we used in our pilot study. They had 5&#x000a0;min to provide traits for each scenario. Two raters evaluated the traits (interrater reliability,&#x003ba; = .72)</p><p>We performed a repeated measures ANOVA on the number of positive traits and found that the original survival scenario(<italic>M</italic> = 6.40, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.11) and the new survivalstereotype scenario (<italic>M</italic> = 5.60, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.98) elicited significantly more positive traits than did the moving scenario (<italic>M</italic> = 3.68, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.40), the professor condition (<italic>M</italic> = 3.38, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.48), and the elderly person condition (<italic>M</italic> = 0.98, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.21), <italic>F</italic>(4, 156) = 74.26, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; .001; <italic>&#x0014b;</italic>
<sub arrange="stack">p</sub><sup arrange="stack">2</sup> = .10 (one missing value).

We also found that the moving and professor scenarios did not vary concerning the provided positive traits (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003e; .05). Together, our findings show that the survival and survivalstereotype scenarios induced significantly more positive traits than did the other scenarios.</p><p>One could also argue that the pattern of findings reported in Experiments 1 and 2were caused by the original survival instruction being different on a number of dimensions (i.e., distinctiveness[unusualness], imagery, familiarity, richness) from the other instructions that we used in Experiments 1 and 2. Indeed, it is sometimes claimed that the survival instruction is easier to imagine and more distinctive (see Nairne &#x00026; Pandeirada, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2010</xref>) than are other scenarios thatcould promote superior retention (Hunt &#x00026; Worthen, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2006</xref>; Paivio, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2007</xref>).This is important because such dimensions as distinctiveness and imagery are known to enhance memory retention (Hunt &#x00026; Worthen, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2006</xref>; Paivio, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2007</xref>).</p><p>To examine this issue, we presented an independent group of participants (<italic>N</italic> = 19, <italic>M</italic>

Repeated measures ANOVAs on these ratings yielded the following findings.

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>General discussion</title><p>The goal of the present experiments was to investigate whether the survival recall advantage can be conceptualized in terms of survival-stereotype activation. Neither of our experiments yielded direct support for this hypothesis. In fact, we found that the survival group displayed superior retention in both experiments, even when pitting the survival group against strong stereotypes (i.e., professor, <xref rid="Sec5" ref-type="sec">Experiment 1</xref>; survival-stereotype, <xref rid="Sec8" ref-type="sec">Experiment 2</xref>). Thispattern lends further support to an interpretation of the survival recall advantage in functional &#x02014;that is, adaptive value&#x02014;terms.</p><p>Our hypothesis was that the survival instruction would elicit a strong stereotype that, in turn, would enhance recall performance. The rationale behind this was that studies consistently show that the activation of stereotypes can boost or deteriorate memory performance (e.g., Dijksterhuis et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2000</xref>). For example, priming an elderly person stereotype activates elderly-related connotations (e.g., <italic>slow</italic>, <italic>bad memory</italic>, <italic>dementia</italic>), and these,in turn, impact memory performance. Hence, we hypothesized that the survival instruction would activate a large number of positive qualities that, together, would boost memory performance. Our pilot study illustrates that the survival instruction elicits stereotypes: Participants attributed positive connotations to the survival instruction and thought mostly about traits such as <italic>intelligent</italic>, <italic>healthy</italic>, <italic>good memory</italic>, and <italic>physically strong</italic>. Furthermore, the results of Experiment 1 confirmed that stereotypes can ameliorate memory, in that the professor group displayed better memory performance, relative to the elderly person group.</p><p>We expected in <xref rid="Sec5" ref-type="sec">Experiment 1</xref> to find similar recall rates in the professor and survival groups, and we anticipated that those groups would exhibit higher recall levels than would the other groups, but this was not borne out by the data. Although stereotype activation was successful, in the sense that participants in the professor stereotype condition remembered significantly more words than did participants in the elderly person stereotype condition, we found that the survival group outperformed all other groups.</p><p><xref rid="Sec8" ref-type="sec">Experiment 2</xref> was based on the characteristics obtained in a pilot study in which we examined the associations people have when they are presented with the survival instruction. In general, people attribute positive connotations to the survival instruction.On the basis of these positive connotations, we constructed a new survival-stereotype instruction. Still, when we compared the group that was given this instruction with the standard survival group, the survival recall advantage remained intact. As in <xref rid="Sec5" ref-type="sec">Experiment 1</xref>, this result runs counter to our idea that the survival recall effect is caused by stereotype activation.</p><p>However, we also asked an independent group of participants to describe the traits that they thought of when reading all the scenarios (survival, moving, professor, elderly person, and survival-stereotype). Interestingly, we found that people described significantly more positive traits when reading the survival and survival-stereotype scenarios than when reading the other scenarios. When these data were looked at more closely, they suggested that although the survival and survivalstereotype scenarios did not differ in the number of elicited positive traits, we still found that the original survival group showed superior memory performance.Thus, the survival-processing advantage cannot be explained in terms of the number of positive traits elicited by the scenario.</p><p>In contrast to previous studies, we did not find, in the present experiments, evidence to suggest that survival scenarios enhance false recall (Otgaar &#x00026; Smeets, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2010</xref>; Otgaar et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2010</xref>; see also Howe &#x00026; Derbish, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2010</xref>).However, as we and others have noted (Howe &#x00026; Derbish, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2010</xref>; Otgaar &#x00026; Smeets, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2010</xref>), adaptive memory studies (Nairne &#x00026; Pandeirada, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2010</xref>; Nairne et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2007</xref>), such as the present one, were not specifically designed to test whether survival processing amplifies false recall. In order to test such an effect, one should preferably rely on stimuli that are specifically developed to elicit robust levels of false recall (e.g., Deese&#x02013;Roediger&#x02013;McDermott word lists; Deese, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">1959</xref>; Roediger &#x00026; McDermott, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">1995</xref>).</p><p>The question that remains is which proximate mechanisms might carry the survival recall advantage. Weinstein et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2008</xref>), for example, argued that the survival recall advantage is the result of the operation of basic memory processes such as enhanced schematic or self-referential processes. However, in their study, they found no evidence for such an interpretation. Also, Kang et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2008</xref>) hypothesized that the heightened arousal and novelty induced by the survival instruction led to a superior increase in memory recollection. As was mentioned before, they failed to obtain support for this.</p><p>It may well be the case that the unique effect of survival processing is related to the survival instruction inducing both item-specific and relational processing. It is well demonstrated that both types of processing lead to superior memory retention (Hunt &#x00026; McDaniel, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">1993</xref>). Indeed, a recent study by Burns, Burns, and Hwang (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2011</xref>) confirmed the idea that the survival recall effect is the result of encoding of both item-specific and relational processing. They showed that the survival recall effect disappeared when control conditions were implemented that also activated item-specific and relational processing.</p><p>The scenario ratings that our participants gave on a number of dimensions (i.e., distinctiveness, imagery, familiarity, richness) might also shed some light on the proximate mechanisms behind the survival recall advantage. Like Nairne and Pandeirada (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2010</xref>), we found that the participants regarded the survival instruction as more distinctive and less familiar than the other scenarios. It might well be the case that distinctive processing fuels the survival recall effect. Although Nairne and Pandeirada (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2008</xref>) presented evidence that seems to indicate that distinctiveness is an unlikely explanation for the survival recall advantage, more studies are needed to address this issue&#x02014;in particular, the possibility that it is a combination of distinctiveness, elaboration, and unfamiliarity that produces the survival recall advantage.</p><p>A possibility that is closely related to this analysis is provided by attention restoration theory (ART). Berman, Jonides, &#x00026; Kaplan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2008</xref>, <xref rid="Sec8" ref-type="sec">Experiment 2</xref>) showed their participants either pictures of nature (e.g., scenery of Nova Scotia) or pictures of urban environments (i.e., city of Detroit). They found that the first group subsequently performed better on attentional tasks than did the second group, indicating that interaction with nature leads to more bottom-up stimulation than does interaction with urban environments. The authors argued that interaction with nature provides individuals with the opportunity for attentional recovery and, therefore, cognitive improvement. This line of reasoning might bear relevance to the memory effects of survival processing, since survival instructions strongly evoke a natural environment (but see Nairne et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2009</xref>).</p><p>It is tempting to assume that survival processing maps onto a special cognitive adaptation, a survival <italic>module</italic> that specifically evolved to process fitness-relevant information. However, evolutionary psychologists would contend that the idea of a specific survival module is too broad (see Nairne et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2007</xref>) and that natural selection would not develop a module for the sole purpose of survival alone.Hence, another option could be that survival processing activates a multitude of different proximate mechanisms that, together, maximize retention (e.g., self-preservation or predator avoidance systems). It is obvious that further studies are needed to unravel the proximate mechanisms behind the adaptive memory effect.</p><p>To summarize, the aim of the present study was to examine whether stereotype activation could help explain the survival recall advantage. In two experiments, we found that when the survival groupwas compared with a host of new control conditions eliciting strong stereotypes, the survival recall advantage did not disappear. Thus, stereotype induction is unlikely to explain the survival recall advantage, and therefore our findings add to the generality of the survival recall advantage and to thegrowing body of literature showing that memory is functionally designed.</p></sec></body><back><ack><sec id="d29e1329"><title>Open Access</title><p>This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution
