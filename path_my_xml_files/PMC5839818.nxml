It often involves the limitation of irreversible airflow and the gradual loss of lung function.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup> It has been reported that the prevalence of COPD was 8.2% in Chinese population aged more than 40 years old.<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup> However, this figure may still be underestimated because many people with COPD remain undiagnosed.<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup> Additionally, this kind of condition not only brings a significant burden for patients, families, and the social healthcare systems, but also is associated with poor health-related quality of life in patients.<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup></p><p>Present therapy for moderate to severe COPD include the combined interventions of smoking cessation, involving long-acting &#x003b2; 2 agonist (LABA)/inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) or LABA/long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA). Although those therapies are effective in decreasing airflow obstruction and enhancing quality of life in patients with COPD, more effective and safe therapies are still looked for preventing and treating its exacerbations and progression.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup></p><p>Roflumilast is an oral, potent, and selective inhibitor of phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4). It has a half-life compatible with once-daily dose. It is reported that roflumilast can inhibit the release of mediators from activated inflammatory cells,<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> and can reduce the absolute number of neutrophils and eosinophils in induced sputum.<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup> Additionally, clinical trials also reported that roflumilast was associated with significant enhancements of lung function and quality of life in patients with COPD.<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup> However, ethnic differences may lead to efficacy and safety differences in drug responses.<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup> Currently, no study specifically focuses on this issue among the Chinese population. Thus, it is necessary to further explore the efficacy and safety of roflumilast in Chinese population with COPD.</p><p>This study aimed to conduct a randomized, double blinded, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of roflumilast for Chinese patients with COPD. We hypothesized that roflumilast for the treatment of COPD in Chinese population would be superior to the efficacy of placebo.</p></sec><sec><label>2</label><title>Methods/design</title><sec><label>2.1</label><title>Study design</title><p>This study is designed as a two-arm, randomized, double blinded, placebo-controlled trial with participants, investigators, assessor, and analyst blinding. The study was approved by the ethics committee of The People's Hospital of Yan&#x02019;an, and was also conducted at this hospital from January 2011 to December 2016. A total of 120 patients were included and were randomly divided into 2 groups (intervention group and placebo group) at a 1:1 allocation ratio. The patients received either roflumilast or placebo once daily for a total of 12 months. Outcome evaluation and data analysis were performed at the end of 12-month treatment, and 3-month follow-up after the treatment.</p></sec></sec><sec><label>3</label><title>Eligibility</title><sec><label>3.1</label><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p>The inclusion criteria were as follows: aged more than 40 years old; confirmed diagnosis of COPD according to the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines (postbronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV<sub>1</sub>)/FVC ratio &#x02264; 70%, and a postbronchodilator FEV<sub>1</sub> with 30% and 80% predicted);<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup> a history of COPD with more than 12 months; clinical stable COPD within 1 month before the study; no medication changes within the 3 months prior the study; and the provision of written informed consent prior to enrollment into the study.</p></sec><sec><label>3.2</label><title>Exclusion criteria</title><p>Patients were excluded if they met the following conditions: pregnancy or breast feeding; asthma or other lung related diseases, such as lung cancer, active tuberculosis; &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>-antitrypsin deficiency; treatment with systemic glucocorticosteroids, any short-acting &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-agonist 1 month before the study; and severe mental disorder.</p></sec><sec><label>3.3</label><title>Randomization and allocation concealment</title><p>All eligible included patients were randomly assigned to the intervention group or placebo group in a 1:1 ratio. Randomization schedule was generated using a computerized number generator with SAS package (version 9.1; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina) by a professional statistician, who was blinded to the treatment allocation. The patients, investigators, outcome assessors, and data analysts were masked to the treatment allocation.</p></sec><sec><label>3.4</label><title>Intervention</title><p>Patients in the intervention group received roflumilast, 500&#x0200a;&#x003bc;g once daily for a total of 12 months.

They found that roflumilast plays an important role in improving lung function in Asian population, such as Korea, and European population for treating patients with COPD. Of them, one study evaluated the efficacy and safety of roflumilast in Korean patients with COPD.<sup>[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup> It was found that roflumilast significantly enhanced lung function with a tolerable safety profile in Korean COPD patients irrespective of the severity of airflow limitation.<sup>[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup> Other studies explored the efficacy of roflumilast in the Asian population, and also found that roflumilast can improve pulmonary function, and the tolerability profile was similar to the Caucasian population.<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup> Another study explored the European patients to assess the efficacy and safety of roflumilast and the results demonstrated that roflumilast produced a modest improvement in lung function without changing the exacerbation rate or health status in severe and stable COPD, and fewer exacerbations.<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup> However, no study was conducted specifically focused on the Chinese population with COPD.</p><p>The results of our study are partly consistent with the previous studies.<sup>[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup> We confirmed our hypothesis that roflumilast has promising efficacy for the treatment of COPD in Chinese population, compared to the placebo. To our best knowledge, this study is the first randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial to explore the efficacy of roflumilast for treating Chinese population with COPD specifically. Our findings showed the efficacy of roflumilast for Chinese patients with COPD.</p><p>In this study, the mean changes of the FEV<sub>1,</sub> FVC, and FEF<sub>25&#x02013;75%</sub> were significantly greater in the intervention group than those in the control group. Furthermore, the total score of SGRQ significantly lower in the intervention group than that in the control group in Chinese patients with COPD. Thus, roflumilast treatment appears to be promising for improving the health-related quality of life of Chinese patients with COPD.</p><p>Although the encouraging efficacy of roflumilast for the treatment of COPD, this study still had several limitations. First, this study was only conducted at a single hospital with recruitment of Chinese Han ethnicity. Thus, it may be limited to the generalization to other ethnicities and other hospitals. Second, this study only performed 3-month follow-up evaluation owing to its short duration. Therefore, the studies with longer follow-up assessment of roflumilast on COPD are still needed to be addressed in the future.</p></sec><sec><label>6</label><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results of this study found that roflumilast can either improve lung function, or the health-related quality of life of Chinese patients with COPD.
