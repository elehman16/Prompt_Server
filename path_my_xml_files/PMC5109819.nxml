Clinical manifestations are soft-tissue swelling and bony enlargements, most frequently in the distal and proximal interphalangeal finger joints, and of the carpometacarpal (CMC1) joint of the thumb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Symptoms and functional consequences include pain, stiffness, reduced grip strength and hand function, and impaired activity performance and quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In a recent study examining the consequences of HOA, the results also showed a substantial and similar impact on work productivity across five European countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>Studies further indicate that people with CMC1-OA have more severe pain and disability than those without involvement of this joint [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The prevalence of CMC1-OA has been estimated at 13% in people aged 41 to 50&#x000a0;years, increasing to 68% in people between 71 and 80&#x000a0;years of age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In the absence of disease-modifying interventions, non-pharmacological approaches such as patient education, hand exercises, assistive devices and orthoses for the CMC1-joint are considered as core treatments for HOA, while surgery is recommended for those with severe CMC1-OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The non-pharmacological interventions for HOA are most frequently delivered by occupational therapists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], and research supports that these interventions are safe and effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>In Norway, the Directorate of Health has assigned the main responsibility for OA care to the primary health care services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Recent research indicates, however, that the quality of these services in general is sub-optimal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], and that especially people with HOA have poor access to recommended treatment both in primary and secondary care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. While persons with hip or knee-OA often receive physiotherapy, few with HOA have seen an occupational therapist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Thus, the care of people with HOA is most frequently limited to general practitioner (GP) consultations, while those with severe CMC1-OA may be referred for surgical consultation. The waiting time for surgical consultation in Norway is usually between three and 6&#x000a0;months, followed by a waiting period of 6 to 12&#x000a0;months prior to surgical treatment.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Surgery for carpometacarpal osteoarthritis</title><p>CMC1-OA presents with a combination of reduced cartilage thickness, increased ligament laxity with resultant instability, and subluxation of the base of the metacarp on the trapezium, which in turn results in adduction contracture and decreased thumb web space [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. As the severity of symptoms does not necessarily correspond with the radiographic stage of the disease, the main indications for surgery are pain and loss of function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Surgical procedures most frequently comprise trapeziectomy with or without ligament reconstruction and tendon interposition (LRTI), and in the most severe cases trapeziometacarpal arthrodesis. Two systematic reviews comparing the effect of different surgical techniques in CMC1-OA conclude that there is currently no evidence that one surgical procedure is superior to another [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The results further show that 10% of the participants who underwent trapeziectomy and 22% who underwent trapeziectomy with LRTI had adverse effects, including scar tenderness, tendon adhesion or rupture, sensory change, or complex regional pain syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Complications and repeat surgeries were also frequently reported following CMC1 arthrodesis, with non-union rates between 8 and 21% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. A recent randomized controlled trial (RCT), comparing arthrodesis with trapeziectomy with LRTI, was prematurely terminated due to the high prevalence of complications: 71% in the arthrodesis group and 21% in the trapeziectomy with LRTI group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Thus, even if CMC1 surgery may reduce pain and improve function, the risk of adverse effects is high, and RCTs comparing surgery with non-surgical interventions are warranted. In a recent review of surgery for thumb osteoarthritis, the authors did not identify any studies that compared surgery to sham surgery or to non-operative treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. However, in a small prospective study evaluating the effect of occupational therapy (assistive devices alone or with addition of one of two types of orthoses) for patients awaiting CMC1-surgery, 23 out of 33 participants (70%) no longer required an operation after 7&#x000a0;months, while only two of the remaining 19 participants wanted an operation after 7&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The results thereby indicate that occupational therapy may reduce the need for surgery. However, as this was a small study with a high risk of bias, robust RTCs comparing the effects of occupational therapy and surgery are needed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Occupational therapy for hand osteoarthritis</title><p>Occupational therapy aims at enhancing activity, participation and health-related quality of life. Interventions in occupational therapy for HOA most frequently comprises patient education, hand exercises, and the provision of assistive devices and thumb orthoses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Patient education</title><p>Based on one RCT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], the authors of a review of treatment for HOA conclude that educating patients about self-management is effective for alleviating pain and avoiding disability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In two later studies, the authors of a Dutch RCT found no effectiveness of a group-based multidisciplinary treatment programme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], while there was a significant improvement in pain self-efficacy and a higher proportion of people meeting the OARSI responder criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] among those receiving patient education (joint protection) compared to those who did not in a recent British RCT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Further, participants in qualitative studies report that they experience lack of help, and little and/or contradictory information with regard to management of their condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Thus, there is a need for developing education material that is unique to HOA and based on high-quality published evidence for HOA treatments.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Assistive devices</title><p>Results from an RCT demonstrated that use of assistive devices significantly improved activity performance and satisfaction with performance in patients with HOA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. In addition, the use of assistive devices was the most frequently reported self-management strategy in a study exploring self-management strategies in persons with HOA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Furthermore, participants with HOA have reported in qualitative interviews that assistive devices help them remain independent in daily activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. However, despite the availability of such devices, the participants had seldom received any information or guidance from health professionals during the process of selecting appropriate devices.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Hand exercises</title><p>Several systematic reviews conclude that there is some, although limited, evidence that hand exercises may reduce pain and increase joint mobility and grip strength in HOA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Furthermore, there were no differences among those who received the multidisciplinary programme that included hand exercises compared to those who did not receive this programme in a recent Dutch RCT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], or between the groups that received hand exercises versus those who did not in a British RCT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. However, none of these interventions included monitoring during the study period, and the rationale for the design of the exercise programmes is unclear. Moreover, when comparing the cost-utility of joint protection only, hand exercises only, and joint protection plus hand exercises with leaflet and advice (control group) in the British study, the findings showed that hand exercises was the most cost-effective option [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].</p><p>In a recent Norwegian RCT, hand exercises led to significant and clinically important functional improvements in terms of decreased pain and fatigue, increased thumb web space, approximately 25% improvement in grip strength, and improved activity performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. The selection and monitoring of exercises in the study was in accordance with recent research and recommendations for exercises for HOA in general [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], as well as for CMC1-OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. As the intervention was well tolerated and delivered at a low cost with respect to time expended and exercise materials used, the authors conclude that the programme should be considered for inclusion in the standard care for people with HOA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. In another Norwegian study investigating the effect of the same exercise programme, but with three additional exercises for the shoulder girdle and upper arm, these findings were supported, although the effects were more limited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. It therefore seems that the less comprehensive programme may be easier to perform on a regular basis, thus making it probably the most effective.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Thumb orthoses</title><p>Based on the best available evidence, the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) recommends that persons with CMC1-OA should be provided with orthoses to prevent or correct subluxation and deformity of the thumb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The effect of CMC1 orthoses has been addressed in six systematic reviews [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Based on a meta-analysis of two randomized controlled trials, the authors in one of the most recent reviews conclude that there is consistent evidence that orthoses reduce hand pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The results from single trials included in this review further indicate that subluxation was reduced when wearing orthoses and more reduced with a rigid orthosis than with a soft one [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. In the two included studies with a low risk of bias, a long and rigid orthosis was found to be pain relieving and well tolerated for long-term night use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>], while a shorter orthosis used during activities of daily living significantly reduced pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. An effective regimen may therefore be a combination of a small and rigid orthosis for pain relief during the day and a rigid nighttime orthosis for prevention of deformities.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Functional assessment of hand osteoarthritis</title><p>Appropriate outcome measures, based on patients&#x02019; concerns, are necessary for the comprehensive evaluation of existing and new interventions in HOA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Such instruments should also be feasible, valid, reliable, and responsive to change. Currently, two patient reported outcomes (PROs) have been developed specifically for HOA: the Australian/Canadian Hand Osteoarthritis Index (AUSCAN) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>] and the Functional Index of HOA (FIHOA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. In a Norwegian study comparing the psychometric properties of these measures, the results indicated that both of these questionnaires contained items that were deemed irrelevant by the Norwegian respondents, such as gender-specific questions and items addressing activities that are not relevant in a Norwegian context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. The items are further limited to activities within self-care and house work, and do not include any questions related to activities within work or leisure. The Measure of Activity Performance of the Hand (MAP-Hand) is a PRO where the items were generated through interviews with people with arthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. In addition to 18 standardized items, the questionnaire includes five open questions, where patients can add other activities of importance to daily functioning. This provides clinicians with important information for goal-setting processes, planning and evaluation of interventions, and meet the need for outcome measures that incorporate the patient perspective as stated by the Outcome Measures in Rheumatology Group (OMERACT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. MAP-Hand has been tested for validity and responsiveness in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and HOA with good results, but studies of reliability, including estimating the smallest detectable difference and minimal important change are warranted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Aims and research questions</title><p>The main objective will be to evaluate whether occupational therapy reduces or delays the need for surgery in carpometacarpal osteoarthritis during the waiting period prior to surgical consultation.</p><p>More specifically, our study will consider the following research questions:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Does occupational therapy in the period before surgical consultation reduce the need for surgery in CMC1-OA (reduces the proportion of patients who receives CMC1-surgery)?</p></list-item><list-item><p>What is the patients&#x02019; motivation and what reasons are given for wanting CMC1-surgery?</p></list-item><list-item><p>Are there differences between departments of rheumatology with regard to degree of CMC1-OA, pain and functional limitations in patients referred for surgical consultation for CMC1 surgery?</p></list-item><list-item><p>Is the Measure of Activity Performance of the Hand (MAP-Hand) a reliable measure in patients with CMC1-OA?</p></list-item><list-item><p>Do patients with CMC1-OA with and without affection of the distal and proximal interphalangeal finger joints differ with regard to symptoms and function?</p></list-item><list-item><p>Do the degrees of CMC1-OA, symptoms and functional limitations significantly predict improvement after 2&#x000a0;years following occupational therapy or CMC1-surgery?</p></list-item><list-item><p>Is occupational therapy more cost-effective than surgery in the management of CMC1-OA?</p></list-item></list>

Members of the project group will be engaged throughout each stage of the trial and will contribute in the process of integrating study results in clinical practice.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Study design and setting</title><p>This is a Norwegian multicentre randomized controlled trial (Trial registration: NCT01794754). The trial will be conducted at the departments of rheumatology at St. Olav&#x02019;s Hospital, Trondheim University Hospital in Trondheim, Haukeland University Hospital in Bergen and Haugesund Rheumatism Hospital in Haugesund, in collaboration with the National advisory unit on rehabilitation in rheumatology, which is located at Diakonhjemmet Hospital in Oslo. Participants will be allocated to receive either standard care (no intervention) or occupational therapy during the waiting period between referral for and the actual surgical consultation (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The occupational therapy intervention represents a supplement to standard HOA care, and no participant will receive an intervention that is below the current standard of care.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Study flow diagram</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12891_2016_1321_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>

</p><p>The patient education will comprise information about hand osteoarthritis, ergonomic principles and the use of five assistive devices that the participants will receive during the first consultation. These will be the five devices most frequently used by participants in an RCT evaluating the effect of assistive devices in HOA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]; a bread knife and a vegetable knife with build-up handles, an enlarged grip for opening bottles, a key for opening jars (the Jar Key), and a self-opening pair of scissors.</p><p>The hand exercise programme will be based on the programme used in one of the previously described Norwegian studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], and contains seven exercises to prevent or delay development of fixed deformities, and to maintain or increase the range of motion, grip strength and joint stability in the wrist and finger joints (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The programme will follow the American College of Sports Medicine&#x02019;s recommendations regarding exercise intensity, session frequency and length of exercise period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>].<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>The hand exercise program</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12891_2016_1321_Tab2_HTML" id="MO2"/></table-wrap>
</p><p>All participants will also receive a day and a night orthosis (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). The design of the day orthosis will depend on the degree of CMC-OA, deformity and sub-luxation of the thumb, but the first choice will be the Push Brace<sup>TM</sup> orthosis. This is a small, water resistant, rigid, pre-fabricated orthosis supporting the CMC1-joint while allowing optimal mobility of the wrist and fingers. The orthosis will be fitted to the participant according to sizing instructions provided by the manufacturer. Alternative day orthoses will be the Camp 28558 thumb orthosis with Orfit Classic 2&#x000a0;mm-Micro, (art.no. 8333.

As there is no cure for this condition, there is a need to develop effective conservative treatment approaches that achieve sustainable long-term improved outcomes. This paper describes the rationale and design of a trial investigating the effect that occupational therapy will have on surgery rate and function in people with carpometacarpal osteoarthritis. To our knowledge, the study will be the first large randomized controlled trial exploring whether occupational therapy during the waiting period before surgical consultation reduces or delays the need for surgery in carpometacarpal osteoarthritis.</p><p>Up until now, surgery has been the main treatment option for people with osteoarthritis. There is good evidence, however, demonstrating that exercise reduces pain and improves hip and knee function OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>], and there is growing evidence that the same is true for HOA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Therefore, the claim has been made that new models are needed for the care of people with osteoarthritis, with an emphasis on positive approaches to self-management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. The results from the current trial may give valuable input to the development of such models. The inclusion of an economic evaluation in our trial also offers an additional dimension that will assist health policymakers in their decision-making regarding the models of care that are most feasible for people with HOA. Furthermore, although this study takes place in a secondary-care setting, patient education, assistive devices, prefabricated orthoses and hand exercises may easily be provided in primary care. If proven effective, the occupational therapy intervention should therefore be implemented earlier in the HOA disease trajectory and as part of primary care, to reduce functional limitations and the need for costly surgery in secondary care.</p><p>The design of the current trial is based on international evidence-based recommendations for HOA, and is aimed at improving access to safe and effective care, professional practice and cost-effective utilization of health care resources. Furthermore, the inclusion of three departments of rheumatology ensures that the new intervention is implemented in various settings, which enhances the generalizability of the results. The results will also provide insight into referral practice, as well as predictors for improving subsequent therapy and surgery.</p><p>The study has been developed in close collaboration with a patient research partner, clinicians and international experts, who will also contribute in the process of integrating study results in clinical practice. If proven effective, the intervention should be implemented and made mandatory in primary or secondary care before CMC1-surgery is considered.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ANCOVA</term><def><p>Analysis of covariance</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AUSCAN</term><def><p>Australian/Canadian Hand Osteoarthritis Index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CI</term><def><p>Confidence intervals</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CMC1</term><def><p>Carpometacarpal joint of the thumb</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EQ-5D</term><def><p>Euro Qol-5 dimensions</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EULAR</term><def><p>European League Against Rheumatism</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FIHOA</term><def><p>Functional Index of Hand Osteoarthritis</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GP</term><def><p>General practitioner</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HOA</term><def><p>Hand osteoarthritis</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICC</term><def><p>Intra class correlation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LRTI</term><def><p>Ligament reconstruction and tendon interposition</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MAP-Hand</term><def><p>Measure of Activity Performance of the Hand</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OA</term><def><p>Osteoarthritis</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OARSI</term><def><p>Osteoarthritis Research Society International</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PRO</term><def><p>Patient reported outcome</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RCT</term><def><p>Randomized controlled trial</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to thank Line Lied, Eivind Strandenes, Herman Luhr (surgeons), as well as Erik R&#x000f8;devand, Clara Gram Gjesdal and Elisabeth Esper&#x000f8; (rheumatologists), who will ensure that patient recruitment and consultations are in line with recommended procedures and good clinical practice.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p>The trial is being funded by an unrestricted grant from the Norwegian Regional Health Authorities health research program HELSEFORSK (Program Grant 243758).
