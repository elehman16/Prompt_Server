All vaccine delivery routes were well tolerated. Binding antibodies were observed to both the ALVAC vector and HIV-1 gp160 proteins. Modest cellular responses were observed in 2/7 individuals in the DC arm and 1/8 in the IM arm as determined by IFN-&#x003b3; ELISPOT. Proliferative responses were most frequent in the DC arm where 4/7 individuals had measurable responses to multiple HIV-1 antigens. Loading DC after maturation resulted in lower gene expression, but overall better responses to both HIV-1 and control antigens, and were associated with better IL-2, TNF-&#x003b1; and IFN-&#x003b3; production.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>ALVAC-HIV delivered IM, ID or SQ with autologous <italic>ex vivo</italic> transfected DC proved to be safe. The DC arm was most immunogenic. Proliferative immune responses were readily detected with only modest cytotoxic CD8 T cell responses. Loading mature DC with the live viral vaccine induced stronger immune responses than loading immature DC, despite increased transgene expression with the latter approach. Volunteers who received the autologous vaccine loaded mature DC developed a broader and durable immune response compared to those vaccinated by conventional routes.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00013572">NCT00013572</ext-link>

However, recent data from the Phase III, RV144 Thai study using a similar canarypox viral vector (vCP1521) and a protein subunit boost showed a modest (31&#x00025;) reduction in HIV acquistion despite minimal T cell responses as detected by IFN-&#x003b3; ELISPOT <xref rid="pone.0024254-RerksNgarm1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. This level of ELISPOT activity, in the range of 15&#x02013;40&#x00025;, is fairly typical for ALVAC-HIV studies <xref rid="pone.0024254-Marovich2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024254-Franchini1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024254-Spearman1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Notably, most vaccinees in RV144 showed lymphoproliferative responses, CD4 responses to HIV-env by ICS and developed binding antibodies to vaccine components. The only difference between the canarypox vector in this study (vCP205) and the Thai trial (vCP1521) is in their respective env sequences: here in RV138 we used an MN (subtype B) and in the RV144 Thai trial, 92TH023 (subtype A/E) was used. Immune correlates of protection are under active investigation for the Thai study. In this context, it is incumbent on researchers to explore new avenues for vaccine development and broaden our understanding of the assessment of immune responses to vaccination. To this end, we conducted a randomized, controlled double-blinded HIV vaccine trial comparing standard immunization routes to a novel delivery route using autologous <italic>ex vivo</italic> loaded dendritic cells. This DC targeted approach to vaccination is labor intensive and ultimately non-deployable on a large scale, but can be informative for vaccine development.</p><p>We found that all administration routes of vCP205, including multiple rounds of autologous DC vaccination of healthy volunteers, were safe and well tolerated. Similar to the RV144 Thai study, our study generated predominantly proliferative responses in the CD4 T cell compartment. Qualitative differences were detected in immune responses that were route dependent with the <italic>ex vivo</italic> targeted DC being more immunogenic <italic>&#x0003e;</italic> IM &#x0003e; ID as assessed in the functional LPA. Somewhat surprisingly, the ID route, which targets a DC rich zone and is proposed to enhance vaccine efficacy (22), induced the most limited of cellular responses. One possible explanation is that we used a lower dose of ID vaccine (50&#x00025;) given the volume constraints of the dermal compartment. We hypothesized that a reasonable dose-sparing effect should be observable with half the dose. This pilot study suggests there was no observed dose sparing effect giving the vaccine intradermally.</p><p>There were clear responders and non-responders to DC vaccination. In fact, the first 4 consecutive volunteers responded to DC vaccination, whereas the last three did not. The presence or absence of an HIV response coincided with the KLH responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0024254-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>). Therefore, KLH served as an important control neoantigen, indicating loss of DC integrity or compromise after loading with a live viral vaccine since both active vaccinees and placebo recipients' DC were pulsed with KLH. It is important to note that KLH specific CD8 T cell ELISPOT responses were low in the DC arm (data not shown). The lymphoproliferative responses elicited by DC vaccination were broad. Responses were detected to whole inactivated HIV-1, as well as env (gp160) and gag (p24) proteins. These responses were robust and durable; lasting up to 18 months post vaccination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0024254-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). In an effort to better characterize the responding cells, we used the cell tracking dye CFDA-SE along with phenotypic markers in a flow cytometric assay. While the preponderance of dividing cells were CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells, there was detectable proliferation in the CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0024254-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>). Despite proliferative activity in the CD8 T cell compartment, cytolytic activity was low. This could be consistent with a recent report that suggests that in the murine cancer setting, priming of a CD8 immune response is indirectly mediated by DC <xref rid="pone.0024254-Yewdall1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>.</p><p>A key difference between responders and non-responders was their DC maturation status at the time of vaccine loading. Maturing the DC first, then loading the vaccine, resulted in greater immune responses despite significantly reduced p24 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0024254-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>, left panel). It is possible that the mature loaded DC were more functional and capable of priming immune responses to the vaccine. When the DC were loaded with vaccine in the immature state, though they expressed more p24, there was reduced viability, decreased maturation (CD83 expression) and technical difficulties which lowered the overall cell yield for vaccination. In addition to our experience, independent reports implicate a role for type I interferons in ALVAC loaded DC showing that ALVAC exposed monocyte derived DC upregulate the type I interferon signaling pathway and DC maturation status influences downstream intracellular networks via a &#x0201c;molecular switch&#x0201d; in IFN&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; signaling <xref rid="pone.0024254-Harenberg1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024254-Longman1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Taken together, integrating our work and the existing literature, we suggest that mature DC are better able to withstand viral vaccine loading and function as primary inducers of immune responses. Our poxvirus data is consistent with prior reports indicating immunologic benefit when loading mature DC with either peptides or RNA <xref rid="pone.0024254-Dieckmann1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024254-Schaft1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>.</p><p>As prior publications suggested that antigen loaded immature DC were tolerogenic, we looked for, but did not find, either HIV specific IL-10 production or the induction of T<sub>reg</sub> cells after vaccination <xref rid="pone.0024254-Dhodapkar2" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024254-Jonuleit1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. It is unclear whether DC non-responders were unresponsive in an antigen specific manner or simply ignored the signal having been insufficiently primed at the outset. The absence of IL-10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0024254-g005">Fig. 5D</xref>) and stable circulating T<sub>reg</sub> phenotypes and frequency pre- and post- vaccination (data not shown), are reassuring observations, leaving open the idea that optimal DC maturation and targeting could lead to more potent vaccines. Data from our gene expression experiments also supports the idea that cells from the non-responders were likely unresponsive, as opposed to tolerized. This assay was designed as an adjunct to our functional studies. We aimed to detect differences in gene regulation between responders and non-responders when stimulated with HIV antigens under LPA like conditions. The data show significant differences between the two groups. In response to stimulation with AT-2 HIV, post-vaccination cells from the responders showed differential regulation of 205 genes. In contrast, no effect was seen in the non-responder group, or in any of the pre-vaccination samples (data not shown).</p><p>Cytolytic CD8 T cell response rates, particularly ELISPOTs and chromium release CTLs, were low overall and similar to those reported in previous canarypox studies <xref rid="pone.0024254-RerksNgarm1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024254-Marovich2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024254-Franchini1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. One of the few responders to generate a strong CD8 cytolytic response was vaccinated by the IM route. This vaccinee responded to a peptide sequence CTRPNYNKRKRIHIG, corresponding to position 296&#x02013;301 (HXB2 numbering) in the V3 loop of the envelope protein. This HLA-B0702 restricted peptide sequence appears to be highly specific to MN subtypes and represents the first time vaccine induced immune responses have been reported against this epitope. While similar sequences denoted B7-R110 have been reported in acute <xref rid="pone.0024254-Yu1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> and chronic <xref rid="pone.0024254-Appay1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024254-Day1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024254-Kiepiela1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> HIV-1 infection, there is no known protection associate with this epitope <xref rid="pone.0024254-Koning1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>.</p><p>Pilot studies are helpful in finding early safety signals, generating hypotheses and driving innovation. Multiple doses of HIV-1 vaccine pulsed, <italic>ex vivo</italic> loaded autologous DC were safe and well tolerated in normal healthy people and immunogenic <italic>in vivo</italic>. Study limitations include the small study size, multiple arms and the change in DC arm loading sequence that was not part of the original study design. Additionally, we did not inject ALVAC SQ as a comparator to the <italic>ex vivo</italic> ALVAC loaded DC injected subcutaneously. Subset analysis of the DC responders and non-responders were included for information purposes but cannot be considered highly robust datasets. Yet, antigen specific proliferative immune responses were observed in both CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell compartments after DC vaccination and were associated with IL-2, TNF-&#x003b1; and IFN-&#x003b3; production. Though a few DC vaccinees did not respond to the vaccination series, no evidence for T<sub>reg</sub> cell induction or tolerance was found. Non-responders and responders were readily differentiated using expression profile analysis supporting our results, but given the small sample size, further study is needed. Targeting mature DC with viral vectors may render cellular vaccines more functional and immunogenic.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0024254.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>
<bold>Characterization of T cell responses for volunteer RV138.08 (IM group).</bold> Epitope mapping using a peptide matrix ELISPOT assay with in vitro expanded (pIVS) PBMC revealed that peptides 75 and 76 were positive. The main epitope recognized was confirmed to be MN Env peptide #76 (CTRPNYNKRKRIHIG Env 296&#x02013;310, HXB2 location). In an ICS assay, 41.5&#x00025; and 0.61&#x00025; of the CD3/CD8 positive T cells in the pIVS preparation were positive for IFN-&#x003b3; staining to p76 pulsed v.s. unpulsed autologous TBC (data not shown).

As predicted, the Env #75/76 peptide overlap contains a motif matching the binding capacity of HLA-B&#x0002a;0703 with the minimal epitope predicted to be RPNYNKRKRI. Peptide 76 was used to continue in vitro stimulation of the culture and further characterized in 51Cr-release CTL and ICS assays. (A) CTL capacity of the line was confirmed by examination of cross-subtype reactivity to rVV expressed Envelope proteins representing subtypes A, B, C, D, CRF01_AE, F, G and H. As predicted from the sequences there was no cross-subtype reactivity and only the autologous MN Env was recognized.
