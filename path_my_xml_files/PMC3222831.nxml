There is currently no widely approved therapeutic agent for treating or preventing cancer-associated cachexia. Colorectal cancer and non-small cell lung cancer have relatively high incidences of cachexia, approximately 28% and 34%, respectively. Neurohormonal overactivity has been implicated in the genesis and progression of cachexia and beta receptor antagonism has been proposed as a potential therapy. MT-102, a novel anabolic/catabolic transforming agent, has a multi-functional effect upon three potential pharmacological targets in cancer cachexia, namely reduced catabolism through non-selective &#x003b2;-blockade, reduced fatigue, and thermogenesis through central 5-HT1a antagonism and increased anabolism through partial &#x003b2;-2 receptor agonism.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>At least 132 male and female patients, aged between 25 and 80&#x000a0;years with a confirmed diagnosis of late-stage non-small cell lung cancer or colorectal cancer, with cachexia will be randomised to either one of the two MT-102 doses or placebo in a 3:1:2 ratio (MT-102 10&#x000a0;mg&#x000a0;BD<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>/MT-102 2.5&#x000a0;mg&#x000a0;BD/placebo). Patients will continue on study treatment for maximally 16&#x000a0;weeks. The primary endpoint, to be analysed by assigned treatment group, will be body weight change over 16&#x000a0;weeks. For this endpoint, the study has 85% power (0.05% significance level) to detect per 4-week period a mean change of &#x02212;0.8&#x000a0;kg in the placebo group and 0&#x000a0;kg in the high-dose MT-102 arm. The first patient was randomised in February 2011 and patient recruitment is expected to continue until mid-2012.</p></sec><sec><title>Perspective</title><p>The ACT-ONE trial is designed to test whether the anabolic/catabolic transforming agent MT-102 will positively impact on the rate of change of body weight in cancer cachexia, thereby evaluating a novel therapeutic strategy in this hitherto poorly treatable condition. A separate ACT-TWO trial will recruit patients who complete the ACT-ONE trial and remain on randomised double-blind medication. Participants in ACT-TWO will be followed for an additional period with a separate primary endpoint.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Cancer</kwd><kwd>Cachexia</kwd><kwd>Intervention trial</kwd><kwd>Functional capacity</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer-Verlag 2011</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cachexia, defined as weight loss, associated with a chronic underlying disease, of at least 5% in 12&#x000a0;months or less is associated with significant morbidity and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Cachexia is known to accompany a wide range of serious illnesses, including cancer, chronic heart failure, COPD and chronic renal failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. It is associated with significant muscle wasting (myopenia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]), loss of muscle strength, fatigue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and anorexia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], in additional to neurohormonal and biochemical abnormalities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Its pathophysiology is characterized by a negative protein and energy balance driven by a variable combination of reduced food intake and abnormal metabolism.</p><p>Cachexia occurs in about a third of all cancer patients and has been estimated to be the direct cause of death in 20% to 40% of all cancer-related deaths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. As for other solid tumours, colorectal cancer (CRC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have relatively high incidences of cachexia, approximately 28% and 34%, respectively, and cachexia is known to be associated with poor outcomes and increased mortality in these cancers. Presently no therapy is widely approved for the treatment of cancer-associated cachexia. It would be very attractive to use relatively inexpensive non-toxic, non-cytotoxic agents to treat cachexia in this patient group.</p><p>MT-102 is an anabolic/catabolic transforming agent with properties including non-specific beta-1 and beta-2 adrenergic receptor blocking activity and intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA). In addition to its &#x003b2;-blocking and ISA activity, MT-102 is a highly potent antagonist of 5-HT<sub>1a</sub> receptors and binds to 5-HT <sub>1a</sub> receptors in the brain. MT-102 augments and decreases the time to onset of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor therapy via blockade of 5-HT<sub>1a</sub> receptors. Through its combined pharmacological actions, MT-102 has a multi-functional effect upon three potential pharmacological targets, each of which is relevant for cancer cachexia, as follows:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Reduced catabolism, through non-selective &#x003b2;-blockade,</p></list-item><list-item><p>Reduced fatigue and thermogenesis, through central 5-HT<sub>1a</sub> antagonism,</p></list-item><list-item><p>Increased anabolism, through partial &#x003b2;2-receptor agonism,</p></list-item></list></p><p>This triad of pharmacological effects renders MT-102 a unique and highly advantaged candidate for development in cancer cachexia.</p><p>In the Yoshida hepatoma rat model, of cancer cachexia, MT-102 demonstrates superior efficacy, relative to any other agent tested, including other &#x003b2;-blockers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In this model, MT-102 administration leads to a dose-dependent increase in weight, lean body mass and functional activity. Furthermore, it has been shown to enhance the survival of animals in this model in a dose-dependent manner. This heightened efficacy is presumed to be due to the unique multi-functional pharmacological activity of this particular agent.</p><p>The ACT-ONE trial will assess the potential efficacy of two different doses of MT-102 in patients with cachexia due to two common forms of cancer. Data from this study, along with that of the ACT-TWO study, will allow the design and conduct of appropriate phase III clinical studies to confirm the utility of MT-102 for this indication. The ACT-ONE study is powered to establish an effect of the higher dose of MT-102 upon the rate of change of body weight; which is the cardinal factor in the definition of cachexia, whereas the ACT-TWO study will be powered for patients' clinical status. Both studies will also examine the effect of MT-102 upon a number of measures of performance and quality of life.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study objectives</title><p>The primary objective of the ACT-ONE trial is to investigate, compared to placebo, the effect of a 10&#x000a0;mg/BD dose of MT-102 in comparison to placebo on the rate of change of body weight over a 16-week period in patients with cachexia related to underlying stages III and IV colorectal or non-small cell lung cancer.

All patients will receive standard of care chemotherapy, radiotherapy and supportive care throughout the study at the discretion of their treating physician. The physicians will be instructed to plan the chemotherapy cycles and the functional assessment visits in such a manner that chemotherapy does not interfere with the performance of the functional assessments by the patients.</p><p>Potentially eligible patients will undergo screening assessments which will include a set of performance tests [stair climbing power (SCP), HGS, short physical performance battery test and the SMWT]. In addition, patients will be given a 7-day course of placebo tablets (one tablet twice daily). Patients able to complete the performance tests as required by the protocol selection criteria and who are at least 80% compliant with the placebo run-in phase will then be randomised to either MT-102 2.5 or 10&#x000a0;mg BD or placebo.

The IMMs will review blinded safety surveillance data reported to the sponsor, but may request to be unblinded if necessary to make safety assessments and study recommendations provided that no study or sponsor personnel shall be unblinded in this process. The IMMs will make recommendations to the sponsor to stop study entry and dosing if they deem it necessary.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Sample size and statistical considerations</title><p>The underlying hypothesis for this trial is that high dose (i.e. 20&#x000a0;mg) of MT-102, relative to placebo, favourably affects the primary endpoint.

To allow for 20% of recruited patients who do not comply with the criteria for inclusion in the mITT population, 132 patients in total will be started on study treatment (66 patients in the active high dose, 22 patients in the active low dose and 44 patients in the placebo arm). The sample size considerations for this study were based on the results of the Randomized Clinical Trial of Adenosine 5-Triphosphate in Patients With Advanced Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer (<italic>Journal of the National Cancer Institute</italic>, Vol. 92, No. 4, February 16, 2000) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In this randomised trial, the weight loss rate in patients allocated to adenosine 5-triphosphate was compared to patients allocated to placebo. Patients included in this trial had stage IIIb or IV NSCLC and were followed for 28&#x000a0;weeks with a weight assessment every 4&#x000a0;weeks. In the placebo group, the mean weight change per 4-week period was &#x02212;1&#x000a0;kg (95% confidence interval [CI]&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;1.5 to &#x02212;0.5, <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;24). The corresponding standard deviation is 1.2&#x000a0;kg per 4-week period. In the same study, patients considered to be cachexic (i.e., weight loss &#x0003e;5% of weight before illness) had a mean weight loss rate of &#x02212;1.6&#x000a0;kg per 4-week period.</p><p>Based on the above assumptions, a mean weight change per 4-week period of &#x02212;0.8&#x000a0;kg in the placebo group versus no weight loss in the high-dose-treated group will be used for the MT-102 trial and a standard deviation of 1.2&#x000a0;kg per 4&#x000a0;weeks.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Statistical and analytical plan</title><p>Demographics and baseline characteristics will be documented by descriptive statistics on the ITT and modified ITT populations.

The primary endpoint of change in the rate of weight loss is clinically relevant, as weight loss is both a defining feature of cachexia and a major complaint of sufferers. Given the importance of loss of lean tissue to the symptoms of cachexia including fatigue and loss of functional capacity, it is highly plausible that a reduction in the rate of further weight loss may be associated with improvements in both symptoms and objective functional capacity, measures of which have therefore been incorporated as secondary efficacy assessment endpoints in this study.</p><p>There have been very few trials of drug therapies to reduce weight loss in cancer cachexia. The ACE inhibitor imidapril has been trialled in 200 patients with one of three cancer types and has been reported to have improved weight in two (Colorectal and non-small cell lung cancer) but neither in the third-type studied (pancreatic) nor in the pre-specified analysis of all three cancer types taken together (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.biotech-intelligence.com/html/html/2a462148882a297c8eafbeafbaeff7ff.html">http://www.biotech-intelligence.com/html/html/2a462148882a297c8eafbeafbaeff7ff.html</ext-link>). Ostarine, an investigational selective androgen receptor modulator enhanced lean body mass and muscle performance in a phase II clinical trial in patients with cancer cachexia. Ostarine led to significant increase in the primary endpoint of lean body mass (LBM) change with an associated improvement in muscle performance measured by stair climb in patients with cancer cachexia. The change from baseline in LBM for the placebo, 1- and 3-mg treatment groups was 0.1, 1.5 (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.001) and 1.3&#x000a0;kg (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.045), respectively, at the end of the 16-week trial (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pharmaceutical-business-review.com/news/gtxs_phaseii_cancer_cachexia_trial_meets_primary_endpoint_090611">http://www.pharmaceutical-business-review.com/news/gtxs_phaseii_cancer_cachexia_trial_meets_primary_endpoint_090611</ext-link>). Infliximab was studied in 89 patients with pancreatic cancer-related cachexia and did not show a statistically significant effect on lean body mass [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Etanercept (a dimeric fusion protein inhibitor of TNF) was tested in 63 evaluable patients with cancer-related weight loss and achieved no significant benefit in terms of weight gain or reduced weight loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>In a phase II clinical study, the orally administered grehlin agonist anamorelin was shown to produce an improvement in total body mass and a trend towards increased lean mass over a 12-week period in patients with cancer, but without any improvement in quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Anamorelin is now being examined in phase III clinical trials for patients with cachexia due to non-small cell lung cancer.</p><p>Other ongoing phase II trials in cancer cachexia include interventions such as the immunomodulator OHR/AVR118 in 30 cancer cachexia patients (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.marketwire.com/press-release/ohr-pharmaceutical-enrolls-first-three-patients-new-clinical-site-ongoing-phase-2b-cachexia-1368449.htm">http://www.marketwire.com/press-release/ohr-pharmaceutical-enrolls-first-three-patients-new-clinical-site-ongoing-phase-2b-cachexia-1368449.htm</ext-link>), a pilot study of APD209 (an oral fixed-dose combination of a progestin and a selective &#x003b2;2-agonist) in cancer cachexia in 16 patients (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT00895726">http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT00895726</ext-link>) and lenalidomide (an immunodulatory derivate of thalidomide) in 60 patients with cancer cachexia (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01127386?term=cachexia&#x00026;rank=1">http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01127386?term=cachexia&#x00026;rank=1</ext-link>).</p><p>Cachexia, despite being very common in many solid tumour cancers, remains a poorly studied, under-diagnosed and largely untreated complication that causes severe symptomatic limitation and predisposes to in increased mortality. The ACT-ONE trial will help evaluate the potential role of an interesting approach to its management.</p><p>The ACT-ONE trial is part of a programme to evaluate the role of MT-102 in cancer cachexia. Participants in ACT-ONE who complete the 16-week treatment period still taking randomised double-blind trial medication will be offered the opportunity to join the ACT-TWO trial. The ACT-TWO trial will continue the same randomised treatment allocations for the period up to that last patient in ACT-ONE having completed all investigations of the ACT-ONE trial and the 16-week period of trial medication. The ACT-TWO trial will be the subject of a separate protocol and design paper and will be separately powered with a different primary endpoint, which will include observations made during the period of double-blind therapy of ACT-ONE as well as the period of double-blind trial medication in ACT-TWO.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgement</title><p>The authors of this manuscript certify
