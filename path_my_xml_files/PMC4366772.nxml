Pinhole visual acuity was tested with a Snellen chart and expressed as a decimal. Assessment of field of vision was done using automated perimetry. Assessment of pupillary response and color vision was done. Indirect fundoscopy was done to check the status of fundus. In patients with suspicion of dysthyroid optic neuropathy (DON), visual evoked potentials were checked to rule out optic nerve involvement. Corneal staining was assessed with biomicroscope.

Detailed ophthalmologic evaluation for assessment of response to therapy was done at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after initiation of therapy.

This was the rationale for evaluating a lower dose oral prednisolone at 1 mg/kg/day. The response rate to low dose oral prednisolone in our study was 54.84% which is comparable to that reported with high dose prednisolone among Caucasians (63.4% and 51%).[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Glucocorticoids oral and iv both were well tolerated in our study, and the side effect profile was comparable between the groups. In our study, 41.93% of 31 patients on oral prednisolone complained of any adverse effect over a period of 1-year, as compared to 85.4% (35/41) patients over 1-year, and 51% (18/35) patients over 3 months in previously published studies among Caucasians.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] The lower dose of prednisolone used in this study may explain this more favorable side-effect profile, as compared to previous studies. In a recent study evaluating the side-effects of glucocorticoid therapy observed by European thyroidologists in managing GO, it was reported that minor nonsevere adverse effects were more common with oral prednisolone, whereas major life-threatening adverse effects were more common with iv pulse methylprednisolone.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] However, all but 1 patient with major life-threatening adverse effect with iv methylprednisolone had received a cumulative dose of the drug &#x0003e;8 g, which is higher than the current recommendations.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>In our study, pulse iv methyl-prednisolone was more effective in inducing a greater reduction of CAS and diplopia scores, along with a significantly higher response rate at 6-month and 1-year follow-up. This is in accordance with previous reports of a faster onset of action along with a greater response to iv glucocorticoids as compared to oral glucocorticoids. However, it is important to consider that response rates with oral prednisolone were significantly better at 1-year (54.84%) as compared to 6-month (38.71%). In one study, it was reported that on patient self-assessment there was no significant difference in the response between iv versus oral steroids (<italic>P</italic> = 0.27).[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Patient self-assessment of outcomes was not done in our study and is a limitation. Limitations of this study include small number of patients evaluated, along with the relatively short duration of follow-up.</p><p>Glucocorticoids are believed to act by inhibition of leucocyte chemotaxis and cytokine release, reduction in glycosaminoglycan synthesis by orbital fibroblasts, and down regulation of adhesion molecules.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Glucocorticoids have been found to be most effective in patients with active ophthalmopathy, with significant inflammatory features, diplopia in primary gaze, and in whom vision is threatened.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] This explains the higher left eye proptosis and intra-ocular pressures observed among responders in our study. Cox-regression also showed diplopia to be predictive of remission. Patients with a more clinically active GO have a better outcome with glucocorticoid therapy. Smoking had an adverse impact on remission of GO in our study, similar to previous reports.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Our study showed that baseline EOM thickness was not predictive of response to glucocorticoid therapy. EOM thickness was comparable among responders versus NR. Repeat CT orbit was not done on follow-up and is also a limitation of this study. Also, lack of estimation of TSH receptor antibody titers was a limitation.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, there is no study available from India, evaluating oral glucocorticoids in GO. The only study till date from India on GO showed that pulse iv dexamethasone is not inferior to pulse iv methylprednisolone in managing moderate severe GO in a cohort of 21 patients.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] This is the first study ever evaluating the role of low dose oral prednisolone in the management of GO. There is only one study available till date on the use of low dose oral prednisolone in GO. That study showed that short-term low dose oral prednisolone for 6 weeks is effective in preventing exacerbation of initially mild or absent GO, when radio-iodine is used for managing Graves&#x02019; disease.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] This study reiterates that iv methylprednisolone is superior to and should be the treatment of choice in managing GO. Oral prednisolone has been recommended as a second line agent in the management of GO, either alone or in combination with other investigative agents like cyclosporine or rituximab.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] One of the limitations of this study is lack of third arm of patients who would have been treated with high dose oral prednisolone, allowing a direct comparison between low dose oral prednisolone versus high dose oral prednisolone groups. Paucity of patients prevented us from having this third arm of the study. In absence of this third arm, it can only be speculated that low dose oral prednisolone (used in this study) is as efficacious as high dose oral prednisolone (based on previous published western literature), with significantly better tolerability and side-effect profile. Low dose oral prednisolone can be considered as a safe second line alternative in Indian GO patients, not willing or intolerant to pulse iv methylprednisolone.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>A<sc>CKNOWLEDGMENTS</sc></title><p>The authors are grateful to the departments of Ophthalmology and Radiology for their assistance in the assessment of GO.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> This study was funded by the Department of Endocrinology, Room Number-6, 4th floor Ronald Ross Building, Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research (IPGMER), Seth Sukhlal Karnani Memorial (SSKM) Hospital, 244 AJC Bose Road, Kolkata - 700 020, India</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>R<sc>EFERENCES</sc></title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Piantanida</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><name><surname>Tanda</surname><given-names>ML</given-names></name><name><surname>Lai</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Sassi</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Bartalena</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Prevalence and natural history of Graves&#x02019; orbitopathy in the XXI century</article-title><source>J Endocrinol Invest</source><year>2013</year><volume>36</volume><fpage>444</fpage><lpage>9</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">23587873</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bartalena</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Tanda</surname><given-names>ML</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Clinical practice.
