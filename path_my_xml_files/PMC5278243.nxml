Phase I data from a series of EVNP in extended criteria donor kidneys have established the safety and feasibility of the technique in clinical practice.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>This is a UK-based phase II multicentre randomised controlled trial to assess the efficacy of EVNP compared with the conventional static cold storage technique in donation after circulatory death (DCD) kidney transplantation. 400 patients receiving a kidney from a DCD donor (categories III and IV, controlled) will be recruited into the study. On arrival at the transplant centre, kidneys will be randomised to receive either EVNP (n=200) or remain in static cold storage (n=200). Kidneys undergoing EVNP will be perfused with an oxygenated packed red cell solution at near body temperature for 60&#x02005;min prior to transplantation. The primary outcome measure will be determined by rates of delayed graft function (DGF) defined as the need for dialysis in the first week post-transplant. Secondary outcome measures include incidences of primary non-function, the duration of DGF, functional DGF defined as &#x0003c;10% fall in serum creatinine for 3 consecutive days in the first week post-transplant, creatinine reduction ratio days 2 and 5, length of hospital stay, rates of biopsy-proven acute rejection, serum creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate at 1, 3, 6 and 12&#x02005;months post-transplant and patient and allograft survival. The EVNP assessment score will be recorded and the level of fibrosis and inflammation will also be measured using tissue, blood and urine samples. Ethics and dissemination. The study has been approved by the National Health Service (NHS) Health Research Authority Research Ethics Committee. The results are expected to be published in 2020.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number</title><p>ISRCTN15821205; Pre-results.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>TRANSPLANT SURGERY</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group specific-use="FundRef"><award-group id="funding-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Kidney Research UK</institution><institution-id>http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000291</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>(SP/MEKC/1/2014)</award-id></award-group></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Strengths and limitations of this study</title></caption><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>This is a large multicentre randomised controlled trial.

In response to this, there has been an increase in the use of kidneys from marginal donors and a significant proportion of transplant kidneys are now provided by donation after circulatory death (DCD) donors.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> DCD kidneys inevitably sustain a warm ischaemic insult prior to retrieval and 50&#x02013;60% of these kidneys have delayed graft function (DGF) after transplantation.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> DGF is associated with an increased risk of acute rejection, longer in-patient stay and therefore greater cost, and may also reduce allograft survival.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1&#x02013;7</xref> Moreover, when compared with standard criteria donors, DCD kidneys are three times more likely to be declined for transplantation due to concerns over their quality.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p><p>Organ preservation has traditionally relied on hypothermic techniques based on the principle that refrigeration reduces cellular metabolism and tissue oxygen requirements. The problem is that in the anoxic hypothermic environment anaerobic cellular respiration continues, albeit at a slow pace. Oxidative phosphorylation is uncoupled and mitochondrial ATP production by chemiosmosis ceases.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> ATP continues to be generated at a much slower rate by substrate-based phosphorylation in the glycolytic pathway. This leads to depletion of intracellular ATP stores. Anaerobic respiration generates lactic acid leading to worsening intracellular acidosis and eventually loss of cell viability.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> The initial warm ischaemic injury sustained by DCD kidneys makes them less tolerant of cold ischaemic injury during hypothermic preservation.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>

Randomisation will be performed after the transplant recipient and kidney have both arrived in the transplanting centre and a final decision to proceed with transplantation has been made by a member of the study team. The randomisation will be performed on a web-based system (sealed envelope) which uses a computer-generated randomisation sequence. In cases where paired kidneys from the same donor are transplanted in the same centre, one kidney from the pair will be randomly allocated to CS and the other to EVNP. In these cases, the randomisation will also determine which kidney (right or left) will be transplanted first.

To allow for a study withdrawal rate of 6%, a total of 400 patients will be recruited.</p></sec><sec id="s2r2"><title>Interim analysis</title><p>Two interim analyses will be performed during the study period. The first of these will be after 125 patients have received a transplant and reached 7&#x02005;days post-transplant and the second after 250 patients have been recruited (and have received a transplant and reached 7&#x02005;days post-transplant).</p></sec><sec id="s2r3"><title>Analysis population and principles</title><p>The population used for efficacy analyses will be an intent-to-treat population including all eligible randomised patients.

A full statistical analysis plan will be drawn up prior to the first interim analysis.</p><sec id="s2s1"><title>Primary analysis</title><p>The number of patients who experience DGF between the two groups will be compared using a logistic regression model adjusting for cold ischaemic time and donor age.</p></sec><sec id="s2s2"><title>Secondary outcomes</title><p><italic>PNF</italic>: The number of patients experiencing PNF in each arm will be compared using Fisher's exact text. The cause of graft loss will be tabulated by arm. The duration of DGF in days will be summarised using the Kaplan-Meier estimate of the duration of DGF for all those who experienced DGF and compared using a log-rank test.</p><p><italic>Outcome measures</italic>: The number of patients that experience functional DGF will be compared using Fisher's exact test. The CRR2 and CRR5 will be compared by arm using a two-sample t-test. The length of hospital stay, defined from admission to discharge, will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, with deaths in hospital censored, and compared between arms using the log-rank test.</p><p><italic>Biopsy-proven acute rejection rate</italic>: The number of patients in each arm will be compared using Fisher's exact test. Longitudinal changes in serum creatinine and eGFR will be separately assessed at 1, 3, 6 and 12&#x02005;months post-transplant and mean values compared using two-way analysis of variance with repeated measures for patients in each arm of the trial. Any difference between arms in the way serum creatinine and eGFR change over time will also be assessed using this model. Patient survival (time from transplant to death) and allograft survival (time from transplant to graft loss or return to dialysis) will be analysed using a Kaplan-Meier estimate of the probability of an event after 12&#x02005;months and a log-rank test. Time to graft loss or return to dialysis will be modelled.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2t"><title>Analysis population and missing data</title><p>Normally if a patient experiences DGF, they would remain in hospital for a minimum of 7&#x02005;days. Hence, for pragmatic reasons, if a patient is discharged from the hospital prior to 7&#x02005;days post-transplant and the patient is known to be alive at 7&#x02005;days post-transplant, then such patients will be imputed to have not experienced DGF. Some patients may also withdraw consent, be withdrawn or die during the conduct of the trial. In any of these cases, it is impossible to know whether such patients are either less or more likely to experience DGF had they not experienced early censoring. Sensitivity analyses will be performed to account for this.</p></sec><sec id="s2u"><title>Safety outcomes</title><p>Incidences of acute rejection, renal artery or renal vein thrombosis, complications of the renal transplant biopsy and the number of hospital admissions for any recognised complication of renal transplantation and immunosuppression will be summarised by arm.</p><p>The University of Cambridge and Cambridge University Hospital National Health Service (NHS) Foundation Trust will be the sponsor for this study. A Trial Steering Committee will meet six monthly to review the trial, monitor recruitment rates to consider protocol amendments and provide advice.
