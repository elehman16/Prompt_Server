The LMA is preferred for airway management in paediatric patients for short duration surgical procedures. The recently introduced ProSeal (PLMA), a modification of Classic LMA, has a gastric drainage tube placed lateral to main airway tube which allows the regurgitated gastric contents to bypass the glottis and prevents the pulmonary aspiration. This study was done to compare the efficacy of ProSeal LMA with an endotracheal tube in paediatric patients with respect to number of attempts for placement of devices, haemodynamic responses and perioperative respiratory complications. Sixty children, ASA I and II, weighing 10-20 kg between 2 and 8 years of age group of either sex undergoing elective ophthalmological and lower abdominal surgeries of 30-60 min duration, randomly divided into two groups of 30 patients each were studied. The number of attempts for endotracheal intubation was less than the placement of PLMA. Haemodynamic responses were significantly higher (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05) after endotracheal intubation as compared to the placement of PLMA. There were no significant differences in mean SpO<sub>2</sub> (%) and EtCO<sub>2</sub> levels recorded at different time intervals between the two groups. The incidence of post-operative respiratory complications cough and bronchospasm was higher after extubation than after removal of PLMA. The incidence of soft tissue trauma was noted to be higher for PLMA after its removal. There were no incidences of aspiration and hoarseness/sore throat in either group. It is concluded that ProSeal LMA can be safely considered as a suitable and effective alternative to endotracheal intubation in paediatric patients for short duration surgical procedures.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>ET tube</kwd><kwd>haemodynamic response</kwd><kwd>PLMA</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Children have been the earliest patrons of anaesthesiology from its earliest clinical applications of surgical anaesthesia.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT1">1</xref>] An endotracheal tube (ET) is always considered to be the gold standard[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT3">3</xref>] device to maintain an airway because of its inherent ability to provide positive pressure ventilation (PPV) and to prevent occurrences of gastric inflation and pulmonary aspiration.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT3">3</xref>] Haemodynamic responses, situations of failed intubation and damage to the oropharyngeal structures[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT3">3</xref>] during intubation are also a serious concern.

The paediatric PLMA lacks the dorsal cuff.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT5">5</xref>] The paediatric ProSeal LMA available sizes are 1, 1.5, 2 and 2.5.</p><p>In the present study we compared the PLMA (size 2) and ET tube with respect to number of attempts for the placement of devices, haemodynamic responses during placement and perioperative respiratory complications.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><p>After approval from institutional ethical committee, written informed consent was taken from all the parents. Sixty children of 2-8 years of age group of either sex, weighing 10-20 kg and belonging to physical status of ASA Grades I and II scheduled for elective ophthalmological and lower abdominal surgical procedures of 30-60 min duration were undertaken for the study. All the patients were randomly divided into two groups by a draw method (simple randomization) of either PLMA (group A) or ET (group B). Patients with the lack of written informed consent anticipated difficult airway, hiatus hernia, gastro-esophageal reflux diseases, cardio respiratory diseases, upper respiratory tract infection (URI), history of convulsions and full stomach were excluded from the study. A thorough preoperative assessment was done a day before surgery.</p><p>All patients were premedicated with i.v. Glycopyrrolate 0.004 mg/kg, i.v. Fentanyl 2 <italic>&#x000b5;</italic>g/kg and i.v. Ondansetron 0.1 mg/kg 5 min prior to induction of anaesthesia. Standard monitoring were applied which included precordial stethoscope, pulse oximeter, capnography, electrocardiography and automated noninvasive blood pressure (NIBP). Base line vital parameters were recorded. After preoxygenation, anaesthesia was induced with i.v. propofol 2 mg/kg mixed with i.v. lignocaine 0.5 mg/kg. Atracurium 0.5 mg/kg was used as neuromuscular blocking agent (NMBA) and intermittent boluses of i.v. atracurium 0.1 mg/kg were given as required.</p><p>PLMA size 2 was selected for group A patients, the cuff was fully deflated and posterior surface of PLMA was well lubricated with 2% lignocaine jelly. The child&#x02019;s head was maintained in the sniffing position. The PLMA was inserted through oral cavity using the index finger technique. The cuff was inflated with 7-10 ml of air as recommended by manufacturer. A number of insertion attempts were recorded. Three attempts were allowed for the placement before the device was considered a failure and the device was replaced with an ET tube. Removal of the device from mouth was termed as failed attempt. After obtaining an effective airway (defined as normal thoracoabdominal movements, bilaterally equal audible breath sounds on auscultation and a regular waveform on capnograph), the PLMA was fixed by taping over the chin. The PLMA position was confirmed by the gel displacement test, bilateral chest movements and square wave capnography. Gastric tube number 10 was inserted through a drain tube. Two attempts were allowed before gastric tube insertion was considered a failure and repositioning of PLMA was done. In group B patients, endotracheal intubation was done using appropriate size cuffed or uncuffed tubes. Uncuffed eETs were preferred for children younger than 6 years.</p><p>All patients were maintained on nitrous oxide 66% in oxygen and halothane 0.8-1% and manually ventilated using Jackson Ree&#x02019;s modification of Ayre&#x02019;s T-piece. EtCO<sub>2</sub> was maintained between 35 and 45 mmHg. Immediately after placement of PLMA and ET intubation, vital parameters were recorded. Haemodynamic parameters were recorded at 5 min and 10 min interval after placement of PLMA and intubation. At the end of surgery, anaesthetic agents were discontinued and patients were kept on 100% oxygen and i.v. glycopyrrolate 0.004 mg/kg followed by i.v. neostigmine 0.05 mg/kg for adequate reversal of residual neuromuscular blockade was given. After full deflation of cuff the PLMA was removed in a spontaneously breathing patient. Similarly, extubation was done after thorough oral suction.</p><p>During emergence, the occurrence of any complications like coughing, bronchospasm and laryngospasm was noted. After removal of both airway devices, blood staining of the ET tube and posterior aspect of cuff of PLMA, tongue-lip-dental trauma and hoarseness was recorded.</p><p>The patients were monitored throughout the perioperative period till stay in the post-anaesthesia care unit. The patients were followed for next 24 h for any sore throat and hoarseness.</p><p>For statistical analysis the data were analyzed using the SPSS software (6.0 version).

The other authors[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT12">12</xref>] also reported the similar findings.</p><p>There was no incidence of hoarseness or sore throat after removal of PLMA or ETT and postoperatively even after 24 h.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Based upon the above observations, results and discussion it is concluded that during routine paediatric surgical procedures of short duration, ProSeal LMA is useful alternative to endotracheal intubation. Though the PLMA is slightly difficult to place, effective airway can be achieved easily by an experienced anaesthesiologist and there are lower incidences of complications.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None
