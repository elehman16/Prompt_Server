It involves a
mixture of sensations, feelings, desires, overcomings, and challenges that make it a
complex, multidimensional process involving physiological and cognitive aspects. In
this sense it is important that companions be prepared and well trained to
participate in this moment, supporting and comforting the parturients and bringing
greater satisfaction to the process of delivery and birth. Stimulating the
participation of companions in delivery and birth is part of the qualification of
humanized childbirth care<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>1</sup>
</xref>. </p><p>Evidence shows that the continuous support from a companion who does not belong to
the hospital&#x02019;s professional team during the delivery provides several benefits for
the woman and the newborn<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>2</sup>
</xref>
<sup>-</sup>
<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>4</sup>
</xref>. It is necessary, therefore, to develop and evaluate educational
technologies for those who intend to participate in childbirth as companions, with
the purpose of disseminating and expanding the knowledge about the physiology and
care involved in the process of childbirth and techniques to support parturients.
The lack of preparation of companions has been highlighted as one of the reasons for
health institutions to prevent their presence<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>5</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>Based on the assumption that the development of educational technologies can
contribute to the empowerment and better performance of companions in the delivery
room, the manual entitled <italic>&#x0201c;Preparing to be a companion during vaginal birth:
what is important to know?&#x0201d;</italic>
<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>6</sup>
</xref>. This educational technology seeks to encourage the development of skills in
those who intend to participate in childbirth as companions. It is also an important
tool to dynamize the methodology used by nurses in the systematization of their
educational actions in the prenatal context. </p><p>It is presumed that companions with access to the educational manual will be better
prepared to provide support to parturients, bringing a positive effect on the
satisfaction of companions and puerperal women with the birthing process. From that
point on, the following question arose: will companions who have access to the
educational manual during prenatal care provide more support to the parturients,
leading to a greater satisfaction of companions and puerperal women with the process
of childbirth? Thus, the objective of the present study was to evaluate the
effectiveness of an educational manual in the instrumentalization of companions to
provide support to the parturient women and to check its influence on the
satisfaction of companions and women with the process of vaginal delivery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Method</title><p>This is a parallel, open, two-arm pilot Randomized Clinical Trial (RCT). Pilot
studies are conducted to guide decisions on how to outline recruitment, gauging and
intervention approaches and are particularly useful in studies on new forms of
intervention<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>7</sup>
</xref>. In this sense, with the aim to evaluate a new educational technology and in
view of the paucity of experimental studies assessing the impact of educational
interventions on the performance of companions in the delivery room, a Pilot Study
became necessary before the realization of a larger RCT. The methodology used was
the <italic>Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials</italic> (CONSORT) for
Non-Pharmacological Interventions<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>8</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>The study was developed in two primary care insititutions in Fortaleza (CE). These
Health Units were chosen because they are a reference to vaginal delivery of
habitual risk and accept the presence of companions during the process of
delivery.</p><p>The subjects of the study were the companions of women who underwent prenatal
consultation in the Centro de Parto Normal Ligia Barros Costa (CPN-LBC) and the
Centro Integrado de Educa&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o e Sa&#x000fa;de Casimiro Jos&#x000e9; de Lima Filho (CIESCJLF) and the
puerperal women who had the presence of a companion who participated in the prenatal
care. The inclusion criteria for companions were: having been chosen by the pregnant
woman to participate in delivery as a companion; having completed at least the
fourth year of elementary school (level of schooling compatible with the readability
index of the manual); and being companions of pregnant women with indication of
vaginal delivery (type of delivery for which the manual is directed). The criterion
of exclusion for companions was: prior experience as a companion during childbirth.
The criterion of inclusion for puerperal women was: having had vaginal delivery;
having had as a companion in the delivery room the same person approached in the
first phase of this study. The criteria for discontinuing the participation of
companions and puerperal women were: companions of pregnant women who progressed to
cesarean section (elective/emergency); withdrawal from the study after the start of
the collection; withdrawal or impossibility to be present at labor/delivery; choice
of another companion at the moment of childbirth; change of address and/or telephone
number that made the contact unfeasible after birth. Thus, the pairs (companion and
puerperal woman) were selected and analyzed.</p><p>Since this is a pioneering Pilot Clinical Trial to evaluate the impact of an
educational technology on the support provided by companions in the delivery room,
the sample size was not calculated. Thus, the sample corresponded to all the
companions (and the respective puerperae) recruited in the period, who met the
inclusion criteria and who completed the follow-up, that is, went through all phases
of the study. At the end, 65 companions, 21 in the Intervention Group (IG) and 44 in
the Control Group (CG) were selected.</p><p>The participants were recruited by the field team and randomized into the IG or CG
using sequence of random numbers generated at www.randomizer.org. The study was
blinded to the field team responsible for evaluation phases III and IV, specified
below. The IG was represented by the group of companions to whom the educational
manual was made available. The CG corresponded to the group of companions eligible
to participate in the survey who received the routine guidelines, characterized by
individual guidelines during prenatal care and the course for pregnant women (and
companions) promoted by the institutions. </p><sec><title>
<italic>Data collection tools</italic>
</title><p>Three instruments were used for data collection (two for companions and one for
the women). The <italic>instrument 1</italic> addressed the characterization of
the companions and items for assessment of their prior knowledge about support
techniques during childbirth. This instrument was applied to all eligible
companions who agreed to participate in the survey. It is a
<italic>baseline</italic> diagnostic tool (Phase 1). </p><p>The <italic>instrument 2</italic>, the Evaluation Form for Companions in the
Delivery Room, consisted of 22 questions and was applied to the companions
during the Phase 3 to evaluate the support provided and the satisfaction with
the experience in the delivery room. The instrument was composed of the
following topics: support actions carried out; satisfaction in being a companion
(labor and delivery); satisfaction with the support provided (labor and
delivery); satisfaction with the way the birth process occurred; satisfaction
with the delay (labor and delivery); satisfaction with the care provided by
health professionals (labor and delivery); evaluation of the usefulness of the
support provided and of the cooperation with health professionals. The score was
distributed as follows: one point for each support action performed by the
companion (questions 1 to 3) and a Likert-type response varying from one (none)
to four (very much) points for the questions 4 to 22. These questions assessed
the level of satisfaction of the companion with his or her experience. The final
score of the instrument consisted of the sum of the number of support actions
performed and the sum of the scores in the Likert-type questions. This
instrument was prepared based on a previous study<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>6</sup>
</xref> and evaluated by three researchers in the field of obstetrics.</p><p> The <italic>instrument 3</italic> was a questionnaire entitled Evaluation of the
Experience and Satisfaction of Puerperal Women with Labor and Delivery<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>9</sup>
</xref>. This questionnaire is divided into two parts: I. characterization of
the puerperal women (items 1 to 13); and II. The short version of the
Questionnaire of Experience and Satisfaction with Childbirth (QESC) (items 14 to
51). This instrument was applied to women during the Phase 4. </p><p>The QESC has already been used and validated in a Brazilian study<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>10</sup>
</xref> and is divided into 8 subscales, of which the following were selected
for the present study: - Subscale 2 - Positive Experience, consisting of 22
items related to the confirmation of expectations, self-control,
self-confidence, knowledge, pleasure and satisfaction with the experience of
childbirth; - Subscale 3 - Negative experience, consisting of 12 items that
refer to fear, malaise and pain during labor and delivery; - Subscale 4 -
Relaxation, consisting of 6 items related to the experience of relaxation during
labor and delivery; - Subscale 6 - Companion&#x02019;s support, consisting of 8 items
specifically related to the support of the companion. Items with negative topics
such as pain, fear, malaise and worry have a reverse score.</p><p> The QESC has a good internal consistency (Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha = 0.9087) and
test-retest fidelity index of 0.586<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>9</sup>
</xref>, allowing the consistent and reliable evaluation of the different
dimensions that are relevant to the experience of childbirth.</p></sec><sec><title>
<italic>Data colletion</italic>
</title><p>Data collection was performed in four phases, with three different teams of
collaborators: one team responsible for Phase I, another responsible for Phase
II and one responsible for Phases III and IV. The collaborators were previously
trained and followed the guidelines of the Standard Operational Protocol
developed for each phase of the study. The operationalization of the data
collection took place as follows: </p><p>
<italic>Phase I (Baseline):</italic> interviews with companions to identify
their sociodemographic profile and prior knowledge about support techniques. The
form (Instrument 1) and Informed Consent Term (TCLE) were placed in sealed and
numbered envelopes, which were randomized to either IG or CG;</p><p>
<italic>Phase II (Intervention):</italic> after the randomization of the
participants, the names and respective contacts of companions were given by the
researcher to the team responsible for the intervention group. The companions
selected for this group were invited to attend the institution, at a date and
time previously scheduled. During the intervention, the educational manual was
introduced and read, openig the possibility of interruption for expressing
doubts or for making comments. A printed version of the manual was delivered to
the participants and they were requested to keep the manual confidential, not
lending or replicating this material in order to prevent the companions of the
control group from having access to it, since this material is not yet a
publication of public domain. Each intervention had an average duration of 20
minutes. </p><p>The manual in question consists of 38 illustrations and 11 topics that deal
sequentially from the preparation to go to the Maternity until the puerperal
period. The topics covered in the handbook are: Few days before delivery
(changes in the woman&#x02019;s body that indicate the approach of delivery); Knowing
the woman&#x02019;s body (anatomy of the reproductive organs); Signs and symptoms of
labor (events that indicate the onset of labor); Arriving at the maternity
hospital (documents that should be brougth and professionals who can act in the
delivery room, presenting the duties of each one of them); Techniques of pain
relief at childbirth (benefit of each of the methods and how the companion can
offer them to the woman); How does normal delivery happen? (the physiological
mechanism of vaginal delivery); Rights and duties of the woman and the
companion; and Notions of Citizenship (birth certificate and maternity and
parental leave). The manual has already been evaluated by representatives of the
target public and validated as to its appearance and content by specialists in
the area of &#x0200b;&#x0200b;women&#x02019;s health and/or obstetrics<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>6</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>
<italic>Phase III (Evaluation of the support provided by the companion in the
delivery room):</italic> a telephone contact was made to the companion had
already participated in labor and delivery (if the pregnant woman had not yet
given birth, another call was made after one week). If the pregnant woman had
progressed to a cesarean section or if her companion had not participated in the
birth process, the reason that impeded the participation of the companion was
recorded. If the participant had been at the delivery, the team applied the
Instrument 2 (described above). </p><p>
<italic>Phase IV (Satisfaction of the woman with the childbirth
experience):</italic> the Instrument 3 was used in this phase, also
performed through a telephone contact. To evaluate the satisfaction of the woman
with the process of childbirth, the following variables were considered: 1. to
which extent the form of the labor process and the felt pain met her
expectations; 2. to which extent was the woman able to relax and how useful was
the relaxation provided; 3. how confident she felt and the situation under
control; 4. to which extent she counted on the help of the companion and how
useful that help was; 5. how much knowledge she had about the relative events
during the birthing process; 6. level of fear, malaise, pleasure/satisfaction
during the labor process; 7. how much she cooperated with health professionals;
and 8. how much she remembers how painful the process of childbirth was; and the
satisfaction with the form, time and intensity of pain during labor and
delivery, variables corresponding to QESC Subsections 2, 3, 4 and 6. </p></sec><sec><title>
<italic>Evaluated outcomes</italic>
</title><p>The primary outcome was the support provided by the companion who used the
educational manual, measured by the number of support actions (emotional,
physical, informational and intermediation) provided by the companion to the
parturient. The secondary outcomes were the satisfaction of the companion and
the woman with the process of childbirth, as measured through the Instruments II
and III. These indicators were used to evaluate the effectiveness of the
educational manual.</p><p>The control variables were: sociodemographic data of the companion: sex, age,
marital status, schooling and family income; participation of the companion in
educational strategies during prenatal care; degree of kinship of the companion;
sociodemographic variables of the puerperal woman: age, marital status,
schooling, family income; obstetric variables: number of gestations, births,
abortions, stillbirths, living children; numbers of prenatal consultations
performed by the puerperal woman; and participation of the puerperal woman in
educational activities carried out during the prenatal period. Before analyzing
the outcomes of the study, the similarity between the groups and the existence
of confounding factors were verified.</p><p>The data were analyzed using the <italic>Statistical Package for the Social
Sciences</italic> (SPSS), version 20.0. The
<italic>Kolmogorov-Smirnov</italic> (KS) was used to verify the normality of
continuous data. The groups were compared at the baseline and after the
intervention, in separate analyses. The chi-square and <italic>Fisher
exact</italic> tests (categorical variables) and the <italic>Student
t-test</italic> or <italic>Mann-Whitney</italic> test (continuous variables)
were used in these comparisons. The correlations were evaluated by means of the
<italic>Spearman correlation</italic> index. The Relative Risk (RR) and the
95% confidence intervals were calculated for the main dependent variables, with
a critical alpha of 0.05 to determine the level of significance.</p><p>The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the Federal University
of Cear&#x000e1; (n&#x000ba; 576.174/14) and registered in the database of the Brazilian
Clinical Trials Registry (ReBEC) (RBR-776d9s). The study participants signed an
ICF, and their anonymity was assured, according to the norms of Resolution n&#x000ba;
466/12 of the National Health Council of the Ministry of Health.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>A total of 65 companions and puerperae participated in the study, 21 in IG and 44 in

</p><p>Women whose companions participated in the GI had greater confirmation of
expectations, self-control, self-confidence, knowledge, pleasure and satisfaction
with the experience of childbirth (Subscale 2), reported lower levels of fear,
malaise and pain (subscale 3), felt more relaxed (Subscale 4) and had a better
evaluation of the support provided by the companion (Subscale 5) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t4">Table 4</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The results of this study show that the educational manual is an effective technology
to instrumentalize companions to carry out support actions to parturient women,
especially actions of physical support. This has a positive influence on the
satisfaction of the companions and puerperal women with the experience of
accompanying and experience the birth, respectively.</p><p>The companions that participated in the study have characteristics similar to those
of other studies regarding age, years of schooling, sex, and degree of kinship with
the women<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>11</sup>
</xref>
<sup>-</sup>
<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>13</sup>
</xref>. This shows that the sample studied represents well the Brazilian reality. </p><p>The groups did not differ as to the previous knowledge about the support techniques
for the parturient women, with emphasis on the reports of supportive actions more
present in common sense and those of emotional support. This underscores the
importance of health services to offer and encourage the participation of pregnant
women and their companions in educational strategies for childbirth preparation,
providing counseling, education, trust and support<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>14</sup>
</xref>.</p><p> As shown in the flowchart of the study participants, most of the baseline sample was
not a companion to the parturient. The main reasons were a change of companion,
restrictions of the health service (not acceptance of male companion) and cesarean
section without the presence of a companion. Several Brazilian maternity hospitals
still do not accept the presence of companions, or accept it partially (during labor
only). Among the factors that prevent the inclusion of companions are the
non-acceptance by the professionals and the inadequate organizational structure of
the services. Specifically in caesarean sections, lack of material resources
(dressing and aprons) and increased risk of infection are the main limiting
factors<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>13</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>The findings here show that almost all the companions used some technique to support
the parturient, more frequently the techniques of emotional and physical support, in
this order. Lack of knowledge is still one of the main barriers to the use of
non-pharmacological methods of pain relief among companions<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>15</sup>
</xref>. In the comparison of the groups, it was observed that the companions in the
GI performed a greater variety of support actions, and were more likely to perform
physical support techniques. This indicates the effectiveness of the educational
manual for the empowerment of companions and, consequently, for their role in
providing support to the parturient. It is worth emphasizing that the educational
manual must back the knowledge of the companion regarding the various support
actions available, but these actions must be carried out according to the needs of
the parturient. </p><p>Participants who used the educational manual evaluated more positively the experience
of accompanying childbirth. Among the possible justifications for this finding are:
greater satisfaction and feeling of being useful when seing that the support
provided increases the well-being of the mothers; less fear and anxiety due to the
greater knowledge on the physiology of childbirth, the role of health professionals,
and the procedures to be performed (subjects covered in the manual). </p><p>O study brought an unexpected and extremely important finding, going beyond its
initial goal. The companions who had access to the educational manual, besides
providing more support actions and better evaluation of their experience as
companions, also made a more critical analysis of the quality of care provided by
the health team. The educational intervention seems to have favored the empowerment
of the companions, making them more demanding and questioning, a fact that may
justify the greater dissatisfaction of the IG with the health professionals and with
the way the labor process occurred. </p><p>Research that investigated the involvement of fathers during pregnancy and childbirth
found that those who did not have qualification during prenatal care felt unprepared
because they did not know how to help their wives, and impotent because they were
mere spectators, they did not understand the work nor their role in this
process<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>16</sup>
</xref>. In another study, fathers who had access to an educational intervention of
preparation for childbirth had a lower risk of experiencing the childbirth event in
a frightening way and feeling unprepared for birth<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>17</sup>
</xref>. </p><p>The educational manual, besides positively influencing the quality of the support
provided by the companions in the delivery room, also contributed to the better
evaluation of the women with respect to the experience of childbirth. A similar
finding was obtained in a study that investigated the interference of the support
provided by companions in the assessment of women regarding the experience of giving
birth. The study found that the amount of support provided had a significant
association with a positive evaluation of the women<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>18</sup>
</xref>. It is worth mentioning that the positive experience of the childbirth
process also depends on factors such as availability and accessibility to health
services, information and support networks, as well as the model of care provided by
health professionals and the adoption of evidence-based practices<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>19</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>The present study allowed the delimitation of parameters for sample calculation in
the definitive study, considering the mean difference in the outcome (number of
support actions provided by companions). It was also possible to detect the need for
adjustments in the data collection process, in order to minimize the interruption of
the losses in the follow-up. It is recommended to ask the participants for a
telephone contact of their close relatives in order to help when the attempts to
contact the companion/postpartum woman are not successful. It is also necessary to
do home visits to the addresses provided in the identification section and/or by
Community Health Agents, to interview the participants that could not be contacted
by telephone. As a limitation of the study, it is worth mentioning the absence of
psychometrically validated Brazilian instruments geared at the evaluation of the
support provided by the companion. Another limitation is the disparity in the
numbers of participants in the IG and CG.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The educational manual allowed the companion to provide a greater number and variety
of actions to support the parturient. In addition, the use of the manual by the
companions had a positive effect on the satisfaction of companions and women with
the birthing process. In this sense, the manual is an effective educational
technology to be used with this target audience. </p><p>We suggest the realization of further studies to evaluate the effectiveness of other
educational interventions that potentiate the abilities of companions as providers
of support to the women during the labor process and to evaluate the influence of
this support on maternal and neonatal outcomes.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>Refer&#x000ea;ncias</title><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Werner</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Uldbjerg</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><name><surname>Zachariae</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>CS</given-names></name><name><surname>Nohr</surname><given-names>EA</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Antenatal hypnosis training and childbirth experience a
