In humans, these effects are less well established. Insulin detemir is a basal insulin analog that causes less weight gain than other basal insulin formulations, including the current standard intermediate-long acting Neutral Protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin. Due to its structural modifications, which render the molecule more lipophilic, it was proposed that insulin detemir enters the brain more readily than other insulins. The aim of this study was to investigate whether insulin detemir treatment differentially modifies brain activation in response to food stimuli as compared to NPH insulin. In addition, cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) insulin levels were measured after both treatments. Brain responses to viewing food and non-food pictures were measured using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging in 32 type 1 diabetic patients, after each of two 12-week treatment periods with insulin detemir and NPH insulin, respectively, both combined with prandial insulin aspart. CSF insulin levels were determined in a subgroup. Insulin detemir decreased body weight by 0.8 kg and NPH insulin increased weight by 0.5 kg (<italic>p</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.02 for difference), while both treatments resulted in similar glycemic control. After treatment with insulin detemir, as compared to NPH insulin, brain activation was significantly lower in bilateral insula in response to visual food stimuli, compared to NPH (<italic>p</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.02 for right and <italic>p</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.05 for left insula). Also, CSF insulin levels were higher compared to those with NPH insulin treatment (<italic>p</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.003). Our findings support the hypothesis that in type 1 diabetic patients, the weight sparing effect of insulin detemir may be mediated by its enhanced action on the central nervous system, resulting in blunted activation in bilateral insula, an appetite-regulating brain region, in response to food stimuli.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00626080?term=incerebro&#x00026;rank=1">NCT00626080</ext-link>.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by an Investigator Initiated Grant of Novo Nordisk A/S.

Animal studies have shown that disrupted intracerebral insulin signaling causes weight gain and that intracerebroventricular insulin administration reduces food intake and body weight <xref rid="pone.0094483-Obici1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094483-Woods1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. In humans, central insulin action was studied using intranasal insulin <xref rid="pone.0094483-Born1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>; acute intranasal insulin promoted satiety and reduced snacking in the postprandial state in women <xref rid="pone.0094483-Hallschmid1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> and resulted in weight loss in the longer term in men <xref rid="pone.0094483-Hallschmid2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. However, it is not clear whether effects of intranasal insulin are completely independent of insulin's peripheral action. Besides, intranasal insulin is not clinically available.</p><p>Patients with type 1 diabetes (T1DM) require treatment with multiple subcutaneous insulin injections daily. Insulin detemir (ID) is a more recently developed basal insulin analog, that has been associated with body weight loss compared to weight gain after treatment with other basal insulin formulations <xref rid="pone.0094483-RussellJones1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. ID differs from human insulin in that threonine at position B30 has been removed and that lysine at B29 has been acylated with myristic acid, a 14-carbon fatty acid. This fatty-acid moiety stabilizes ID self-association and enables the binding to albumin, which gives ID its long-acting properties <xref rid="pone.0094483-Morales1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. It has been hypothesized <xref rid="pone.0094483-Hermansen1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> that due to the fatty acid moiety, ID more easily enters the brain, thereby potentially promoting satiety in relevant CNS regions and reducing appetite, food intake and body weight. Accordingly, ID may have stronger effects in modulating brain functions than other long-acting insulin formulations: ID, administered intravenously, enhanced cortical activity compared to human insulin (as measured by electroencephalography, EEG and magnetoencephalography, MEG) and decreased food intake in both preclinical <xref rid="pone.0094483-Hennige1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> and clinical studies <xref rid="pone.0094483-Tschritter1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094483-Hallschmid3" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. However, the effects of ID on appetite regulating brain regions during food stimuli have not been studied and no data are available regarding insulin concentrations in human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) during insulin treatment and its relation to insulin's central actions.</p><p>In previous functional MRI (fMRI) studies, it was shown that obese subjects show hyperactivation to food pictures in brain networks linked to motivation, reward and cognitive control <xref rid="pone.0094483-Bruce1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094483-Rothemund1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> and that fMRI hyperactivation to high-calorie food pictures predicts weight gain <xref rid="pone.0094483-Murdaugh1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. In the present study, fMRI was used to test the hypothesis that treatment with ID modifies activation in appetite regulating brain regions in response to visual food stimuli compared to regular treatment with Neutral Protamine Hagedorn insulin (NPH). The study was performed in T1DM patients since these patients are insulin-deficient, allowing the assessment of effects attributable to exogenous insulin per se. Indeed, differences were observed in brain activation between treatment with ID and NPH.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0094483.s001">Checklist S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0094483.s002">Protocol S1</xref>.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>The study was approved by the Medical Ethics Review Committee of the VU University Medical Center (VUMC) and the Central Committee on Research involving Human Subjects; the study was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki.

Since NPH and ID can be visually distinguished as NPH is a cloudy solution that needs to be mixed before injection, while the ID preparation is available as a clear solution, blinding of insulin treatment was not possible.

Before image acquisition started, participants performed a test task to ensure that the task was understood properly. The real task consisted of eleven pseudo-randomized blocks, each block containing three to eight different pictures of the same category. In order to control for attention lapses, participants were requested to make indoor-outdoor judgments using an MRI-compatible response box. Each block was followed by one to three scrambled arrows (left or right), to which participants had to respond by indicating the direction of the arrow. Each stimulus (picture and arrow) was shown for four seconds, followed by an inter-stimulus interval (fixation cross) of 1.5 to 2.5 seconds. The task lasted approximately eight minutes. Since each patient was scanned twice, two different versions of the task, with equal design, were presented. The order of scanning versions was randomized across subjects, to prevent order effects.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Image acquisition and analysis</title><p>MRI data were acquired on a 3.0 T GE SignaHDxt scanner (General Electric, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA).

Interestingly, in a subgroup of patients, we found higher serum and CSF insulin levels after ID than after NPH treatment.</p><p>The insula, the region in which lower BOLD signal was observed, is relevant in the processing of food cues and craving for food <xref rid="pone.0094483-Siep1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> and is assumed to be involved in food choices <xref rid="pone.0094483-Piech1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Insulin acts in the CNS to induce satiety and inhibit food intake and weight gain, and insulin receptors are also present at high concentrations in the cerebral (insular) cortex, and are accessible via the CSF <xref rid="pone.0094483-Woods2" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Therefore, ID may have both direct and indirect effects on the insula, ultimately resulting in reduced neural activation and suppression of the BOLD signal.</p><p>Whether the lower BOLD activation during visual food stimuli after ID treatment is cause or consequence of the observed weight loss cannot be determined from our study. Two prospective studies <xref rid="pone.0094483-Murdaugh1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094483-Yokum1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> however, demonstrated that enhanced brain responses to food cues can predict future weight gain. Further evidence for a direct effect of ID on the CNS comes from studies using systemic infusions in mice and humans which resulted in acute changes in EEG and MEG as well as ensuing reductions in food intake <xref rid="pone.0094483-Hennige1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0094483-Hallschmid3" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.</p><p>Interestingly, a positive correlation was found between BOLD signal in bilateral insula and treatment-related body weight change only after treatment with NPH. Although no definite causal relationship may be inferred from this finding, it may be speculated that NPH modifies food-related activity in appetite regulating brain regions in a way that promotes weight gain.</p><p>Studies in mice investigating whether or not ID crosses the blood-brain-barrier used acute infusions and showed conflicting results: in one study a prefential brain tissue effect of ID was found after intravenous insulin injection, whereas in the other study it was shown that ID does not cross the mouse blood-brain-barrier at all <xref rid="pone.0094483-Hennige1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094483-Banks1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. In humans, information on CSF insulin levels during treatment with various insulin formulations is lacking. Since (long-standing) T1DM is associated with absence of endogenous insulin production, patients with T1DM seem an attractive model to determine CSF insulin levels that should entirely reflect the result of exogenous administration of insulin. Although our study is the first to perform LP procedures to this end in T1DM, due to the associated discomfort and potential side-effects, a relatively small number of patients consented to undergo this procedure twice during the course of the study. Nevertheless, in this relatively small sample, increased CSF insulin levels were found in patients treated with ID versus NPH, in spite of comparable daily basal insulin doses, supporting the hypothesis that ID crosses the BBB more readily than NPH, or that clearance of ID from the CSF occurs at a slower rate.</p><p>In the present study we focused on ID action in the brain, but other mechanisms underlying its weight reducing effect have been proposed, e.g. increased energy expenditure and reduced frequency of hypoglycemia. However, in a randomized cross-over study <xref rid="pone.0094483-Zachariah1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> comparing ID and NPH insulin treatment no difference in energy expenditure between both treatments was observed. Since ID treatment results in more stable insulin levels and a greater effect on glucose metabolism in the liver than in peripheral tissues <xref rid="pone.0094483-Hordern1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, it has also been suggested that the weight difference between NPH and ID is due to a reduced frequency of hypoglycemia with ID <xref rid="pone.0094483-Davies1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. As patients not systematically reported all hypoglycemias (and snacking) during the present study, we cannot rule out that a reduced hypoglycemia (and snacking) frequency caused the differences in body weight. However, this hypothesis is unlikely to fully explain the weight-sparing effect of ID, as supported by the fact that other studies demonstrated that insulin glargine, when causing the same frequency of hypoglycemia as ID, resulted in more weight gain.</p><p>Limitations of the study include the non-blinded study design: NPH and ID can be visually distinguished as NPH is a cloudy solution that needs to be mixed before injection, while the ID preparation is available as a clear solution. However, worldwide, NPH is the standard (intermediate) long-acting human insulin and therefore the best active comparator. Moreover, since subjects were not aware of the food-related nature of the experiment, it is unlikely that knowledge of the type of insulin treatment has influenced the BOLD effects in our study. Additionally, possible confounders that could have accounted for the observed differences in CNS responses to food cues include HbA1c or prevailing glucose and/or insulin plasma levels. We deliberately chose to study patients in a real-life setting as compared to an acute exposure (e.g. clamp condition), since it is unclear whether this artificial condition can be extrapolated to real-life conditions in which weight differences are observed. In the present study, adjustment for glycemic variables and insulin levels did not alter the fMRI-measured results. Preferably, a cross-over trial should have a wash-out period to avoid carry-over effects. However, since all type 1 diabetes patients need some type of long-acting insulin every day, insulin washout was not an option. An alternative option to minimize carry-over effects is to lengthen treatment periods <xref rid="pone.0094483-JonesB1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. In our study, we lengthened the period of both treatments from the originally planned 8 weeks to 12 weeks. Since the duration of action of NPH and ID on glucose metabolism is less than 24 h, we expect that lengthening the treatment period to 12 weeks was sufficient. Weight gain associated with insulin treatment is relevant for both T1DM and type 2 diabetic (T2DM) patients although this side effect of insulin treatment may be more relevant in T2DM patients who generally are already overweight or obese. Although it is tempting to generalize our findings to T2DM, this study should be repeated in T2DM patients in future investigations.</p><p>In summary, the present study expands the limited data available, describing the effects of insulin on the human brain. We showed that a 12-week treatment with ID, compared to NPH, resulted in weight loss in T1DM patients, which was paralleled by decreased brain activation in the bilateral insula in response to visual food stimuli. Furthermore, ID versus NPH treatment resulted in elevated CSF insulin levels. These findings support the hypothesis that the weight sparing effect of ID may, at least in part, be mediated by its enhanced action in the CNS that interferes with food-related activation in appetite regulating brain regions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0094483.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>
