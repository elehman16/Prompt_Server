It may be precipitated by reversible causes like pain and muscle spasm secondary to local inflammation, infection, and trauma, etc. or a consequence of irreversible causes such as neoplasm, fibrosis, and trauma.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] This makes the airway access a difficult task for the anesthesiologist. Preoperative mandibular nerve block has been suggested to reproduce maximal possible mouth opening and thus, safer anesthetic induction in such patients, by alleviating the source of reversible trismus.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] However, a documented failure rate of around 20% may preclude this conventional technique as an ideal approach for this purpose, especially in trauma patients where anatomical location of the nerve may be disturbed.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Furthermore, the requirement of a larger volume of local anesthetic with this technique makes the patients prone to associated complications.</p><p>The use of ultrasound may help to target the mandibular nerve more reliably, thereby reducing the amount of local anesthetic required and decreasing the incidence of complications. Use of ultrasound-guided (USG) mandibular nerve block has been described in literature but current data is limited to case reports only.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Thus, the purpose of this study is to access the relative efficacy of USG mandibular nerve block in predicting safe anesthetic induction in unilateral mandibular fracture patients presenting with acute pain and trismus.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>After institutional ethical approval and written informed consent, all patients belonging to American Society of Anesthesiologist physical Status I and II, aged 18&#x02013;65 years, body mass index 25&#x02013;30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, presenting as unilateral mandibular fracture with acute pain and trismus, in between July 2014 and December 2014, were included in this prospective, randomized controlled, outcome assessor blinded trial (registered in Indian clinical trial registry). Exclusion criteria included a requirement for rapid sequence induction, hemodynamic instability, absent incisors, end-organ dysfunction, pregnancy, psychiatric disorders, history of limited mouth opening, recent analgesic, sedative or muscle relaxant consumption, and any contraindication for mandibular nerve block.</p><p>Patients' characteristics, fracture side, inter-incisor distance, and pain score (using a 100-mm Visual Analog Scale [VAS]) were noted in neutral head position. Enrolled patients were randomly assigned to two equal groups by computer generated random numbers and concealed via sealed opaque envelope technique. Group V received mandibular nerve block via intra-oral Vazirani-Akinosi (VA) technique; Group U received above block via USG technique.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>VA technique</title><p>With teeth occluded, lips were retracted. The needle and syringe were aligned parallel to the occlusal plane, at a level just superior to the maxillary molars. The needle penetrated the mucosa just medial to the ramus, and it was advanced to a depth of 2.5 cm. Now, a volume of 10 ml bupivacaine (0.5%) was injected on the affected site (i.e. where surgical intervention was planned) after negative aspiration.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Ultrasound-guided technique</title><p>A linear ultrasound probe (8&#x02013;13 MHz [12 L-RS probe]; GE Healthcare LOGIQ e portable USG machine) was placed superior to the mandible in a transverse orientation on the same side of fracture site. The condyle of mandible was traced and anterior to the condyle; mandibular nerve was identified as an ovoid to round hyperechoic structure adjacent to the alveolar artery and vein [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. A blunt tip needle (22-gauge, 5 cm length) was inserted superior to the probe using an out of plane technique and advanced until it is adjacent to the mandibular nerve. Now, 3 ml of 0.5% Bupivacaine was injected after negative aspiration. In case, the mandibular nerve was not visualized by this plane, a cardiac probe (2.8&#x02013;4 MHz [3S RS probe]; GE Healthcare LOGIQ e portable USG machine) was chosen and placed in an oblique transverse position below the zygoma and anterior to the mandibular condyle. The lateral pterigoid plate was located, and posterior to the plate, the mandibular nerve was identified as a hyperechoic round to oval structure deep to maxillary and alveolar artery [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>]. Now, a blunt tip needle (22-gauge, 5 cm length) was inserted posterior to the probe using an in-line technique. The needle was advanced until it is adjacent to the nerve and a volume of 3 ml bupivacaine (0.5%) was injected after negative aspiration.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Linear transducer position and location of mandibular nerve, alveolar artery and vein</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AER-10-184-g001"/></fig><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Cardiac transducer position and location of mandibular artery and nerve</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AER-10-184-g002"/></fig><p>After the procedure, inter-incisor distance and pain score were re-evaluated at 30 min, in both the groups. Patients with continued pain (VAS &#x0003e; 30) were regarded as &#x0201c;block failure&#x0201d; and any block or drug-related complications were noted. Now all patients were intubated as per ASA difficult airway algorithm, and general anesthesia (GA) was induced with propofol, fentanyl, and rocuronium. The mouth was then opened maximally, and inter-incisor distance was again measured, to reassess any further increase in above parameter after GA induction. Patients with continued limited mouth opening even after GA were regarded as &#x0201c;mechanical obstruction.&#x0201d; Data collection and monitoring were done by an investigator blinded to group allocation.</p><p>To detect a 20% difference in the block failures with an expected standard deviation of 25% estimated from initial pilot observations; power analysis, with &#x003b1; = 0.05, &#x003b2; = 0.20, show that we required to enroll 26 patients per group.

All such patients admitted during the study period were screened for eligibility, with the target to include at least 26 patients per group. Of 126 patients screened for our study during the study duration, 68 patients meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria were initially randomized into two study groups. Four patients were later excluded: In two patients, mandibular nerve could not be identified by ultrasonography (Group U), in other two patients there was hemorrhagic tap during the procedure (Group V). Thus, 64 patients (32 in each group) completed the study successfully [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>].</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Flow chart of patients studied</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AER-10-184-g003"/></fig><p>Baseline demographics, ASA grade, inter-incisor distance, and VAS scores were similar among both the groups [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>].

Previous studies on VA technique have documented an anesthetic failure rate of about 20% with this procedure.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] However, Heard <italic>et al</italic>. reported successful nerve blockade in all six patients of the similar subset as of our study; a strong emphasis could not be laid upon such results, as it was not a suitably powered trial having a small sample size.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] We observed significantly decreased postblock VAS scores with both the techniques, except for six block failures following the VA procedure, where patients had continued pain and limited mouth opening. Inter-incisor distance increased significantly in these patients after GA induction. Here, inter-individual anatomical variations, swelling and inflammation or blind needle placement technique, all or any of them could have contributed to displaced position of mandibular nerve leading to block failure with VA approach. Seven patients (3 with VA and 4 with USG technique) where the cause of trismus was possibly mechanical (due to trauma, swelling, or other risk factors), inter-incisor distance remained limited even after GA induction. For all other patients, the increase in inter-incisor distance after nerve blockade was nearly maximal and the postinduction inter-incisor distance did not changed significantly from the postblock values in both the compared techniques.</p><p>Reversal of trismus was likely due to pain relief and muscle relaxation in the mandibular nerve supply area, after the block procedure. Increased mouth opening then allowed the attending anesthesiologist to carry out crucial airway assessment for other predictors of the difficult airway, and direct laryngoscopy-guided endotracheal intubation was performed in majority of patients, where airway was otherwise normal. While USG technique allowed us to precisely segregate all the patients who genuinely required awake fibreoptic intubation; in VA technique a safer strategy for airway management of 6 block failures could not be predicted.</p><p>Previous trials have used 1.5&#x02013;2.0 ml of local anesthetic in VA approach for performing various dental procedures.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Potocnik and Bajrovic observed that even if there is no procedural flaw, inflammation could increase the mandibular block failure rate to 45% with routine local anesthetic volume.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Data on trismus is relatively scarce and limited to case reports only; with stated volume usage varying from 5 to 10 ml.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] As the extent of inflammation and swelling is expected to be higher in trauma patients, we preferred maximally effective, safer drug volume (10 ml) documented for VA technique. We, however, acknowledge that a dose&#x02013;response study could provide better insight into ideal choice of local anesthetic and its optimal dose or concentration for performing VA procedure in trismus patients. Data on USG technique are altogether uniform, so we utilized similar methodology and drug volume (3 ml) in this group.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Block related complication included hemorrhagic tap in two patients while performing VA technique. Above procedure was abandoned in these patients, and further management included close observation followed by awake fibreoptic intubation with no other sequel. Drug-related adverse effects included itching in upper lips and lower eyelid (25% patients) by VA technique. Previous studies have observed this side effect in 8% patients while other complications were reported rarely.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Higher incidence in our study could be attributed to larger local anesthetic volume (10 ml) injected via VA technique, which led to greater drug distribution toward the affected area, precipitating as paresis of the infraorbital nerve. No such deleterious effects were observed in any patient where USG nerve block was performed in our study. Ultrasound guidance allowed us to precisely target the mandibular nerve and reduced the dose of local anesthetic needed for nerve blockade, thereby diminishing any chance of complications related to tissue injury or drug insufflations to adjacent structures.</p><p>The limitations of our study include a relatively small sample size in proportion to the burden of problem. Our results may vary from studies done on other ethnic groups owing to variations in jaw texture, and subjective anesthetic sensitivity. Further trails could investigate the utility of mandibular nerve block in trismus patients with multiple facial fractures.</p><p>We conclude that USG mandibular nerve block can effectively predict safer anesthetic induction in patients presenting with acute trismus. It helped in segregating patients on the basis of postblock results and decision on a safer airway management procedure was then attained precisely, by assessing other predictors of a difficult airway.</p><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Declaration of patient consent</title><p>The authors certify that they have obtained all appropriate patient consent forms.
