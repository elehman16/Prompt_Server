Patients had a baseline Modified Mayo Disease Activity Index (MMDAI) score &#x02265;5 but &#x02264;10, with subscale ratings &#x02265;2 for rectal bleeding and endoscopic appearance. The MMDAI score is the sum of 4 subscale scores: stool frequency, rectal bleeding, endoscopic appearance, and physician's global assessment. Since publication of the original MMDAI,<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> the endoscopic appearance subscale was modified to classify patients with any degree of friability with a subscale score of 2. Exclusion criteria included the use of systemic, oral, topical, or rectal corticosteroids or laxatives or enemas (other than mesalamine) during the preceding 14 days. Concomitant use of a stable oral 5-ASA regimen was permitted at doses up to 4.8 g/d. Rectal 5-ASA use was discontinued during the run-in phase of the study (i.e., 4&#x02013;7 days before randomization) and was not permitted during the studies.</p><p>The protocol was approved by institutional review boards and ethics committees.

Each study was comprised of a 2-week screening phase, a run-in/stabilization phase of 4 to 7 days, a 6-week treatment phase, and a 2-week follow-up phase (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). During the run-in phase, patients received single-blind placebo rectal foam twice daily, to familiarize themselves with study drug administration. In the treatment phase of each study, patients were randomized 1:1 to receive budesonide rectal foam 2 mg/25 mL twice daily for 2 weeks, then once daily for 4 weeks, or matching placebo. A colonoscopy was required for patients with newly diagnosed UC or without a confirmed diagnosis of UC within 12 months of the screening visit. Colonoscopy, if necessary, was performed no greater than 10 days and no less than 4 days before randomization. For patients not meeting the requirement for colonoscopy, a sigmoidoscopy was scheduled 4 to 7 days before randomization.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>FIGURE 1.</label><caption><p>Study design. b.i.d., twice daily; EOS, end of study; EOT, end of trial; q.d., once daily; R, randomization.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ibd-22-1881-g001"/></fig></sec><sec id="s1-3"><title>Assessments</title><p>Subgroup analyses for the primary, key secondary, and safety endpoints were performed for patients with baseline oral 5-ASA use (i.e., at the time the first study dose [budesonide foam or placebo] was received) during the studies.
