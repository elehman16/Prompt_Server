In total, 83 patients were recruited: 40 currently depressed patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale-17 items (HDRS-17) score &#x0003e;17) (study 1) and 43 patients with bipolar disorder (BD) in partial remission (HDRS-17 and Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) &#x02264; 14) (study 2). In both studies, patients were randomised to receive eight weekly EPO (Eprex; 40,000 IU) or saline (0.9% NaCl) infusions in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel&#x02014;group design. Plasma BDNF levels were measured at baseline and at weeks 5, 9 and at follow up, week 14. In contrast with our hypothesis, EPO down regulated plasma BDNF levels in patients with TRD (mean reduction at week 9 (95% CI): EPO 10.94 ng/l (4.51-21.41 ng/l); mean increase at week 9: Saline 0.52 ng/l, p=0.04 (-5.88-4.48 ng/l) p=0.04, partial &#x0014b;<sup>2</sup>=0.12). No significant effects were found on BDNF levels in partially remitted patients with BD (p=0.35). The present effects of EPO on BDNF levels in patients with TRD point to a role of neurotrophic factors in the potential effects of EPO seen in TRD and BD. The neurobiological mechanisms underlying these effects and the interaction between EPO and peripheral levels on BDNF need to be further elucidated in human studies including a broad range of biomarkers.</p><sec id="sec001"><title>Trial Registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00916552">NCT00916552</ext-link>.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The study was funded by the Danish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Higher Education, Novo Nordisk Foundation, Beckett Fonden, Savv&#x000e6;rksejer Juhl&#x02019;s Mindefond, and the Augustinus Foundation.

Bipolar disorder (BD), recurrent depression and treatment resistant depression (TRD) are associated with dysregulation in the cellular signalling pathways that influence brain function and thereby behavioural performance but it is not fully elucidated whether peripheral BDNF potentially can serve as a biomarker in these disorders [<xref rid="pone.0127629.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0127629.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. BDNF may be a critical modulator of neuroplasticity changes including neurogenesis. Hence, changes in BDNF may play a key role in the pathophysiology of mood disorders [<xref rid="pone.0127629.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. BDNF exerts potent effects on neuronal function and survival in various cell systems in the CNS, making it an intriguing candidate for development for neurological and psychiatric disease indications [<xref rid="pone.0127629.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>BDNF is present in the systemic circulation and can cross the blood-brain barrier, and at rest a cerebral output is seen in healthy young men [<xref rid="pone.0127629.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. It&#x000b4;s possible role has been widely studied in depression and to a lesser degree in other neuropsychiatric disorders. In brief, lower BDNF levels in serum and plasma have been reported in depression and BDNF levels seem to normalise levels in periods of remission [<xref rid="pone.0127629.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In contrast, findings in BD are conflicting: some studies have demonstrated lowered levels of BDNF in manic or depressed bipolar patients compared with healthy control persons [<xref rid="pone.0127629.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0127629.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], while others have found increased BDNF levels [<xref rid="pone.0127629.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0127629.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Lower BDNF levels are also seen in schizophrenia [<xref rid="pone.0127629.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer&#x02019;s disorder [<xref rid="pone.0127629.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. BDNF may thus represent an unspecific biomarker of several different neuropsychiatric disorders with a neurodegenerative component. Interestingly, some chronic inflammatory disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis [<xref rid="pone.0127629.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and asthma [<xref rid="pone.0127629.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] have been associated with elevated BDNF levels in the severe states. Finally, higher plasma BDNF levels seem to be associated with risk factors for cardiovascular disease including elevated diastolic blood pressure, higher cholesterol and higher BMI [<xref rid="pone.0127629.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. This suggests that the pattern of up- and down regulation of BDNF is complex and may be mediated through interrelations between different growth factors regulating the central nervous system.</p><p>The hematopoietic cytokine erythropoietin (EPO) acts as a cytoprotective agent in both neuronal and vascular systems which make it a candidate drug for neuroprotection [<xref rid="pone.0127629.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Similar to BDNF, EPO is considered to have applicability in a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders [<xref rid="pone.0127629.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and it is capable of modulating multiple cellular signal transduction pathways to promote neuronal survival and enhance proliferation and differentiation of neuronal cells [<xref rid="pone.0127629.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. EPO crosses the blood-brain barrier [<xref rid="pone.0127629.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and is a potent growth factor that can protect CNS cells against apoptosis and promote proliferation of neuronal cells [<xref rid="pone.0127629.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], thereby potentially being capable of preventing the progression of neurodegenerative processes in mood episodes. Evidence from preclinical studies, human neuroimaging studies, and recent clinical trials provide some indication for antidepressive cognitive enhancement effect, which might be mediated by action on EPO receptors located in the CNS [<xref rid="pone.0127629.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In addition, we have demonstrated in two parallel clinical trials that EPO enhances cognition in patients with TRD and in patients with partial remitted BD [<xref rid="pone.0127629.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0127629.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>In preclinical studies EPO seems to increase BDNF production [<xref rid="pone.0127629.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0127629.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and BDNF gene expression in the brain [<xref rid="pone.0127629.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0127629.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] although studies are scarce. The effects of co-administered EPO on peripheral BDNF levels have never been studied in humans. In the present study, our primary hypothesis was that administration of EPO would be associated with increased BDNF levels in patients with TRD and in patients with BD in partial remission having cognitive difficulties.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec003"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec004"><title>Study design and participants</title><p>The study had a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group design which has been published elsewhere and described primary and secondary outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0127629.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0127629.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0127629.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] (see summary pages 6&#x02013;7).

They then received weekly intravenous infusions of either EPO (40 000 IU) or saline for eight weeks (weeks 1&#x02013;8) in addition to their current antidepressant medication. This high dose and treatment schedule were chosen because several studies have shown that weekly administration of EPO in similar doses to other patient groups is effective for cognitive enhancement [<xref rid="pone.0127629.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0127629.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and a single high dose to healthy volunteers enhances memory related dependent hippocampus response after one week [<xref rid="pone.0127629.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].

Investigators performing the analyses were blinded to treatment group. The detection limit for the BDNF assay was 58 pg/ml and few samples were below and excluded from analysis. Samples from the same participant were grouped together on the same plate in a randomly assigned sequence using the random numbers generator in SPSS, with an even distribution of samples from patients and healthy control subjects across plates.

In contrast with our hypothesis EPO reduced plasma BDNF levels in patients with TRD while no effects were observed in patients with partially remitted BD. These associations were not influenced by age, gender, baseline depression severity, change in depression severity, or memory performance from baseline to week 9. Further, lower BDNF levels were associated with the number of prior antidepressant treatment trials in patients with TRD, platelet count and baseline BDNF levels.</p><p>Interestingly, lower BDNF levels were associated with the number of prior antidepressant treatment trials in the patients with TRD. Unfortunately, it was not possible to conduct this analysis in the bipolar patient cohort as we did not assess prior medical treatments trials for these patients. Medication may alter neurotrophic signalling; a number of studies have investigated the effect of antidepressants on peripheral BDNF levels in patients with depression and showed that the use of SSRIs is associated with an increase in peripheral BDNF levels [<xref rid="pone.0127629.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0127629.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The same pattern was observed using lithium in unipolar depression [<xref rid="pone.0127629.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. However, BD studies are scarce and the results conflicting. One study showed that quetiapine used in acute mood episodes increased BDNF levels in patients with a depressive episode but decreased BDNF levels in patients with a manic/mixed episode [<xref rid="pone.0127629.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Another study showed that four weeks of treatment with risperidone had no effect on BDNF levels [<xref rid="pone.0127629.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Eleven patients in the EPO group and 12 patients in the saline group were prescribed benzodiazepines. However, only a few patients received benzodiazepines on a daily basis, and most used benzodiazepines as necessary to a maximum of 22.5 mg oxazepam (or equivalent and they were encouraged to avoid using benzodiazepines 24 hours before assessment). In the present study, almost all patients were in medical treatment, and the different treatment groups were equally distributed across the two groups (<xref rid="pone.0127629.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), except in the TRD group (study 1), where nine saline-treated patients and three EPO-treated patients were treated with dual action antidepressants, minimising the possibility that the present findings could be due to differences in the medication. In contrast with the present study, a metaanalysis on the effect of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) compromising result from 11 studies (n = 221 patients) with unipolar disorder, BD or psychotic depression showed that peripheral BNDF increased after ECT treatment [<xref rid="pone.0127629.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].</p><p>No previous studies have investigated the effect of EPO on BDNF levels in humans. We hypothesised that EPO would increase peripheral BDNF levels since EPO infusion, as previously mentioned, increases CNS BDNF in preclinical models, and in several human studies of patients with neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric conditions EPO is also associated with neuroprotective and neuroproliferative potentials [<xref rid="pone.0127629.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], including TRD and BD [21;22]. Indeed, we demonstrated with prospective magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that EPO also prevents brain matter loss in a subfield of the left hippocampus and that this volume increase was associated with improvement of memory function in the present cohort of patients with TRD and BD [<xref rid="pone.0127629.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Whether this is due to a general cellular proliferation or possibly angiogenesis is unresolved although increased hematocrit levels in the EPO group had normalised at the time of the second MRI scan (performed at the follow-up visit in week 14). The increased hemotocrit level during the active study period had no effect on BDNF levels in the present study. Nevertheless, one may speculate whether EPO may mediate its effect directly on the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway which is a crucial regulator of cell growth and proliferation. Further, a mTOR activation stimulates both cell growth, angiogenesis, and cell migration as illustrated in preclinical studies showing that EPO seems to mediate it&#x000b4;s effects via the mTOR signalling pathway [<xref rid="pone.0127629.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0127629.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].</p><p>Thus, the beneficial effects of EPO reported in our primary analyses [<xref rid="pone.0127629.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0127629.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] may not be driven through the effect of EPO on BDNF-driven signal transduction pathways. Conversely, it may be plausible that increased BDNF levels are not uniformly associated with a beneficial outcome and neuroprotective effects. Indeed, a study from our group demonstrated that bipolar patients with severe course of rapid cycling had significant increased BDNF levels as compared with age and gender matched control persons [<xref rid="pone.0127629.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] which was in line with another recent study also including bipolar patients with a severe course [<xref rid="pone.0127629.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Further, as described in the introduction elevated BDNF levels seem related to chronic inflammation e.g. rheumatoid arthritis and asthma and are also associated with increased risk factors of cardiovascular diseases. In the present study the decreased BDNF levels were only seen in currently depressed patients with TRD. This finding may relate to the symptom level, and thus the decrease may correlate with the differences in HDRS-17 scores. Nevertheless, the decreased BDNF levels in the TRD cohort were not associated with change in HDRS-17 scores from visits 1 to 9, and we found no correlation between HDRS-17 scores and BDNF levels on any of the four visits. This is in line with previous studies from our group [<xref rid="pone.0127629.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] and others [<xref rid="pone.0127629.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. In contrast, a study of inpatients showed that BDNF plasma levels were significantly lower in the patients with the most severe illness [<xref rid="pone.0127629.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. In the present study BDNF levels were also not correlated with changes in memory performance score. In line with a study also including patients with major depressive disorder, this study showed no correlation between cognitive performances and BDNF levels [<xref rid="pone.0127629.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Additionally, a longitudinal study showed no association between serum BDNF and subsequent cognitive test trajectories, in older adults, although a potential trend towards a cross-sectional association was found [<xref rid="pone.0127629.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>].</p><p>Within the total cohort, BDNF levels tended to decrease over time especially between the baseline visit and week 5 visit, and this decrease was attenuated in the EPO-treated group. However, the influence of time was not significant, whereas another longer follow-up study found a significant decrease in BDNF over time [<xref rid="pone.0127629.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Concerning study 2, including patients with BD in partial remission, it cannot be excluded that the effect of EPO versus placebo on BDNF levels would be different among patients in a severe depressive state in line with a recent review pointing at peripheral BDNF levels as a biomarker of disease activity [<xref rid="pone.0127629.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>].</p><p>The cellular source of BDNF would influence the interpretation of the present finding as it is still unresolved whether peripheral changes in BDNF levels reflect central BDNF regulated neuroplasticity. In circulation, BDNF is primarily present in platelet granules and is released upon platelet activation [<xref rid="pone.0127629.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Consequently, one explanation for the present finding could be due to the increased platelet levels seen in the EPO-treated group as the decreased BDNF levels may be a consequence of the increase in platelet count. Thus, the EPO-induced platelets would assimilate circulating BDNF. Indeed, post hoc analyses adding the variable: change in platelet count contributed significantly to the decreased BDNF levels seen in patients with TRD, but the effect of the treatment group remained significant, suggesting that the increased platelet count was not the whole explanation. EPO may then directly reduce the BDNF release from platelets in line with preclinical studies showing that BDNF release from platelets is affected by antidepressants [<xref rid="pone.0127629.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0127629.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Further, EPO is a cytokine and capable of preventing inflammation [<xref rid="pone.0127629.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Hence, the present result of a significant decreased BDNF levels in currently depressed patients with TRD, could also be mediated through EPO&#x000b4;s effects on the inflammatory pathway. Given the present result it would be of interest to investigate possible correlations between inflammatory markers (e.g. IL-6, Il-10 and high sensitive C-reactive protein) and BDNF levels in the present cohort.</p><sec id="sec015"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>A strength of the present study is the use of fasting samples collected at the same time of day and based on rather strict inclusions criteria according to the EPO&#x000b4;s haematopoietic side-effects, not influenced by smoking, alcohol abuse, high BMI, use of contraceptive pills, or concurrent somatic disorders. It is an additional strength that nearly all participants fulfilled per protocol although six participants did not receive all eight EPO injections due increased risk of thrombosis, reflected by elevated platelet levels to above normal range (removing these six individuals in post hoc analyses did not change the results). The relatively few participants (n = 83) is a limitation, and BDNF levels also exhibit a large intra- individual heterogeneity, and the significant difference in the TRD study was reduced to a strong trend when removing outliers. Finally, the significant finding was, when corrected for multiplicity, reduced to a trend level. The present finding should therefore be considered as exploratory and be interpreted with caution. Concerning the present finding of a reduced BDNF level in the EPO group in patients with TRD, a post hoc statistical power calculations using the open source statistical power calculation tool <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.dssresearch.com/KnowledgeCenter/toolkitcalculators/statisticalpowercalculators.aspx">https://www.dssresearch.com/KnowledgeCenter/toolkitcalculators/statisticalpowercalculators.aspx</ext-link> showed our sample size of n = 39 with mean (SD) BDNF levels of 17.3 ng/l (17.2) provided a power of 0.93 to detect a significant difference between the groups at a significant level of 0.05 (two-tailed), if we assume a mean difference in BDNF levels of 7.0 ng/l between the two groups, discriminates between those who received EPO and those who received saline. If we assume that 10.0 ng/l is a clinical relevant difference the power was reduced to 0.76. Further, we did not register daily physical exercise level, and since EPO is well known for its potential doping capacity the change in BDNF levels could be due to increased exercise levels in the intervention group. Nevertheless, there are conflicting results on how physical activity influences BDNF levels. A review showed a positive effect of exercise on BDNF levels in healthy participants [<xref rid="pone.0127629.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], while a small study on depressed patients showed no changes in BDNF levels [<xref rid="pone.0127629.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] One study has shown that long-term exercise may in fact lower BDNF levels in healthy participants [<xref rid="pone.0127629.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>].</p><p>Currently, the impact of prior course of illness is not clarified; one study revealed a difference in peripheral BDNF levels between patients with a first-episode depression and patients with recurrent depression [<xref rid="pone.0127629.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], whereas two other studies did not find an effect of prior course of illness [<xref rid="pone.0127629.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0127629.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. In the present study, post-hoc analyses adding the number of previous episodes as an independent variable did not influence the results. Nevertheless, as both patient cohorts were comprised mainly of patients with a more severe and longer course, the influence of EPO on BDNF levels may differ in patients in the early versus late/chronic course of the disorders. Further, the evidence that episodes of depression are associated with low peripheral BDNF is mostly based on cross sectional data and studies following patients over time are mostly follow-up studies including an active medical treatment (for review [<xref rid="pone.0127629.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0127629.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]). Our finding that the number of previous antidepressant treatments contributed to decreased BDNF levels at follow-up in patients with TRD possibly indicates that peripheral BDNF levels may interact with treatment duration. BDNF levels may thus act differently in early stages compared with late stages of the disorders, an assumption also stated in a review on circulating levels of BDNF in neuropsychiatric disorders [<xref rid="pone.0127629.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec016"><title>Conclusions</title><p>EPO down regulated plasma BDNF levels in patients with TRD, whereas no effect was observed in patients with BD.
