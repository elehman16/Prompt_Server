<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4&#x02013;6</xref> Headaches affect all age groups, with a higher prevalence in women compared with men.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4&#x02013;6</xref> The direct cost of healthcare services, and medications for the management of headaches is likewise substantial,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7&#x02013;11</xref> as are indirect costs.

<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) might also reduce the occurrence of headache. However, evidence on the relationship of headaches with sodium intake and other dietary factors is sparse, with most attention focusing on the potential role of monosodium glutamate intake.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22&#x02013;24</xref> In the primary results paper of the DASH-Sodium trial, which focused on the blood pressure effects of the dietary interventions, the authors briefly comment on the occurrence of headaches in the broad context of side effects. They reported that the side effect of headache occurred in 47% of participants during the high, compared with 39 percent during the low, sodium feeding period.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> In this paper, we expand on these preliminary observations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>A detailed description of the rationale, design and methods of the DASH-Sodium trial has been published.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Briefly, DASH-Sodium was a multicentre, randomised clinical trial, conducted between September 1997 and November 1999, designed to compare the effects on blood pressure of three levels of dietary sodium and two diet patterns. The study design incorporated a parallel, two-group, comparison of diet (DASH diet vs control diet) together with a three-period crossover of the three levels of dietary sodium intake, with a primary outcome of mean systolic blood pressure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2014006671F1">figure 1</xref>). The three sodium levels were (1) &#x02018;high&#x02019; (150&#x02005;mmol, at 2100&#x02005;kcal caloric intake), reflecting average consumption in the USA, (2) &#x02018;intermediate&#x02019; (100&#x02005;mmol) reflecting the upper limit of current recommendations for adults<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> and (3) &#x02018;low&#x02019; (50&#x02005;mmol). The DASH diet is rich in fruits, vegetables and low-fat dairy products; high in dietary fibre, potassium, calcium and magnesium; moderately high in protein; and low in saturated fat, cholesterol and total fat. The control diet is typical of what many in the Western world eat.</p><fig id="BMJOPEN2014006671F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1 </label><caption><p>DASH -Sodium trial flow diagram (BMI, body mass index; CV, cardiovascular; DM, diabetes mellitus; OTC, over the counter).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen2014006671f01"/></fig><p>Study participants were 412 adults (age &#x02265;22&#x02005;years) with systolic blood pressure between 120 and 159&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg and diastolic blood pressure between 80 and 95&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg (ie, prehypertension or stage 1 hypertension). Major exclusion criteria were diabetes mellitus, evidence of active malignancy, history of cardiovascular event (angina, myocardial infarction, angioplasty or stroke), renal insufficiency (serum creatinine &#x0003e;1.2&#x02005;mg/dL for females or 1.5&#x02005;mg/dL for males), anaemia (haematocrit at least 5% below normal range), pregnancy, inflammatory bowel disease, body mass index (BMI) &#x0003e;40&#x02005;kg/m<sup>2</sup>, use of antihypertensive drugs and corticosteroids, and consumption of more than 14 alcoholic beverages per week.</p><p>Three screening visits (each separated by at least 7&#x02005;days) were conducted to assess general eligibility and to collect baseline data. Following the screening visits, eligible participants started a 2-week run-in feeding period during which they ate the control diet at the high sodium level. The run-in feeding period was designed to exclude participants who were unlikely to comply with the dietary requirements and to estimate caloric requirements needed to maintain weight. Participants were then randomly assigned (generated using desktop PC at each coordinating centre) to one of the two diets using a parallel-group design, and ate each of three sodium levels (feeding periods) for 30&#x02005;days each, in a randomised crossover design. Participants were not notified of their assigned dietary pattern or sodium sequence.</p><p>During feeding periods (run-in and intervention), participants were required to eat at least one meal per day on site at the clinical centre, 5&#x02005;days per week, and to take food home for other meals. Participants were expected to eat all of their food and were instructed to record the type and amount of any uneaten study food. Caffeinated beverages and alcohol were limited and monitored. Individual energy intake (calorie content) was adjusted, so that each participant&#x02019;s weight during each feeding period remained stable.</p><p>Data collection staff were masked to randomised sodium and diet sequence. Measurements were obtained during screening and at the end of each feeding period. Blood pressure was measured in a seated position, using the right arm of participants. Twenty-four hour urine (for analysis of sodium, potassium, urea nitrogen and creatinine) and body weight were also collected. Compliance with the feeding protocol was assessed by urinary excretion of sodium, potassium, phosphorus, urea nitrogen and creatinine, estimated from 24&#x02005;h urine collections.</p><p>Symptoms (side effects), including headache, bloating, dry mouth, excessive thirst, fatigue or low energy, lightheadedness, nausea and change in taste, were collected via self-administered questionnaires (see online supplement) completed during the last 7&#x02005;days of each sodium feeding period. For each symptom, potential responses were (1) &#x02018;none&#x02019; for not experiencing any symptom, (2) &#x02018;mild&#x02019; if symptom occurred but did not interfere with usual activities, (3) &#x02018;moderate&#x02019; if symptom occurred and somewhat interfered with usual activities and (4) &#x02018;severe&#x02019; if participants were unable to perform usual activities due to the symptom.</p><p>This analysis of the DASH-Sodium trial included 390 (95%) of the 412 randomised participants. Excluded participants were those with missing information on headaches in any of the three feeding periods. For the primary analysis in this study, headache was defined as &#x02018;any headache&#x02019; (mild, moderate or severe) during the last 7&#x02005;days of each feeding period. Subsequently, we report frequency of headache by severity.</p><p>The means and proportions between groups were explored using t tests and &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> tests, respectively. A non-parametric test (extension of Wilcoxon rank-sum test) was used for trends in the frequency of headache by sodium intake. Since multiple observations were obtained on each participant, we used generalised estimating equation (GEE) models,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> with a logit link and binomial error and an exchangeable covariance structure, to model the odds of a headache. The adjusted covariates used in this analysis were measured at baseline. Models were adjusted for age, sex, race, clinical site, systolic blood pressure, BMI and smoking status. The potential for carryover effects was unavoidable in this trial; however, since the experimental agent was one's diet and participants must eat something during these intervals, statistical GEE models were also adjusted for carryover effects from the previous periods. To address the qualitative consistency and benefit-hazard profiles between participants, subgroup analysis by diet stratified by age, sex, race, obesity (BMI &#x02265;30&#x02005;kg/m<sup>2</sup> vs not) and hypertension (blood pressure &#x02265;140/90&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg vs not) status at baseline were also performed. Interactions between subgroups were tested by the addition of an interaction term to the main effects model.</p><p>Each participant provided written, informed consent.</p><p>A p value of &#x02264;0.05 was considered statistically significant.

<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> It is noteworthy that there was no significant relationship between diet pattern and headache. This suggests that a process that is independent of a blood pressure may mediate the relationship between sodium and headaches.</p><p>Our results contrast with the popular belief that a diet rich in fruits, vegetables and potassium and low in saturated and total fat may ease the frequency, or even prevent, headache.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Several dietary factors, including fasting, alcoholic drinks, chocolate, coffee and cheese, appear to trigger vascular headache (cluster or migraine) in adults.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33&#x02013;36</xref> In some studies, an increased intake of monosodium glutamate is associated with the occurrence of headaches.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22&#x02013;24</xref> However, a recent review concluded that evidence on the relationship of sodium glutamate intake and headaches is inconsistent.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> In one study of 200 adults (mean age 37.7&#x02005;years, 81% females), monosodium glutamate was identified as a trigger for migraine headache in only 5 (2.5%) of study participants.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> However, data on the relationship between sodium intake and any form of headaches are sparse.</p><p>The results of this study provide encouraging evidence in support of dietary recommendations to lower sodium intake: recommendations which are currently based on the relationship of sodium intake with blood pressure. The daily intake of sodium in adults living in the USA is already in excess of their physiological need and for many individuals, is much higher than the highest level tested in this study.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>
<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> Our results also support the recent WHO guidelines for reducing sodium intake to less than 87&#x02005;mmol/day<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> and American Heart Association guidelines for reducing sodium intake to 65&#x02005;mmol/day.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></p><p>Strengths of our study include its randomised controlled design comparing two diets using a parallel design and a three-period crossover of three levels of dietary sodium (high, intermediate and low). Dietary intake during the feeding periods was closely monitored and vigorous efforts were made to promote adherence with assigned diets. The participants of this study were healthy, non-institutionalised, racially diverse, middle-aged and older-aged men and women. Hence we believe that these results are applicable to a large fraction of adults.</p><p>Our study also has limitations. Information on the prevalence of headache at baseline from eligible participants was lacking. In addition, there was no information about the type of headache (tension, cluster or migraine) experienced by study participants. However, we suspect that most of the headaches were tension headaches. Whether a reduced sodium intake can prevent vascular headache is unknown. Second, the instrument was administered just once in each feeding period and does not allow calculation of an event rate, such as person-days of headaches. Third, these are secondary, post hoc analyses from a trial that was not explicitly designed to test the effects of dietary factors on headaches. Nonetheless, a rigorously controlled feeding study designed to test the effects of dietary factors on occurrence of headaches would be extremely expensive and logistically challenging. Fourth, our results likely underestimate the relationship of sodium intake with headaches. The range of sodium intake was relatively narrow&#x02014;the highest sodium group in our trial actually corresponds to the average in the USA and is much lower than the intake in many countries, particularly in Asia. Self-report of symptoms is inherently imprecise and could bias results to the null, given that a validated instrument was not used for patient-reported headache.</p><p>In conclusion, a reduced sodium intake was associated with significantly lower risk of headache, while diet patterns had no effect on the risk of headaches. A reduced dietary sodium intake offers a novel approach to prevent headache in adults. Additional studies are needed to replicate these findings and to explore mechanisms that mediate the association between sodium intake and headache.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e218" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2014-006671.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e220" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2014-006671.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> All three authors (MA, MW and LJA) have substantially contributed to the conception, drafting, editing and revising for the important intellectual content of the manuscript.
