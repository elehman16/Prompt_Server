The availability of dietary proteins is a key factor limiting the population growth of herbivore species. The objective of this study is to investigate the degree to which protein availability influences the growth of increasing vole populations. We hypothesise that the summer growth of folivorous vole populations is positively associated with dietary protein availability. A field experiment was conducted over a summer reproductive period in 18 vegetated enclosures. Populations of field voles (<italic>Microtus agrestis</italic>) were randomised amongst three treatment groups: 1) food supplementation with <italic>ad libitum</italic> high protein (30% dry weight) pellets, 2) food supplementation with <italic>ad libitum</italic> low protein (1% dry weight; both supplemented foods had equivalent energy content) pellets, and 3) control (no food supplementation), n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;6 per treatment. Vole density, survival, demographic attributes and condition indicators were monitored with live-trapping and blood sampling. Highest final vole densities were attained in populations that received high protein supplementation and lowest in low protein populations. Control populations displayed intermediate densities. The survival rate of voles was similar in all treatment groups. The proportion of females, and of those that were pregnant or lactating, was highest in the high protein supplemented populations. This suggests that variation in reproductive, rather than survival rates of voles, accounted for density differences between the treatment groups. We found no clear association between population demography and individual physiological condition. Our results demonstrate that dietary protein availability limits vole population growth during the summer growing season. This suggests that the nutritional quality of forage may be an underestimated source of interannual variation in the density and growth rates of widely fluctuating populations of herbivorous small mammals.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The experiment was funded by the Academy of Finland (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.aka.fi/eng">www.aka.fi/eng</ext-link>: grant 133495 to OH, grant 132190 to TM).

These differences have traditionally been attributed to winter severity and amount of snowfall, which are negatively associated with the stabilising effect of generalist predators on voles and their specialist predators <xref rid="pone.0091113-Hansson1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0091113-Hanski3" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p><p>Recent reports have documented a widespread collapse of small rodent population cycles <xref rid="pone.0091113-Cornulier1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, often attributed to changing winter climate <xref rid="pone.0091113-Hrnfeldt1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0091113-Kausrud1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Korpela et al. <xref rid="pone.0091113-Korpela1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> presented evidence to challenge this association, and instead, using extensive time-series vole monitoring and climatic data from Finland, highlighted a connection between weather conditions during spring and summer, and vole population growth. The latter relationship is potentially mediated by variation in forage quality (e.g. <xref rid="pone.0091113-Chapin1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0091113-Jnsdttir1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>).</p><p>For herbivores, forage quality is to a considerable degree determined by nitrogen content, which is often a primary limiting factor for the growth of populations (nitrogen limitation hypothesis <xref rid="pone.0091113-Mattson1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0091113-White1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>). Nitrogen levels in plants vary in response to a range of biotic and abiotic factors, such as weather, leading to both spatial and temporal variation in its availability to herbivores <xref rid="pone.0091113-Kummerow1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0091113-Laine1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. For example, Cole and Batzli <xref rid="pone.0091113-Cole1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> identified that different vegetation types altered the density, reproductive performance and survival of wild prairie vole populations, and concluded that highly nutritional forage can elevate peak population densities. Additionally, a midsummer cessation of breeding, often occurring in cyclic folivorous voles during the height of the summer growing season (termed a &#x02018;midsummer crisis&#x02019; for voles), is hypothesized to result from nutritional changes in plants during their reproductive phenology <xref rid="pone.0091113-Myllymki1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.</p><p>The physiological health state of individuals may vary before translating into changes in population demography. For example, populations of small mammals are characterised in decline years by small individual body size, as well as low reproductive output and adult survival (the Chitty effect <xref rid="pone.0091113-Chitty1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0091113-Burthe1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>). Haematological indices, e.g., levels of albumin, haematocrit and immunoglobulins, can also reflect the quality of individual dietary intake <xref rid="pone.0091113-Mira1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0091113-Schoech1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>.</p><p>The objective of our study is to evaluate the extent to which protein availability limits the density and population growth of small mammals during northern European summer, a time of seemingly superabundant food resources. We hypothesise that protein supplementation will have positive effects, proximately on the physiological condition of voles and ultimately on population growth, as compared to non-supplemented populations. Specifically, we predict that the positive response will be more pronounced in populations that receive high protein food than in those that receive supplemental food with equivalent levels of energy but low protein.

Permissions for carrying out experiments at this location were obtained from the land owner, whose contact information is available from the authors upon request. The study did not involve endangered or protected species. The experiment was approved by the Finnish Animal Ethics Council (permit ESAVI/1437/04.10.03/2011). Field technicians were trained prior to the experiment and took all possibly precautions to minimise animal stress during trapping and sampling.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Enclosures and experimental design</title><p>The experiment was conducted in 18 adjoining field enclosures (20&#x000d7;25 m each) with natural meadow vegetation, dominated by the grasses <italic>Phleum pratense</italic> and <italic>Deschampsia caespitosa</italic>. Enclosures were constructed of sheet metal rising approximately one meter above ground and extending 50 cm underground. Thereby, vole movement between enclosures was prevented and access by mammalian predators of voles (mustelids) restricted. Avian predators had access to the enclosures but were very rarely observed in the area during the experiment. Each enclosure contained eight sheet-metal shelter boxes (40&#x000d7;40&#x000d7;50 cm, with two entrance hole at the base) approximately 10 m apart, in a 3&#x000d7;2&#x000d7;3 configuration. An Ugglan Special live trap (Grahnab, Sweden) was placed in each shelter box.</p><p>Enclosures were randomly allocated to one of three treatment groups: 1) <italic>ad libitum</italic> high-protein (30 per cent dry weight crude protein) food supplementation, 2) <italic>ad libitum</italic> low-protein (1 per cent) food supplementation, or 3) control (no food supplementation). The energy content of the two protein treatments (30% and 1%) was unchanged at 3500 kcal/kg. Food supplementation was supplied through specifically formulated pellets (Altromin, Lage, Germany) available from a wire mesh feeder placed in each shelter box.</p><p>At the beginning of June 2011, six field voles (three males, three females) were introduced to each enclosure. The first trapping occasion was conducted two weeks later to obtain baseline abundance estimates representative of established individuals. A total of two male and three female voles were introduced to four enclosures (2 high protein and 2 low protein) to replace voles that had apparently died between introduction and baseline trapping. Food supplementation began immediately following baseline trapping on June 16, 2011, and continued until immediately prior to the final trapping in mid-September (13<sup>th</sup>) 2011. The experiment thus encompassed the primary reproductive period of field vole populations in central Finland <xref rid="pone.0091113-Myllymki1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Vole monitoring and sampling</title><p>Abundance monitoring and vole blood sampling was conducted every fourth week for a total of four trapping occasions. On each occasion, traps were baited with oats and checked consecutively at 7 am, 2 pm and 9 pm, for a total of 8&#x02013;9 times over three days. An electronic PIT-tag (EID Aalten BV, Aalten, Netherlands) was subcutaneously injected into every vole upon first capture and the unique identification number recorded at each encounter. Voles were placed into ventilated buckets and taken to an on-site field laboratory where their sex and reproductive status (males: subadult, mature; females: subadult, mature, pregnant and/or lactating) was determined through external examination. Body mass and head width were measured (to nearest 0.1 g and 0.1 mm, respectively), and approximately 150 &#x000b5;l of blood was collected from the retro-orbital sinus with heparinized capillary tubes. Blood was not collected from juvenile individuals weighing under 15 g. Voles were then released into the same enclosure as captured, except on the final trapping occasion when voles were removed from enclosures. Upon encountering an individual that had already been sampled for blood during the trapping occasion, the vole was immediately released at the point of capture after recording its identification number, sex, reproductive status and weight.</p><p>Vole abundance (hereafter density) was estimated separately for each enclosure and trapping occasion (18 enclosures &#x000d7; 4 occasions &#x0200a;=&#x0200a; 72 population density estimates) using the program CAPTURE <xref rid="pone.0091113-Otis1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. M<sub>h</sub> models (which incorporate heterogeneity in capture rates) with the jackknife estimator were employed for trapping occasions one to three. Throughout this period, four enclosures experienced one trapping occasion in which no individual was recaptured after their initial capture. In these cases, density was estimated with removal (M<sub>bh</sub>) models (Pollock and Otto's estimator <xref rid="pone.0091113-Pollock1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>). During the final trapping occasion, voles were removed from enclosures upon first capture and density was estimated with removal models. Rarely, voles were found dead in traps or died during sampling (approximately 3% of captures). These individuals were excluded from the density estimation models, but added to the final estimate <xref rid="pone.0091113-Otis1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. A population growth rate was calculated for each trapping interval based on the formula, R<sub>t</sub> &#x0200a;=&#x0200a; ln(N<sub>t-1</sub>/N<sub>t</sub>), where N<sub>t</sub> is the population density at time t <xref rid="pone.0091113-Huitu1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0091113-Sibly1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>.</p><p>Vole survival rate was calculated separately for each enclosure and trapping interval using program MARK 7.0 <xref rid="pone.0091113-White2" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>.

Due to a small difference in AIC values between the two most parsimonious models (&#x00394;AIC &#x0003c;2), final survival estimates were obtained using a weighted model averaging procedure, taking model selection uncertainty into account <xref rid="pone.0091113-Burnham1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Condition indices</title><p>Body condition index was expressed as the studentized residuals of a random coefficients regression model of individual body mass on head width <xref rid="pone.0091113-SchulteHostedde1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>.

Blood plasma was then separated and frozen (&#x0003c;&#x02212;20&#x000b0;C) before enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (hereafter, ELISA).</p><p>Total IgG antibody titres were measured according to the following protocol. Solid anti-mouse conjugate was pushed through a 0.22 &#x000b5;m syringe filter and dissolved in 0.135 M NaCl. Plate wells were then coated with 50 &#x000b5;l of anti-mouse IgG (M-8642, Sigma, lot 060M6082) solution (1 mg/ml) and incubated for a minimum of 12 hours at +4&#x000b0;C. Wells were emptied, and masked with 100 &#x000b5;l 1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline (BSA-PBS) and incubated for 60 minutes at room temperature. Wells were then emptied, washed and pat dried. 50 &#x000b5;l of plasma sample (diluted at 1&#x02236;40000 with BSA) was added to duplicate wells. A standard was prepared by combining 2 &#x000b5;l from each sample over all trapping occasions. Duplicate standard concentrations of 200, 150, 100, 50, 25, 10, 5 and 0 were run on each plate simultaneously with samples. Plates containing samples and standards were then incubated for 3 hours at room temperature. Following incubation, solutions were removed and the wells washed. 50 &#x000b5;l of alkaline phosphatase conjugated anti-mouse IgG (A-2179, Sigma, lot 31K4852), diluted at 1&#x02236;4000 with BSA-PBS, was added to each well and plates incubated for a minimum of 12 hours at +4&#x000b0;C. Following incubation, wells were washed and pat dried, and 50 &#x000b5;l of substrate (1 mg pNPP [P4744, Sigma, lot 109K6076] to 1 ml DEA buffer) was added to each. Plates were then incubated in the dark and read at 405 nm with a Thermo Labsystems Multiskan Ascent 354 platereader after 15, 30, 45, 60 and 75 minutes. An absorbance approximately mid-way between the standard dilutions is most desirable. After comparing absorbance levels, 45 minutes of incubation was deemed the most appropriate. The mean absorbance of the sample duplicates was used as the final measure. On rare occasions when an anomalous result occurred, the plausible duplicate was used alone.</p><p>A commercially available mouse-albumin ELISA kit (Alpha Diagnostics International, Texas) was used to measure the albumin concentration of vole plasma as per manufacturer's instructions. An anti-mouse albumin-HPR conjugate was used and plates were read at 450 nm using the Thermo Labsystems Multiskan Ascent 354 platereader.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Random coefficients regression models (PROC MIXED) were used to evaluate the individual and interactive effects of time (week of year as a continuous variable) and treatment on vole density, with the intercept and week as random effects. The effect of population mean condition index on density was evaluated in a separate model. For this, data were restricted to the final three trapping occasions, and condition at the previous trapping occasion (t-1) set as an initial explanatory variable, along with time, treatment and their interactions. The intercept and time were again used as random effects.</p><p>Due to the positive correlation between density and week (P&#x0003c;0.001), analyses of growth rate (R<sub>t</sub>), survival, condition index, total IgG, haematocrit and albumin content were carried out with repeated-measures mixed ANOVA models (PROC MIXED) with trapping occasion as a repeated categorical variable. Other initial fixed explanatory variables were treatment, density and all possible interactions. Enclosure and enclosure &#x000d7; trapping occasion were included as random factors (for IgG and albumin models the ELISA plate number was also included as a random factor). Repeated covariate type (autoregressive, unstructured, compound symmetry or toeplitz) selection was based on AIC of the full model. Model selection was thereafter based on a stepwise reduction approach, guided by AIC values and biological importance, using Kenward and Roger estimation <xref rid="pone.0091113-Littell1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. Model comparisons were made using the maximum likelihood (ML) method, and final values obtained from the most parsimonious model with restricted maximum likelihood (REML). Sexes were analysed separately when possible, and model validity was verified via the residual distribution. To assess for delayed effects of density, the data were restricted to the final two trapping occasions and each response model incorporating current density compared to models including densities for the two preceding trapping occasions (t-1, t-2).

In general, the quantitative effects of resources on vertebrate herbivore populations have been extensively studied <xref rid="pone.0091113-Boutin1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>, while the effects of food resource quality remain little investigated. Similarly, in voles the limiting effects of food on population demography has manifested through quantity, and predominately only during winter <xref rid="pone.0091113-Huitu1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. As such, our experimental results offer important insights into processes contributing to variation in herbivore density &#x02013; namely the availability of high-quality food during the growing season.</p><p>Survival rates of voles did not differ between treatment groups during the experiment. Therefore, the observed differences in density are largely attributable to increased recruitment through reproduction. This is supported by the tendency of high protein populations to consist of few males and many reproducing females as compared to the other treatment groups. However, increased rates of reproduction were not reflected in the proportion of juvenile voles, which were lowest in September when the population growth rate was highest. Desy and Batzli <xref rid="pone.0091113-Desy1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> identified the same peculiarity which they attributed to faster growth of juveniles with food supplementation. In other words, high quality food enables voles to grow faster than lower quality food. Indeed, protein supplementation has been found to accelerate the growth of small rodent individuals <xref rid="pone.0091113-Cameron1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. For this reason, it was not appropriate to evaluate functional group differences in survival and condition between juvenile and adult voles in the current experiment. It should be noted that the quality of available food resources may affect the demographic rates of vole populations differently in winter than in summer &#x02013; this remains a topic for further experimentation.</p><p>Interestingly, control treatment groups in our experiment attained approximately half the densities of high protein supplemented groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0091113-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). The protein content of our high-quality supplementation was 30%, while crude protein levels in grasses (including <italic>Phleum pratense</italic>) at the end of the growing season are about 10&#x02013;15% of dry weight <xref rid="pone.0091113-Suleiman1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>. It is therefore tempting to entertain the idea that summer vole densities closely reflect the levels of dietary protein available to voles in their forage.</p><p>Contrary to our predictions, neither body condition nor haematological indices were clearly associated with experimental treatments or population density. Nevertheless, the identification of changes over time, and interactions with current and past density, highlight the complex interactions and potential utility of these measures in population ecology research. It should be noted that interpretation of haematological indices is difficult and several parameters are usually required to provide an adequate representation of health status <xref rid="pone.0091113-Beldomenico1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>. For example, elevated total IgG could represent high baseline immunity levels resulting from good health or an immune response to infection <xref rid="pone.0091113-Huitu2" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Similarly, low albumin may be a sign of a protein deficient diet or infection <xref rid="pone.0091113-Frommel1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>. Since we employed several health indicators without observing treatment effects, it appears that voles were able to maintain good physiological condition during the breeding season on natural food resources alone (for contrasting results during the non-breeding season, see <xref rid="pone.0091113-Huitu2" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>). In the context of our treatments, it seems plausible that voles which received supplemental protein were allocating it foremost to reproduction, as opposed to elevating their own physiological condition (i.e., income breeding <xref rid="pone.0091113-Jnsson1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>).</p><p>Korpela et al. recently highlighted the association between summer growing conditions and the dynamics of vole populations <xref rid="pone.0091113-Korpela1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. However, their study did not identify proximate mechanisms acting during summer. Climate, amongst other things, has been shown to alter nitrogen levels in plants <xref rid="pone.0091113-Kummerow1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0091113-Laine1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, and we have demonstrated here that summer protein levels are a plausible mechanistic link between climate and vole population demography. In further support, a &#x02018;midsummer crisis&#x02019;, hypothesized to result from a shortage of high-quality food due to graminoid senescence <xref rid="pone.0091113-Myllymki1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, did not present in high protein treatment groups. Meanwhile, the growth rate of low protein populations was clearly reduced between the final two trapping intervals without obvious changes in survival rates. Further research is nonetheless needed to elucidate causalities between climate and herbivore diet quality.</p><p>Considerable debate has focused on factors which limit and regulate cyclic populations of small mammals. A common line of differentiation is between intrinsic (for example age structure and maternal or juvenile environment: see <xref rid="pone.0091113-Boonstra2" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0091113-Helle1" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>) and extrinsic factors (the environment, including predation: see <xref rid="pone.0091113-Hanski1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0091113-Korpimki1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. However, recent transplant experiments have provided compelling evidence to support an important effect of the immediate environment on the life history traits of voles <xref rid="pone.0091113-Ergon1" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0091113-Speakman1" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref> (see however <xref rid="pone.0091113-Helle1" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>). Our identification of diet quality limitation on increasing vole populations is consistent with the latter findings. Specifically, we have demonstrated that protein availability limits the growth of summer vole populations. We therefore conclude that diet quality, ultimately determined by stochastic variation in climate, is likely to have a hitherto underestimated influence on the population dynamics of small mammals.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Jean-Emmanuel Fournier, Stephen Ryan, Ilkka Taponen and Ana&#x000ef;s Zimmer for their contributions to field work, Nuria Blanco and Sami Kyr&#x000f6;l&#x000e4;inen for assistance with ELISA tests, and Tero Klemola for advice regarding abundance modelling and statistical analyses.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0091113-Hansson1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
