The duration of sensory block is longer than the motor block with levobupivacaine,[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] as compared to ropivacaine, therefore, levobupivacaine appears to be the LA of choice, especially in orthopaedic surgeries.</p><p>However, these early advantages can be limited by the relatively brief duration of action of the LAs and in this regard, there is increased interest in clonidine and dexmedetomidine (&#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-adrenoreceptor agonists) as adjuvants to LAs for increasing the duration of analgesia in the post-operative period. The &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptors are located on primary afferent terminals implicated in analgesia and therefore support the analgesic action at peripheral sites.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] The efficacy of dexmedetomidine exceeds that of clonidine for peripheral nerve blocks.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>We hypothesised that equal doses of clonidine or dexmedetomidine (0.5 &#x003bc;g/kg) as adjuvants to levobupivacaine in USG-guided FSNB will have a beneficial effect in prolonging the duration of post-operative analgesia and improved verbal rating score (VRS) in patients scheduled for below knee surgery under subarachnoid block (SAB).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><p>The study was a prospective, randomised, double-blind, controlled clinical trial. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee and written informed consent was obtained from all patients recruited from May 2014 to June 2015. This study was carried out on 90 American Society of Anesthesiologists&#x02019; (ASA) physical status 1-2 patients of both gender, in the age group of 20&#x02013;60 years, scheduled for below knee surgery under SAB. Patient's refusal, neuropathy, treatment with &#x003b2; blockers or calcium channel blockers, hypersensitivity to LAs, allergy to study drugs and patients with known bradyarrhythmias formed the exclusion criteria.</p><p>During pre-anaesthetic visit, the patients were explained about the study purpose, advantages and risks of the procedure and instructed to demand analgesia as per requirement and informed written consent was obtained. Patients were educated about the 11 point VRS during the pre-operative assessment.</p><p>Randomisation was achieved by computer-generated random number table. Random group assigned was enclosed in a sealed opaque envelope to ensure concealment of allocation sequence. After shifting the patient inside operation theatre, sealed envelope was opened by anaesthesiologist not involved in the study to prepare the drug solution according to randomisation. All the patients were kept nil orally for 8 h before surgery and pre-medicated with tablet alprazolam 0.25 mg and tablet ranitidine 150 mg the night before surgery and 2 h before surgery. In the operation theatre, after securing 18-gauge intravenous (IV) cannula, 0.9% sodium chloride (normal saline [NS]) infusion was commenced. After establishing standard anaesthesia monitoring, baseline parameters such as heart rate (HR), non-invasive blood pressure and peripheral oxygen saturation were recorded.</p><p>All patients included in the study were given SAB in sitting position using 26 gauge Quincke spinal needle at L<sub>3</sub>&#x02013;L<sub>4</sub> interspace with 15 mg (3 mL) 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine after ensuring free flow of cerebrospinal fluid. After confirmation of adequate level (T<sub>6</sub>), surgery was allowed to proceed. After the surgery was over and the sensory level regressed to T<sub>10</sub>, following proper positioning of patients, USG-guided FSNB was given in allocated patients with respective drug solutions.</p><p>The femoral block was performed under ultrasound Sonosite Micromaxx<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (Sonosite<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Bothell, WA, USA) guidance with patient supine and leg in neutral position. After skin disinfection with povidone iodine, sterile drapes were applied. Femoral nerve and vessels were identified (femoral nerve lies lateral to femoral artery in a groove formed by iliacus and psoas muscle) in short axis view using linear probe (8&#x02013;12 Hz) covered with sterile plastic sheath and with sufficient application of sterilised gel. A 22 gauge echogenic needle (Stimuplex<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, B. Braun, Melsungen, Germany) was used by an ultrasound-guided in-plane (lateral to medial) technique and positioned between the fascia iliaca and iliopsoas muscle near lateral corner of femoral nerve. After checking the exact location of the needle tip, 1 mL of NS was injected to open the plane and after confirmation of hypoechoic area on USG image, the injection of the 20 mL of drug solution was given.</p><p>Sciatic nerve block was given by popliteal approach with patient in supine position by same ultrasound probe mentioned above. Leg of the patient was elevated by putting sterile pillow between lower aspect of leg and table to allow the access of probe. After draping popliteal fossa and applying sufficient gel, a short axis view of popliteal neurovascular bundle was obtained. A 22 gauge echogenic needle was used by ultrasound-guided in-plane (lateral to medial) technique and under continuous ultrasound guidance, tip was placed between the tibial and common peroneal component of sciatic nerve near the division and 1 mL of NS was injected to open the plane and after confirmation of hypoechoic area on USG image, the injection of the 20 mL of drug solution was given.</p><p>The patients in Group LL (<italic>n</italic> = 30) received 38 mL of 0.125% levobupivacaine (Levoanawin&#x02122;, Neon Laboratories, Limited, Mumbai 2.5 mg/mL, 10 mL) with 2 mL NS. Patients in Group LD (<italic>n</italic> = 30) received 38 mL of 0.125% levobupivacaine with 0.5 &#x003bc;g/kg dexmedetomidine (Dextomid&#x02122; 100 &#x003bc;g by Neon Laboratories, Mumbai, 100 &#x003bc;g/mL) and in Group LC (<italic>n</italic> = 30) received 38 mL of 0.125% levobupivacaine with 0.5 &#x003bc;g/kg clonidine (Cloneon&#x02122;, Neon Laboratories, Limited 150 &#x003bc;g/mL, 1 mL) in saline to make total drug volume of 40 mL. In all patients, 20 mL of LA solution was injected around femoral nerve and 20 mL around sciatic nerve.</p><p>Block assessment was done at hourly interval up to 24 h by a blinded anaesthesiologist. Post-operatively, the patients were evaluated for pain, nausea or vomiting, sedation, haemodynamic parameters (HR, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure) and VRS in the post-anaesthesia care unit at 0, 2, 4, 8, 12 and 24 h by an investigator blinded to group assignment. For the first 24 h, the protocol for post-operative analgesia consisted of standard orders for intramuscular diclofenac 75 mg on demand for VRS &#x0003e;4. For breakthrough pain, patients were treated with IV tramadol 2 mg/kg as and when required.</p><p>Patients were asked to rate average pain they experience over a period of 24 h post-operatively by 11 point VRS,[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] where 0 was no pain and 10 was worst imaginable pain. Patients were asked to rate the severity of nausea, vomiting on a four-point scale:[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] none (1), mild (2), moderate (3), severe (4). Patient was evaluated for sedation using modified Ramsay sedation score:[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] (1) wide awake, (2) drowsy, (3) asleep but arousable with verbal stimulus, (4) arousable with mild physical stimulus, (5) not arousable with mild physical stimulus.</p><p>Duration of analgesia was the primary outcome of our study, whereas the rescue analgesics requirement, VRS scores, sedation score and haemodynamic parameters were the secondary outcomes. Duration of analgesia was taken as the outcome measure for the purpose of sample size calculation. It was estimated that 23 subjects would be required per group to detect a difference of 60 min in this parameter between the groups, with 80% power and 5% probability of Type 1 error. This calculation assumed a pooled standard deviation of 60 min for the duration of analgesia. To account for probable dropouts and block failure we included 30 patients in each group.</p><p>Data were collected and entered in MS Excel 2010. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software 17 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Normal distribution of the collected data was first verified with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Continuous variables were analysed with analysis of variance or the Kruskal&#x02013;Wallis test on the basis of data distribution. <italic>Post hoc</italic> comparisons were performed with the unpaired Student's <italic>t</italic>-test or the Mann&#x02013;Whitney U-test with Bonferroni's correction, as indicated.

Peripheral nerve blocks have distinctly an edge over general anaesthesia and neuraxial blocks in this regard.</p><p>The analgesic efficacy of levobupivacaine in peripheral nerve blocks is already known, and this study also shows analgesic benefits of using levobupivacaine in FSNB. The efficacy of 0.2% ropivacaine, 0.2% levobupivacaine and 0.125% levobupivacaine was compared in continuous popliteal sciatic nerve block in a study involving sixty patients undergoing elective hallux valgus repair.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Post-operative analgesia was excellent in all three groups without motor block with 0.125% levobupivacaine. Therefore, for post-operative analgesia, 0.125% seems to be an ideal concentration of levobupivacaine, as it tends to avoid the motor block and thereby helps in early ambulation in the post-operative period especially after orthopaedic surgeries.</p><p>&#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptor agonists, either alone or in combination with LAs, are highly effective in the treatment of short-term pain. The analgesic efficacy of clonidine is by virtue of its action on &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptors present on primary afferent terminals. We have used clonidine in the dose of 0.5 &#x003bc;g/kg in accordance with study.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Dexmedetomidine compared to clonidine is more selective &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptor agonist with seven times greater affinity.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Much like clonidine, dexmedetomidine has been shown to prolong the duration of analgesia by blocking the hyperpolarisation-activated cation current.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>In this study, mean duration of analgesia was significantly prolonged in dexmedetomidine group (10.17 &#x000b1; 2.40 h) and clonidine group (7.31 &#x000b1; 1.76 h) as compared to control group (4.16 &#x000b1; 1.04 h) (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). Clonidine (1 &#x003bc;g/kg) in FSNB[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] with 0.75% ropivacaine in patients undergoing hallux valgus repair was reported to increase the duration of post-operative analgesia by 3 h as compared to control group in accordance with the present study. However, the overall increase in duration of analgesia, up to 13 h in the control group may be attributed to the higher concentration of LA used in this study. We kept the sensory level higher (T<sub>6</sub>) because our intention was to give FSNB for post-operative analgesia under the effect of spinal so that patient does not experience pain during positioning for FSNB.</p><p>Dexmedetomidine (1 &#x003bc;g/kg) with 0.5% ropivacaine in posterior tibial nerve block[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] was found to increase duration of analgesia up to 21 h, however, 6 h gain in the post-operative analgesia over control group is consistent with the present study, whereas increased duration may be attributed to the higher concentration of LA. The present study found more consistent results with the study[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] comparing clonidine and dexmedetomidine added to 0.25% bupivacaine in supraclavicular block in a dose of 1 &#x003bc;g/kg and observed an increase of about 3 h in the duration of analgesia with the dexmedetomidine.</p><p>The LA-prolonging effect of &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptor agonists is probably mediated locally at the level of neurons. The effect appears to be more profound on C-fibers (pain fibres) than A<sub>&#x003b4;</sub> fibres (motor fibres),[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] thereby making the effects potentially more sensory specific.</p><p>A lot of heterogeneity was observed between the studies when comparing rescue analgesia. No differences were reported in total ketoprofen consumption or regarding the number of patients requesting post-operative analgesics between the clonidine and control groups in one of the studies.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Significantly less analgesic consumption in dexmedetomidine group was observed as compared to control in another study[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] which is consistent with this study.</p><p>Most of the studies[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] have observed sedation scores of grade 2 with clonidine and dexmedetomidine used as adjuvants irrespective of LA used, as was also observed in the present study, although the dose of adjuvant is less in present study.</p><p>More studies with the fixed doses and objectives are needed to evaluate this parameter in FSNB. All the patients were comfortable and responded to verbal command throughout the study period. No patient developed deep sedation, had airway compromise or desaturation.</p><p>We did not encounter any episode of bradycardia in the dose of 0.5 &#x003bc;g/kg clonidine or dexmedetomidine as compared to studies using doses of 1 &#x003bc;g/kg.</p><p>Our data supports specific action of &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-adrenoreceptors on peripheral nerves leading to better pain scores and decrease in post-operative analgesic requirement. To summarize, the addition of clonidine and dexmedetomidine in a dose of 0.5 &#x003bc;g/kg to 0.125% levobupivacaine decreases VRS scores post-operatively, prolongs duration of analgesia and decreases number of demands for rescue analgesics. Dexmedetomidine provides analgesia for longer duration as compared to clonidine; however, VRS scores in two groups were comparable beyond 8 h of the block.</p><p>The study had few limitations; the beneficial effects of &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptors could be because of systemic absorption rather than purely perineural effect. Also, the present study design was not meant to test the onset of sensory and motor blockades individually.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Dexmedetomidine or clonidine (0.5 &#x003bc;g/kg) used as adjuvants to levobupivacaine in USG-guided FSNB can prolong the duration of analgesia with reduced rescue analgesic requirement as compared to control in the post-operative period.
