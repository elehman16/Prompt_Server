We used to routinely provide premedication with diazepam and chlorpheniramine before cardiac catheterization procedures. However the benefits of such a treatment are not well established here. Therefore, we designed this study to test whether the routine use of premedication during coronary angiography is needed.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A total of 200 consecutive patients scheduled to undergo either diagnostic or therapeutic coronary angiographic procedures were randomized to receive either premedication with diazepam (5 mg) and chlorpheniramine (4 mg) 60 minutes prior to their procedures (n = 100) or no premedication (n = 100). The administration of intravenous midazolam during the procedures was permitted at the operator&#x02019;s discretion. The primary endpoints were anxiety and pain perception during the procedure.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 200 patients with similar baseline characteristics were randomized into two groups. The first group received oral premedication with diazepam (5 mg) and chlorphenamine (4 mg) 60 minutes prior to their procedures, and the other group did not receive premedication. We observed no differences in periprocedural pain perception (31% in the premedicated group versus 29% in the non-premedicated group; P = 0.75) or anxiety (59% in the premedicated group versus 50% in the non-premedicated group; P = 0.2). Interestingly, local pain was more pronounced in the premedicated patients than in the non-premedicated patients (30% versus 16%, respectively; P = 0.018). There were no contrast-related reactions reported in either group.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Treatment with oral diazepam and chlorphenamine prior to cardiac catheterization and percutaneous coronary intervention does not alter rates of anxiety, periprocedural pain.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Premedication</kwd><kwd>Diazepam</kwd><kwd>Chlorpheniramine</kwd><kwd>Anxiety</kwd><kwd>Coronary angiography</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>We used to routinely administer premedication with diazepam and chlorpheniramine to our patients undergoing cardiac catheterization procedures. We searched the literature for support for this approach, but the few relevant papers found only a neutral result when studying the effect of premedication on procedural outcomes [<xref rid="R01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Whether the cost of those medications outweighs their clinical benefits needs to be determined along with their effects on reducing procedural adverse events, patient pain perception, and anxiety. In a retrospective study, non-catheter-induced coronary spasms were observed in some of the patients for whom the sedation was the only premedication that was administered [<xref rid="R02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In contrast, a study of 12 patients who were administered intravenous diazepam before coronary angiography observed that, in addition to its central sedative effects, diazepam also has nitroglycerin-like effects on the coronary and systemic circulation [<xref rid="R03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Various sedatives have been used for premedication, but they are no longer routinely ordered to be administered before the patient is sent to the catheterization laboratory. Instead, the patient's state of alertness and need for sedation are assessed (if needed) once he or she is on the catheterization table. According to conscious sedation guidelines, the administration of small repeated doses of intravenous midazolam (0.5 to 1 mg) and/or fentanyl (25 to 50 mg) maintains a comfortable but arousable state [<xref rid="R04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Premedications have routinely been used in catheterization laboratories, but no evidence-based practices or previous studies have addressed their harmful or beneficial effects on procedural outcomes. In this study, we evaluated their usefulness and whether there is a difference between premedicating and non-premedicating practices. Doing so will add evidence-based practices (instead of inherited practices) to the literature.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design and patients</title><p>This randomized, single-center, controlled trial compared premedication with diazepam and chlorphenamine to no premedication in stable patients undergoing diagnostic or interventional procedures. A total of 200 patients were equally divided to receive or not receive open-label oral diazepam (5 mg) and chlorphenamine (4 mg) before cardiac catheterization.</p><p>This was a randomized, single-center, controlled clinical trial in which the patients were randomly divided equally into two groups (at a 1:1 ratio) and received either open-label oral diazepam (5 mg) and chlorphenamine (4 mg) or no premedication beforehand. The patients underwent either routine coronary angiography or PCI. This study only included adult patients who were referred for cardiac catheterization procedures. Any patients with acute myocardial infarction, decompensated heart failure or hemodynamic instability and any patients who were inappropriate due to high anxiety levels were excluded. The patients who were eligible for this clinical trial were given a detailed explanation of the study, and informed consent was obtained for the catheterization procedure. They were then randomized into one group that received premedication with diazepam (5 mg) 30 to 60 minutes prior to the procedures or a second group that did not receive the premedication.</p><p>Randomization was achieved using an &#x0201c;alternating weekdays&#x0201d; procedure. All of the patients who arrived for their procedures on Saturday, Monday and Wednesday were given the premedication, and the patients undergoing their procedures on Sunday and Tuesday received no premedication prior to the procedures.</p><p>It is also important to note that midazolam administration was permitted during the procedures and was performed at the operator&#x02019;s discretion.</p><p>A data collection form was developed to collect the required information during recovery (while the patients were entering and exiting the catheterization laboratory). In addition, it took the current hospital practice and policy into account. This form included the patient&#x02019;s demographic and background variables, including height and weight, comorbid conditions, and previous ischemic heart disease, which consisted of any previous history of ST-elevated myocardial infarction, non-ST-elevated myocardial infarction, or coronary artery bypass grafting. In addition, it documented which procedure they underwent (diagnostic or interventional cardiac catheterization) and whether the procedure was elective or acute. The primary endpoint was patient pain and anxiety. One of the aims of this study was to measure the number of adverse events that the patients experienced while undergoing the procedure. Therefore, this aspect of the research sought to assess adverse effects, such as the composite of contrast-related allergies. Secondary endpoints included the number of non-catheter-induced spasms. The patient&#x02019;s anxiety and pain assessment involved a patient questionnaire, which sought to measure the patient&#x02019;s self-assessment of their perception of pain and anxiety in the periprocedural period.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Study medications</title><p>Diazepam (Valium) administration.

The data are presented as the means &#x000b1; standard deviations for the continuous variables and as absolute numbers (percentages) for the categorical variables. Comparisons between the two groups were performed using t-tests for the continuous variables and chi-squared tests for the categorical variables. A P-value of &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. An intention-to-treat analysis of all of the participants who were randomized into the treatment groups was used to determine the efficacy of the premedication therapy.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Study limitations</title><p>This study is single-center study and may be subject to bias.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><p>A total of 200 consecutive patients with similar demographic characteristics (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>) were randomized into two groups (100 patients per group).

The first group received open-label oral diazepam (5 mg) and chlorphenamine (4 mg) 60 minutes prior to their procedures, and the other group did not receive any premedication. The patient population was predominantly male (76%), with a mean age of 58 years.
