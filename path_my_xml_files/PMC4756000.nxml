functions depending on the duration of smartphone usage. [Subjects and Methods]
Participants were randomly allocated to 2 groups: group 1 (subjects who used smartphones
for &#x0003c;4 hours/day, n=25) and group 2 (subjects who used smartphones for &#x0003e;4 hours/day,
n=25). The craniovertebral angles of all participants were measured and scapular indices
were calculated to assess the change in posture and forced vital capacity, forced
expiratory volume in 1 second, the ratio of forced expiratory volume in 1 second to forced
vital capacity, and peak expiratory flow were measured to assess changes in respiratory
function. [Results] There were significant differences in the craniovertebral angle,
scapular index, and peak expiratory flow depending on the duration of smartphone usage.
[Conclusion] The result of this study showed that prolonged use of smartphones could
negatively affect both, posture and respiratory function.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Smartphone</kwd><kwd>Posture</kwd><kwd>Respiratory function</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>In the past few years, the number of smartphone users have progressively increased
worldwide<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. With the growing use of
smartphones, concerns have also increased about musculoskeletal problems associated with the
prolonged use of smartphones. Recent investigations have shown that smartphone users tend to
report pain in the neck, shoulder, and thumb, and the severity of the symptoms as the total
time spent using the smartphone increases<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Prolonged smart phone usage causes faulty posture such as forward
neck posture, slouched posture, or rounded shoulders<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Sustained forward neck posture can cause injury to the structure of
the cervical and lumbar spine, as well as ligaments<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. These structural problems caused by
faulty posture can also lead to respiratory dysfunction<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Perry et al. investigated the possibility correlation between
dysfunctional breathing and musculoskeletal pain patterns. Their result showed that 83% of
patients with neck pain (caused by faulty posture) experienced a changed breathing pattern.
This study indicated that there was a relationship between neck pain and respiration<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. The adverse effects of prolonged sitting
and a sedentary lifestyle on our health are well known, and similarly, we should understand
the effect of prolonged smartphone usage on our posture and respiratory function. Therefore,
our study focused on the change in the subjects body posture and respiratory function caused
by using smartphones for prolonged durations. The aim of this study was to evaluate the
changes in the posture and respiratory functions depending on the duration of smartphone
usage.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Fifty healthy volunteers were recruited from Daegu University, South Korea. The subject
characteristics (mean &#x000b1; SD) were: 21 &#x000b1; 2.41&#x02005;years old; 168 &#x000b1; 8.15&#x02005;cm in height; 65 &#x000b1;
14.41&#x02005;kg in body weight. The subjects were divided in to 2 groups according to the duration
of smartphone usage reported by each individual: group 1 for those that used smartphones
less than 4 hours per day (3.0 &#x000b1; 1.0 hours), and group 2 for those that used smartphones for
more than 4 hours each day (5.5 &#x000b1; 1.0 hours).</p><p>Subjects were excluded if they met any of the following conditions: had experienced
cervical fracture or trauma, bone cancer, neurological motion disorders, restrictions in
lung function, or other neurologic, orthopedic, or unstable cardiac conditions; were smokers
or smoke-free within 5&#x02005;years; or had undergone thoracic or abdominal surgery. Informed
consent was voluntarily obtained from all the subjects prior to participation in the study,
and this study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Daegu University.</p><p>To determine the subjects&#x02019; posture and lung function, we examined craniovertebral angle
(CVA), scapular index and respiratory function. Forward head posture (FHP) was assessed by
using CVA. A lower CVA indicates greater FHP. CVA showed good retest reliability in previous
studies (intra-class correlation coefficients ranged from 0.88 to 0.98)<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>CVA was assessed by using a digital, lateral-view photograph of the subjects in their usual
standing posture. A photograph was taken laterally by using a digital camera (AlpaNEX-6;
Sonny, China). The CVA was calculated by using Adobe Photoshop CS6. To minimize image
distortion, the assessor placed a circular spirit level at the base of the camera to ensure
that the camera was positioned perpendiculary to the horizontal. The tragus of the subject&#x02019;s
ear was marked, and the seventh cervical vertebra was found and marked by finding its bony
landmark. This was done by asking the subject to flex and extend her head 3 times, and then
finding the seventh spinous process of the vertebra. The angle of FHP was calculated between
the line connecting the tragus of ear to seventh cervical vertebra and the horizontal
plane<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>To assess for rounded shoulders, subjects were asked to stand normally with their hands
hanging beside the body. The coracoid process, sternal notch, posterior edge of the acromion
process and the adjacent thoracic vertebral spine were then palpated and marked. The
distance between the coracoid process and sternal notch, and the distance between the
posterior edge of acromion process and the adjacent thoracic vertebral spine were measured
by using tape. The scapular index was calculated by using the following formula<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>The resting position of the scapula was determined by measuring the distance from the
midpoint of the sternal notch (SN) to the medial aspect of the coracoid process (CP)
(the length of the chest side) and the horizontal distance from the posterolateral
angle of the acromion (PLA) to the thoracic spine (TS) (the length of the back
side).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jpts-28-186-g001"/></fig>).</p><p>Test of respiratory function were performed by using a spirometer (Cardiotouch 3000.
BIONET). The spirometer calculated and recorded the following measurements: forced vital
capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), ratio of forced expiratory
volume in 1 second to forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC), and peak expiratory flow (PEF). Each
subject was seated and asked to look straight ahead, while the mouthpiece of the spirometer
was inserted into their mouth and a nose clip was fixed on their nose. The same assessor
performed measurements throughout the entire experiment and the most physiological
respiratory function test results of three trials was recorded.</p><p>Statistical analysis was performed by using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS)
version 18.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA). Data were analyzed by using the independent t-test
to examine for differences in results between the 2 groups. Statistical significance was
defined as p &#x0003c; 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>A total of 50 subjects participated in the study, with 25 subjects in each group. The

prolonged smartphone use on change in posture. We also measured FVC, FEV1, FEV1/FVC and PEF
as parameters to demonstrate the change in respiratory function cause by prolonged
smartphone use. The results of this study show significant differences in CVA, scapular
index and PEF. As shown in <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, subjects who
used smartphones for prolonged durations tended to have poorer FHP and rounded shoulders
compared with the subjects who spent less time on smartphones. It also shows that people who
used smartphones for prolonged durations had partly impaired respiratory function.</p><p>FHP is one of the most common cervical abnormalities that predisposes individuals to
pathological conditions, such as headache, neck pain, temporomandibular disorders, vertebral
body disorders, alterations in the length and strength of soft-tissue, and scapula and
shoulder dyskinesia<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Many studies
proved that prolonged computer users tended to have a higher ratio of FHP<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. If people concentrate on watching the
relatively small screen, they tend to bend their neck more to look at the screen. This may
be the reason for the development of more severe problems<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>As stated earlier, a lower CVA indicates greater FHP. In our study, subjects who use
smartphone more than 4 hours per day had lower CVAs. This result is consistent with the
results from a recent study conducted by Kim et al. who showed that the increase in both
flexion angles of the cervical and lumbar spine were significantly higher in the group of
prolonged smartphone users (300&#x02005;s) compared with the group of smartphone users that used the
device for a short time (3&#x02005;s)<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Another
study showed that many smartphone users had neck pain due to increased cervical angles<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>A lower scapular index indicates a higher degree of rounded shoulders. In our study,
subjects who used smartphones more than 4 hours per day, had lower scapular index. Many
previous studies established that many sedentary workers tended to have a rounded shoulder
posture. In our study, the use of smartphones, as well as prolonged sitting caused the
typical rounded shoulder<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. The other
study showed that rounded shoulders is strongly associated with FHP<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. Fernandez and colleague reported that neck
musculoskeletal disorder (such as altered cervical posture) is related to thoracic kyphosis
and rounded shoulder posture. Their hypothesis was that irregular lower trapezius condition
and serratus anterior positions by abnormal scapular tilt can lead to rounded shoulder
posture<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In respiratory function, Only PEF showed significant difference between the two groups.
However, other variables (FVC, FEV1, FEV1/FVC) also showed lower values like PEF in subjects
using smartphone for prolonged duration. There are recent researches about the correlation
between posture and respiratory function. Baghery et al. reported that respiratory function
in slumped sitting is significantly lower than in other postures such as normal sitting or
standing<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. Similarly, kyphotic posture
caused by using a smartphone for a long time can impair respiratory function.</p><p>The result of this study showed that using a smartphone for a prolonged duration could
negatively effect both posture and respiratory function. These results may be used to
promote awareness about smartphone usage. For health considerations, we need to pay
attention to the duration of usage, as well as posture while using smartphones. This study
has some limitations. The number of subjects was relatively small and we did not investigate
the statistical relationship between posture and respiratory function. Another limitation is
that we could not determine possible solutions to these problems. Therefore, future studies
should further extend on this study in order to evaluate the missing insights and determine
possible solutions to the problems caused by prolonged smartphone usage.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Kang</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Shin</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Head flexion angle while using a
