Symptoms of atopy were reported to occur in 15&#x02013;40% of children aged 13&#x02013;14&#x02005;years living in the UK in the mid-1990s<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> and prevalence has increased in many countries in recent years.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2&#x02013;4</xref></p><p>Despite the high atopic disease burden, pathogenic mechanisms remain poorly understood. Atopic disorders are heterogeneous resulting from complex interactions between environmental factors, including exposure to microbes, and host genes modulating innate and acquired immune responses, and mucosal and skin integrity.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> A critical issue is the role of atopy defined as a genetic propensity to develop immunoglobulin E antibodies following exposure to allergens<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> and assessed by skin prick tests (SPTs) or measurement of specific IgE in serum. For eczema<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> and asthma,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> atopic sensitisation early in life has been associated with persistent disease.</p><p>The hygiene hypothesis, based on the observation of increased atopy in smaller families,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> postulates that reduced exposure to infections in early childhood results in aberrant immunological responses to allergens.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Intestinal microbiota provide a critical source of early immune stimulation and variations in early gut colonisation have been associated with the development of atopic disease.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Probiotics are defined as live microorganisms which, when administered in adequate amounts, confer health benefits on the host.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> However, the term &#x02018;probiotic&#x02019; is commonly used for microorganisms that are undergoing evaluation for possible health benefits and it is this sense that is used here. Clinical trials suggest a role for probiotics in the primary prevention of atopic eczema.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> The mechanisms whereby probiotics may prevent atopy are unclear but might involve reduced exposure to allergens through improved epithelial barrier function and modulation of the developing immune system to prevent IgE sensitisation.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p><p>We evaluated the effect of a probiotic comprising two strains of lactobacilli and two strains of bifidobacteria, or an inert placebo, administered to mother-infant dyads in the perinatal period on clinical and laboratory manifestations of atopy.

Details of the recruitment process are described elsewhere.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Women with known adverse conditions likely to affect them, the fetus, or the outcome of the pregnancy, were excluded. Women were informed of the trial, by letter, at booking, and provided with further information when attending for antenatal care. Those returning an expression of interest were contacted by researchers. Signed, informed consent was obtained by a researcher at 35&#x02013;36&#x02005;weeks gestation.</p><p>We had intended to recruit infants at &#x02018;high-risk&#x02019; of developing atopy defined as those with a first degree relative with either asthma or eczema diagnosed by a health professional or allergic rhinitis treated by a doctor.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> However, sufficient details of atopy in first degree relatives were often difficult to obtain at recruitment. Therefore, in practice, infants with and without an increased risk of atopy were recruited. To preserve the integrity of the random allocation sequence, all infants are included in this report. Key findings relating to those at increased risk of atopy are presented in Webtable 1.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Randomisation</title><p>Pregnant women were allocated on a 1:1 basis at 36&#x02005;weeks gestation to either the active or placebo arm of the study according to a computer-generated, random sequence without blocks. The random sequence was generated by the commercial partners and held independently of the research team. Women were allocated consecutively to the next number in the randomisation sequence and provided with the corresponding, preprepared intervention pack.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Intervention</title><p>We selected a multispecies probiotic preparation on the basis of greater efficacy than either single species or single organism preparations in the prevention or treatment of diseases in animal models and clinical trials.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Species that had been evaluated in previous clinical trials, including the prevention of eczema were selected.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Organisms were selected on the basis of activity in promoting responses in vitro consistent with protection against allergy (personal communication; Dr S. Plummer 2003).</p><p>The active intervention comprised a vegetarian capsule containing <italic>Lactobacillus salivarius</italic> CUL61 (National Collection of Industrial, Food and Marine Bacteria (NCIMB) 30211) 6.25&#x000d7;10<sup>9</sup> colony forming units (CFUs), <italic>Lactobacillus paracasei</italic> CUL08 (NCIMB 30154) 1.25&#x000d7;10<sup>9</sup> CFUs, <italic>Bifidobacterium animalis</italic> subspecies <italic>lactis</italic> CUL34 (NCIMB 30172) 1.25&#x000d7;10<sup>9</sup> CFUs and <italic>Bifidobacterium bifidum</italic> CUL20 (NCIMB 30153) 1.25&#x000d7;10<sup>9</sup> CFUs as a freeze-dried powder. Organism identity was confirmed at the species and strain levels by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, rep PCR fingerprinting and cluster analysis, and Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA typing. Women in the placebo arm received capsules of identical appearance containing maltodextrin powder. The dose in both arms was one capsule daily from 36&#x02005;weeks gestation until delivery. Infants received the same capsules as their mother once daily from birth to age 6&#x02005;months. Women were asked to store the capsules in the fridge and either took the capsule by mouth or sprinkled the contents onto food. The contents of the capsule were sprinkled directly into the infant's open mouth or mixed with expressed breast milk or formula feed. Mothers were asked not to consume any commercially available probiotics or live yoghurts or administer these to their infants.</p><p>Unused capsules returned by participants from intervention and placebo groups for compliance monitoring were tested by an independent laboratory on an opportunistic basis. No live bacteria were identified in the placebo capsules, conforming with the random allocation sequence. Viability of the bacteria in the active preparation was consistent with the storage conditions confirming no significant deterioration in the product.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Data collection and allergen testing</title><p>Demographic information and possible risk factors for atopy were recorded at recruitment. Follow-up questionnaires were scheduled every 6&#x02005;weeks to age 6&#x02005;months and at 1 year and 2&#x02005;years. A research assistant completed questionnaires with the parent/carer during a home visit at age 6&#x02005;weeks, during research clinics at 6&#x02005;months and 2&#x02005;years and by telephone interview at other times. Where a follow-up was missed, parents/carers were asked to provide information for the period since the last questionnaire was completed. Questionnaires recorded any atopic disorders diagnosed by health professionals, treatments received and the occurrence and duration of common skin, respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms.</p><p>At research clinics, infants were examined by either a clinician or a trained researcher. If present, the severity of eczema was evaluated by the scoring atopic dermatitis index.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> SPTs using common food allergens (cow's milk, hen's egg), aeroallergens (house dust mite, cat dander, grass pollen) and positive (histamine) and negative controls were performed. The response to an allergen was considered positive if there was a wheal diameter &#x02265;3&#x02005;mm.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Outcome measures</title><p>The primary outcome was the cumulative frequency of diagnosed eczema at 2&#x02005;year follow-up (reported by parents/carers to have been diagnosed by a health professional or diagnosed during a research clinic). Eczema was defined as an itchy rash affecting the face, scalp or extensor surfaces of the limbs in infants and flexures in older children and of duration &#x02265;4&#x02005;weeks and with &#x02265;1 exacerbation by age 24&#x02005;months<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> based on the information from questionnaires. Secondary outcomes were responses to SPTs, atopic eczema defined as eczema with one or more positive SPTs, eczema of any duration and whether or not diagnosed by a health professional, the severity of eczema, treatment with topical steroid preparations, respiratory symptoms with asthma and allergic rhinitis and reported food allergy. We had intended to report outcomes up to age 2&#x02005;years. However, scheduled follow-up assessments were often delayed particularly when mothers had returned to work. Therefore, we have included all information for children aged up to, but not including, 3&#x02005;years.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Data management and analysis</title><p>Strict blinding of the clinical research teams regarding participant allocation was maintained until after databases were locked following completion of data collection. The period of follow-up, defined as the time from birth to the age of the last follow-up questionnaire, was calculated for each infant. Demographic variables, possible risk factors for atopy, and primary and secondary outcomes were analysed by treatment allocated. Findings for binary outcomes were expressed in ORs with 95% CIs. A &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test or Fisher's exact test was used to compare proportions. Continuous outcome variables had skewed distributions and were summarised using median values and IQR and compared by the Mann-Whitney U test.</p><p>We performed adjusted analyses to investigate whether the trends in atopic sensitivity or atopic eczema were modified by baseline demographic variables (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ARCHDISCHILD2013305799TB1">table 1</xref>), possible risk factors for atopy (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ARCHDISCHILD2013305799TB2">table 2</xref>) and mother and infant compliance. For compliance, participants were classified as no compliance and compliance levels 1&#x02013;4 representing the quartiles of the total number of days that trial interventions were taken. We used a set of logistic regression models, including the study treatment in each case and adding the other variables in a stepwise manner, retaining them in the model if they resulted in a significant improvement in model fit (at the 5% level). Analysis was performed using R/SPSS V.16.0 (IBM, USA)/SAS V.9&#x000b7;2 (SAS Institute, USA).</p><table-wrap id="ARCHDISCHILD2013305799TB1" position="float"><label>Table&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Demographic characteristics and possible risk factors for atopy at baseline</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="char" char="(" span="1"/><col align="char" char="(" span="1"/></colgroup><thead valign="bottom"><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Variable</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Probiotic arm*</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Placebo arm*</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Socioeconomic status (Townsend rank;

However, with the exception of reduced sensitivity to cow's milk protein at 6&#x02005;months, differences in the smaller cohort did not reach statistical significance. Median (IQR) compliance with the trial interventions in pregnant women was 20 (12&#x02013;28) days in the probiotic arm and 20 (12&#x02013;28) days in the placebo arm (p=0.98, Mann-Whitney U test).

In logistic regression analyses, in almost all cases, additional variables (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ARCHDISCHILD2013305799TB1">table 1</xref>) were not significantly related to clinical outcomes and did not change the estimated OR for the effect of the probiotic.

However, probiotic administration was associated with a reduced frequency in sensitivity to food antigens and atopic eczema.</p><p>The strengths of our study are the relatively large number of mother-infant dyads recruited, the pragmatic nature of the trial, and confirmation of identity and viability of the probiotic organisms.</p><p>The study had several weaknesses. We had intended to evaluate clinical outcomes in infants at increased risk of atopy identified by having one or more first degree relatives with atopy. In practice, this was difficult to determine accurately at recruitment. However, the frequency of atopy and effects of the probiotic were similar in infants with and without a first degree relative with atopy. We expected that administering a novel intervention to healthy young infants would be difficult and, although compliance with the trial interventions in mothers was good, compliance was lower in infants. Finally, many mothers returned to work and this resulted in missed or delayed follow-up questionnaires and study clinic attendances. Although we compensated for missed follow-ups by subsequently asking parents and carers for information since the last assessment was done, this may have resulted in some loss of accuracy of information.</p><p>Our finding that the study probiotic did not affect the frequency of eczema is inconsistent with a meta-analysis of 13 randomised, placebo-controlled trials (3092 infants/children), where probiotic administration was associated with modest reductions in the frequency of eczema (fixed effects analysis; RR 0.79; 95% CI 0.71 to 0.88).<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Despite agreement between studies in the meta-analysis (I<sup>2</sup>=24.0%),<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> variability in outcomes between studies are likely to result from differences in the probiotics used,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> the contribution of atopic and other pathogenic factors including variations in host mucosal and skin integrity,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
