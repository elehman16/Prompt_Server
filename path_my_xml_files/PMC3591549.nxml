Studies on pediatric patients are necessary due to the differences in the airway of pediatric subjects compared with adult subjects.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] These differences are due to the large head, short jaw, higher larynx, anterior angulation of the vocal cords, and long bifid epiglottis in pediatric subjects.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>]</p><p>Recently, a small version of the Airtraq has been introduced for pediatric use. Two sizes of this pediatric version are available, one that accepts an endotracheal tube between 4.00 and 5.50 mm internal diameter and another that accepts a tube size between 2.50 and 3.50 mm for use in infants. Compared with Airtraq studies in adults, the authors hypothesize that pediatric Airtraq scope will be easy to use. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the intubation time of Airtraq compared with Macintoch laryngoscope in pediatric patients, number of intubation attempts, optimization maneuvers, ease of intubation, and cardiovascular changes during intubation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><p>Ethical approval for this study was provided by the local research ethics board. Written parental informed consent was obtained for all the subjects. Fifty healthy children aged 2&#x02013;10 years of American Society of Anesthesiologists class I, who were scheduled for elective surgery under general anesthesia requiring endotracheal intubation were enrolled in this prospective, randomized study. Exclusion criteria included subjects with a history of difficult intubation, risk of gastric aspiration, cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, metabolic disease, and central nervous system disease. Solid food was not allowed for 6 h preoperatively and clear liquids were permitted up to 3 h prior to induction of anesthesia.</p><p>Subjects were premedicated with oral midazolam 0.5 mg/kg (with a maximum dose of 10 mg) 1 h before surgery. Baseline hemodynamic data were recorded after placement of routine monitors when the subject arrived in the operating room. Anesthesia was induced with inhalational sevoflurane in oxygen-air mixture. After induction and establishment of an intravenous line, fentanyl 2-&#x003bc;g/kg, glycopyrrolate 0.04 &#x003bc;g/kg, and atracurium 0.5 mg/kg were administered. Sealed envelopes opened by the anesthesiologist prior to induction were used to randomize subjects to undergo intubation with the Airtraq laryngoscope (Airtraq&#x02122; group) or Macintosh laryngoscope (Macintosh group). Both anesthesiologists (WR and AM) in this study had 15 or more years of experience.</p><p>The parameters under study included intubation time (primary outcome), number of intubation attempts, and number of optimization maneuvers required, such as repositioning the head or the need for a second assistant to aid tracheal intubation. Intubation time was recorded as the period from termination of manual ventilation with a facemask to initiation of ventilation through the endotracheal tube. After successful tracheal intubation the ease of intubation was recorded by the investigator using a visual analog scale (0 = extremely easy to 10 = extremely difficult). Tracheal intubation requiring 120 s or more was classified as a failed intubation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>]</p><p>Hemodynamic variables, including systolic, diastolic, mean arterial blood pressure, and heart rate were recorded before and after anesthetic induction, and at 1, 3, and 5 min after tracheal intubation. An independent research assistant recorded all data.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data were analyzed with SPPS version 14 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Power analysis indicated that 25 subjects per group are required based on a 25 s (50%) reduction in the intubation time comparing Airtraq[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] to direct laryngoscope.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] The alpha error was set at 0.05 and type II error was set at 0.20.

The subjects in this study were not expected to be difficult to intubate. However, assorted case reports do report successful intubation with the Airtraq in difficult cases. For example, Vlatten and Soder described the successful use of Airtraq for the management of a difficult airway in an infant with Robin Sequence, which is marked by micrognathia, retrognathia, and glossoptosis.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] Recently, Iwai and colleagues also reported success with the Airtraq in a 1-year 5-month-old male child with Robin Sequence.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] Similarly, Hirabayshi and colleagues reported improved view of the glottis and successful intubation with the use of the pediatric Airtraq in a 9-year-old child with Treacher&#x02013;Collin syndrome compared with the Macintosh laryngoscope.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] Piraccini and colleagues reported a case series of 7 children in whom Airtraq was used as a rescue device for intubation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] Piraccini and colleagues recommend the pediatric Airtraq for cases suspected to be difficult intubations or Cormack and Lehane grade 3 or 4 when using the Macintosh laryngoscope.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] Piraccini and colleagues successfully intubated all subjects at first attempt in less than 30 s.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] In agreement with our results but in adult Chalkeidis and colleagues reported that it is easy to use Airtraq videolaryngoscope but no clear advantage in patients with normal airway.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] They did not find any significant difference as regard the intubation time, need for intubation assistance and complications rate.</p><p>Our results differ from those of Maharaj and colleagues[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] who reported less alteration of the stress response to intubation with Airtraq in adult patients. We found a low heart rate in the Airtraq group. This difference between studies can be attributed to the difference in the physiology of the study populations.</p><p>There are several limitations to this study. First, this study was conducted in children with normal airway, and the results may not be extrapolated to children with difficult airways. Second, experienced airway operators in a tertiary care center conducted intubations in this study and the results may not apply to other settings.</p><p>In conclusion, Airtraq decreases intubation time, number of intubation attempts, and optimization maneuvers in pediatric patients. It was easier to use by the investigators. It results in a lower alteration in the heart rate compared with direct visualization by the standard Macintosh laryngoscope.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Neustein</surname><given-names>SM</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Use of the Airtraq Laryngoscope</article-title><source>Anesthesiology</source><year>2007</year><volume>107</volume><fpage>674</fpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">17893473</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Maharaj</surname><given-names>CH</given-names></name><name><surname>Costello</surname><given-names>JF</given-names></name><name><surname>Higgins</surname><given-names>BD</given-names></name><name><surname>Harte</surname><given-names>BH</given-names></name><name><surname>Laffey</surname><given-names>JG</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Learning and performance of tracheal intubation by novice personnel: A comparison of the Airtraq and Macintosh laryngoscope</article-title><source>Anaesthesia</source><year>2006</year><volume>61</volume><fpage>671</fpage><lpage>7</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16792613</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Suzuki</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Toyama</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Iwasaki</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Henderson</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Airtraq for awake tracheal intubation</article-title><source>Anaesthesia</source><year>2007</year><volume>62</volume><fpage>746</fpage><lpage>7</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">17567358</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Maharaj</surname><given-names>CH</given-names></name><name><surname>Buckley</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><name><surname>Harte</surname><given-names>BH</given-names></name><name><surname>Laffey</surname><given-names>JG</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Endotracheal intubation in patients with cervical spine immobilization.
