Besides hippocampal sharp wave-ripple complexes and sleep spindles, slow oscillations appear to play a key role in the process of sleep-associated memory consolidation. Furthermore, slow oscillation amplitude and spectral power increase during the night after learning declarative and procedural memory tasks. However, it is unresolved whether learning-induced changes specifically alter characteristics of individual slow oscillations, such as the slow oscillation up-state length and amplitude, which are believed to be important for neuronal replay. 24 subjects (12 men) aged between 20 and 30 years participated in a randomized, within-subject, multicenter study. Subjects slept on three occasions for a whole night in the sleep laboratory with full polysomnography. Whereas the first night only served for adaptation purposes, the two remaining nights were preceded by a declarative word-pair task or by a non-learning control task. Slow oscillations were detected in non-rapid eye movement sleep over electrode Fz. Results indicate positive correlations between the length of the up-state as well as the amplitude of both slow oscillation phases and changes in memory performance from pre to post sleep. We speculate that the prolonged slow oscillation up-state length might extend the timeframe for the transfer of initial hippocampal to long-term cortical memory representations, whereas the increase in slow oscillation amplitudes possibly reflects changes in the net synaptic strength of cortical networks. </p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Research was supported by the Austrian Science Fund (FWF, Project P-15370).

Over centuries, sleep was a much studied topic, which even today appears to be a challenging research field with many unresolved mysteries. Many functions of sleep have been discussed, with sleep-dependent consolidation being a prevalent topic. According to the &#x0201c;active system consolidation&#x0201d; hypothesis, sleep actively strengthens and restructures memories and thereby promotes the consolidation of newly acquired memory traces [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>It is believed that new, declarative knowledge is initially encoded in a fast-learning temporary memory storage as well as in a parallel slow-learning long-term memory storage, namely the hippocampus and the neocortex, respectively [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Studies using single-unit recordings in rodents have shown that after encoding, during quiet wakefulness or subsequent sleep, newly acquired memory traces become spontaneously and repeatedly reactivated. These reactivations are most prominent within the fast-learning hippocampus and are strongest during the occurrence of hippocampal sharp wave-ripple complexes [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. During sleep, particularly during slow-wave sleep (SWS), hippocampal ripples - recorded in rats and humans - were found to be temporally linked to thalamo-cortically generated sleep spindles [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], which are proposed to support synaptic plasticity at the neocortical level [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. </p><p>According to the idea of an active system consolidation during sleep, hippocampal reactivations and sleep spindles are proposed to foster the gradual transformation of initially fragile hippocampal to permanent cortical long-term memory representations [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>A key role in this model is assigned to the sleep slow oscillation. Slow oscillations are generated within cortical networks [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and occur in human sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) with a mean spectral peak frequency of 0.7-0.8 Hz [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Every slow oscillation consists of a hyperpolarized &#x0201c;down&#x0201d;-state associated with a decreased and a depolarized &#x0201c;up&#x0201d;-state characterized by an increased cortical activity [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Besides cortical activity, also ripple and sleep spindle activity is strongly increased during depolarizing up-states of neocortical slow oscillations [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. It is believed that the reactivation of newly learned hippocampal memories and moreover the transfer of these memories into the cortex is grouped by the up-state of the slow oscillation. Hence, according to this idea, reactivated hippocampal memories reach the cortex at a point in time in which most cortical neurons are depolarized and spindles are occurring. In other words, slow oscillations are proposed to synchronize and orchestrate a hippocampo-to-neocortical information transfer and hereby play a critical role in integrating newly acquired hippocampal memory traces into slow learning cortical long-term memory systems [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>Indeed, inducing slow oscillations during SWS by transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS) [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] provided the first evidence for a causal role of slow oscillations in declarative memory consolidation. Besides increased overnight memory improvement, such stimulation also led to enhanced spindle activity and enhanced EEG power in the slow oscillation band. In line with these findings, several recent studies reported a positive correlation between the EEG power in the slow-wave frequency range (0.1-4 Hz) &#x02013; often named slow-wave activity (SWA) &#x02013; and overnight memory change in healthy children [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and adults [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. </p><p>However, SWA does not contain information regarding the amplitude and/or the phase length of both the up-state and down-state of the slow oscillation. Using single slow oscillation events instead of SWA, M&#x000f6;lle and colleagues [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] showed that learning of a declarative word-pair task, compared to a non-learning control task, led to a specific amplitude increase in the up-state of the slow oscillation, whereas the down-state amplitude and the length of the slow oscillation were not affected. In this study, we address whether changes in certain slow oscillation features, such as slow oscillation peak amplitudes and phase lengths, are triggered in response to a declarative learning demand or are related to overnight gains or decrements in memory performance. Therefore, we re-analyzed a data set previously published by Schabus and colleagues [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2.1"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>The study was approved by the local research ethics committee (University of Salzburg, Ethics Committee) and was conducted in accordance with the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.

Recall performance is expressed as the percentage of correct responses (e.g. TEST1=[correct response score<sub>TEST1</sub>/160]*100). Accordingly, the overnight change in memory performance was defined as the difference between morning and evening recall performance.</p></sec><sec id="s2.4.2"><title>Control task</title><p>The control task was highly similar to the experimental task, but lacking an intentional learning component.

Our results demonstrate that whereas learning a declarative word-pair task prior to sleep does not alter (i) the up- or down-state peak amplitude or (ii) the up- or down-state length of the slow oscillation in general, there is a relation to individual overnight memory change.</p><p>Specifically, we revealed that the amount of overnight memory change is linearly related to induced changes in the up-state length as well as to changes in the up-state and down-state peak amplitude of the slow oscillation, which is in line with earlier reports relating slow oscillation power to changes in declarative [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and procedural [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] memory performance from evening to morning. While all these results underline the role of slow oscillations for memory consolidation during sleep [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], we believe that, specifically, the separation of up- and down- states &#x02013; and not merely the overall slow oscillation power &#x02013; adds important information about state specific contributions to the consolidation process. Recent evidence clearly points to the fact that the depolarizing up-state of the slow oscillation is the more likely time window where information reprocessing occurs [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] or where incoming information during sleep is further processed [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. We therefore argue that a relative increase in the length of the up-state phase might provide a longer time window for replaying and transferring new memories from the hippocampus into cortical networks. Consequently, the accessibility of newly stored memories should be facilitated and overnight memory change increased. </p><p>Another prevalent hypothesis concerning learning-related slow oscillation changes has been postulated by Tononi and Cirelli [<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]: the synaptic downscaling hypothesis. According to their view, learning during wakefulness leads to synaptic potentiation and slow oscillations - reflected by SWA - downscale this net increase in synaptic strength during SWS. As a result, exclusively strong memories survive this downscaling process and signal to noise ratio increases, which thus facilitate accessibility of these memory traces. The degree of synchronization between populations of neurons during sleep differs as a function of the synaptic strength at the end of the day. High synaptic strength leads to high rates of synchronization and as a consequence to high slow oscillation amplitudes. Hence, initial encoding efficiency or initial strength of newly acquired memory traces probably should separate memory enhancers (I+) from memory non-enhancers (I-) as only the former individuals show an increase of slow oscillation amplitudes following learning. However, in our study, I+ and I- did not differ in their absolute memory performance during recall before sleep. It can be argued that I+, irrespectively of the initial encoding strength, experience a stronger depotentiation during the night. This might be reflected by a relative increase in slow oscillation amplitudes and may lead to an increase in signal to noise ratio and consequently easier memory access the next day. </p><p>Note, however, that there are also recent animal studies, which seem at odds with the assumptions of the synaptic downscaling hypothesis [<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. For instance, a study by Chauvette and collegues [<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] revealed that long-term potentiation rather than downscaling of cortical networks occurs during SWS. Interestingly, in that study SWS-related potentiation was linked to hyperpolarization periods and thus establishes a link between slow-wave down-states, long-term potentiation and consequently also sleep-associated memory consolidation. In light of these findings, our results might therefore also reflect the efficiency of long-term potentiation processes during the night after learning a declarative memory task during the slow oscillation down-state. The exact significance of slow oscillation up- or down-states for long-term potentiation and memory consolidation is yet to be addressed.</p><p>Besides differences in learning induced changes, we also found a general difference regarding the up-state phase length of the slow oscillation between I+ and I-. Furthermore, changes in the up-state length were also related to subjects&#x02019; IQ. However, trait effects do not seem to significantly bias revealed memory change and slow oscillation effects. </p><p>Learning induced changes in slow oscillation parameters were only evident in individuals who improved their memory overnight (cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082049-g003">Figure 3</xref>). This implies that these modifications are not generally induced by learning. Regarding the length of the slow oscillation, our results resemble findings by M&#x000f6;lle et al. [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], as they also did not find general, learning induced modifications of the length of slow oscillations. Nevertheless, M&#x000f6;lle and colleagues could show a slight learning induced increase in the up-state amplitude at around 500-800ms after the peak of the down-state. As we only analyzed the peak amplitude of the up-state and as the up-state peak occurs most often before 500ms after the down-state peak, it is quite possible that point by point comparisons would have revealed a similar, general learning induced amplitude increase in such &#x0201c;late&#x0201d; timeframe of the slow oscillation up-state. Furthermore, we restricted our analysis to slow oscillations detected over site Fz. It is therefore possible that general learning induced changes in slow oscillation amplitudes and phase lengths could be revealed over other, probably more specifically task related, cortical regions. Last but not least, as this study was a first explorative study using different kind of slow oscillation measures, we did not apply any alpha-adjustment for multiple testing.</p><p>In conclusion, our data extend earlier findings and suggest that the length of the up-state of individual slow oscillations directly relates to overnight memory improvements in a declarative memory task. In addition, both the up-state and down-state peak amplitude were found to be related to overnight memory changes. We speculate that while a prolongation of the depolarizing up-state of the slow oscillation extends the time window for neuronal replay and therefore relates to overnight memory improvement, slow oscillation amplitude changes might reflect changes in the net synaptic strength of cortical networks. Such amplitude changes might either relate to synaptic downscaling and thus to an improved signal to noise ratio for better memory access or to a direct strengthening or integration of new memories within or into cortical networks by means of long term potentiation.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
