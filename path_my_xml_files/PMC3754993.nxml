We recruited healthy adult participants and used adaptive running working memory training tasks with a double-blind design, combined with the event-related potentials (ERPs) approach, to explore the influence of updating function training on brain activity. Participants in the training group underwent training for 20 days. Compared with the control group, the training group's accuracy (ACC) in the two-back working memory task had no significant differences after training, but reaction time (RT) was reduced significantly. Besides, the amplitudes of N160 and P300 increased significantly whereas that of P200 decreased significantly. The results suggest that training could have improved the participants' capacity on both inhibitory and updating.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the Major Project of the National Social Science Fund (11&#x00026;ZD187) and the projects of the human social science on Young Fund of the ministry of Education (13YJC190032).

Several researchers have used neuroimaging techniques to explore the neural basis of working memory plasticity. Their results showed that, through working memory training, the activity of the brain areas related with working memory can be enhanced <xref rid="pone.0071063-Westerberg1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0071063-Olesen1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. McNab et al. found that the plasticity of working memory is correlated with changes in the density of the dopamine D1 receptor in the cerebral cortex <xref rid="pone.0071063-McNab1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>.</p><p>Although these cognitive neuroscience studies proved that working memory training could change the activity of relevant brain areas <xref rid="pone.0071063-Westerberg1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0071063-Olesen1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, the brain areas involved in working memory are complicated, and a certain connectivity of those different areas may be required to fulfill this function <xref rid="pone.0071063-Collette1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. However, results from neuroimaging techniques show that it is difficult to explain the influence of working memory training on brain activity based on the spatial activation pattern. The event-related potentials (ERPs) technique has high resolution in a time course and could distinguish the changes in different stages of working memory processing based on the temporal activation patterns. For instance, McEvoy et al. found that the aging of working memory is not a single-area alteration <xref rid="pone.0071063-McEvoy1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. On the contrary, aging was revealed by decreases in the amplitude of P300 in the parietal cortex and increases in the amplitude of P200 in the frontal cortex. Thus, our study used ERPs to probe the influence of working memory updating training on the relevant brain processing.</p><p>Updating is an essential component in the central executive component of WM, which recently have attracted great attention in the WM study field <xref rid="pone.0071063-Zhao1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0071063-Klingberg2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. The major function of updating is to continuously and simultaneously change the contents in the working memory load according to newly presented information <xref rid="pone.0071063-Collette1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0071063-Kane1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. The running memory task is widely used as an index of WMU. In this task, participants are presented with a series of unknown items of a certain length, which they are required to recall in order within a certain length of time. This task better represents the ability to monitor input information and to replace old information that is irrelevant to the ongoing task with new information that is relevant to the ongoing task <xref rid="pone.0071063-Mirris1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. More important, the running memory task purely reflects the central executive functioning involved in WM, removing the potential confounding effects of storage. Our studies used an adaptive running working memory task to perform working memory updating training.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>The experiment was conducted after obtaining Institutional Review Board approval from the School of Psychology at Beijing Normal University.

The participants were between 18 and 29 years of age, with normal or corrected normal sight, no color blindness or weakness, no history of mental illness and neuropathy, no medical treatment or drug use before the experiments, and no consumption of coffee, alcohol or other substances that could affect the neurosystem 24 hours before the pre- and post-test. The subjects were randomly divided into training and control groups, with 12 subjects in the training group (3 males and 9 females with an average age of 20.5 years, std 2.24) and 12 subjects in the control group. However, the cap of one participant in the latter group was off and did not join in the post-test, so there were 11 valid participants (5 males and 6 females with an average age of 21.27 years, std 3.10). The experiments were approved by the IRB in Beijing Normal University, and all of the participants signed consent forms and received ordinary pay.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Tests for Pre- and Post-training Evaluation</title><p>We used a 2-back task to measure working memory ability, which has a sound validation and reliability; the program was compiled by E-prime 2.0. In the 2-back task, the participants were asked to compare whether the current stimulus is the same as the latest two stimuli. When performing the task, there was a fixation &#x0201c;+&#x0201d; in the center of a black screen, and a series of Arabic numbers would present up/down/left/right of the &#x0201c;+&#x0201d; one by one; the numbers range from 1 to 9. The participants need to judge the numbers' locations regardless of their values. The font used was &#x0201c;Times New Roman&#x0201d;, the color was white, the font size was 60, and the numbers and the positions that they appeared in were random. The interval between stimuli was 4500 ms: first the prompt &#x0201c;X&#x0201d; was presented, followed by a 1300 ms delay, and then the stimuli were presented for 200 ms, allowing participants to enter a reaction within 2500 ms. The whole test consists of 2 blocks with 84 trials, and the first two trials in each block need no response. Half of the participants press &#x0201c;1&#x0201d; for a consistent judgment and &#x0201c;3&#x0201d; for an inconsistent judgment, and the other half are press &#x0201c;3&#x0201d; for a consistent judgment and &#x0201c;1&#x0201d; for an inconsistent judgment.

Several letters were then presented one after another. The number of letters presented varied between different trials, with 5, 7, 9 or 11 letters presented in each trial. Every trial type occurred in a random order. The participants were required to sequentially remember the last three letters presented. For example, if the presented letters are, sequentially, S-D-F-G-H-J-K, then participants need to remember S, S-D, S-D-F, D-F-G, F-G-H, G-H-J, H-J-K. Finally, a blank is presented on the screen, and the participants need to enter the last three letters presented, in order, using the keyboard. The duration of every letter presented is 1750 ms at the beginning, and the difficulty of the task is subsequently changed according to the scores of participants; namely, as their scores increase, the duration of every letter presented decreases. The participants finished 6 blocks with 5 trials of this task. To be specific, if participants correctly answered 3 or more trials in these five trials, the duration of each letter in the next block will be reduced by 100 ms. In contrast, if the participants incorrectly answered 2 or more trials in these five trials, the duration of each letter will be prolonged by 100 ms.

The band-pass filter range of 0.05 to 100 Hz was used during the EEG recording. Vertical EOG and horizontal EOG were recorded with two pairs of electrodes, one placed above and below the right eyes and another 10 mm from the lateral canthi.

The results of the independent sample t-test of the two additive values demonstrated that there is no statistically significant difference related to the additive ACC values between the training and control groups (<italic>t</italic>(21)&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1.243, <italic>p</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.228, <italic>d</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.52).

We didn't find an increase of accuracy in 2-back task in post-test, compared with pre-test, which might be due to the difficulty of the task and the cognitive capacity of our participants. The 2-back task adopted in our study had been verified to have good validity, reliability, and differentiation <xref rid="pone.0071063-Owen1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Whereas, in our study, all participants are aged 18&#x02013;29, and all are well educated. Accuracy of 23 participants ranges from 77.5% to 100%, and mean accuracy of the pre-test was 95.27%, and the standard deviation was 5.01. As it demonstrated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0071063-t002">Table 2</xref>, one participant's accuracy was 77.5%, one 88.5%, one 89.7%, two 92.4%, two 93.7%, one 94.8%, one 94.9%, one 96.2%, two 96.3%, one 97.4%, three 97.5%, two 98.7%, two 98.8%, and three 100%. Judging from the overall data distribution, it can be found that accuracy for pre-test was quite high, with most of them around 95%, which might leave little room for participants to improve. However, it reflects at the same time that the participants had fully understood the task and thoroughly devoted their cognitive resources to accomplish the task. Analyzing data of each participant in the training group, we found that 8 out of 12 improved in accuracy, 2 subjects showed no difference, 2 declined.

2-back task decreased significantly. Our explanations are: a) No trade-off effects exist between accuracy and reaction time in the pre- and post-test; b) Evidence from previous studies <xref rid="pone.0071063-McEvoy1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0071063-Owen1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0071063-Gevins1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> showed that reaction time of working memory 2-back task is an indicator of working memory capacity. McEvoy found the reaction time of old people in working memory 2-back task is significantly higher than that of the younger ones, thus making the reaction time a main indicator of working memory aging <xref rid="pone.0071063-McEvoy1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Gevins found the subjects with higher IQ showed a significant lower reaction time in working memory 2-back task, making the reaction time a main indicator of intelligence level <xref rid="pone.0071063-Gevins1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Therefore, we regarded reaction time as an effective indicator of evaluating the training effect.</p><p>Our study used the running memory task, which purely reflects the central executive functioning involved in WM and removes the potential confounding effects of storage from the training task. Compared with the control group, the training group's 2-back working memory task performance improved significantly, as demonstrated by the decrease in the RT. The 2-back task involves storage capacity and multiple executive sub-components <xref rid="pone.0071063-Owen1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. The improvement in 2-back working memory performance resulted from an improvement in executive function, namely, the core updating function in working memory.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>ERPs Analysis</title><p>Following previous research <xref rid="pone.0071063-McEvoy1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, for our total average results, we mainly measured P200 in the frontal area (FZ) and P300 and N160 in the parietal area (PZ, P7, and P8). The amplitudes of P200 and N160 were apparent; hence, we measured their peak values. The time window of P200 was 150&#x02013;250 ms and that of N160 was 130&#x02013;200 ms. The peak value of P300 had large individual differences, and several participants did not have apparent peak values. Therefore, we merely analyzed the average amplitude, and we chose 250&#x02013;500 ms as the time window; this decision was based on previous research and the additive results.</p><p>For the individual N160 component analysis, we used the post-test peak value minus the pre-test peak value to obtain the additive values, and we calculated the two groups' average additive values (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0071063-g001">Figure 2</xref>). The independent-sample t test showed that, on the P7 electrode, the additive value of N160 is not significantly different between the two groups (<italic>t</italic>(21)&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;&#x02212;0.735, <italic>p</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.470, <italic>d</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.30) whereas, on the P8 electrode, the training group's N160 additive value is significantly lower than the control's (<italic>t</italic>(21)&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;&#x02212;2.356, <italic>p</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.028, <italic>d</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.98). These results showed that the N160 amplitude increased after training. The N160 component is considered to be representative of visual recognition processing <xref rid="pone.0071063-McEvoy1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. The increased N160 amplitude after training demonstrated that working memory updating training can improve the strength and validity of an individual's recognition of a target stimulus. This result implied that the influence of training likely occurs at the perception stage. In our study, the positive results on P8 combined with the negative results on P7 may be due to the spatial task used in the pre- and post-tests. The N160 component was found in the studies of facial identity earlier. N160 (N170) was recorded during 130&#x02013;200 ms after the appearance of face or other objects, whose negative amplitude arrives during 160&#x02013;170 ms. It mainly shows in occipito-temporal region and gets the highest amplitude on P8 (T6).When induced by face, the N160 (N170)'s amplitude gets higher than that induced by objects on both hemisphere, usually with right hemisphere advantage <xref rid="pone.0071063-Rousselet1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Previous studies revealed that N160 (N170) might reflect the process of stimulus's category in recognizing progress. N160 (N170) could be induced by other stimulus besides face, such as car, house, furniture, words <xref rid="pone.0071063-Carmel1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0071063-Itier1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0071063-Marina1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. In the linguistic field, studies on N160 or N170 component in the visual cognition mechanism of words were primarily focused on the language family of alphabets. Many have discovered that words would induce more N160 or N170 reactions in the left occipital lobe compared with other stimulus like human faces, object drawings, or character strings <xref rid="pone.0071063-Brem1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0071063-Maurer1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0071063-Maurer2" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0071063-Wong1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. While in the working memory field, McEvoy's study <xref rid="pone.0071063-McEvoy1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> found both spatial working memory task and verbal working memory task can induce N160 component in parietal and occipital, and the N160 component can be interpreted as being relevant with perceptual speed and visual attention allocation.</p><p>In the individual P200 component analysis, we used the post-test peak value minus the pre-test peak value to obtain the additive values, and we calculated the two groups' average additive values (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0071063-g002">Figure 3</xref>).
