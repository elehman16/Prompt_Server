The objective of this study was to assess the psychometric properties of the 9-item, patient-administered version of the Montgomery-&#x000c5;sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS-S).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Data from a multicentre, double-blind, 8-week, randomised controlled trial of 278 outpatients diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder were used to evaluate the validity, reliability and sensitivity to change of the MADRS-S using psychometric methods. A Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve was plotted to identify the most appropriate threshold to define perceived remission.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>No missing values were found at the item level, indicating good acceptability of the scale. The construct validity was satisfactory: all items contributed to a common underlying concept, as expected. The correlation between MADRS-S and physicians' MADRS was moderate (r = 0.54, p &#x0003c; 0.001) indicating that MADRS-S is complementary rather than redundant to the MADRS. Cronbach's alpha was 0.84, and the stability over time of the scale, estimated on a sub-sample of patients whose health status did not change during the first week of the study, was good (intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.78). MADRS-S sensitivity to change was shown. Using a threshold value of 5, the definition of "perceived remission" reached a sensitivity of 82% and a specificity of 75%.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Taking account of patient's perceptions of the severity of their own symptoms along with the psychometric properties of the MADRS-S enable its use for evaluative purposes in the development of new antidepressant drugs.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Depression is a disabling illness associated with considerable co-morbidity, risk of suicide and numerous adverse social and economic consequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The reported lifetime risk for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) in the general population varies between 10% &#x02013; 25% for women, and 5% &#x02013; 12% for men [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The pharmacological treatment of MDD is based on antidepressants, whose efficacy has been demonstrated in a large number of studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>The use of patient-reported outcomes as a secondary endpoint in the development of new antidepressants has been of growing interest in recent years. Among these outcomes, health-related quality of life, medication compliance and subjective effectiveness (patients' perceptions of symptom severity) are the most commonly used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. One possible explanation for this growing interest is the fact that patients are increasingly becoming key players in the overall disease management process. In the subjective effectiveness questionnaire category, the main instruments are the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], the Carroll Rating Scale for Depression (CRSD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], the Montgomery &#x02013; &#x000c5;sberg Depression Rating Scale &#x02013; Self report (MADRS-S) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], the Hamilton Depression Inventory (HDI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], and the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology &#x02013; Self Report (QIDS-SR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>The BDI is the most widely used self-rating instrument, and has been extensively validated in numerous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The CRSD and the HDI are the self-reported versions of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], while the MADRS-S is the patient version of the Montgomery-&#x000c5;sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. From the conceptual and psychometric points of view, these questionnaires are quite different. The BDI is more concerned with depressive cognitive attitudes while the other scales pay more attention to somatic symptoms and functional impairment. The CRSD may discourage patients; completing its 52 questions is time consuming. This may also make it more difficult to implement in clinical research studies compared with the shorter 16-item QIDS-SR or 9-item MADRS-S.</p><p>These reasons led us to focus on the psychometric properties of the MADRS-S, particularly its sensitivity to change, since this is of major importance for evaluative purposes (e.g. in the comparison of treatment effects).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Patients and Methods</title><sec><title>Study Design and Population</title><p>Data came from a multicentre, double blind, randomised clinical trial comparing escitalopram with citalopram in outpatients diagnosed with MDD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Eligible patients were aged between 18&#x02013;65 years, fulfilled DSM-IV criteria for MDD, and had a baseline MADRS total score of at least 30.</p><p>Patients meeting DSM-IV criteria for primary diagnoses of any axis I other than MDD, or those with a history of mania, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia or other psychotic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, or cognitive disorder were not eligible for the study. Patients who met DSM-IV criteria for substance abuse or dependence within the past 12 moths, or who used a depot antipsychotic within 6 months before study inclusion, or any antipsychotic, anxiolytic or anticonvulsant medications within 2 weeks before the first administration of study medication were also ineligible for inclusion.</p><p>The Regional review and Ethics committee approved the study protocol on September 3<sup>rd</sup>, 2003. All patients provided their written informed consent.</p></sec><sec><title>Assessments</title><p>Study assessments were performed at baseline and at weeks 1, 4 and 8 after start of treatment. Sociodemographics and clinical data were collected at baseline, and the investigators administered the MADRS, the Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI-S) and Improvement (CGI-I) scales at each visit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Before these assessments, patients were asked to fill in the MADRS-S.</p><p>This scale consists of 9 items assessing patients' mood, feelings of unease, sleep, appetite, ability to concentrate, initiative, emotional involvement, pessimism and zest for life. Each item is scored between 0 and 3, with three intermediate levels (0.5, 1.5, 2.5). The total score is calculated by summing the answers of the nine items, ranging between 0 and 27 (higher scores indicate increased impairment).</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 8.2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], and all statistical tests were two-sided. The &#x003b1; risk was set to 0.05. Continuous variables were described using mean &#x000b1; standard deviation (SD), while categorical variables were reported using frequency and percentage.</p><p>Item-level analysis consisted of assessing the number of missing values for each item and item-response distribution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Correlating each item with the MADRS-S total score after correction for overlap assessed item-internal consistency. A correlation of at least 0.40 is recommended as the standard for supporting item-internal consistency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. We also calculated the percentage of respondents achieving the lowest (floor effect) and highest (ceiling effect) score to determine whether the range of MADRS-S was appropriate.</p><p>Construct validity was examined using several methods.</p><p>(1) Factor analysis was conducted to test the underlying dimensionality of the MADRS-S.</p><p>(2) The discriminative validity of the MADRS-S was determined by comparing mean scores across patient groups that were known to differ in their clinical features (known-groups methodology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]). Since the recall period of the MADRS-S is the past three days, we did not expect it to be associated with medical history (i.e. number of episodes of depression, history of psychiatric hospitalisation), and we assumed the MADRS-S total score to be associated with the severity of the current episode.</p><p>(3) The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve was plotted to define the optimal cut-off value for perceived remission, using the MADRS criteria of 12 or less for remission as the "gold standard".</p><p>Cronbach's alpha coefficient was used to estimate the internal consistency reliability of the MADRS-S score. A reliability of at least 0.70 is recommended to compare groups of patients, while at least 0.90 is required for comparing individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Test-retest reliability of the MADRS-S questionnaire was assessed in a sub-sample of 120 patients whose health status severity was declared unchanged between the baseline and week 1 visits using the CGI-I scale. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was computed between scale scores from both assessments.</p><p>The sensitivity to change of the MADRS-S questionnaire was assessed in a sub-sample of 132 patients whose MADRS total score at week 8 was lower or equal to 12 (remission state). Baseline and week 8 scores were compared using paired <italic>t</italic>-test. Effect sizes were also computed. According to Cohen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], an effect size of at least 0.2 is recommended as the standard for supporting sensitivity to change.</p><p>Finally, the evaluative ability of the MADRS-S to discriminate between treatment groups was tested using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model, predicting the mean MADRS-S change at week 8 from baseline, with investigator specialisation and treatment as factors, and baseline MADRS-S score as covariate. Perceived response rates, defined as a reduction of at least 50% from the baseline MADRS-S score at week 8, and perceived remission rates, defined using the cut-off value revealed in the ROC analysis, were also compared using a logistic model with the same explanatory factors and covariate as those used in the ANCOVA model described above.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Sample characteristics</title><p>Among the 280 patients, two (0.7%) refused to fill in the MADRS-S questionnaire and were excluded from the analyses.

We demonstrated the validity, acceptability, reliability and sensitivity to change of the MADRS-S.</p><p>The lack of missing values illustrates good patient acceptance of the questionnaire, and indicates that it seems feasible to ask patients to rate their perception of nine symptoms of depression. Ceiling effects for six items were higher than floor effects, reflecting the initial severity level of the disease, as patients were only included in the study if they had a physician-reported MADRS score of at least 30. Results of the factor analysis supported the unique underlying concept assessed by the nine items. The reliability of the MADRS-S was satisfactory, with a test-retest intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.78 and a Cronbach's alpha of 0.84. Most importantly, the effect size of 2.8 in a sub-sample of improved patients after eight weeks of antidepressant treatment confirmed the ability of the scale to be sensitive to change, as is the original MADRS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. These results clearly showed the ability of the patient-reported MADRS-S to detect differences between treatment regimens.</p><p>However, the association between physician and patient-reported scores was lower in our study (0.54) compared with those reported by Svanborg and &#x000c5;sberg (0.70) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], and by Mundt <italic>et al </italic>(0.82) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. By comparison, Carroll <italic>et al </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] reported an association between the HDRS and the CRSD of 0.71. The more similar the scale, the higher the level of correlation found for assessment procedures (Mundt and colleagues compared the traditional clinician-rated MADRS with a telephone-based, interactive voice response technology); paper-and-pencil <italic>vs</italic>. interview-based ratings are known to only moderately correlate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] and scales with slightly differing content and wording can be expected to show slightly lower correlations.</p><p>Patients were asked to fill the MADRS-S before any clinical assessments in order to provide the most accurate perception they have on their disease. It is noteworthy that response and remission rates based on the MADRS-S are always lower than those from the clinician-based MADRS, indicating that patients' and clinicians' perceptions of the disease are different, more complementary than redundant, and can provide additional useful information. This is of major interest for MDD management since taking into account patients' feelings may improve medication compliance, decrease time to symptom alleviation, and, as a result, improve patients' quality of life.</p><p>The growing focus on patient-reported outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] as a secondary endpoint in randomised clinical trials and the findings of our study lead us to recommend the concomitant use of the MADRS and MADRS-S during the development of new compounds.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>NM was head investigator and responsible for the design of the multicentre, double-blind, 8-week, randomised controlled trial of 278 outpatients from which data from the current study was provided.
