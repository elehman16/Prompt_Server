However, the properties of probiotics are strain-dependent. We performed an individual patient data meta-analysis to assess the effectiveness of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> CNCM I-3856 on the management of IBS symptoms.</p><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorder with high prevalence, affecting up to 20% of the population in some geographical areas[<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Diverse GI symptoms occur in IBS, mainly abdominal pain, bloating and altered bowel habits. Subjects also report some extra-GI symptoms and an impaired quality of life[<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. According to Rome III criteria, IBS diagnosis is based on the presence of abdominal pain and/or discomfort, associated with at least two of the following: improvement with defecation, onset associated with a change in frequency of stool, onset associated with a change in form of stool[<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The diagnosis is confirmed by the absence of any organic disorder. Some IBS subtypes are distinguished depending on the predominant stool pattern: constipation-predominant IBS (IBS-C), diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D), mixed IBS (IBS-M) alternating constipation and diarrhea, and an un-subtyped IBS. To date, the pathogenesis of IBS is still not clear. Different mechanisms may be implicated, such as altered GI motility, visceral hypersensitivity, intestinal barrier disorder, dysfunction of the brain-gut axis, intestinal inflammation and disruption of the intestinal flora[<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. When investigating IBS, the gut microbiota is of great interest. First, some IBS cases begin after an acute episode of a GI infection, which can alter the gut microbiota&#x02019;s diversity[<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Secondly, the intestinal microbiota is thought to be involved in most of the mechanisms of IBS[<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Due to a lack of satisfactory pharmacological treatments suitable for long-term administration[<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], both patients and caregivers turn to alternative methods for the management of IBS. In such an approach, probiotics prove to be an interesting and promising option. Their supplementation may help to counterbalance mechanisms involved in IBS[<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and to alleviate associated symptoms. Today the challenge is to identify which probiotic strains are relevant for IBS management and the conditions for their use (preparations, doses, duration).</p><p><italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (<italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>) CNCM I-3856, a proprietary yeast strain from Lesaffre, has been studied for its beneficial properties in alleviating GI symptoms in IBS subjects. Two randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have been conducted and published[<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] involving a total of 579 IBS subjects. We decided to perform an individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis to confirm the previous findings and strengthen conclusions on this particular yeast strain.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Design and study selection</title><p>Methods for statistical analyses were pre-specified in a Statistical Analysis Plan. We evaluated manuscripts that studied the effect of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> CNCM I-3856 supplementation on GI symptoms in IBS subjects. Only the two aforementioned clinical trials were identified and included in this meta-analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Study product</title><p>The I-3856 strain of <italic>Sacharomyces cerevisiae</italic> is a proprietary, well-characterized strain of Lesaffre, registered in the French National Collection of Cultures of Microorganisms (CNCM). The <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> species has been characterized by using phenotypic (API<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> ID32C, Biomerieux SAS) and genotypic referenced methods (genetic amplification and sequencing of 26S DNA)[<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Moreover, the strain I-3856 is identified thanks to the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) Interdelta typing technique[<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], and other genetic methods (<italic>e.g</italic>., complete genome sequencing).</p></sec><sec><title>Data collection</title><p>All data were provided by the sponsor of the trials. Uniform collection methods were employed in the two trials.</p></sec><sec><title>Definition of outcomes</title><p>Outcomes were defined as the daily Likert scale scores of abdominal pain/discomfort and bloating (calculated on a weekly basis) over the common study period of both studies (8 wk) and also expressed as total Area Under the Curve (AUC) [total AUC (W0-W8) and total AUC (W5-W8)]. According to the abdominal score at baseline, responder status was considered. A subject was defined as responder if he/she experienced a decrease of 1 arbitrary unit (a.u.) or 50% of the abdominal discomfort score from baseline for at least 2 wk out of the last 4 wk of the study. Bowel movements, <italic>i.e</italic>., stool frequency and consistency, were also studied.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analyses were conducted, in first instance, on the Intent to Treat (ITT) population. Two subpopulations of interest where then derived from this population: IBS-C subjects (IBS subjects with hard or lumpy stools &#x02265; 25% and loose (mushy) or watery stools &#x0003c; 25% of bowel movements[<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]) and IBS-C subjects with an abdominal pain/discomfort score higher than or equal to 2 at baseline (referred as &#x0201c;IBS-C &#x02265; 2 subpopulation&#x0201d; in this paper). In both RCTs of this meta-analysis, subjects were included if they reported a score of abdominal pain/discomfort ranging between 1 and 6 (on a 7-point Likert scale) at baseline. Nevertheless, only subjects presenting a score &#x02265; 2 and &#x0003c; 6 at baseline have been considered in the IBS-C &#x02265; 2 subpopulation. IBS typology can vary a lot from one individual to another, inducing great variability in symptoms scores intensity. The supplementation with <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> CNCM I-3856 aims to be administered to healthy subjects with a medium level of abdominal pain/discomfort. IBS patients who need a follow-up at hospital because of high-level of pain (&#x02265; 6) are out of the scope of the present supplementation. Inversely, subjects with low level of symptoms intensity (strictly below 2) can&#x02019;t be considered as being improvable. In the ITT population, outcomes throughout the study period were analyzed using a fixed-effect repeated measure model including the factors Product, Week, IBS Type, Study and interactions Product*Week, Product*Study and Product*Week*Study[<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. An Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA), including factors Product, IBS Type, Study, Product*Study and the baseline value as a covariate, was conducted to analyze total AUCs. Finally, a Generalized Linear Model (GLM, binomial distribution) including factors Product, Study, IBS Type and interaction Product*Study was conducted to assess the responder status. In the subpopulations, the same statistical models, without the IBS Type effect, were run. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> software version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, United States).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>RESULTS</title><p>The two clinical trials were published in 2015 and 2016 in two different peer-reviewed journals.

Probiotic products should contain the adequate amount of living cells to be efficient. Then, it is needed to maintain a suitable level of viable cells during the product&#x02019;s shelf life. This living yeast cells count is expressed most of time as a minimum of colony forming unit per gram. This count of the yeast strain CNCM I-3856 cells after manufacturing was around 8 &#x000d7; 10<sup>9</sup> CFU/g. It could slightly vary within the specification limits at release depending on the batch even if the manufacturing process and the microbiological methods are validated. This variation is due to the type of products (microbiological products obtained by fermentation) and due to the method variability of viable cell counts (&#x000b1; 0.5 log). Moreover, it has to be considered that viable cell count slightly decreases with time (sensitivity to humidity and temperature), which has already been confirmed by a stability test program performed according international conference on harmonisation guidelines. That is why, an overdose is commonly adopted for probiotics. Based on these considerations, efficacy of probiotics is considered by the scientific community as similar when dosage remains within the same log.

No significant benefits of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> CNCM I-3856 supplementation were observed during the first month of supplementation compared to placebo. This point has been previously reported by Pineton de Chambrun et al[<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] who mentioned a potential delay of action of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. The yeast may positively impact abdominal pain/discomfort due to an analgesic effect, with a delay before significant effectiveness as reported in animal studies[<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In rats, some significant product effects were noted over the second month of study but the analgesic effect was transitory and limited to the time of product administration.</p><p>From a clinical point of view, AUC data provide relevant information in regard to overall subjective feelings. First, the AUC presents an overview of GI symptom intensity during the study period. This provides an indication of symptom alleviation over the supplementation period. The present analysis hardly succeeded in demonstrating a beneficial effect of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> CNCM I-3856 on the global AUC [AUC (W0-W8)] for abdominal pain/discomfort and bloating. Statistically positive effects were reported in the IBS-C &#x02265; 2 subpopulation, but not in the ITT population and IBS-C subpopulation. An AUC was also calculated over the second month of supplementation. This period was chosen in order to account for the aforementioned delay for significant action of the probiotic. Analysis on this specific period [AUC (W5-W8)] confirmed the product effect associated with yeast supplementation, in comparison to placebo, in all analyzed populations. Additionally, every statistically significant difference or trend was related to an improvement in the Active group from 9.2% and up to 14.9% compared to Placebo. This observation is of great interest from a clinical point of view: the 10% difference is considered as a minimal clinically relevant threshold[<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. This means that <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> CNCM I-3856 improves IBS symptoms in a significant and relevant manner in IBS patients, in a global IBS population and in the IBS-C subtype during the second month of consumption. Another approach in validating the clinical benefits of therapy consists of analyzing the percentage of patients who positively respond to the treatment. Various definitions of responder status are suggested by the literature[<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In addition, food and drug authorities have since established some complete definitions for responder status[<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Two different definitions of responder status were applied in the two RCTs[<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. They were re-used in the present meta-analysis for consistency. Conclusions on responder status were limited to the ITT population who experienced an improvement of 1 a.u. of abdominal pain/discomfort for at least 50% of the second month of supplementation.</p><p>One point limiting the positive conclusions on <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> CNCM I-3856 relates to the placebo response commonly reported in GI disorders. A meta-analysis of placebo-controlled RCTs conducted in IBS patients reported a mean placebo response rate of 37.5%[<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. This is consistent with previous meta-analysis from Patel et al[<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] who observed that 40.2% of patients respond to placebo. The placebo effect is one factor influencing the placebo response rate, but it does not affect it alone. The authors of this meta-analysis tried to determine the confounding factors which may influence the placebo response rate (duration of therapy, run-in phase, single or multi-centre study, <italic>etc</italic>.); but, inconsistent data were reported[<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>Today, probiotics are an alternative approach being extensively researched for the management of symptoms in IBS patients. While the effects of probiotics on IBS physiopathology are still under scrutiny[<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], many clinical trials investigating the benefits of one or more bacterial strains in IBS have been published. Increased resources are now available to examine probiotic benefits in IBS management. It remains difficult to clearly conclude efficacy and set up recommendations for probiotics supplementation because of the poor repeatability of the data and the difficulty in comparing studies. Indeed, great heterogeneity is observed between trials in terms of variety of strains used, probiotic dosage, treatment duration, outcome definitions, and statistical analyses. This point is highlighted in literature reviews and meta-analyses[<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>-<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In the absence of comparable studies, meta-analyses are performed to integrate qualitative clinical trials irrespective of the probiotic strains studied[<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>-<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. All authors globally agree as to the benefits of probiotics supplementation in IBS patients. Neither individual probiotic nor combination of strains was, however, identified as effective by itself and conclusions were drawn for probiotics in general. Some authors directed their meta-analyses specifically to <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> strains[<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] or to <italic>Lactobacillus rhamnosus</italic> GG in children[<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Only a few trials were included in these meta-analyses (six trials investigating <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> strains and three trials investigating <italic>Lactobacillus rhamnosus</italic> GG in children), but their conclusions can be considered relevant in light of the studies selected. Both authors concluded on beneficial effect of <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> spp on IBS symptoms, namely on frequency and intensity of abdominal pain. However, no recommendations for dose and treatment duration were proposed.</p><p>In regards to these meta-analyses, the present IPD meta-analysis demonstrates two advantages. First, the two RCTs were designed to evaluate the same probiotic strain, <italic>i.e., S. cerevisiae</italic> CNCM I-3856, and the methodologies were very similar. Study designs were double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled to achieve high quality studies, and recommendations for treatment trial design were applied[<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. These points strengthen the integration of data and their analyses as a whole. Second, individual data on all subjects were compiled to perform new statistical analyses, which provide a more robust result than meta-analyses based on aggregate data. The pooling of the two original individual trials[<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] for meta-analysis increased the sample size and thus the power of the statistical analyses, in particular in the context of the analysis in the IBS-C subpopulation. In addition, this meta-analysis allowed answering and confirming questions not initially raised by both studies and consolidated previous results reported on <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> CNCM I-3856.</p><p>In conclusion, this IPD meta-analysis confirms previous data linking <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> CNCM I-3856 supplementation and improvement of GI symptoms in IBS overall population and in the IBS-C and IBS-C &#x02265; 2 subpopulations. Despite great similarities in study designs, the two RCTs considered in the meta-analysis differ in terms of endpoints. The present observations would gain in being validated by a new RCT designed according to these meta-analysis conclusions.</p></sec><sec><title>COMMENTS</title><sec><title>Background</title><p>Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorder with high prevalence.
