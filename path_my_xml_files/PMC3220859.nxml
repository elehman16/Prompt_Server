It is reasonable to translate this information to the clinical situation of the subcutaneous injected long-acting insulin, but no study so far has examined the question directly.</p><p>We recently reported that GIR area under the curve (AUC)<sub>0&#x02013;32 h</sub> (a measure of insulin effect on glucose metabolism after subcutaneous injection of long-acting insulins) is greater with glargine than with NPH and detemir (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). However, in that study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>), the factor(s) responsible for GIR variations between T2DM subjects and between the three basal insulins were not assessed.</p><p>The results of the present analysis indicate that BMI is a factor that may well predict the PD of basal insulins NPH, detemir, and glargine, as indicated by the inverse correlation between BMI and PD (GIR AUC<sub>0&#x02013;32 h</sub>). In addition, the results indicate that the PD of the three basal insulins is differentially affected by BMI (i.e., at increasing BMI, the PD was lower for detemir than for NPH and glargine). Likewise, EGP, the well-known primary determinant of fasting blood glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>), was more suppressed by glargine and NPH compared with detemir in people with greater BMI. Although all three basal insulins showed a lower suppression of EGP for increasing BMI, the correlations were significant only for NPH and detemir, suggesting that glargine has a greater effect in restraining EGP at increasing adiposity. The reasons for the lower effect of detemir at higher BMI are unclear. We acknowledge that these conclusions have limitations because of the small sample size of the study; nevertheless, the results might explain findings of recent clinical studies.</p><p>A previous crossover study, longer than 2 months, reported higher dose requirements of the long-acting insulin analogs compared with NPH insulin, in a group (<italic>n</italic> = 20) of T2DM subjects with BMI &#x0003e;30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Results of studies examining larger groups of T2DM subjects for &#x02265;6 months indicated that higher detemir insulin doses are required versus NPH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>) and glargine for similar efficacy on glycemic control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). However, none of those studies ascertained the impact of BMI on insulin dose requirements. A recent post hoc analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>) of a study comparing insulin glargine (once a day) and detemir (twice a day) in T2DM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>) titrated to reach similar glycemic control has shown that the higher dose of insulin detemir needed was directly correlated with BMI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, BMI largely explains the PD effect of insulins NPH, detemir, and glargine in T2DM subjects previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). In fact, as BMI increases, the effect of detemir is lower versus NPH and glargine (lower GIR and greater EGP). The current study suggests that it is obesity that primarily drives the larger detemir versus NPH and glargine doses needed in T2DM.</p></sec>
