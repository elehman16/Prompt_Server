However, what is not known is the best way to improve uptake of guidelines into practice. Previous studies have demonstrated that implementation interventions, that is, interventions designed to improve the uptake of evidence into practice, are effective some of the time. However we have little information to guide the choice of intervention to promote the uptake of guidelines for any given implementation problem <xref rid="pone.0065471-Grimshaw1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Previous evaluations of implementation interventions have been criticised for not providing enough detail on the rationale for the developed intervention, including the hypothesised change processes that the intervention is targeting, or other relevant contextual factors <xref rid="pone.0065471-French1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.</p><p>Low back pain (LBP) is a common and costly condition. Estimates of the lifetime prevalence of LBP range from 6% to 66% (median 39%) <xref rid="pone.0065471-Hoy1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. At any one time, one in every four Australians have LBP, and four out of five Australians will experience it at some time in their lives <xref rid="pone.0065471-Walker1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Similar rates of LBP are reported in other high income countries around the world <xref rid="pone.0065471-Foster1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. LBP carries a substantial financial burden, with the direct and indirect cost of LBP in Australia in 2001 estimated to be AUD$9,175 million <xref rid="pone.0065471-Walker2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p><p>Many people with LBP seek care from a general medical practitioner (GP). Two Australian national surveys of people with LBP have shown that of the 45% of people with acute LBP who sought care from a healthcare provider, they most commonly sought care from a GP (between 22% and 30% of those who sought care) <xref rid="pone.0065471-Walker3" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065471-Wilk1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. LBP is the second most common symptom, after a cough, for a visit to an Australian GP <xref rid="pone.0065471-Britt1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p><p>Management of LBP in general practice in Australia is not always concordant with recommended evidence-based practice <xref rid="pone.0065471-Williams1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065471-Runciman1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Plain film x-rays, and other imaging, for acute non-specific LBP are of limited diagnostic value, expose people to unnecessary ionising radiation, and provide no benefits in physical function, pain, or disability <xref rid="pone.0065471-Australian1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065471-Chou1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. However, plain film x-rays remain over utilised in the management of acute LBP in primary care settings <xref rid="pone.0065471-Good1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065471-Somerville1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. In Australia, over one quarter of patients with acute LBP receive an x-ray <xref rid="pone.0065471-Williams1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065471-McGuirk1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> and over-utilisation of plain film x-rays has also been reported in the United States and Europe <xref rid="pone.0065471-Chou1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065471-Carey1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0065471-Kovacs1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Giving advice to stay active to people with acute LBP is supported by high level evidence and results in small benefits to patient outcomes <xref rid="pone.0065471-Dahm1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, but it is underused by Australian GPs <xref rid="pone.0065471-Williams1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p><p>In 2003, the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) endorsed an evidence-based guideline for the management of acute musculoskeletal pain <xref rid="pone.0065471-Australian1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. The guideline was distributed by post to every Australian registered primary healthcare practitioner, and was available electronically on the NHMRC website. The aim of the guideline was to inform primary care practitioners of the evidence-based management of acute musculoskeletal pain, including non-specific LBP. We chose two key guideline recommendations (specifying recommended clinical behaviours, hereafter referred to as target behaviours) to address in this trial that were underpinned by high level evidence; one target behaviour related to diagnosis, that plain film x-rays were necessary only if fracture is suspected, and one related to treatment, that of providing advice to stay active, including the avoidance of advising more than two days of bed rest.</p><p>There have been a number of randomised trials evaluating interventions that aimed to improve the management of acute LBP in primary care settings <xref rid="pone.0065471-Robling1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0065471-Evans1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. These trials evaluated complex interventions of various combinations including educational outreach, educational workshops, and distribution of educational materials. The trials had varying success in changing certain practitioner behaviours and provide some information about methods of reducing x-ray referral for acute LBP in particular. However, these studies do not provide information about successful change of the behaviour of giving advice to stay active. For the implementation interventions evaluated in these studies, no explicit rationale was reported for the intervention chosen, and none reported the use of behavioural theory to design their intervention. More research is required to build on these studies in light of recent developments in implementation research. For example, current guidance recommends that interventions designed to increase the uptake of guidelines into clinical practice should address barriers and drivers of practice change <xref rid="pone.0065471-Michie1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Also, it is recommended that explicit theory is used to understand barriers, design interventions, and explore mediating pathways and moderators to advance the science of implementation research <xref rid="pone.0065471-Davies1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>.</p><p>This study aimed to test the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a theory-informed intervention for implementing two behaviours recommended in a clinical practice guideline for acute LBP in general medical practice in Victoria, Australia. In this study we were unable to recruit sufficient patients to measure our original primary outcomes so we introduced other outcomes measured at the general practitioner (GP) level. A discussion of the difficulties we encountered in recruiting patient participants is published elsewhere <xref rid="pone.0065471-Page1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. This current paper reports an overview of the methods of this study, a description of the changes made to the planned outcome measures, and the effectiveness results. The full cost effectiveness results will be reported elsewhere.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>The trial protocol for IMPLEMENT (IMPLEmenting a clinical practice guideline for acute low back pain evidence-based manageMENT) is published elsewhere <xref rid="pone.0065471-McKenzie1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref> and available as supporting information (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0065471.s003">Protocol S1</xref>).

The reasons for using this trial design were discussed in detail in the protocol <xref rid="pone.0065471-McKenzie1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Recruitment of Practices and Patients</title><p>Recruitment of general practices occurred between October 2006 and May 2007. We approached all general medical practices in Victoria, Australia, via mail. GPs at these practices received a postcard with a short description of the study, followed by an invitation letter. A random selection of GPs was also contacted by telephone, with the number contacted in this way limited by available resources. To raise awareness of the study we placed notices about the study in relevant professional newsletters. When one GP in a practice agreed to participate and the practice was included, we then sent follow-up letters to the other GPs in the same practice informing them that the practice was included, encouraging them to participate, and allowing them to object to the practice participating if they wished. Included GPs were offered continuing professional development credits, or continuing medical education points, and access to LBP experts.</p><p>Patient participant recruitment commenced in November 2007 and ceased in June 2008. A full description of our attempted patient participant recruitment methods is published elsewhere <xref rid="pone.0065471-Page1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. Patient participant inclusion criteria were people presenting with acute (less than three months duration) non-specific LBP and aged 18 years or older. Exclusion criteria were described in the protocol <xref rid="pone.0065471-McKenzie1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. We were unable to recruit a sufficient number of patient participants to measure the patient outcomes described in the protocol <xref rid="pone.0065471-McKenzie1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Randomisation and Allocation Concealment</title><p>General practices were randomly allocated to either the intervention group or control group. A statistician independent of the study implemented the randomisation at a single point in time, and was only provided with general practice identification codes and stratification variables. Four stratification variables were defined by the number of GPs per practice (two levels: one to three GPs; four or more GPs) and whether the practice was in a rural or metropolitan location, defined as per Australian government geographical classification <xref rid="pone.0065471-Australian2" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. Within stratum, practices were allocated to the intervention and control groups with equal probability (1&#x02236;1 randomisation ratio) using computer-generated random numbers. Allocation was concealed from the investigators until baseline data had been collected from GPs.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Blinding</title><p>Investigators (not involved in the delivery of the intervention), researcher assistants who entered the data and the statistician were blinded to group allocation until the statistical analysis was completed. Due to the nature of the intervention, it was not possible to blind the GPs to group allocation.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Interventions</title><p>The control group received access to the guideline as per the guideline&#x02019;s existing dissemination strategy, a printed copy of the guideline and a written reminder of how to access the electronic version of the guideline. Control group materials were sent to GPs in August 2007.</p><p>The process for developing the theory-informed intervention and a detailed description of the content of the intervention are published elsewhere <xref rid="pone.0065471-French1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Briefly, to develop the IMPLEMENT intervention, we used the Theoretical Domains Framework <xref rid="pone.0065471-Michie2" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0065471-Francis1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref> of behaviour change to identify the barriers and enablers to the target behaviours and guide the choice of intervention components. Barriers to, and enablers of, the two target behaviours were identified in a qualitative study consisting of focus group interviews with 42 GPs in Victoria, Australia <xref rid="pone.0065471-Green1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. We then selected behaviour change techniques, to overcome these barriers and enhance the enablers, using a mapping tool designed for this purpose <xref rid="pone.0065471-Michie1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. The selected behaviour change techniques included information provision, persuasive communication, provide information on consequences, provide opportunities for social comparison, barrier identification, model/demonstrate the behaviour, role play, provide instruction, time management and action planning. These techniques were combined to form a cohesive intervention delivered via two facilitated, interactive, educational workshops, each of three hours&#x02019; duration.</p><p>Workshops were a combination of didactic lectures and small group discussions and activities. We also produced a DVD to distribute to all GPs in the intervention group with the primary purpose of providing the material to those who could not attend the workshops. This alternative mode of delivering the same intervention content and messages included film footage from the workshops and electronic resources related to acute LBP management. The workshops were held between June and September 2007. The workshop content was evaluated by the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, and the Australian College of Rural and Remote Medicine, and both organisations allocated continuing professional development points for GPs who attended both the workshops.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Outcomes</title><p>The outcomes we measured in the trial deviated from those reported in the protocol because we were unable to recruit adequate numbers of patients to measure patient outcomes.

Specific item content was informed by focus group interviews with 42 GPs conducted as part of this study <xref rid="pone.0065471-Green1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. The interviews used standard elicitation methods and covered GP views and experiences about the two target behaviours. Responses were used to design items measuring the theoretical constructs considered relevant to behaviour (drawn from the Theoretical Domains Framework and the Theory of Planned Behaviour) <xref rid="pone.0065471-Michie2" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065471-Ajzen1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065471-Francis2" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>.The constructs included: behavioural intention (whether the GP intends to engage in the behaviour), attitude (whether the GP is in favour of performing the behaviour), subjective norm (how much the GP feels social pressure to engage in the behaviour), perceived behavioural control (whether the GP feels in control of the behaviour), beliefs about capabilities (whether the GP is confident in performing the behaviour), beliefs about professional role (whether the GP feels it is their professional responsibility to perform the behaviour), knowledge (whether the GP has knowledge about the behaviour), memory (whether the GP remembers to perform the behaviour) and environmental context (whether the GP feels the environmental context supports performance of the behaviour).</p><p>The questionnaire we developed to measure behavioural constructs contained 51 items and produced summary scores for the various behavioural constructs for each target clinical behaviour (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0065471.s004">Questionnaire S1</xref>). There were 24 items related to providing advice to stay active; 22 of these were scored using a 7-point Likert scale, one item required a yes/no response and one item was multiple choice (later collapsed to a dichotomous scale).</p><p>There were 27 items relating to x-ray referral; 25 of these were scored using a 7-point Likert scale, one item recorded a yes/no response and one item was multiple choice collapsed to a dichotomous scale (adherent with guideline recommendation or not). Higher scores reflected greater intention to perform the target behaviour, more favourable attitudes toward the behaviour, greater social pressure to perform the behaviour, a greater level of perceived control over the behaviour, stronger belief in own capabilities of performing the behaviour, stronger belief that performance of behaviour is part of one&#x02019;s professional role, greater knowledge about the behaviour, better memory for performing behaviour, and stronger belief that the environmental context supports performance of the behaviour. Different constructs were measured using between one and six items.</p><p>The psychometric properties (construct validity, test-retest reliability and predictive validity) of the behavioural constructs questionnaire were investigated in a separate sample of 528 Australian GPs prior to the trial (Unpublished data: O&#x02019;Connor D, Monash University, Australia). Confirmatory factor analysis was conducted using LISREL v 8.7 to examine the construct validity of the tool. Test-retest reliability was investigated by calculating intra-class coefficients for the behavioural constructs for 98 GPs completing the survey on two occasions, separated by a two-week interval. Predictive validity was examined by interviewing a random subset of 100 GPs by phone one month after survey completion to record their behaviour and multiple regression analyses examined whether the behavioural constructs predicted behaviour. Factor analysis confirmed the hypothesised factor structure with all but one item demonstrating high factor loadings (&#x0003e;0.6) to the constructs which they intended to measure. Fit indices were high indicating good fit of the data to the model. Intra-class correlation coefficient values for the behavioural constructs ranged from 0.56 to 0.72 indicating moderate-to-good test-retest reliability. Multiple regression analyses demonstrated that the constructs <italic>Attitudes</italic>, <italic>Subjective norms</italic> and <italic>Perceived behavioural control</italic> were predictive of intention for both behaviours. The model explained 68% of the variance for intention to manage without referral for x-ray when the direct measures were used in the model (R2 adj&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.68, F(3, 518)&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;366.18, p&#x0003c;0.001) and explained 74% of the variance when indirect measures were added to the model in step 2 (R2 adj&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.74, F change&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;37.63, p&#x0003c;0.001). The model explained 52% of the variance for intention to advise patients to stay active when the direct measures were used (R2 adj&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.52, F(3, 518)&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;190.03, p&#x0003c;0.001) and explained 60% of the variance when indirect measures were added in step 2 (R2 adj&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.60, F change&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;33.09, p&#x0003c;0.001). Intention was predictive of the behaviour managing patients without an x-ray and univariate analysis showed that for every 1 unit increase in intention, the odds of managing patients without x-ray would increase by 40% of what they were. We were unable to examine the predictive validity of the intention-behaviour relationship for advice to stay active because all GPs interviewed after one month of completing the survey said they gave this advice to their patients.</p><p>GPs&#x02019; fear avoidance beliefs about LBP were measured via a modified version of the Fear-Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire (FAB-Q) physical activity subscale <xref rid="pone.0065471-Waddell1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref> adapted for the GP participants <xref rid="pone.0065471-Coudeyre1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. The original questionnaire was designed for use with people with LBP, and we modified the items so that it can apply to practitioners, for example &#x0201c;Physical activity makes my pain worse&#x0201d; was modified to &#x0201c;Physical activity makes acute non-specific low-back pain worse&#x0201d;. The reliability and validity of these modifications was not evaluated. GPs&#x02019; fear-avoidance beliefs were included as an outcome because there have been some studies suggesting that practitioners&#x02019; fear-avoidance beliefs influence their treatment recommendations such that they are less likely to adhere to the guideline recommendations regarding giving advice to stay active <xref rid="pone.0065471-Rainville1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. The instrument consisted of four items, each measured on a 7-point Likert scale (0&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;completely disagree, 6&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;completely agree). Scores from these items were summed providing a score ranging from 0 to 24, with higher values representing greater fear-avoidance beliefs.</p></sec><sec id="s2g2"><title>Behavioural simulation outcomes (clinical decision in response to vignettes)</title><p>Our behavioural simulation measures were also included in the questionnaire distributed to GPs 12 months post intervention/control delivery (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0065471.s004">Questionnaire S1</xref>).

The patient vignettes were piloted with five practising GPs who were not part of the study.</p><p>For the behavioural simulation outcomes, adherence was determined regarding imaging and advice to stay active. X-ray adherence was defined as the GP not referring for a lumbosacral plain x-ray. Imaging adherence was defined as the GP not referring for any of following three diagnostic tests: lumbosacral plain x-ray, lumbar CT scan and lumbar magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Activity adherence was defined as &#x0201c;Advise the patient to continue with their normal daily activities&#x0201d; regardless of other interventions selected (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0065471.s004">Questionnaire S1</xref> for other options available).

Medicare is Australia's publicly funded universal healthcare system that provides free or subsidised care by health professionals such as GPs, including x-rays and other imaging. The large majority (approximately 95%) of patients who consult an Australian GP would have their imaging costs covered by Medicare <xref rid="pone.0065471-Britt1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. The exceptions are injured workers and people who have sustained an injury as a result of an automobile accident, who are funded under different compensation systems. For each consenting GP, we obtained the total number of Medicare-funded patients who consulted the GP, and the number of low back-related imaging (x-ray and CT) referrals made by the GP in the period 12 months post intervention delivery. It was not possible to obtain data that was specifically linked to patients that presented with acute non-specific LBP. These data were likely to have included GP patients with chronic LBP and those where an x-ray may have been appropriate, e.g. a fracture was suspected.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Sample Size</title><p>The original sample size calculations were based on measuring process (x-ray referral) and health (LBP-specific disability) outcomes on a cohort of patient participants recruited through the participating general practices. We determined that recruiting an average of 25 patient participants from each of the 92 general practices, providing a total of 2,300 patient participants, would be sufficient to detect important differences between groups in these outcomes with at least 90% power. Important differences were determined to be an absolute risk reduction of 10% in the percentage of patients referred for x-ray, assuming an x-ray referral rate of 20% in the control group, and a difference of at least two points in the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire, assuming a standard deviation of 6.0 (full details available in protocol <xref rid="pone.0065471-McKenzie1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0065471.s003">Protocol S1</xref>).

An exchangeable correlation structure was specified, where responses from the same practice were assumed to be equally correlated. However, when the estimated intra-cluster correlation coefficient (ICC) from the model was negative, the model was refitted with an independent correlation structure, that is, assuming an ICC of zero. This approach yields conservative estimates of standard errors and follows the recommendations and practice of others in assuming that in this context, the likely explanation for a negative ICC is sampling variability, not a true underlying negative ICC (e.g. <xref rid="pone.0065471-Eldridge1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0065471-Ukoumunne1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>).

However, updated CONSORT guidance recommends that both a measure of absolute and relative effect should be provided <xref rid="pone.0065471-Schulz1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>.

For behavioural construct outcomes (<italic>Behavioural intention, Attitude, Subjective norm, Perceived behavioural control, Beliefs about professional role</italic> and <italic>Beliefs about capabilities</italic>) there was greater agreement or likelihood in the GPs&#x02019; intentions and beliefs in performing the clinical behaviour not referring for plain x-ray in line with the guideline recommendations, but the point estimates were typically small. For the clinical behaviour advising patients to stay active, there were no statistically significant differences between the groups for the behavioural construct outcomes. For behavioural simulation, the intervention improved GPs&#x02019; intended adherence to an evidence-based guideline as measured by patient vignettes at 12 months post-intervention. For lumbar imaging rates (administrative medical imaging data), there was no statistically significant difference in x-ray and CT referral rates between the groups. The potential importance of the intervention on lumbar imaging rates for those with acute non-specific LBP remains unclear since the administrative data was not specific to patients with this condition.</p><p>While these results suggest that the evaluated intervention holds some promise for improving guideline uptake, this intervention typically entails an upfront investment that may or may not be offset by any health gains and/or reductions in health service utilisation. The potential for improvements in clinical practice should therefore be weighed against the additional cost or cost-savings attributable to the intervention. Results from an economic evaluation alongside the IMPLEMENT trial, suggest that, after taking account of reductions in service use, the IMPLEMENT intervention may actually be less costly than standard dissemination. At the mean, the IMPLEMENT intervention dominated (less costly and more effective) standard dissemination for the outcomes of x-ray referral and intention to adhere to the guideline in behavioural simulation. Confidence intervals around point estimates of incremental cost-effectiveness for the outcome of x-ray referral suggest that we cannot be at least 95% confident that the IMPLEMENT intervention differs in value from standard dissemination. Confidence intervals around point estimates of cost-effectiveness for the outcome of intention to adhere to the guideline in behavioural simulation suggest that, given a sufficiently high willingness to pay, we can be at least 95% confident that the IMPLEMENT intervention represents good value in comparison to standard dissemination. Full results from the economic evaluation alongside the IMPLEMENT trial and a discussion of the limitations of the economic analysis will be reported elsewhere.</p><p>Estimated ICCs for the administrative imaging outcomes were very small. Several hypotheses may explain these results including the low prevalence of the outcomes <xref rid="pone.0065471-Ukoumunne1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065471-Campbell1" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref>, a large amount of variability in the outcomes arising through the inclusion of all patients (not only patients with acute LBP), or consistency of management of patients across GPs. For the behavioural simulation outcome data, which sought GPs&#x02019; intended clinical decisions in relation to only acute LBP patients, ICCs of x-ray and imaging adherence were larger, indicating some inconsistency in the intended management of patients across GPs (although the confidence intervals did not exclude an ICC of zero). Of particular note was the large ICC for advice to stay active, indicating a lack of consistency in GP intended practice for this clinical behaviour. This uncertainty may arise from the GP community being unclear about what is meant by providing advice to stay active. Discussions with GPs in the intervention workshops indicated that interpretations of advice to stay active were variable, ranging from advising patients to go for a swim or a walk, to giving patients specific low back exercises, to advising patients to return to their normal activities as soon as possible. This issue may be related to the predominance of GPs taking a biomedical (or structural) orientation to LBP, which in some studies has been linked to advising patients to restrict activity <xref rid="pone.0065471-Main1" ref-type="bibr">[67]</xref>. GPs appear to need further education and resources about this aspect of care, and changing clinical behaviour relating to giving advice to stay active for patients with acute LBP should be considered in GP workforce education and policy.</p><p>There was no statistically significant difference in the behavioural simulation outcome between the groups for recommending bed rest. The vast majority of GPs from both groups adhered to this guideline recommendation and assuming the GPs in this study are representative of the primary care population, it appears few GPs would recommend bed rest to this acute LBP patient population.</p><p>For other aspects of evidence-based recommendations for acute LBP, it is evident that there are problems remaining in primary care with ongoing discordance with clinical practice guidelines <xref rid="pone.0065471-Williams1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065471-Runciman1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Questions remain about the best way to approach this. As in clinical research, testing a small number of interventions to address a problem does not guarantee a clear and immediate solution to the problem. We agree with the view now frequently argued in the literature <xref rid="pone.0065471-Michie3" ref-type="bibr">[68]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065471-Grimshaw2" ref-type="bibr">[69]</xref> that it is important to build a cumulative science of implementation (which relies in large part on a cumulative science of behaviour change) and we trust that the trial we report in this paper makes a contribution to that science.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Comparison with Other Studies</title><p>This trial adds to the evidence-base in the implementation literature for LBP management in a number of ways. First, it shows that a theory-informed intervention, compared to simple guideline dissemination alone, can make small changes to GP intention to practise in a manner that is consistent with recommendations from an evidence-based guideline. Previous studies in this area have lacked strong rationale for intervention choice and have not assessed barriers and facilitators to uptake of evidence into practice prior to intervention development <xref rid="pone.0065471-French2" ref-type="bibr">[70]</xref>. Like our study, previous implementation studies aimed at primary care providers to reduce x-ray utilisation and increase activity advice for acute LBP patients have demonstrated generally small effects, whether the outcomes were measured as process level outcomes or as patient outcomes <xref rid="pone.0065471-Robling1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0065471-Becker1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065471-Evans1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065471-Ammendolia1" ref-type="bibr">[71]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065471-Slater1" ref-type="bibr">[72]</xref>.</p><p>This trial included an economic evaluation that has been absent in most previous trials in this area. Unfortunately our inability to recruit sufficient patients into the trial has limited the full cost-effectiveness evaluation, however we were able to determine the costs of developing a theoretically-informed intervention and relate this to potential costs saved in the reduction of plain film x-ray utilisation.</p><p>Whether using theory as a basis for behaviour change intervention design will lead to more effective interventions is not well understood. Some reviews have concluded that the use of theory is associated with larger intervention effects <xref rid="pone.0065471-Albada1" ref-type="bibr">[73]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0065471-Webb1" ref-type="bibr">[77]</xref>, while other reviews have concluded small, none or negative association between reported theory use in intervention design and intervention effectiveness <xref rid="pone.0065471-Albarracin1" ref-type="bibr">[78]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0065471-Baker1" ref-type="bibr">[80]</xref>. More research is required in this area, including studies to compare the use of different theories in developing interventions, or to compare the use of theory in developing interventions with other intervention development methods.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Strengths and Weaknesses of the Study</title><p>The main strength of this study was that this is, to the authors&#x02019; knowledge, the first theoretically-informed implementation intervention to be tested in a cluster randomised trial design for the management of acute LBP in the general medical practice setting. The intervention was developed in light of recent thinking amongst implementation scientists that interventions designed to improve the uptake of evidence into practice require a strong rationale and need to be theoretically informed <xref rid="pone.0065471-French1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.</p><p>The major limitation of the study was that we were unable to recruit patient participants, and were therefore not able to measure actual GP clinical behaviours, patient health outcomes, patient behaviours, and patient level measures of health service utilisation. Nor could we measure practitioners&#x02019; management of patients in a cohort of acute LBP patients. Failure to recruit patient participants was in spite of multiple changes to our recruitment strategy <xref rid="pone.0065471-Page1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. We surveyed participating GPs about patient recruitment, and despite intending to recruit patients, GPs forgot to approach patients to participate and GPs were ambivalent about whether patients were interested, or not, in participating. In a busy general practice clinic with GPs consulting only a few acute LBP patients every week their ability to approach patients for recruitment was clearly difficult. Future LBP implementation trials in general practice should consider other novel strategies to measure patient outcomes. This could include strategies to improve patient recruitment, for example regular electronic reminders in their clinic computer systems, telephone reminders from the research team, and meaningful incentives <xref rid="pone.0065471-BellSyer1" ref-type="bibr">[81]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065471-Treweek1" ref-type="bibr">[82]</xref>. Researchers should also consider, where possible, measuring outcomes that are routinely collected and may not require individual patient consent.</p><p>Given our failure to recruit patient participants, we introduced alternative outcomes to measure the effect of the intervention. These included: i) behavioural simulation where GPs were asked to decide whether or not they would refer for x-ray, refer for other imaging, provide advice to stay active, or provide advice regarding bed rest in response to a simulated clinical situation using patient vignettes; and ii) behaviour on referrals for plain x-ray and CT scans using administrative data. These outcomes have limitations.</p><p>Behavioural simulation measures, including the use of vignettes, have previously been demonstrated to be valid measures of clinical practice and have good concordance with standardised patients and medical record abstraction <xref rid="pone.0065471-Peabody1" ref-type="bibr">[83]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0065471-Luck1" ref-type="bibr">[84]</xref>. However, the strength of the association between behavioural simulation and clinical behaviour measures is uncertain <xref rid="pone.0065471-Hrisos1" ref-type="bibr">[85]</xref>. Further, like other self-report measures, the responses may be influenced by social desirability. Although we didn&#x02019;t conduct formal empirical testing of the vignettes, we carried out some assessment of content validity. As is recommended in developing measurement scales <xref rid="pone.0065471-Streiner1" ref-type="bibr">[86]</xref>, we piloted the vignettes with people in the same group who were to receive the vignettes in the trial, that is, practising GPs. Further, the results from the trial itself provide some information about construct validity, since we expected that intention, as measured via vignette responses, would differ between the intervention and control groups. Given this occurred, this provides us with some confidence that the vignette responses discriminate between groups. However, it is unclear whether the observed effects for these outcomes in our trial would impact on actual GP clinical behaviour or patient outcomes.</p><p>The clinical behaviour outcomes measured via the administrative data were aggregated across all Medicare-funded patients who consulted the GP in the period 12 months post intervention delivery. It was not possible from these data to separate the population of acute LBP patients and the imaging specific to this population, that is, the data included all patients and all low back-related imaging. This raises two important issues which lead to difficulties in interpreting the effects from this administrative data.</p><p>First, we cannot be sure that the observed intervention effects (including the estimates which fall within the confidence limits) are reflective of changes in practice for the population of interest. For example, it is possible that GPs may reduce imaging for those who present with chronic LBP, or those who present with fracture, but not those with acute non-specific LBP. Second, if we assume practice change did occur only in patients presenting with acute non-specific LBP, the measurement error from the inclusion of other populations (chronic LBP, fracture, and other conditions), is likely to have attenuated the observed effects toward a value of no effect.</p><p>Despite limitations regarding interpretation of the administrative data, these data do have some advantages. A strength of administrative data recorded on all patients is that selection bias issues, that often arise in cluster randomised trials through differential recruitment of patient participants by those who are aware of their allocation status, are minimised <xref rid="pone.0065471-Torgerson1" ref-type="bibr">[87]</xref>. Further, although not the focus of the intervention in this trial, routine imaging for chronic LBP is not recommended in international guidelines <xref rid="pone.0065471-Koes1" ref-type="bibr">[88]</xref>, so if a reduction of imaging in this population occurred then this would also be consistent with best practice. Finally, even though an x-ray is recommended when a GP suspects a fracture in a patient who presents with acute LBP, the prevalence of fracture in people presenting with acute LBP in Australian primary care is very low. In a cohort study conducted in Australia of 1,172 patients presenting to primary care with acute LBP, only eight fractures were detected (0.7%) <xref rid="pone.0065471-Henschke1" ref-type="bibr">[89]</xref>. Hence, we expect that the prevalence of fracture would be equally low in the patients represented in the administrative data we collected, and the influence of any x-rays that were ordered appropriately for this condition would be low. So overall, we have some confidence that a reduction of imaging in the intervention group GPs, measured by these data, indicates that the intervention would be effective.</p><p>There was some baseline imbalance in GP characteristics which may be associated with the outcome, and therefore modify the estimated intervention effects. A larger proportion of intervention group GPs indicated having undertaken LBP continuing education in the past year, while a larger proportion of control group GPs indicated having a special interest in LBP. An Australian study demonstrated that GPs who reported a special interest in LBP was associated with beliefs about management contrary to the best available evidence <xref rid="pone.0065471-Buchbinder2" ref-type="bibr">[90]</xref>. While all analyses adjusted for this latter pre-specified confounder, we did not adjust for LBP continuing education. Some post hoc sensitivity analyses on the administrative outcomes indicated that adjustment for LBP continuing education moved the effect estimates further from the null (results available on request). Therefore, the reported effect estimates for these outcomes, may provide a more conservative estimate of intervention effect.</p><p>Engaging healthcare clinicians to participate in research is difficult and challenging <xref rid="pone.0065471-Ellis1" ref-type="bibr">[91]</xref>. Of the general practices approached for participation, approximately 5% were recruited, and then only 61% of GPs in the intervention group were able to attend the intervention workshops. This limits the generalisability of our findings. A culture shift may be necessary in order for future implementation research to be feasible and for the results to be relevant to the broader healthcare community.</p><p>We attempted to maximise attendance at the workshops by offering an incentive to attend (continuing professional development points) and by holding the workshops on different days, times, and locations. The DVD only included the information provision (didactic) sections of the workshop and therefore the DVD did not achieve the aim of the intervention of delivering the full suite of behaviour change techniques, which required small group discussion and interaction with simulated patients. Also, considering the poor uptake of the DVD in the GPs unable to attend the workshop, our experience suggests that DVDs are not the answer for delivering this type of intervention. In future trials, other delivery modes could be considered including remote access to rurally-located GPs and online delivery, but keeping in mind the likely trade-off between achieving increased participation and the additional cost of doing so.</p><p>Practice change may require a suite of interventions with different clinicians taking up and responding to different interventions. However, this intervention was purposefully designed to be thorough and thereby required six hours of workshop attendance by the participating GPs in the intervention arm. If this thorough, theory-driven, intervention resulted in only small changes in GPs&#x02019; practice intention when compared to simple dissemination of the guideline, then it is difficult to anticipate less intense interventions being more successful.</p><p>There was some loss to follow-up for all outcome variables, which has the potential to result in some bias in the estimated intervention effects. Eleven and nine GPs were lost to follow-up in the intervention and control groups respectively (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0065471-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Of these, four GPs in each of the intervention groups provided reasons for dropping out which would seem to be unrelated to the outcomes (i.e. moving practice, family illness, poor health, and death). This leaves seven and five GPs from the intervention and control groups respectively, for whom there is the potential that their outcomes may differ compared with those who remained in the trial. However, given these GPs are relatively few in number, the potential impact of this loss to follow-up on the intervention effects may be minor. Due to missing confounder information, there was some further missing outcome data in the fitted models. Some post-hoc sensitivity analyses of the imaging referral outcomes, comparing intervention effects estimated from models with all available outcomes versus models with the reduced subset arising from missing confounders, yielded similar estimates of intervention effect (results available on request).</p><p>Only a small fraction of GPs invited to participate in the trial agreed to do so. We do not have information on characteristics of those who did not agree to participate, and so are unable to examine whether the participating GPs differed in factors that may modify the effect of the intervention.</p><p>Finally, some care is needed when interpreting the results because of the number of outcomes analysed. It is likely that some of the statistically significant results arise through chance.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Conclusion</title><p>An intervention based on a behaviour change theoretical framework, and evidence, compared to simple guideline dissemination alone, improved GP adherence to an evidence-based guideline measured by patient vignettes. No important change was demonstrated in most other behavioural constructs measured by questionnaire. The effect estimates for lumbar imaging were in the direction of a reduction in imaging rates in the intervention group, but the differences between groups were not statistically significant, and the potential importance of the effects was difficult to interpret. Overall, the intervention led to small changes in GP intention to practice in a manner that is consistent with an evidence-based guideline, but it did not result in statistically significant changes in actual behaviour measured via administrative data. More research is required to evaluate the effectiveness of theory-based interventions designed to improve the adherence to evidence-based guidelines for LBP management in primary care, examining actual GP behaviours in clinical practice.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0065471.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>
