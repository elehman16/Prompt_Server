The kshar was prepared on the basis of samhitas. Elements present in Kshar and Nirdah Rasa were analysed using Atomic Absorption Emission Spectrophotometry. During preparation, hourly pH reading showed highly alkaline solution having pH between 14 15. A placebo controlled comparative study conducted to evaluate efficacy using standardized Palash Kshar and Nirdaha Rasa in 30 patients.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Result:</title><p>Nirdaha Rasa was found to be more useful but the plant gets scarified because of the extraction method hence Nirdaha Rasa was obtained with tiryaak paatan yantra which yielded maximum quantity but had less mineral content. Nirdaha Rasa was for the first time prepared and standardized by the author. Numbers of experiments were performed to standardize the method of preparation of Kshar. The ideal method was found to be as per Shushrut. Atomic Absorption Emission Spectrophotometry was used to analyse prepared Kshar and Nirdaha Rasa, which showed the presence of elements like magnesium, sulphur, phosphorus, calcium, sodium, chlorine and some antioxidant and trace elements like zinc and selenium. A placebo controlled comparative study showed symptomatic relief and improvement in Stress test (n=5) and 2D echo cardiography (n=2) and reduction in LAD artery (n=2), partial recanalization of renal artery (n=1) and complete recanalization of carotid (n=2) circumflex (n=2) artery.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Conclusion:</title><p>It is postulated that potassium found in palash kshara plays an important role in breaking the etiopathogenesis of CAD and will be useful in recanalising coronary artery and prevent further myocardial infarction. A further analytical evaluation and statistically powered clinical study will be useful in confirming the current findings.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front></article>
