Previous trials have shown that IPTp with monthly SP benefits HIV-positive primi- and secundigravidae, but there is no conclusive evidence of the possible benefits of this regimen to HIV-negative women, or to a population comprising of both HIV-positive and &#x02013;negative women of different gravidities.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This study analyzed 484 samples collected at delivery as part of a randomized, partially placebo controlled clinical trial, conducted in rural Malawi between 2003 and 2007. The study included pregnant women regardless of their gravidity or HIV-infection status. The participants received SP twice (controls), monthly SP, or monthly SP and two doses of azithromycin (AZI-SP). The main outcome was the prevalence of peripheral <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> malaria at delivery diagnosed with a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay.</p></sec><sec><title>Findings</title><p>Overall prevalence of PCR-diagnosed peripheral <italic>P. falciparum</italic> malaria at delivery was 10.5&#x00025;.

When only HIV-negative participants were analyzed, the corresponding figures were 0.26 (0.12 to 0.57, P&#x0003c;0.001) for women in the monthly SP group, and 0.24 (0.11 to 0.53, P&#x0003c;0.001) for those in the AZI-SP group.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our results suggest that increasing the frequency of SP administration during pregnancy improves the efficacy against malaria at delivery among HIV-negative women, as well as a population consisting of both HIV-positive and &#x02013;negative pregnant women of all gravidities, in a setting of relatively low but holoendemic malaria transmission, frequent use of bed nets and high SP resistance.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00131235</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Malaria is one of the most important preventable causes of poor maternal health and adverse birth outcomes <xref rid="pone.0041123-Desai1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. In sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), an estimated 25 million pregnant women are in danger of <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> infections every year <xref rid="pone.0041123-Steketee1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Fortunately, much of the malaria-associated morbidity and mortality can be prevented by intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp), and 35 of 45 sub-Saharan African countries had adopted IPTp with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) as a national policy by the end of 2010 <xref rid="pone.0041123-World1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. However, the effectiveness of the standard two-dose SP IPTp is under threat due to increasing SP-resistance, declined malaria immunity among women infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), possibly too long treatment interval, and difficulties in practical implementation <xref rid="pone.0041123-Sridaran1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0041123-terKuile1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Thus, new antimalarial regimens for IPTp are needed, but finding an alternative to SP has proven difficult. Therefore the WHO continues to recommend the use of SP IPTp for pregnant women at risk of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> in SSA <xref rid="pone.0041123-World1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Increasing the dosing frequency of SP has been considered as one possibility to improve the effectiveness of SP IPTp while alternative regimens are being explored.</p><p>At least four trials have tested the efficacy of an IPTp regimen that contains monthly SP-dosing <xref rid="pone.0041123-Parise1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0041123-Luntamo1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. However, three of these trials focused on defined risk groups and not an unselected population of pregnant women, which typically comprises the actual target group for IPTp <xref rid="pone.0041123-Parise1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0041123-Hamer1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. A Kenyan and a Malawian study enrolled participants in their first or second pregnancy <xref rid="pone.0041123-Parise1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0041123-Filler1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, and a Zambian sample included only HIV-positive women <xref rid="pone.0041123-Hamer1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. These three trials, in aggregate, suggest that monthly SP results in less placental and peripheral maternal malaria at delivery and a higher birth weight among HIV-positive primi- and secundigravidae <xref rid="pone.0041123-terKuile1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. However, there is no conclusive evidence of the benefits of monthly SP for HIV-negative women, for HIV-positive multigravidae, or for a population comprising of both HIV-positive and &#x02013;negative women of different gravidities.</p><p>In our previously reported trial from Malawi we included pregnant women regardless of their gravidity or HIV-infection status <xref rid="pone.0041123-Luntamo1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. A total of 1320 participants were randomized to receive either two doses of SP (control), monthly SP, or a combination of monthly SP and two doses of azithromycin (AZI-SP). Compared with the controls, the trial documented a significantly lower incidence of both preterm delivery and low birth weight (LBW) in the AZI-SP, but not in the monthly SP group. Peripheral malaria prevalence assessed by conventional microscopy was higher among controls (approximately 5&#x00025;) than among women in both intervention groups (approximately 2&#x00025;), both around 32 gestational weeks and at delivery. However, these intergroup differences were statistically significant only around 32 gestational weeks &#x02013; possibly because microscopic malaria samples at delivery were available only for 481 individuals who gave birth at a health facility. Hence, we could not establish if the trial regimens reduced malaria exposure in late pregnancy, nor whether the differences in pregnancy outcomes between the monthly SP and AZI-SP groups were due to an additional antimalarial effect of azithromycin or other factors.</p><p>In a subsequent study, we applied a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) &#x02013; based method to diagnose malaria from peripheral blood samples collected at delivery in the above described trial. With this more sensitive method, we documented an almost five fold higher prevalence of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> parasitaemia than earlier diagnosed with microscopy <xref rid="pone.0041123-Rantala1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. In the current study we used the results of this PCR-methodology to assess the effect of monthly SP and AZI-SP treatments on peripheral malaria parasitaemia at delivery in a population that consisted of both HIV-positive and &#x02013;negative participants of all gravidities.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study Design and Outcomes</title><p>This study is a secondary analysis of peripheral blood samples collected at delivery for real-time PCR assay targeting <italic>P. falciparum</italic> as part of the Lungwena Antenatal Intervention Study (LAIS), which has been described in detail elsewhere <xref rid="pone.0041123-Luntamo1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Of the 1320 LAIS participants, these blood samples were collected only from the women who delivered at a local health facility. The LAIS enrolled both HIV-positive and &#x02013;negative pregnant women of all gravidities into a randomized, partially placebo controlled clinical trial, which was conducted in rural Malawi between 2003 and 2007. The study hypothesis was that preterm delivery and other adverse pregnancy outcomes could be reduced, and maternal health improved by intermittent preventive treatment (IPT) of pregnant women with monthly sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, alone or in combination with two doses of azithromycin.

Inclusion criteria for the study were gestational age 14&#x02013;26 weeks by ultrasound assessment, felt movements of the fetus, availability for follow-up, and informed consent. Exclusion criteria included severe illness, receipt of azithromycin during the current pregnancy or SP within preceding 28 days, allergy to study drugs, and any previous serious allergic reaction.

Participants in the first intervention group (&#x0201c;monthly SP&#x0201d;) received otherwise the same treatment, but SP was given monthly from enrollment until 37 gestational weeks. Participants in the second intervention group (&#x0201c;AZI-SP&#x0201d;) received otherwise the same treatment as the monthly SP group, but instead of placebo, they received active azithromycin twice (two tablets orally, each containing 500 mg of azithromycin): at enrollment visit and between 28<sup>th</sup> and 34<sup>th</sup> weeks of gestation. All participants received ferrous sulphate (200 mg/day) and folic acid (0.25 mg/day) throughout pregnancy.</p><p>Participants diagnosed with malaria at enrollment or at 28&#x02013;34<sup>th</sup> week visit received the normal pre-packed study drugs which included SP for all study groups.

Based on this list, an individual drug box was pre-packed for each identification number. The drug box contained appropriate study drugs for each planned study visit in separate opaque drug envelopes labeled with identification number and visit information. Individual slips containing unique identification numbers, but not group allocation, were sealed in individual opaque randomization envelopes. The envelopes were grouped into randomization blocks to ensure similar allocation rates to each group.</p><p>At enrollment visit, the research personnel interviewed individuals interested in participating in the study about their socioeconomic status, obstetric history and bed net use, gave pre-test HIV-counseling, and performed an antenatal and laboratory examinations. Testing for HIV was optional. Eligible individuals signed or thumb-printed informed consent and picked one randomization envelope which contained an identification number. A research assistant not involved in outcome assessment gave the corresponding pre-packed study drugs to the participant under direct observation.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Follow-up</title><p>At follow-up visits (at four-week intervals until 36 completed gestational weeks and weekly thereafter) the research personnel conducted an antenatal examination. The participants were offered post-test HIV counseling and prevention of mother to child transmission. At the visit during 28th&#x02013;34th weeks of gestation, a malaria test was conducted. At each visit, the participant took the appropriate pre-packed study drugs under direct observation.</p><p>Upon notification of a delivery, a research assistant visited the delivery site. She collected data on delivery, examined the newborn and gave her/him nevirapine or placebo based on maternal HIV status.

We therefore believe that the sample findings were reliable and representative, and that IPTp with monthly SP, with or without azithromycin, was indeed associated with reduced prevalence of PCR-diagnosed peripheral <italic>P. falciparum</italic> malaria parasitaemia at delivery in the target population from which the sample was drawn.</p><p>A secondary analysis of pooled data from three other clinical trials from Kenya, Malawi and Zambia suggested that compared with the two-dose SP regimen, the monthly regimen had a beneficial effect on malaria prevalence at delivery and birth weight among HIV-positive pregnant women in their first or second pregnancy <xref rid="pone.0041123-terKuile1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. The previous Malawian study found significantly lower peripheral malaria at delivery in the monthly SP group also among HIV-negative primi- and secundigravidae <xref rid="pone.0041123-Filler1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. However, when this data was pooled with the data of HIV-negative participants in the Kenyan study, the analysis failed to document statistical significance <xref rid="pone.0041123-terKuile1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. None of these earlier studies addressed the efficacy of the monthly SP regimen in a representative sample that contained both HIV-negative women and those with more than one earlier pregnancy <xref rid="pone.0041123-Parise1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0041123-Hamer1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Hence, it has thus far been uncertain, whether the monthly SP regimen would best be reserved for some selected risk groups, or it should be given to all pregnant women in malaria endemic areas <xref rid="pone.0041123-terKuile1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.</p><p>Our results indicate that IPTp with monthly SP can in some conditions reduce the prevalence of peripheral blood <italic>P. falciparum</italic> malaria parasitaemia at delivery in the latter, wider target group, as well as among HIV-negative women regardless of their gravidity. This finding is consistent with the results of a recently reported trial from Mali, which found that IPTp with three doses of SP is superior to two doses in reducing malaria prevalence at delivery, LBW and premature delivery among mainly HIV-negative women of different gravidities <xref rid="pone.0041123-Diakite1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. The sample of the current substudy was not powered to look at more direct health outcomes, but since also PCR-detectable submicroscopic parasitaemias have important consequences to maternal health and birth outcomes, the observed effect is likely to be beneficial both to the mother and the newborn <xref rid="pone.0041123-Mayor1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0041123-Adegnika1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> (Atupele Kapito-Tembo et al, unpublished results).</p><p>Besides the apparently improved efficacy against malaria, monthly dosing would solve some of the problems associated with the two-dose SP IPTp. There are concerns that the dosing interval in the two-dose regimen might be too long even in areas with low levels of SP resistance, and increasing resistance further shortens the duration of the post-treatment prophylactic effect <xref rid="pone.0041123-White1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0041123-Diakite1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. This concerns especially HIV-positive women not taking cotrimoxazole prophylaxis, who have increased susceptibility to malaria in pregnancy and reduced efficacy of antimalarial drugs <xref rid="pone.0041123-Menndez1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0041123-TerKuile1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0041123-terKuile1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Also, many pregnant women receive none or only one dose of SP despite making several antenatal care visits during the second and third trimesters <xref rid="pone.0041123-vanEijk1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0041123-Sangar1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. One reason for this is the difficulty to determine the appropriate timing of the doses; monthly SP policy would simplify the dosing regimen and thus ensure that more women receive at least two doses of SP <xref rid="pone.0041123-Gill1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0041123-Sangar1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0041123-Filler1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0041123-Ouma1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0041123-AshwoodSmith1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Previous results suggest that also monthly SP, alone and in combination with azithromycin, is safe to use during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy <xref rid="pone.0041123-terKuile1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0041123-Luntamo1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0041123-Peters1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0041123-Kalilani1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. All this, together with the ease of single-dose administration which can be done under direct observation at antenatal care visits, and the low price of SP, makes the monthly SP regimen seem suitable for IPTp until an effective, safe and feasible alternative for SP has been identified.</p><p>However, before adopting a monthly SP IPTp policy, several issues have to be taken into consideration. The prevalence of mutations in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> associated with resistance to SP has increased in Africa, and is very high among pregnant women in some parts of Malawi <xref rid="pone.0041123-Sridaran1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0041123-Taylor1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. There have been concerns that IPTp might increase resistance and even cause adverse outcomes, but the results have so far been contradictory <xref rid="pone.0041123-Taylor1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0041123-Harrington1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0041123-Taylor2" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Additionally, local conditions such as malaria prevalence and the level of acquired malaria immunity among the target group need to be taken into consideration as they might affect SP IPTp efficacy. In our study area the level of resistance was high already during the enrollment between 2003 and 2007: over 80&#x00025; of the malaria isolates collected among the LAIS participants at enrollment were found to express quintuple DNA mutations for SP resistance (Steven Meshnick et al, unpublished results).</p><p>In our previous analysis we found that the combination regimen of monthly SP and two doses of azithromycin, but not monthly SP alone, was significantly superior to the standard regimen of two SP doses in preventing preterm delivery and LBW <xref rid="pone.0041123-Luntamo1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Azithromycin is both a modestly active antimalarial and a potent broad-spectrum antimicrobial drug, and thus the improved efficacy of the combination could have been due to either activity <xref rid="pone.0041123-Chico1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0041123-Pfizer1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. However, because the prevalence of microscopic malaria was low, we were earlier unable to adequately separate the antimalarial and other possible effects of azithromycin.</p><p>In the current analysis, we found that the monthly SP regimen was associated with statistically significant reductions in PCR-diagnosed malaria prevalence at delivery both alone, as well as in combination with azithromycin, and that there were no major differences between the two intervention regimens in the point-estimates for the effect size. The results thus suggest that the decrease in parasitaemia at delivery was mainly caused by the increased frequency of the SP dosage, while the improvement in birth outcomes might have been due to some other activity of azithromycin, independent of its activity against malaria. A possible explanation for azithromycin&#x02019;s weak antimalarial effect in our study is the used dosage. Although 1g dose of azithromycin given twice several weeks apart is sufficient to cure many RTIs, it might be suboptimal against <italic>P. falciparum</italic> malaria <xref rid="pone.0041123-Chico1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0041123-Pfizer1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>.</p><p>Two limitations of our study are that we analyzed the prevalence of malaria parasitaemia with PCR only at delivery, and only from peripheral blood. It could be argued that the difference in parasitaemia at delivery simply reflects the fact that the last dose in the regimens containing monthly SP was given nearer to delivery than in the two-dose regimen. Thus we cannot rule out that the groups might have had comparable malaria prevalence during pregnancy and that the differences only developed towards delivery. However, it is unlikely that the efficacy of SP would have differed during pregnancy, and therefore the monthly dosing with shorter treatment intervals is likely to have been more effective throughout pregnancy. This is supported by our finding of a comparable effect size in the prevalence of microscopic malaria parasitaemia at 32 gestational weeks in the original sample from which the current study population was drawn <xref rid="pone.0041123-Luntamo1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Another limitation is that we did not perform analyses with PCR of placental blood and did not collect histological samples of the placenta to diagnose placental malaria. The microscopic results of placental blood showed no difference between the groups <xref rid="pone.0041123-Luntamo1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.</p><p>In conclusion, our results suggest that increasing the frequency of SP administration during pregnancy improves efficacy against malaria at delivery among HIV-negative women as well as a population consisting of both HIV-positive and &#x02013;negative pregnant women of all gravidities in a setting of relatively low but holoendemic malaria transmission, frequent use of bed nets and high SP resistance. However, further research is needed to study the consequences of the prevention of submicroscopic malaria infections to maternal and child health, as well as the effect of different levels of resistance and malaria prevalence on the IPTp efficacy. We therefore recommend the use of sensitive diagnostic tools for malaria, such as PCR and placental histology, and the determination of the level and change of drug resistance and acquired immunity in future IPTp trials.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0041123.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>
