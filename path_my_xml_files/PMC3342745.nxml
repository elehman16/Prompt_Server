We, therefore, compared the effect of the ETA/ETB receptor antagonist, bosentan, on pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) in healthy subjects with (HS: HAPE subjects, <italic>n</italic>=5) or without a HAPE-history (CS: Control subjects, <italic>n</italic>=10). A double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, crossover design was performed in order to study the effects on PASP of a single oral dose of bosentan (250 mg) after 90 min exposure to normobaric hypoxia (FiO<sub>2</sub> =0.12). In normoxia, PASP, evaluated by echocardiography, was 23.4&#x000b1;2.7 mmHg in CS and 28&#x000b1;5.8 mmHg in HS (NS). During the placebo period, hypoxia induced a significant decrease in SaO<sub>2</sub>, PaO<sub>2</sub> and PCO<sub>2</sub> and increase in pH in both CS and HS. Pulmonary arterial systolic pressure was also significantly increased (+8.5&#x000b1;5.0 mmHg in CS; +13.4&#x000b1;3.1 mmHg in HS) and reached significantly higher levels in HS than in CS (<italic>P</italic>=0.02). Bosentan significantly but similarly blunted the hypoxia-induced increase in PASP in both CS (Bosentan: 27.0&#x000b1;3.3 mmHg; placebo: 32.1&#x000b1;3.5 mmHg; <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01) and HS (Bosentan: 35.0&#x000b1;2.9 mmHg; placebo: 41.4&#x000b1;7.6 mmHg; <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05), (CS 5.2&#x000b1;5.3 vs. HS -6.4&#x000b1;5.2 mmHg, NS). Bosentan did not have a major effect on the hypoxia-induced changes in blood gas, or on cardiac output (CO) and systemic blood pressure (SBP), which were not modified by hypoxia. Plasma ET-1 in hypoxia during the bosentan period was 2.8 times higher than during for both CS and HS. A single oral dose of bosentan similarly blunted the hypoxia-induced increase in PASP both in healthy and HAPE-susceptible subjects, without altering CO or SBP.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>endothelin-1</kwd><kwd>hypoxia</kwd><kwd>pulmonary hypertension</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1-1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Endothelin, which is a potent pulmonary vasoconstrictor, has been involved in the pathophysiological pathway of high-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE). Indeed, the main mechanism for edema constitution appears to be hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction that leads to a larger increase in pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) in subjects with HAPE susceptibility than in subjects without HAPE history. In mountaineers, the increase in plasma ET-1 concentration at high altitude is correlated with the increase in PAP, and is larger in subjects susceptible to HAPE than in subjects with no HAPE history.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] Nonselective ETA/ETB endothelin receptor blockade in animal models prevent hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction and reduces acute and chronic hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] Thus, we and other investigators have shown that pulmonary arterial systolic pressure (PASP) in healthy subjects exposed to high altitude was significantly lower after endothelin-1 (ET-1) receptor blockade by bosentan than after placebo.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] However, at the present time no data are available for subjects with a previous history of HAPE.</p><p>The aim of this study was therefore to investigate, in healthy mountaineers with a past history of HAPE in comparison with control subjects, the effects of a single oral dose of bosentan on PASP and cardiac hemodynamics during an acute normobaric-hypoxia test at rest and during submaximal exercise.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>Fifteen men (age: 37&#x000b1;8 years) with experience in mountain hiking were recruited for the study. Five of them had previously experienced at least 2 HAPE episodes at high altitude, defined as acute dyspnea with cyanosis at an altitude &#x0003e;3,000 m. with a need to descend to an altitude &#x0003c;2,000 m (HAPE subjects group, HS). The 10 remaining healthy subjects had not previously experienced HAPE, despite regular mountain hiking at or above the same altitude (control subjects group, CS). The results for the latter group have been published in detail elsewhere.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] None of the subjects was acclimatized to altitude or was on any medication.

The dose of bosentan used is the recommended dose for patients with primary or secondary pulmonary hypertension. Subjects were instructed to avoid strenuous physical activity 1 week before the investigation. All investigations were performed at the Georges Pompidou Hospital Clinical Investigation Center in Paris (40-50 m. above sea level) at normal barometric pressure.</p><p>On each study day at 8 a.m., after a light caffeine- and fat-free breakfast, baseline echocardiography (with PASP measurement) was carried out and blood samples for plasma ET-1 concentration and blood gas measurements were taken at rest in normoxia and during a submaximal exercise test at 8:30 a.m. At 9:30 a.m., 250 mg bosentan or a matching placebo was given orally with 250 ml tap water, according to the randomization procedure. At 11:30 a.m., the subject was exposed to normobaric hypoxia for 90 minutes. During exposure to the normobaric hypoxic gas mixture, a second set of echocardiography and blood sample analyses were carried out, at rest at 12:30 p.m. (3 hours. after bosentan or placebo ingestion) and during a second submaximal exercise test at 1 p.m.</p><p>Oxygen saturation (SaO<sub>2</sub>) by ear oximetry (Oximax N-595, Nellcor, Boulder, Colo., USA), systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP, respectively) by a semiautomatic validated oscillometric device (Nippon Collins, Komaki City, Japan) and heart rate (HR) were continuously monitored.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Normobaric hypoxia</title><p>Normobaric hypoxia was achieved by inhalation of a gas mixture of O<sub>2</sub>(FiO<sub>2</sub> =0.12) and N<sub>2</sub> at normal barometric pressure through a tightly secure facial mask; this pressure was equivalent to the oxygen partial pressure found at an altitude of 4,300 m (Altitrainer, SM-TEC, Lausanne, Switzerland).</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Submaximal exercise test</title><p>The submaximal exercise tests were performed in the semisupine position on a cycle ergometer.

The right atrial pressure was estimated as a function of the inferior vena cava diameter and its variation during breathing. Pulmonary flow was recorded by pulsed-wave Doppler and acceleration time was measured from onset to the peak velocity of pulmonary flow. Pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) was determined using the formula PVR (Wood Unit, WU) = V<sub>TR</sub>/VTI<sub>RVOT</sub> + 0.16, where VTI<sub>RVOT</sub> is the velocity time-integral of the right ventricle outflow tract.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] Cardiac output (CO) was calculated as the product of the velocity-time integral and the area of the LV outflow tract and HR. Early tricuspid inflow wave, E, and annular tricuspid velocity, Et, were measured by Doppler imaging for the tricuspid ratio: E/Et calculation.

Level of altitude, prior acclimatization, rate of ascent, exertion, cold, individual genetic susceptibility, and presence of patent foramen ovale are the main clinical determinants for HAPE.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] However, searching for other potential pathophysiological pathways in order to detect the subjects susceptible to develop HAPE and to find new therapeutic strategies to prevent HAPE occurrence is still a topical subject. Our results show that, in subjects with or without medical history of HAPE, blockade of ETA and ETB receptors by a single oral dose of bosentan 250 mg similarly reduces the hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension at rest. Although bosentan did not significantly reduce the magnitude of the increase in PASP due to exercise in hypoxic conditions, PASP remained 3-5 mmHg lower after bosentan intake than after placebo intake in both groups. The vasodilatory effect of bosentan was restricted to the pulmonary circulation and bosentan had no effect on right ventricular systolic or on systemic hemodynamics (SBP, CO and HR). Despite its favorable pulmonary hemodynamic effect, acute administration of bosentan had no significant effect on gas exchange in hypoxic conditions in control or HAPE subjects.</p><sec id="sec2-9"><title>Differences between CS and HS during the placebo period</title><p>Several attempts have been made to identify HAPE-susceptible individuals and to apply preventive measures before an ascent to high altitude (reviewed in Reference 10). These subjects appear to have an increase pulmonary vasoreactivity which may be revealed by hypoxia and/or exercise. As previously reported, we first confirmed that HS had normal resting PASP at sea level in normoxia.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] However, in our study, resting PASP was slightly higher, although nonsignificantly, in HS than in CS. Part of the difference in resting PASP between the two groups may be due to the higher SBP in HS than CS.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] Second, we confirmed that for a similar hypoxia-induced decrease in SaO<sub>2</sub> and PaO<sub>2</sub> at rest, HS had more pronounced hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (increase in PVR) than CS, thus achieving a significantly higher PASP. This was consistent with the results of previous studies.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] However, there was an overlap of PASP values between HS and CS that did not allow HS to be distinguished from CS. Further, larger studies are needed in order to establish if the hypoxia test at rest could serve as a screening test to detect HAPE-susceptible subjects before altitude exposure. Third, in contrast to previous findings,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] PASP values recorded during exercise at a similar workload in normoxic conditions (&#x02248;110 W for a HR &#x02248;120 bpm in both groups) did not significantly differ between HS and CS. Indeed, Grunig et al.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] suggested that a PASP &#x0003e; 45 mmHg during submaximal exercise in normoxia may be a useful screening test to identify HAPE susceptible subjects. We observed that PASP at exercise in normoxia was &#x0003e;45 mmHg only in 2 HS and that 2 CS reached PASP above this threshold during exercise. However, these data should be interpreted with caution because of the small sample size of the two studies. Finally, the workload achieved under normoxic (&#x02248;110 W, 8&#x02013;9 minutes) and hypoxic (&#x02248;70 W, 4-5 minutes) conditions were similar between HS and CS.</p><p>The larger increase in PASP in HS than in CS during hypoxia at rest and exercise suggests an increased intrinsic vasoreactivity of their pulmonary circulation in response to hypoxic stress, potentially involving ET-1 transduction pathways (reviews in[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] and[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] ). We found that a 90-minute exposure to normobaric hypoxia induced a slight increase in plasma ET-1 concentrations in CS but not in HS, probably because of its small sample size. Previous studies have found plasma ET-1 concentration to be higher in HAPE susceptible subjects than in nonsusceptible subjects, with the increase in plasma ET-1 concentration correlated to the increase in PASP after exposure to high altitude.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] Berger et al. also found that at high altitude there is a transpulmonary gain in ET-1 plasma concentration while at sea level there is a transpulmonary loss.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] This may be due to increased ET-1 release from endothelial cells and/or increased conversion of big ET-1.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>] However, measurement of endothelins in plasma is not a sensitive method for investigating the effects of endothelins within the vascular wall, whereas the magnitude of the response to a pharmacological of ETA/ETB receptors represents at best an integrated evaluation of the degree of the endothelin system involvement.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-10"><title>Bosentan effects at rest and during exercise during normobaric hypoxia in HS and CS</title><p>The selected dose of bosentan (250 mg) effectively blocked ETA/ETB receptors in both CS and HS, with a similar 3-fold increase in plasma ET-1 concentrations.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>] It also blunted the hypoxia-induced increase in PASP at rest in both CS and HS subjects, with a similar decrease (15-20%) in PASP. This is consistent with the results of the ACME-1 study, in which PASP was 30% lower after 3-day bosentan treatment (62.5&#x02013;125 mg o.d.) than after placebo in healthy subjects after an ascent to high altitude.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] In our study, bosentan did not significantly reduce the magnitude of the exercise/hypoxia-induced increase in PASP in both groups. However, PASP after bosentan treatment remained 3&#x02013;5 mmHg lower than after placebo in both groups (NS). Although HS reached a higher PASP than CS during both rest and exercise under hypoxic conditions, the magnitude of the blunting effect of bosentan on PASP increase did not differ between HS and CS groups; however, PASP after bosentan treatment remained higher in HS than in CS.</p><p>The absence of a significant difference between bosentan and placebo during exercise can be explained by increased between-subject variability in PASP and difficulty in obtaining adequate Doppler signal during exercise. Furthermore, the small sample size of the study also contributes to the absence of significant response. The effect of bosentan on PASP was probably due to its selective pulmonary vasodilatory effect at the selected dose.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>] Indeed, the blunting effect of bosentan on the PASP increase was not associated with any change in CO, SBP or HR.</p><p>Finally, a single oral dose of bosentan had no major effect on SaO<sub>2</sub> or blood gases at rest or during exercise under hypoxic conditions, suggesting that in contrast with Faoro et al.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>] a single oral dose of bosentan does not have an acute effect on oxygen transfer capacity in these experimental conditions in normal or HAPE-subjects.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Our preliminary findings demonstrate that (1) the ET1 system is indeed activated by hypoxia independently of individual susceptibility to HAPE, and (2) this activation can be effectively and partly reversed by an ETA/ETB receptor antagonist. However, the fact that the magnitude of the reduction in PASP after bosentan treatment was similar between HS and CS suggests that hypoxia-induced activation of the ET-1 system is not any greater in HS than in CS in our experimental conditions. Therefore, the PASP response during hypoxia to a single oral dose of 250 mg of bosentan cannot serve as a useful screening test to identify HAPE susceptible subjects. However, these results should be confirmed by further studies involving more subjects.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>The authors thank the nursing staff of the Clinical Investigation Centre at the Georges Pompidou Hospital who ran the protocol, Dr. Laure Marelle who recruited the subjects and Dr. Jean-Louis Paul who performed the ET1 dosages.
