The use of adjunctive corticosteroids to attenuate the inflammatory response in TBM may improve outcome by reducing the likelihood or severity of neurological complications. Over the past sixty years, a number of clinical studies have investigated this hypothesis using adjunctive corticosteroids in the treatment of TBM <xref rid="pone.0027821-Shane1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0027821-Ashby1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0027821-Lepper1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0027821-OToole1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0027821-Escobar1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0027821-Girgis1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0027821-Schoeman1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. A decade ago a meta-analysis of all randomised controlled trials suggested that adjunctive corticosteroids reduced the risk of death in children but not in adults <xref rid="pone.0027821-Prasad1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p><p>We have previously conducted a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of adjunctive dexamethasone in 545 Vietnamese adolescents and adults with TBM <xref rid="pone.0027821-Thwaites1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Treatment with dexamethasone was associated with a reduction in mortality [relative risk (RR) 0.69, 95&#x00025; confidence interval (C.I.) 0.52 &#x02013; 0.92, p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.01), but not in neurological disability, compared with placebo. Significantly fewer adverse events occurred in the dexamethasone group than in the placebo group. Although the number of HIV-infected patients included in the study was too small to confidently determine a treatment effect, the use of dexamethasone appeared to be safe in that group of patients.</p><p>A more recent meta-analysis of 1140 participants recruited to seven trials has found that corticosteroids reduced the risk of death (RR 0.78, 95&#x00025; CI 0.67&#x02013;0.91)<xref rid="pone.0027821-Prasad2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Data on disabling residual neurological deficit from 720 participants in three trials showed that corticosteroids reduce the risk of death or disabling residual neurological deficit (RR 0.82, 95&#x00025; CI 0.70 to 0.97). The authors concluded that corticosteroids should be routinely used in HIV-uninfected patients with TBM to reduce death and disabling residual neurological deficit amongst survivors. Consequently, adjunctive corticosteroids have become recommended as routine therapy for all patients with TBM <xref rid="pone.0027821-Prasad2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0027821-Thwaites2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0027821-National1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.</p><p>There are limited data on the long-term outcome of patients with TBM <xref rid="pone.0027821-LONGTERM1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0027821-Schoeman2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. The mechanisms by which corticosteroids reduce mortality remain obscure <xref rid="pone.0027821-Simmons1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. It is unknown how long the mortality benefit persists for, or whether the lack of effect on disability will have long-term consequences. Therefore we conducted a follow-up study to determine whether adjunctive dexamethasone was associated with reduced mortality or neurological disability five years after entry into the original trial.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design, setting and participants</title><p>The original study was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of adjunctive dexamethasone in Vietnamese adults and adolescents with TBM.

Patients were assessed using a standard questionnaire and neurological examination. Neurological disability was assessed using standardized questionnaires ('two simple questions' and modified Rankin scale), as previously described <xref rid="pone.0027821-Thwaites1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Four survivors who were unable to attend the hospital gave verbal consent and were assessed by telephone interview. The primary outcome was overall survival during the five years of follow-up. The secondary outcome measures were disability status five years after randomization, and tuberculosis relapse (defined as re-treatment for tuberculosis) during the follow-up period.

We also displayed hazard rate estimates (number of events divided by person-years of follow-up) in both arms during the following time intervals: 0 to three, three to six, six to nine, nine to twelve months, and at yearly intervals thereafter. As supplementary graphical displays, we show the Nelson-Aaalen estimator of the cumulative hazard and smoothed hazard rate estimates based on a local bandwidth selection algorithm.</p><p>Proportional hazards were tested based on weighted Schoenfeld residuals. As there was strong evidence of non-proportional hazards for the treatment effect over time, we compared survival probabilities at fixed time points (yearly intervals from one to five years of follow-up) in all patients and by TBM grade, respectively. Kaplan-Meier estimates of survival probabilities were used and comparisons were based on Greenwood's variance formula. We also tested whether there was an interaction between TBM grade and dexamethasone treatment using a logistic regression, with outcome death prior to the respective time point, and excluding patients lost to follow-up. In addition, we fitted separate Cox survival models for the first three months of randomized treatment and the time thereafter. The following potential predictors of mortality were included in the Cox regression analysis: treatment group, admission TBM grade, HIV status, age, gender, haematocrit and serum sodium at baseline. The three-month cut-off was chosen because at this time point the initiation phase of tuberculosis treatment (and treatment with dexamethasone) had been completed. Of note, estimates (of hazards and hazard ratios) for the time period from month three onwards include only patients who survived beyond month three and this may select different subpopulations in the two treatment arms. Thus, causal interpretation of results from the latter time period should be applied with caution. All reported confidence intervals are two-sided 95&#x00025; confidence intervals and analyses were performed with the statistical software R version 2.8.0 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) <xref rid="pone.0027821-R1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> and the companion R package muhaz version 1.2.5 (for smooth hazard estimation).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><p>545 patients were randomized (274 in the dexamethasone arm, 271 in the placebo arm) between 4 April 2001 and 29 March 2003. 10/545 (2&#x00025;) patients were lost to follow-up during the original nine-month follow-up period (5 in the dexamethasone group and 5 in the placebo group).

Of the 50 subjects who died after nine months, 4 had a cause of death reported by the relatives (TBM, pneumonia and diabetes, myocardial infarction and asthma) and 46 had an unknown cause of death.

It was not possible to assess whether patients who had died between nine months and five years had been re-treated for tuberculosis prior to death.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our original trial <xref rid="pone.0027821-Thwaites1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref> showed that adjunctive dexamethasone treatment improved survival in patients with TBM at nine months. The present study shows a survival benefit of dexamethasone treatment for up to two years of follow-up. The benefits on long-term (five-year) survival are inevitably less clear, and may be confined to patients with grade I TBM, and dexamethasone was not associated with improvement in disability status at nine months or five years post-randomisation.</p><p>We managed to obtain follow-up data from the vast majority (91.2&#x00025;) of patients at five years. Although the five-year survival estimates were similar in the two arms, there did appear to be a persistent benefit of dexamethasone in the patients with grade 1 TBM. One possible explanation is that dexamethasone may prevent the development of neurological complications in this group of patients, whereas it has limited effect on those who present with established neurological deficits (grade 2 or 3 TBM). This has important clinical implications and re-emphasises the need to diagnose and treat TBM promptly, before neurological complications ensue. Although TBM may have an indolent presentation, once a patient comes to the attention of medical services, the condition should be managed as a medical emergency, as clinical outcome is critically dependent on the TBM grade at the initiation of therapy.</p><p>We observed that the Kaplan-Meier survival curve for all patients converged over the five-year follow-up period, suggesting non-proportional hazards. This was confirmed by a Cox survival hazards model which indicated that dexamethasone had a highly significant benefit during the first three months of follow-up which was partially offset by a higher subsequent mortality amongst three-month survivors in the dexamethasone group. A possible explanation is that dexamethasone saves lives acutely, but leaves some individuals with severe neurological sequaelae, which subsequently lead to death. Two baseline variables, HIV status and increased TBM grade, were found to be associated with death during the initial 3 months of treatment. When we examined the follow-up period beyond three months, HIV status, low haematocrit and increased age were found to be independently associated with death. </p><p>Disability status at nine months and five years was assessed using the modified Rankin score and the 'two simple questions'. These tools are commonly used for assessment of disability in stroke patients and give an indication of the extent to which patients require physical assistance with activities of daily living, a somewhat crude measure of disability. Examination of the disability data at nine months reveals that severe disability was more frequent in the dexamethasone arm compared with the placebo arm (12.4&#x00025; versus 8.1&#x00025;), and that intermediate outcome showed a similar pattern (17.9&#x00025; versus 15.5&#x00025;, respectively). There was no difference in the number of patients with TBM grade 1 who had severe disability at nine months (four in each treatment arm); this low rate of disability at nine months may explain why the survival benefit in grade 1 TBM appears to persist out to five years. For patients with grade 2 and 3 TBM there were more severely disabled patients at 9 months in the dexamethasone arm, compared with the placebo arm: 19 versus 11 (grade 2 TBM) and 11 versus 7 (grade 3 TBM). By five years intermediate outcome remained more frequent in the dexamethasone arm compared with the placebo (17.2&#x00025; versus 14.8&#x00025;) but the rates of severe outcome were similar (6.8&#x00025; versus 7.4&#x00025;). Thus dexamethasone may be preventing death at nine months but leaving more patients disabled; these disabled patients go on to die over the course of the follow-up period.</p><p>We acknowledge several limitations of our study. The primary outcome measure was all-cause mortality at five years and it was not possible to determine whether the cause of death was related to TBM or not. Secondly, we did not formally assess neuro-cognitive function in the patients, which may have been able to detect more subtle differences in disability. Thirdly, our Kaplan-Meier curves and analyses suggest a larger benefit of dexamethasone treatment in TBM grade 1 but tests for heterogeneity of the treatment effect in different TBM grades were not significant. While such tests have low power, we cannot conclusively rule out that the observed heterogeneity is due to chance alone. The sample size in the original study was powered to detect a difference in the primary endpoint outcome at nine months; no sample size was calculated in relation to the five-year follow up outlined in this study. Finally, there are no specialist neuro-rehabilitation services available in Vietnam and this may influence long-term outcome of disabled patients; these results may therefore not be comparable to outcome for disabled TBM survivors in settings where such facilities exist.</p><p>The findings of our original study indicated that dexamethasone improved survival at nine months in all patients with TBM, although it had no effect on neurological disability. This study demonstrated a benefit of dexamethasone up to two years of follow-up but could not demonstrate a five year survival benefit, which may be confined to patients with less severe disease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0027821.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Cumulative hazard (left panel) and smoothed hazard rate estimates (right panel) according to treatment group.
