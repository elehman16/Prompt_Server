This paper presents the rationale and study design.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">The impact evaluation involves a cluster randomized controlled trial design that will be implemented in 120 rural communities/villages within 60 communes supported by SELEVER in the Boucle de Mouhoun, Centre-Ouest, and Haut-Bassins regions of Burkina Faso. Communities will be randomly assigned to one of three treatment arms, including: (1) SELEVER intervention group; (2) SELEVER with an intensive WASH component; and (3) control group without intervention. Primary outcomes include the mean probability of adequacy of diets for women and children (aged 2&#x02013;4 years at baseline), infant and young child feeding practices of caregivers of children aged 0&#x02013;2 years, and household poultry production and sales. Intermediate outcomes along the agriculture and nutrition pathways will also be measured, including child nutrition status and development.

Low-income households typically subsist on monotonous staple-based diets and lack of diet diversity is associated with inadequate intake and risks of deficiencies of essential micronutrients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Food production is just one factor in the availability and consumption of nutrients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Food is stored, distributed, processed, marketed, prepared, and consumed in ways that affect the access, acceptability, and nutritional quality of foods for consumers during critical stages of the life cycle, including infancy, childhood, and adolescence.</p><p id="Par30">An emerging framework for improving diet quality involves value chains (VC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The VC framework focuses on the broader range of actors that are involved in the production, processing, trade, and consumption of food products and the opportunities to achieve beneficial outcomes for some or all of the actors through changes in the structures, systems, and relationships that the chain involves. However, VC analysis and development have historically not considered nutrition-related value-addition; rather, the focus has been mainly on increased income for VC actors. Because VCs play a key role in determining food availability, affordability, quality, and acceptability, they also have a role in improving diets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and, moreover, provide useful lenses to characterize the food system. Participation in VCs in low- and middle-income settings also carries important opportunities to expand benefits to women by increasing women&#x02019;s assets, skills, and decision-making power within both the household and the community [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. At the same time, agricultural development, especially related to expansion and formalization of markets, may also inadvertently disempower women, by adding to their time burden and/or reducing their control over income, which could have negative consequences for diet and nutrition outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par31">VC-related activities may also increase health risks in producers and consumers. One specific emerging risk with livestock keeping is the elevation of disease burdens related to the close proximity of animals and humans, which include increased exposure to zoonotic diseases, including elevated risks of diarrhea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and environmental enteric dysfunction (EED), [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] as well as respiratory infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Poultry are a particular concern, given that scavenging poultry systems involve poultry roaming in and around the main household dwelling, thereby exposing young children (who are often left alone to sit or play on the ground) to the ingestion of chicken fecal matter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Evidence on these risks and exposures is, however, limited to a small number of observational studies. EED is thought to reduce appetite, inhibit nutrient absorption, impair immune system function, and is associated with stunting in children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. To date, the prospects of achieving improved diets (especially of women and young children) through interventions in livestock/poultry VCs have been largely ignored and little attention has been paid in these VC interventions to the prevention of EED through improved poultry-related hygiene promotion. Likewise, water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) interventions have largely focused on reducing exposure to human fecal matter, even though animal feces are more widespread in typical village environments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. There are several reasons for this evidence gap, including the issue that the biological processes involved in EED are complex and not yet well understood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Moreover, examining the links between poultry husbandry and child nutrition also requires researchers to design rigorous research across traditional disciplines which is in itself a challenge.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Country context</title><p id="Par32">Burkina Faso is one of the least developed countries in the world, with the latest Demographic Health Surveys [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] showing high rates of child stunting (35%), wasting (16%), and anemia (88%). Almost half of women are anemic and 16% of women are underweight (BMI&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;18.5&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>). Infant and young child feeding (IYCF) practices are particularly poor. Exclusive breastfeeding up to six months occurs in less than 13% of infants and only 3% of children are introduced to solid or semi-solid foods in the six- to eight-month window [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Particularly pertinent for our study is the low rate of dietary diversification for young children (age range 6&#x02013;24 months). In an international sample of recent DHS data, we estimated that Burkina Faso had the second lowest dietary diversity score in the world (based on a count of seven food groups) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In the 2010 DHS, 14% of children aged under two years had consumed poultry flesh and egg consumption was limited to 3% of children in the same age group, while 80% of households owned poultry. These findings suggest that there is significant scope to further expand poultry-based income generation for rural households, and chicken and egg consumption for young children and their mothers. Despite woman&#x02019;s crucial role in poultry production in Burkina Faso, women generally have limited control over the mobility of their poultry to markets, often relying on husbands and sons to take poultry to market and connect to more formal traders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Moreover, a gender gap in poultry ownership and access to services exists with women owning smaller flocks and having less access to veterinary services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>The SELEVER intervention</title><p id="Par33">Soutenir l&#x02019;Exploitation Familiale pour Lancer l&#x02019;&#x000c9;levage des Volailles et Valoriser l&#x02019;&#x000c9;conomie Rurale (SELEVER) or Women&#x02019;s Poultry Program to Improve Income and Nutrition project is a five-year program funded by the Bill &#x00026; Melinda Gates Foundation. The SELEVER project is implemented by Agribusiness Systems International (ASI) in partnership with selected local NGOs, private institutions, and governmental services. SELEVER is a poultry VC program that leverages agriculture development strategies and nutrition to increase poultry production and improve the nutritional status of women and children in the Centre Ouest, Hauts-Bassins, and Boucle de Mouhoun regions of Burkina Faso.

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec7"><title>Program theory</title><p id="Par45">The program theory for this evaluation is guided by the 2013 Lancet Series framework on Maternal and Child Nutrition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The SELEVER package bundles a nutrition-specific intervention (BCC on nutrition, health, and care) alongside two nutrition-sensitive interventions (women&#x02019;s empowerment and poultry VC development). The premise for understanding the role of VCs (that are, by definition, commodity-specific) in improving nutrition is that, generally, food-related nutritional impacts derive from changes in quality of overall diet, not just nutrient content of an individual food. Improvements in diet quality may also be necessary but not sufficient to result in improved nutrition if, for example, limiting constraints in the other determinants of nutrition (namely low burden of infectious diseases and caregiving practices) are not also simultaneously addressed. We identify four interlinked, food system-based pathways through which the SELEVER package could have an impact on diets. Building on [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], these pathways are based on: (1) leveraging demand; (2) supply of nutritious foods; (3) enhancing nutrition related value addition along a chain; and (4) empowering women. These pathways are complex, span multiple domains, and are linked through interactions with the food environment, including food availability, affordability, acceptability, nutrient quality, and food safety.</p><sec id="Sec8"><title>Pathway 1: increasing the demand for nutritious foods</title><p id="Par46">Increased intake of nutritious foods through SELEVER can be achieved through the BCC promoting the consumption of, or willingness to pay for, nutritious food. Nutritious food may be produced by the same households consuming the food or may be purchased. Intake of the poultry VC-related food (eggs, chicken meat) could complement or substitute the consumption of other foods in the diet. The food may also be shared within the household or consumed by only a few household members. This pathway can also influence VC actors since greater demand for nutritious foods can lead to expanding marketing opportunities (see <xref rid="Sec9" ref-type="sec">Pathway 2</xref>). Moreover, increased demand can play an important role in stimulating agricultural production, particularly for smallholders who face market-access constraints. The extent of the effect of the increased demand on prices will depend on the level of market integration. In addition, by improving knowledge on child health and care practices, BCC can also influence the other two immediate determinants of child malnutrition and lead to improved nutrition status of children in the first 1000-day window.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Pathway 2: increasing the supply of nutritious foods</title><p id="Par47">This involves the more recognizable VC pathway, where interventions target chain actors in the upstream segment of a VC (e.g. producers) who often face multiple constraints in responding to demand from actors further downstream (e.g. retailers, processors). Interventions would look to alleviate these constraints (e.g. increase poultry flock size through reduced mortality from improved uptake of vaccinations and other poultry management practices), strengthening market channels while increasing production, reducing transaction costs and risk, leading to increased efficiency and profits, and, in time, to improved incomes. In addition to the increased supply of foods, increased production and incomes for smallholders could mean that some additional income feeds back into dietary decisions, further increasing consumption and demand for nutritious foods (see <xref rid="Sec8" ref-type="sec">Pathway 1</xref>). SELEVER activities aim to increase poultry production through input provision and/or training on improved management practices, including the promotion of improved production technologies (housing, vaccinations) and increasing access to credit to stimulate investment in production. These VC interventions can also influence the basket of products (e.g. foods for local consumption rather than export and foods with relatively high nutritional value) that households produce. The targeting of particular foods has to be undertaken in the context of the substitution between crops for production and consumption and the long-term impacts for both incomes and nutrition at multiple scales (from the household and village levels to regional or national levels).</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Pathway 3: value chain performance and nutrition-related value addition</title><p id="Par48">The performance of the market-based transactions along the VC affects commercial relations and profits for the actors involved. In addition to economic value, the nutrition content, food safety, or contamination risk of a particular food can also be enhanced or diminished at key points along a VC. Moreover, by influencing supply volumes (quantity), price, and quality (including nutrition content and food safety/contamination) of a relevant food, VC performance can also mediate the effects of the SELEVER package on consumption and production decisions, influencing diets and nutrition of a broad range of target populations. These effects will be both direct (e.g. on poultry producers through the provision of VC services) and indirect (e.g. on consumers through market availability and prices). However, for nutrition-related value-addition to factor in investment strategies and in the VC transactions requires reliable information on both nutrition content and contamination risk to be transmitted along the chain and for prices to reflect a premium for these qualities. In practice, this is often not the case, particularly in low-income settings. As nutrition-related value includes properties that are akin to those of credence goods, there are no incentives to pay for quality unless there is some form of visible, third-part activity that may be undertaken publicly (e.g. information campaigns) or privately (e.g. consumer reporting). One of the VC-related contamination risks we will examine explicitly is related to the effect of livestock VC production practices on disease burdens, particularly through children&#x02019;s exposure to animal feces.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Pathway 4: empowering women</title><p id="Par49">As women play important roles in production and value addition, agriculture has the potential to empower women to make better food-, health-, and care-related decisions for themselves and their families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Participation in VCs carries important opportunities to expand benefits to women by increasing women&#x02019;s assets, skills, and decision-making power within both the household and the community [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. At the same time, agricultural development, especially related to expansion and formalization of markets, also has the power to inadvertently disempower women, by adding to their time burden and/or reducing their control over income, which could have negative consequences for diet and nutrition outcomes. Empowering women is an integral part of the conceptual design of SELEVER. In particular, SELEVER aims to increase women&#x02019;s income from poultry and improve their decision-making within the household. To this end, SELEVER will engage with female producer groups and savings and loans groups, and improve women&#x02019;s access to saving and credit. SELEVER will, at the same time, engage village leaders and men in gender sensitization.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Main hypotheses and outcome indicators</title><p id="Par50">The SELEVER package is expected to have direct and indirect effects on a range of different target groups (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Summary of hypothesized impact pathways for SELEVER</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th/><th colspan="2">Expected effects</th></tr><tr><th>SELEVER activity</th><th>Target group</th><th>

</p><p id="Par75">The SELEVER intervention is implemented at the commune level as the training, sensitization, and BCC involve commune level stakeholders. During the preparation stage, 60 communes were selected from a pool of 79 communes that were available for scale-up by SELEVER in the targeted regions. The criteria for commune selection included: (1) not included in the SELEVER pilot communes; (2) classified as rural or peri-urban (as classified in the national census); (3) year-round accessibility by road; and (4) for the Hauts-Bassin region communes, proximity to the Boucle de Mouhoun and Centre Ouest regions. The first stage of randomization was aimed at randomizing the 60 communes in the study into two groups (SELEVER and control) and provides the basis for the main trial comparisons (SELEVER &#x02013; Control). Due to the relatively small number of clusters in the study, to ensure balance in the comparison groups the random allocation was undertaken through restricted randomization by modeling selection using a set of commune-level and village-level variables obtained through the national census of 2006.</p><p id="Par76">Following Hayes and Moulton [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], the variables in the restricted randomization were selected on availability and their potential influence on the main study outcomes. The variables in the model included population size, existence of a government center, number of female associations, main agricultural crop, main source of revenue, market presence, health center presence, number of functional boreholes, and number of functional wells. Village level data were also used to generate commune level aggregates for population size, number of health centers, number of boreholes, and market access. Villages that were too small to allow for a subsequent survey sample to be drawn (likely to have less than 15 households with children in the 2&#x02013;4-year age group based on latest DHS demographics) or too large to be considered rural (with a population of over 5000 people or over 95% of the population distribution) were excluded from the list. A program was developed using Stata to randomly allocate communes to two different groups stratifying by region and then select two villages in each commune from the list of available villages. The algorithm then regressed the selection into the treatment group based on the village-level and commune-level covariates. The routine tested 3000 random allocations and selected the permutation that minimized the r<sup>2</sup> statistic for the predicted selection. The second stage of randomization will provide the basis for the WASH sub-study comparisons (SELEVER+/SELEVER &#x02013; Control). The 30 SELEVER village pairs (one pair for each commune) will be randomly assigned to either the SELEVER intervention or SELEVER+, and 15 communes from the control group will also be selected for the sub-study using a similar restricted randomization procedure (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>

</p><p id="Par78">During the baseline survey, a household census will be conducted to identify all the large poultry producers in the community, households with women in the target groups (women aged 15&#x02013;35 years with children in the target age group), and collect other basic household level information necessary for the sample selection. Households will then be randomly selected from the household census for the survey interviews. Large poultry-producing households (e.g. defined as owning a poultry flock of over 20 chickens/fowls) will be oversampled (6/15 households will be large poultry-producing households). This distribution of the sample will enable the construction of comparable samples for the main trial comparisons, also allowing for analysis of direct and indirect effects by including both beneficiary and non-beneficiary households in the survey population.</p><p id="Par79">For the power calculations, we used data from an observational study examining food intake in two of the three regions of interest (Centre-Ouest and Boucle du Mouhoun) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and from the impact evaluation of the Hellen Keller International homestead food production intervention in Burkina Faso [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The power calculations for the primary outcomes for women, children, and households are based on 80% statistical power and alpha value of 0.05 (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). With a random sub-sample of 360 women and children per treatment arm in the detailed biomedical assessment, we can estimate effect sizes for the primary outcomes of about 0.28 z-scores in the MPA for women and children. This effect size is equivalent to about 6 points in MPA, which is approximately half the absolute difference observed between MPAs in the post-harvest and lean seasons in the targeted regions of Burkina Faso [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Considering that dietary assessment is quite time-consuming in terms of both data collection and analysis, and that biomarker status assessment is invasive and quite expensive, it is appropriate to limit assessment of these indicators to the required sub-sample only. The individual PA for a specific nutrient is compiled using the probability approach to compare the usual nutrient intake to the relevant population requirement distribution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Therefore, its average at the population level can be interpreted as the prevalence of adequacy of intake for this specific nutrient. The MPA is an aggregate measure of the adequacy of intake across a range of key nutrients, in this case iron, zinc, and vitamin A. The other primary outcomes (e.g. dietary diversity, household poultry production, and sales) will require a larger sample size to detect a meaningful impact. With the full sample based on 900 households per treatment arm in the main trial (SELEVER &#x02013; Control), we can detect effect sizes ranging from 0.18 z-scores (e.g. household poultry production) to 0.15 z-scores (e.g. household poultry sales). Power estimates for the study&#x02019;s end line survey will be reassessed based on actual levels and intracluster correlations in our survey and estimated typical level of attrition based on similar study designs (set at 5%).</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Data collection and outcome measurement</title><p id="Par80">The evaluation will follow a mixed-methods approach with a panel of repeated measures (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Post baseline, follow-up survey 1 (six months after baseline), will examine the panel for seasonality and short-term changes across the different treatment arms. A process evaluation will be undertaken 18&#x000a0;months after baseline to provide data for minor adjustments to the SELEVER design. Follow-up survey 2 will provide evidence on two-year impacts during the lean season, while end line survey 1 will provide evidence on the impact of SELEVER after three years of implementation. End line survey 2 will provide evidence on sustained effects one year after SELEVER completed implementation. The panel design with repeated measures will also allow studying the intervention effects on the growth and nutritional status of children from birth throughout early childhood.

The survey will include an assessment of women&#x02019;s knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding IYCF and sanitation and hygiene, using a questionnaire and 24-h recall methods previously tested in Burkina Faso [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Other household level data</title><p id="Par86">The household survey will include a range of modules including demographics, consumption/expenditure, and income (gender-disaggregated; total income and income from sale of agricultural production); the consumption/expenditure module will also be used to derive household-level estimates of energy and micronutrient availability at the household level (and adequacy) using adult equivalents.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Methods of analysis</title><sec id="Sec29"><title>Impact evaluation</title><p id="Par87">The analysis will follow the intention-to-treat approach as protocol and as treated, using econometric analysis to control for differences at baseline across treatment arms for all the relevant variables of interest. The randomized study design allows for the identification of causal effects of interventions through comparisons of mean outcomes between the treatment arms. Following Bruhn and McKenzie [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], impact will be assessed for the different treatment arms using both a &#x0201c;difference-in-difference&#x0201d; (DID) estimator and a single difference analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model. In particular, the ANCOVA estimator has been shown to provide more efficient estimates of program impact when auto-correlation of outcomes is low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Depending on the level of clustering of the outcome under analysis, we will employ multi-level regression models that account for the hierarchical nature of the data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The multi-level models, also known as mixed-effects models, will use both fixed effects (as covariates) and random effects at commune, village, and household levels to take into account the effect of clustering at these levels and to estimate unbiased standard errors. Robustness checks for the treatment estimates will also include controlling for the balancing variables used in the randomization. The intent-to-treat analysis strategy we will employ will include attempts to follow up all individuals in the randomized study, as well as the development of a main analysis that is valid under a stated plausible assumption on missing data, and sensitivity analysis to explore the effects of departures from the assumption underlying the main analysis. Data management, data cleaning, and statistical analyses will be conducted using Stata (Statacorp, USA). The statistical significance for all tests will be set at 5% in case of testing main effects or 10% in case of interactions. All statistical tests will be two-sided.</p></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Market analysis</title><p id="Par88">As far as we are aware, there are no published studies on poultry market integration in Burkina Faso. If poultry markets are not fully integrated, the additional supply and demand from the project could influence prices. There are several levels of markets along the poultry VC. These markets are linked by complex relations and involve several actors: producers, traders, aggregators, retailers, and consumers. The markets where the program may have an impact are the <italic>foire</italic> (village, or group of villages, level market), the aggregator market, and the retailer markets. <italic>Foire</italic> markets, in particular, are markets where foods are purchased from local farmers by traders and where local consumers make their purchases. If the project has an impact on prices it is likely to occur at this level. As part of the program monitoring activities, price data will be collected monthly in the local <italic>foire</italic> next to each of the selected villages. We will work with partners, including agriculture extension workers operating in the selected communes to use mobile phones to collect price monthly from relevant markets and from a sub-set of poultry producers.</p></sec><sec id="Sec31"><title>Process evaluation and costs</title><p id="Par89">The theory-driven process evaluation will combine qualitative and quantitative data to provide evidence of changes along the agriculture&#x02013;nutrition pathways for the complex intervention package. We will work closely with the SELEVER implementers to identify indicators for the key processes and program impact pathways for the intervention. During the process evaluation and at end line, cost data will also be collected retrospectively following an ingredients approach using a semi-structured questionnaire. The questionnaire will also cover both cash and in-kind contributions and will be used to estimate both financial and economic costs. Financial costs capture actual expenditures in terms of program implementation on an annual basis. Economic costs included the opportunity costs of community members involved in the SELEVER service provision. Opportunity costs of volunteer community members will be calculated using local pay scales. Process and output data covering the adequacy of the service delivery will be collected using standardized data collection forms. Cost estimates will be combined with output data to provide estimates of cost-efficiency metrics and with impact estimates (at end line) to provide estimates of cost-outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec32"><title>Qualitative research</title><p id="Par90">The qualitative research component will focus on understanding the impact pathways and the barriers related to social and cultural norms, especially for women. Gender-disaggregated individual interviews and focus group discussions will provide important information concerning how families make decisions about the production, sale, consumption, or purchase of nutritious foods. Qualitative interviews will also focus explicitly on women&#x02019;s commitments and time allocation, on trade-offs they face, such as earning additional income vs. addressing domestic duties and caring for children, and whether engagement in these activities have the potential to improve women&#x02019;s bargaining power.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec33"><title>Data storage and security</title><p id="Par91">Data cleaning will include the creation of anonymized versions of the datasets. The data files in Stata format containing identifying information from the baseline survey will be held only on the principal investigators&#x02019; (PI) computers, for use in tracking and identifying baseline survey respondents during the follow-up surveys. The data will be processed, cleaned, and documented by the research assistants and program manager in Burkina Faso, working under close guidance of the PIs. The documentation will include questionnaires, data variable labels, value labels, and a codebook, to assist in the analysis. Field notes from the fieldwork coordinator and team leaders describing the data collection process will also be stored. Within 12&#x000a0;months of the end of the project, the anonymized data will be made publicly available on the IFPRI web site. Users of the data will be asked to provide information on how the data are expected to be used, to help IFPRI track use of the data for research purposes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec34"><title>Dissemination of results</title><p id="Par92">Our communications plan is focused on three objectives:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par93">

Agricultural production is just one element within a food chain that affects the access, acceptability, and nutritional quality of foods for consumers. The VC framework, encompassing every activity from food production to consumption, can provide a useful lens to examine the role of interventions in food systems to improve diets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. However, the focus to date in VC analysis has been on economic returns, overlooking the opportunities to influence diets more broadly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Moreover, VC activities may increase risks of exposure to toxins that may be harmful to health and nutrition. Poultry livestock rearing in low-income settings, in particular, may pose a risk to young children through a hypothesized oral&#x02013;fecal pathway leading to EED [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However, there is a paucity of evidence on the effectiveness and additional risks involved in interventions in VCs to improve diets. To our knowledge, this study is the first to rigorously examine from a food systems perspective, the simultaneous impact of scaling-up nutrition-specific and nutrition-sensitive interventions through a livestock VC intervention platform, across nutrition, health, and agriculture domains. The findings of this evaluation will provide important evidence to support the design of market-based nutrition-sensitive interventions.</p><sec id="Sec38"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par99">Enrolment began in March 2017 (see SPIRIT figure [Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>] and checklist [Additional file&#x02009;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>]).<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>SPIRIT figure</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2017_2156_Fig4_HTML" id="MO4"/></fig>
