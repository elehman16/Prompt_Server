Patients in both groups received 20 minutes of treatment, thrice a week and 4 weeks in total. Effects of treatment were assessed mainly by changes in the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC VA 3.1) before, in the middle (after 2 weeks), at the end (after 4 weeks) and 4 weeks after the end of the treatment. Completion time of 50 yards walking was evaluated as a secondary measurement.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>There was no statistical difference in WOMAC pain, stiffness and function scores between the two groups before treatment. Patients in the real treatment group experienced greater improvement in WOMAC pain, stiffness and function scores in the middle, at the end and 4 weeks after the end of the treatment (p<underline>&#x0003c;</underline>0.05). No significant difference was shown in completion time of 50 yards walking before, in the middle and at the end of the treatment. Patients in the real treatment group were superior to those in the sham group in completion time of 50 yards&#x02019; walking 4 weeks after the treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Compared with sham treatment, 10.6&#x003bc;m laser moxibustion can significantly reduce pain and improve knee joint stiffness and function in patients with knee osteoarthritis.</p></sec></body></article>
