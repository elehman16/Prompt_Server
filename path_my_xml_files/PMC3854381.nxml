group therapy (ARGT) with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in the
treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD), generalized anxiety disorder
(GAD), and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Subjects were sequentially
recruited and randomized into two groups, one receiving ARGT (n = 63) and the
other SSRIs (n = 66) for 8 weeks. Fifty-four ARGT outpatients with MDD (n = 19),
GAD (n = 19), and OCD (n = 16) and 55 SSRI outpatients with MDD (n = 19), GAD (n
= 19), and OCD (n = 17) completed the study. All subjects were assessed using
the Hamilton Depression Scale and Hamilton Anxiety Scale before and after
treatment. The 10-item Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale was employed only
for OCD subjects. Plasma levels of serotonin, norepinephrine, cortisol, and
adrenocorticotropic hormone were also measured at baseline and 8 weeks after
completion of treatment. Symptom scores were significantly reduced (P &#x0003c;
0.001) in both the ARGT and SSRI groups at the end of treatment. However, MDD,
GAD and OCD patients in the ARGT group had significantly lower plasma cortisol
concentrations compared to baseline (P &#x0003c; 0.05), whereas MDD and OCD patients
receiving SSRIs showed significantly increased plasma levels of serotonin (P
&#x0003c; 0.05). These findings suggest that ARGT may modulate plasma cortisol levels
and affect the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis as opposed to SSRIs, which
may up-regulate plasma serotonin levels via a different pathway to produce an
overall improvement in the clinical condition of the patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Attribution retraining group therapy</kwd><kwd>Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors</kwd><kwd>Neurobiological effects</kwd><kwd>Serotonin</kwd><kwd>Cortisol</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="0"/><table-count count="4"/><ref-count count="36"/><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Currently the two main treatments in clinical practice for major depression disorder
(MDD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)
are antidepressants and psychotherapy. Many studies examining the use of
antidepressants in the treatment of psychiatric disorders focus on the underlying
neurobiological mechanisms, whereas most studies on psychotherapy focus on its
effects on symptom management and psychosocial function. Few studies have examined
the role of psychotherapy in improving neurobiological function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B01">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B03">3</xref>,
with even fewer studies comparing the difference between the two therapies in terms
of their effects on neurobiological function.</p><p>Over the past few decades a number of studies have demonstrated the crucial role of
neurotransmitters and neuroendocrine function in the psychopathology of MDD, GAD,
and OCD. The central hypothesis for the pathophysiology of these depressive
disorders is primarily related to serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) and
norepinephrine (NE). Abnormal 5-HT and NE levels have been reported in the three
diseases. Most studies have indicated lower 5-HT levels for MDD patients and higher
NE levels for GAD patients than for normal subjects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B04">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B06">6</xref>. The neuroendocrine
dysfunction hypothesis mainly refers to abnormal hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal
(HPA) axis function, such as abnormal activities of adrenocorticotropic hormone
(ACTH) and cortisol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B07">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>.</p><p>Several studies imply that successful psychotherapy may have a positive effect on
neurotransmitters, including 5-HT, NE and their metabolites, for normal subjects and
MDD patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B02">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B03">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>. However, the outcomes of these studies are
varied and some studies have been conducted on small patient samples. Data from some
studies support the hypothesis that plasma 5-HT levels increase after psychotherapy
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B03">3</xref> while others have not shown a
significant change in plasma 5-HT levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>.
One study reported that NE metabolite levels decrease after psychotherapy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>. Another study demonstrated a nonsignificant
decrease in plasma NE metabolite levels during treatment in cognitive therapy
responders compared with non-responders <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>
while other studies have suggested that psychotherapy may affect blood levels of
ACTH and cortisol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B01">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>. Abelson et al.
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref> found that cognitive/emotional
manipulation can substantially modulate the responses of the HPA axis to
pharmacological activation in normal subjects and in patients with panic disorder
via a pharmacological activation paradigm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>.</p><p>Attribution retraining (AR) is one of a number of therapeutic approaches classified
as cognitive behavior therapy. AR is designed to change maladaptive attribution
styles to more adaptive ones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>. Individuals
attribute behaviors and events to various reasons. Hence the attributional style of
an individual is defined as that individual's characteristic way of explaining the
cause of events. The basis of AR therapy centers around the modification of this
thought process with the ultimate aim of modifying behavior <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>. AR is based on
the integrated hopelessness/self-esteem theory proposed by the groups of Abramson,
Seligman, and Metalsky <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>. In AR interventions, therapists usually
target the patient's automatic thoughts, which are rooted in unhealthy attributions,
and challenge these pessimistic attributions by offering alternative explanations
based on healthy attributions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>. Hence AR
can be applied to a variety of psychological problems with maladaptive attributional
style <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>. A number of studies have
demonstrated a link between maladaptive attributional style and various
psychological problems, including depression and anxiety <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>.</p><p>In China, Wang and Zhang <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref> developed a group form of AR named AR group
therapy (ARGT), which is based on the integrated hopelessness/self-esteem theory and
AR. ARGT is a form of group cognitive-behavior therapy that treats clients'
maladjusted emotions and behaviors by changing their rationalization strategy
explanations for problems and symptoms. They examined ARGT in Chinese college
graduates with depression and outpatients with MDD, GAD, and OCD and successfully
demonstrated that ARGT was able to reduce their symptoms and alter their maladaptive
attributional styles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>.</p><p>The purpose of the present study was 1) to characterize the neurobiological effects
of ARGT on plasma levels of 5-HT, NE, ACTH, and cortisol for outpatients with MDD,
GAD, and OCD, and 2) to compare the neurobiological effects obtained with ARGT to
those obtained with 5-serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) antidepressants.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><p>The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Nanjing Brain Hospital, Nanjing
Medical University (China) before patient recruitment, and written informed consent
was obtained from all participants at the time of recruitment.</p><sec><title>Participants</title><p>Subjects aged 16&#x0223c;50 years who met the DSM-IV criteria for MDD, GAD or OCD based
on the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I disorders, patient
edition (SCID-I/P, Version 2.0, China) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>
were recruited among outpatients presenting to a mental health hospital in
Nanjing, China, between October 2007 and September 2008. The diagnostic
interview was held by two attending psychiatrists with more than 6 years of
clinical experience.</p><p>The inclusion criteria for the study were: 1) MDD group: scores &#x02265;18 on the
24-item version of the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD); 2) GAD
group: scores &#x02265;14 on the 14-item version of the Hamilton Rating Scale for
Anxiety (HAMA); 3) OCD group: scores &#x02265;16 on the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive
Scale (Y-BOCS); 4) willing to participate in the study for 8 weeks.</p><p>The exclusion criteria were: 1) neurological disease, 2) serious physical illness
(e.g., heart, lung, liver, kidney, or blood system disease), 3) drug or alcohol
abuse, 4) psychotic symptoms, 5) personality disorders, 6) pregnancy, 7) suicide
risk, 8) treatment with antidepressants or other psychotropic medications within
6 months prior to the beginning of the trial; 9) more than a single target
diagnosis (e.g., comorbidity for MDD and GAD or MDD and OCD).</p><p>The criteria for exclusion during the investigation were: 1) failure to attend
psychotherapy or non-adherence to antidepressant medication for 2 consecutive
weeks, 2) serious adverse drug reaction events or requirement of antidepressant
withdrawal because of adverse drug reactions, 3) need for other treatment
outside the study because of attempted suicide, poor feeding, etc., 4) serious
physical illness or infectious diseases during the course of the study, 5)
pregnancy, 6) significant changes in life, 7) incorrect diagnosis, 8) withdrawal
of informed consent.</p></sec><sec><title>Study design</title><p>A clinical trial study design was used. Outpatients with MDD, GAD, and OCD were
sequentially allocated to the ARGT group or SSRI treatment group by a block
randomization with a block size of 8 (since there are 8 patients in each ARGT
subgroup). Response to treatment was assessed with symptomatology scales in both
groups. Blood samples were also collected before and after intervention to
measure plasma levels of 5-HT, NE, cortisol, and ACTH.</p></sec><sec><title>Assessments</title><p>Measurements were made at the time of recruitment (baseline; week 0) and at the
final week of the treatment course (post-test; week 8). The 24-item version of
HAMD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref> was used to measure the severity
of depressive symptoms in MDD subjects. The internal consistency of the Chinese
version of HAMD is 0.88&#x0223c;0.99 and the authenticity coefficient (reflecting the
severity of clinical symptoms) is 0.92. The 14-item HAMA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref> was used to measure the severity of anxiety symptoms for
GAD subjects. The inter-rater reliability of the Chinese version of HAMA is 0.93
and the authenticity coefficient is 0.92. The 10-item Y-BOCS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref> was employed to assess the severity of
obsessions and compulsions in OCD subjects. The inter-rater reliability
(intraclass correlation coefficient) is &#x02265;0.82, the test-retest reliability
(intraclass correlation coefficient) is &#x02265;0.82 and the Cronbach alpha reliability
is 0.75. The scale has good content validity and construct validity.</p><p>Assessment was blind. All the informant-report questionnaires were administered
by two psychologists who did not know the aim of this study. All staff
administering the assessments received specific professional training for each
assessment for more than one month prior to the beginning of the study. The
Spearman correlation coefficients (HAMD, HAMA, Y-BOCS) between the two
psychologists were 0.832, 0.835, and 0.931.</p><p>Demographic data (age, gender, marital status, educational level, family
environment) and clinical characteristics (onset of the disease, stressful life
events, course of the disease, psychotropic medication history, psychotherapy
history, family history, and physical illness history) were also collected at
the time of recruitment.</p></sec><sec><title>Blood samples</title><p>Subjects were required to observe a tyramine-free diet (no alcohol, cheese or
coffee) for 48&#x02005;h before phlebotomy and to keep a record of all food eaten during
this period. After an overnight fast, blood samples were drawn between 8 and 10
o'clock in the morning at the time of recruitment (baseline) and by the 8th week
(post-test). Blood samples (5&#x02005;mL) were drawn into tubes containing heparin
anticoagulant and centrifuged at 4200&#x02005;rpm for 4&#x02005;min at 4&#x000b0;C after a 30-min
interval. The supernatant plasma was extracted and stored frozen at -80&#x000b0;C until
the time of assay.</p><p>Plasma levels of 5-HT, NE, cortisol, and ACTH were determined by a
radioimmunoassay method. Commercially available kits were used to quantify
plasma hormone levels. 5-HT and NE kits (Biosource Europe SA, Belgium) had
standard ranges of 15&#x0223c;2500 and 4.5&#x0223c;450&#x02005;&#x000b5;g/L, sensitivity of 0.3 and 0.0375&#x02005;&#x000b5;g/L,
and a coefficient of variation (CV) &#x0003c;5 and &#x0003c;10%, respectively. The ACTH
kit (Diagnostic System Laboratories, USA) had a standard range of
6.0&#x0223c;407.4&#x02005;ng/L, sensitivity of 1.3&#x02005;ng/L and CV &#x0003c;10%. The cortisol kit
(Beijing Chemclin Biotech Co., Ltd., China) had a standard range of 10&#x0223c;500&#x02005;&#x000b5;g/L,
sensitivity of 2&#x02005;&#x000b5;g/L and CV &#x0003c;10%. Absolute levels were quantitated with a
gamma radioimmunoassay counter (GC-911, Science and Technology Development Co.,
China) by professional and technical staff at the Neuropsychiatric Institute,
Nanjing Brain Hospital affiliated to Nanjing Medical University.</p></sec><sec><title>Treatment</title><p>Patients randomized to the ARGT group received ARGT once a week according to a
previously validated protocol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>. Antidepressant medications were
withheld for the duration of the ARGT. Each ARGT session lasted 2&#x02005;h and was held
weekly over an 8-week course. Participants were allocated to different ARGT
subgroups according to the sequence of enrolment in the study, with 7&#x0223c;8 patients
allocated to each ARGT subgroup. Within a structured therapy protocol, each
session focused on a specific topic as follows: 1) knowing and supporting each
other; 2) the meaning of symptoms and the effects of cognitive factors; 3) the
role of attribution in psychology; 4) participants' upbringing and basic
beliefs; 5) rebuilding attributional styles and practicing new behaviors; 6)
consolidating new attribution styles and behaviors; 7) self-esteem, personality
and attributions for positive events; 8) sharing future plans and discussing
leaving.</p><p>ARGT was performed by two therapists for each subgroup. One was the main
therapist who coordinated all subgroups. The other was the co-therapist. There
were different co-therapists for different subgroups. All therapists had
completed training in psychotherapy. The main therapist was a clinical and
counseling psychologist registered in the Professional Organizations and
Individual Practitioners in Clinical and Counseling Psychology, Chinese
Psychological Society. The co-therapists were blind to the purpose of the study.
Additionally there were 4 supervisors who were registered psychologist
supervisors from the Chinese Psychological Society who supervised the treatment
sessions. Each ARGT subgroup participated in a session supervised by one of the
psychologist supervisors at least once every two weeks. To maintain treatment
integrity, the co-therapist also recorded each step of the intervention plan and
reported to the main therapist prior to the subsequent session.</p><p>Patients in the SSRI group received standard clinical treatment with one of the
following SSRI antidepressants: fluoxetine (Prozac), paroxetine (Paxil),
sertraline (Zoloft), citalopram (Celexa), and fluvoxamine (Luvox), and did not
receive psychotherapy during the study period. The choice of antidepressant
depended on the symptoms and tolerance. Medications were titrated from the
minimum effective doses upwards. The initial doses were: 10&#x02005;mg fluoxetine, 10&#x02005;mg
paroxetine, 50&#x02005;mg sertraline, 10&#x02005;mg citalopram, and 50&#x02005;mg fluvoxamine. The
therapeutic doses were: 20&#x02005;mg fluoxetine, 20&#x0223c;40&#x02005;mg paroxetine, 50&#x0223c;150&#x02005;mg
sertraline, 20&#x0223c;40&#x02005;mg citalopram, and 50&#x0223c;150&#x02005;mg fluvoxamine. Medication was
increased from the initial dose to the therapeutic dose within 2 weeks. After
treatment, the average maximum doses were: 20.00 &#x000b1; 0.00&#x02005;mg fluoxetine, 24.67 &#x000b1;
6.40&#x02005;mg paroxetine, 87.5 &#x000b1; 29.46&#x02005;mg sertraline, 26.36 &#x000b1; 6.74&#x02005;mg citalopram, and
91.07 &#x000b1; 23.22&#x02005;mg fluvoxamine. The antidepressant treatment was monitored by two
clinicians experienced in the use of SSRI.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data analyses were performed using the Statistical Package for the Social
Sciences (SPSS) for Windows, version 15.0 (SPSS Inc., USA). Baseline data were
compared between groups in relation to demographic variables using the
&#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test for nominal variables and the independent-samples
<italic>t</italic>-test for continuous variables (after the
Kolmogorov-Smirnov Z-test and the Levene test). All scores of the continuous
variables were tested by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov Z-test for normal distribution
and by the Levene test for homogeneity of variance. Nonparametric tests were
used for non-normal and non-homogeneous variance data. Normal and homogeneous
variance data were tested for significance using the <italic>t</italic>-test.
The paired-samples <italic>t</italic>-test was used to compare the scores at
baseline and at week 8 in each group. The independent-samples
<italic>t</italic>-test was used to compare reduction scores between two groups.
All tests were two-tailed, with the level of significance set at 0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Baseline data</title><p>A total of 129 eligible outpatients with MDD (n = 45), GAD (n = 45), and OCD (n =

</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The present study demonstrates that ARGT and SSRI can both improve depressive
symptoms in MDD patients, anxious symptoms in GAD patients, and obsessive-compulsive
symptoms in OCD patients, in agreement with previously published studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>. Additionally, this study
also explored the neurobiological effects of the two therapies and obtained three
major results.</p><p>The first was that plasma cortisol levels dropped significantly in patients with MDD,
GAD, and OCD after ARGT. Plasma ACTH levels also dropped but the reduction in plasma
ACTH levels did not reach statistical significance, especially in GAD and OCD
patients. This outcome supports findings of others on cognitive-behavioral stress
management <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B01">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B02">2</xref>, which also reported a reduction in blood cortisol concentration
following psychotherapy. However, this is in contrast to a recent study from our
group on patients with GAD who received Chinese Taoist Psychotherapy for 6 months,
which revealed an overall improvement in anxiety symptoms and a significant decrease
in ACTH levels, side by side with a significant increase in plasma cortisol levels
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>. Neuroendocrine dysfunction is found
in MDD, GAD and OCD patients. The different change directions between the present
study and our previous one were possibly the result of different baseline cortisol
and ACTH levels.</p><p>Plasma cortisol and ACTH levels may reflect HPA axis function. Some studies support
HPA axis over-activation with a concurrent increase in plasma cortisol and ACTH in
patients with MDD, GAD, or OCD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B08">8</xref>. On the
other hand, other studies propose a decrease in plasma cortisol concentrations,
arguing that the functions of the HPA axis differ during different phases, subtypes
and severity levels of the disease process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B09">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>. Hence, dysfunction of the HPA axis is a more precise
psychopathological description of the three diseases. Because of the possible
different conditions at baseline, the effects of successful psychotherapy mentioned
above on plasma cortisol concentrations may increase as well as decrease. These
fluctuating changes may reflect the trend towards normalization of an abnormal HPA
axis. Furthermore, the hormones of the HPA axis, such as cortisol and ACTH, are
regarded as stress hormones due to their close association with stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>. Psychotherapy is designed to adjust
maladaptive attributional styles and other cognitive and behavioral responses to
stressful events using various psychological skills. Current results concerning the
possible role of psychotherapy in the normalization of HPA axis hormones are
evidence that biological function may be improved with the improvement of
psychological function by psychotherapy.</p><p>The second major finding of the present study was that there were no significant
changes in cortisol or ACTH levels after SSRI between baseline and the 8th week and
compared to psychotherapy. This outcome agrees with another study, which found that
overactivity of the HPA axis may be one factor associated with a slower response to
fluoxetine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>. The authors of the cited study
hypothesized that SSRI antidepressants may not be the best therapy for MDD patients
with overactivity of the HPA axis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>. On the
contrary, there have also been data suggesting that antidepressants reduce cortisol
levels by decreasing the sensitivity of glucocorticoid receptors (GR) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>. Hern&#x000e1;ndez et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref> reported a significant reduction in cortisol levels in MDD
patients after administration of SSRI for 52 weeks, although only a partial
re-establishment of HPA axis function was achieved. It can be seen that the effect
of SSRI on the HPA axis is unstable, a fact possibly due to the specific
physiological targets of SSRI.</p><p>The third major finding of the present study was that plasma 5-HT levels
significantly increased in MDD, GAD, and OCD patients after SSRI treatment. SSRI can
block the reuptake of 5-HT by presynaptic neurons, allowing more 5-HT to be
available to the postsynaptic receptor. The patients receiving ARGT in this study
did not show significant changes in plasma 5-HT or NE levels, suggesting different
mechanisms of action between the two systems.</p><p>There are complex functional interactions between 5-HT and the HPA axis. Cortisol can
modulate 5-HT function in the central nervous system by activating GR and the
mineralocorticoid receptor (MR). Elevated 5-HT may also influence the HPA axis
indirectly via the increase in cortisol self-inhibition resulting in an overall
reduction of cortisol levels. Conversely, normalization of the HPA axis may
influence 5-HT function indirectly by adjusting the antagonism between GR and MR,
and regulate cortisol levels further by self-inhibition as well. Therefore,
treatments, which target the 5-HT system or HPA axis may result in an integrated
effect on the HPA axis and 5-HT systems. This phenomenon could account for the
reduction in plasma cortisol levels observed in the SSRI group side by side with an
increase in plasma 5-HT levels in the patients treated with ARGT even though the
differences did not reach statistical significance.</p><p>This study has some shortcomings. Firstly, plasma neurotransmitter concentrations may
not accurately reflect the actual neurotransmitter levels in the central nervous
system. Secondly, this study only evaluated changes over a short period of time. The
levels of neurotransmitters in the cerebrospinal fluid may provide a more accurate
measure of the absolute neurotransmitter levels but this approach is invasive and
not without a significant risk to the patient. The long-term neurobiological effect
of psychotherapy on MDD, GAD and OCD patients is also difficult to measure due to
the dropout problem in outpatient clinics.</p><p>On the whole, this study demonstrated that ARGT and SSRI can both improve symptoms in
MDD, GAD, and OCD patients. Plasma cortisol levels dropped significantly in patients
with MDD, GAD, and OCD patients after ARGT. Plasma 5-HT levels increased
significantly in MDD, GAD, and OCD patients after SSRI treatment. This finding
suggests that ARGT may modulate plasma cortisol levels and affect the HPA axis, as
opposed to SSRIs, which may up-regulate plasma 5-HT levels via a different pathway
to produce an overall improvement in the clinical condition of the patients.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Research supported by the National Science and Technology Support Projects, China
