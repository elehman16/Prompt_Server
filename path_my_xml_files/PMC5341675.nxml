These sympathoadrenergic responses reported by King <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] are also seen during extubation, recovery, and emergence from anesthesia. The exact mechanism responsible for these hemodynamic responses is unknown. It may be associated with the release of catecholamines occurring during this stressful period. Acute hemodynamic changes during extubation can lead to life-threatening arrhythmias, myocardial ischemia, acute cardiac failure, pulmonary edema, or cerebrovascular hemorrhage in susceptible individuals.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] These responses, in turn, can be catastrophic in several situations such as ocular surgeries, intracranial surgeries, cardiac surgeries, and aneurysmal surgeries.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Respiratory complications after tracheal extubation are three times more common than during intubation and induction of anesthesia.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Bucking and coughing frequently occur during extubation and may lead to negative pressure pulmonary edema with an abrupt increase in intraocular pressure, intrathoracic pressure, intraabdominal pressure, and intracranial pressure. This can increase the mortality and morbidity of the patient.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Early recovery and extubation in neurosurgical patients is the preferred method when the preoperative state of consciousness is relatively normal, and surgery does not involve critical brain areas or extensive manipulation.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Several techniques have been applied to alleviate the hemodynamic responses and coughing during emergence and extubation. They include deep extubation, administration of intravenous (IV) narcotics, dexmedetomidine, calcium channel blockers, and administration of lidocaine.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Lignocaine is one of the commonly used drugs by IV,[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] endotracheal tube (ETT) cuff,[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] or laryngotracheal route[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] to blunt the circulatory and airway reflexes during emergence from general anesthesia. IV lignocaine may lead to prolonged emergence from general anesthesia.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] The mechanism of action of lignocaine may be due to either the local anesthetizing action of the airway mucosa or systemic absorption of the drug. Lignocaine may be rapidly absorbed into the circulation from the tracheobronchial tree with its blood concentrations being the same as after an IV injection.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>Jee and Park[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] compared the effects of administration of intratracheal 2% lidocaine with IV lidocaine and placebo to study airway and circulatory reflexes in patients undergoing surgery using general anesthesia for elective minor orthopedic surgery, plastic superficial surgery, or lower abdominal surgery. Based on this study, the aim of this study was to investigate whether intratracheal lignocaine in a dose of 1.5 mg/kg given before skull pin removal attenuates cough and hemodynamic response in neurosurgical patients during emergency and compared this with IV and placebo groups.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ethodology</sc></title><p>This prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted in a tertiary care hospital in Northern India from August 2014 to August 2016.</p><p>After obtaining approval from the Institutional Review Board for conducting the study and informed consent, sixty patients of either sex with physical status American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) Classes I and II aged 18&#x02013;70 years, scheduled to undergo elective craniotomies in supine position were included in the study. Patients with a history of sore throat, upper respiratory tract infection, laryngeal or tracheal pathology, asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, allergy to local anesthetics, and patients on beta-blocker therapy were excluded from the study.</p><p>The patients were randomly divided into three groups (by a computer-generated randomized table) of twenty patients with Group 1 receiving IV lignocaine and intratracheal placebo (IV group), Group 2 receiving intratracheal lignocaine and IV placebo (I/T group), and Group 3 receiving IV and intratracheal placebo (placebo group). 1.5 mg/kg of 2% preservative-free lignocaine (Xylocard) was administered to each group either IV or intratracheally, and the placebo group received the same volume of normal saline. The same volume of drug and placebo (0.9% NaCl) was prepared and coded in two 10 ml syringes by the attending anesthesiologist, keeping the observer blind to the type of drug administered. The decoding of the drugs was done at the end of completion of the study. During the preoperative visit, all the patients were clinically evaluated, assessed, and investigated, and the study protocol was explained to all the patients and written informed consent taken from them. No patient received any premedication. The anesthesia protocol was standardized for all the patients. Anesthesia was induced with fentanyl 2 &#x000b5;g/kg and propofol 2 mg/kg. Vecuronium 0.15 mg/kg body weight was administered to facilitate endotracheal intubation. After endotracheal intubation, anesthesia was maintained with a mixture of oxygen and nitrous oxide with isoflurane. Vecuronium was administered to maintain two twitches on the neuromuscular monitor. Isoflurane was administered at 1 minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) till dural closure. At dural closure, sevoflurane was introduced to maintain 1 MAC and discontinued at the removal of pins or last surgical skin suture applied. Intraoperative monitoring included electrocardiogram, HR, pulse oximetry, capnography, invasive arterial blood pressure, central venous pressure, nasopharyngeal temperature, inhalational agent concentration, and neuromuscular monitoring using BeneView T5 monitor on Mindray Wato Ex-65 workstation. At skull pin insertion, 50 &#x000b5;g of injection fentanyl was administered to blunt the hemodynamic responses to skull pin insertion. Repeated doses of injection fentanyl 1 &#x000b5;g/kg were administered every hourly till dural closure. IV paracetamol (1 g) was given to all the patients at the end of the surgery.</p><p>The study drug was prepared and administered at the time of wound dressing by the attending anesthesiologist. After administration of the study drug, its effect on airway and circulatory reflexes was noted in terms of episodes of cough and hemodynamic parameters in each group till 5 min after extubation.</p><p>The residual neuromuscular block was reversed using neostigmine 0.05 mg/kg and glycopyrrolate 0.02 mg/kg. Patients were extubated when they were breathing spontaneously and were obeying commands. The tolerance to ETT was monitored, and number of episodes of cough was recorded during emergence and at the time of extubation. Smoothness of extubation was graded as follows:</p><p>

</p><p>Hemodynamic parameters such as HR and blood pressure (systolic, diastolic, mean arterial pressure) were recorded at baseline, after administration of study drug, before extubation, and every minute after extubation for 5 min. The total time taken for extubation was taken as the time from the discontinuation of sevoflurane till the time of endotracheal extubation.</p><p>The data collected intraoperatively were summarized and compiled. It was entered into a spreadsheet (Microsoft Excel) and then exported to data editor of SPSS version 20.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA). The sample size was based on a similar previous study by Daelim <italic>et al</italic>[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] in which three groups of patients were studied who received intratracheal lignocaine, IV lignocaine, and placebo. With an alpha error of 5%, beta error of 20%, and power of 80%, the sample size for each group was calculated to twenty.

However, we could not measure serum lignocaine levels due to lack of facilities in our hospital.</p><p>There was no statistically significant difference in HR (<italic>P</italic> values) between Group 1 (receiving IV lignocaine) and Group 2 (receiving intratracheal lignocaine).

A similar study was conducted by Savitha <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Ninety patients were randomly divided into three groups to receive placebo (saline), 0.5 mg/kg injection lignocaine or 1 mg/kg lignocaine. The authors found that lignocaine 1 mg/kg was superior to 0.5 mg/kg in attenuating the hemodynamic responses to tracheal extubation. Their study results were comparable to our results in terms of attenuation of circulatory and airway responses. Khezri <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] did a similar study dividing the patients into two groups to receive either 2% injection lignocaine 1.5 mg/kg IV or intratracheally. Heart rate, systolic blood pressure, bucking, and number of coughs were continuously monitored for 30 min postextubation. The results in their study were comparable to our study results in terms of both circulatory and airway responses in the postextubation period. Similarly, Bidwai <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] observed the HR and blood pressure response to endotracheal extubation with IV lignocaine 1 mg/kg and control group (saline).

The attenuation of hemodynamic responses could have been a result of local mucosal anesthetic effect and systemic absorption of lignocaine.</p><p>Coughing during emergence from general anesthesia is a physiological response to tracheal extubation which can result in potentially dangerous patient movements, hypertension, tachycardia or other arrhythmias, myocardial ischemia, surgical bleeding, bronchospasm, increasing intraocular and intracranial pressures, especially in neurosurgical patients, which is very detrimental.</p><p>Smoothness of extubation was graded in terms of grading of cough as follows:</p><p>

They divided the patients into three groups and were given 1 mg/kg of IV 2% lignocaine (Group 1), placebo (Group 2), 1 mg/kg of 2% lignocaine instilled down the ETT (Group 3) before skull pin removal. They found that 2% lignocaine instilled through endotracheal route was not superior to IV route or placebo in attenuating cough and extubation response when given 20&#x02013;30 min before extubation. The results were contrary to our study results in terms of hemodynamic response attenuation probably because the dose of drug used in our study was higher (1.5 mg/kg) and mean time interval between the study drug and extubation was lesser (21 min).</p><p>Jee and Park[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] did a study and found that lignocaine instilled through the ETT suppresses cough if given approximately 5 min before extubation and found it to be superior to IV injection.

Nagrale <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] prospectively studied ninety patients and evaluated hemodynamic effects and cough suppression of IV propofol, lignocaine, and esmolol administered 2 min before extubation. There was a significant decrease in hemodynamic response and about 90% cough suppression in the group receiving IV lignocaine 2 min before extubation. This was attributed to the fact that IV lignocaine deepens the plane of anesthesia and thus suppresses the hemodynamic and airway reflexes at extubation.</p><p>Plasma concentrations of lignocaine required to suppress the cough reflex under general anesthesia are reported to be between 2.3 and 3 &#x000b5;g/ml during the emergence.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] The plasma concentration of lignocaine from endotracheal administration may be same or less than that from IV lignocaine.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] The lignocaine administered through the ETT may spread distally due to the action of gravity in the supine position. However, the presence of wet mucous blanket might facilitate the diffusion of lignocaine proximally in the tracheobronchial tree. This may anesthetize the mucosa and block the receptors involved in the airway reflexes. Therefore, reflex suppression of endotracheal lignocaine may probably be attributable to its mucosa anesthetizing effect.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSION</sc></title><p>We concluded from our study that both IV and intratracheal lignocaine 1.5 mg/kg are effective in attenuation of hemodynamic response if given within 20 min from skull pin removal to extubation when compared with the placebo. The attenuation of hemodynamic responses at the time of extubation was comparable between the patients receiving IV lignocaine and intratracheal placebo and patients receiving intratracheal lignocaine and IV placebo. Cough suppression through intratracheal route was comparable with IV route.
