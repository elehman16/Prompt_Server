Their most important application is the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Our objective is to analyze cost per responder of TNF-&#x003b1; inhibitors for RA from the German Statutory Health Insurance funds' perspective. We aim to conduct the analysis based on randomized comparative effectiveness studies of the relevant treatments for the German setting. For inclusion of effectiveness studies, we require results in terms of response rates as defined by European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) or American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria. We identify conventional triple therapy as the relevant comparator. We calculate cost per responder based on German direct medical costs. Direct clinical comparisons could be identified for both etanercept and infliximab compared to triple therapy. For infliximab, cost per responder was 216,392 euros for ACR50 and 432,784 euros for ACR70 responses. For etanercept, cost per ACR70 responder was 321,527 euros. Cost was lower for response defined by EULAR criteria, but data was only available for infliximab. Cost per responder is overestimated by 40&#x000a0;% due to inclusion of taxes and mandatory rebates in German drugs' list prices. Our analysis shows specific requirements for cost-effectiveness analysis in Germany. Cost per responder for TNF-&#x003b1; treatment in the German setting is more than double the cost estimated in a similar analysis for the USA, which measured against placebo. The difference in results shows the critical role of the correct comparator for a specific setting.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Cost-effectiveness</kwd><kwd>Etanercept</kwd><kwd>Germany</kwd><kwd>Infliximab</kwd><kwd>Rheumatoid arthritis</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Clinical Rheumatology 2013</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is the most common chronic inflammatory systemic disease. Its socioeconomic relevance is characterized by a high prevalence in industrialized countries combined with the productivity loss associated with the disease.</p><p>The goal of the therapy is early disease control and induction of sustained remission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Patients can be treated with conventional or biological disease-modifying therapies. Methotrexate (MTX) is the most commonly used disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD). Tumor necrosis factor &#x003b1; (TNF-&#x003b1;) inhibitors are the most popular biological agents approved for the treatment of RA after failure of conventional DMARDs. Biological agents incur higher direct treatment costs.</p><p>Germany is the most populous country in the European Union and its most important market for biological agents. The main payer in the German health care system is the Statutory Health Insurance (SHI). The SHI funds provide insurance to 90&#x000a0;% of the German population. The SHI funds have more than 70 million members. With more than EUR 1 billion expenditure, TNF-&#x003b1; inhibitors ranked highest in the SHI funds' pharmaceutical expenditure in 2011 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>For the German population, overall prevalence of inflammatory arthritis is estimated at 3.4&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The prevalence of RA is 1&#x000a0;%, i.e., approximately 800,000 people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The percentage of patients treated with TNF-&#x003b1; inhibitors has been rising from 2&#x000a0;% in 2000 to 20&#x000a0;% in 2008 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In 2011, adalimumab, etanercept, and infliximab were the most popular biological agents by sales.</p><p>High prevalence and high pharmaceutical spending motivate a cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) of TNF-&#x003b1; therapies for the German setting. We aim to conduct a CEA considering the special requirements for health economic analysis in Germany.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><p>We choose cost per responder as the most suitable measure of cost-effectiveness for the German setting. Quality-adjusted life years are not used in the German context due to legal concerns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Cost-effectiveness in terms of cost per function score unit is problematic as the commonly used Health Assessment Questionnaire is not cardinally scaled.</p><p>We conduct our analysis from the SHI funds' point of view. Reporting from the main payer's perspective has been suggested by the Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care for CEA in Germany.</p><p>For inclusion of effectiveness studies, we require results in terms of response rates as defined either by European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) criteria (EULAR good response, EULAR moderate to good response) or by American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria (ACR50 response, ACR70 response).</p><p>First-line biological therapy is not reimbursed by the German SHI funds unless individual reasons imply poor response or toxicity of DMARDs. German guidelines require treatment for at least 6&#x000a0;months and failure of at least two DMARDs including MTX before the initiation of biological therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>While MTX monotherapy is chosen as the comparator in most CEAs of biological treatments, this would not reflect German clinical practice. By definition, patients who are eligible for MTX monotherapy would not be treated with TNF-&#x003b1; inhibitors in the German setting. Only MTX refractory patients would be treated with biological therapies. The German Federal Joint Committee's (Gemeinsamer Bundesausschuss (GBA)) requirements include identification of the correct comparator for the specific patient population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>If MTX monotherapy is not effective, DMARD combination therapy can be initiated as an alternative to biological treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. DMARD combination therapy has been shown to be more effective than MTX monotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. We identify conventional triple therapy as the most clinically relevant alternative to biological therapy as shown by 2011 SHI prescription data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The combination of MTX, sulfasalazine, and hydroxychloroquine has been shown to be more effective than MTX monotherapy by O'Dell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. It is the most suitable comparator to reflect a treatment alternative to biological therapy in German clinical practice.</p><p>Therefore, we search PubMed for clinical comparisons of TNF-&#x003b1; therapy and triple therapy. We conduct our analysis based on direct clinical comparisons. Direct clinical comparisons offer a higher level of evidence than indirect comparisons according to GBA's requirements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>All clinical trials are included if they feature at least one study arm with biological therapy and one arm with triple therapy. Initial treatment needs to be MTX monotherapy or failure of MTX monotherapy has to be an inclusion criterion for patients.</p><p>We search PubMed for the search terms &#x0201c;adalimumab, sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, and rheumatoid arthritis.&#x0201d; We screen all hits as well as their references for further studies. The search produced 17 English language results. One clinical trial could be identified which compared adalimumab to triple therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Application of the same search terms to infliximab and etanercept produced 40 and 34 hits. Screening of the hits resulted in the identification of three clinical trials for infliximab [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and two clinical trials for etanercept [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p>We calculate cost per responder based on German direct medical costs for the treatments applied in the trials. Cost calculations include 2013 drug costs and treatment costs (administration and monitoring cost and screening cost before initiation of the therapy) according to German SHI payment conditions.</p><p>We report the sensitivity to the national specifics of German drug pricing. Contrary to other countries, Germany applies the full 19&#x000a0;% value-added tax (VAT) to all pharmaceuticals.

While providing a valuable comparison of four different treatment approaches, the active study design ultimately leads to infliximab combination therapy in all study arms.

The costs estimated in our study are more than twice as high. This difference can mainly be attributed to the use of triple therapy rather than placebo as a comparator for the German setting.

However, both trials show little evidence for any significant clinical advantage of TNF-&#x003b1; therapy after 2&#x000a0;years.

The huge cost difference between biological and conventional therapy does not significantly change for either switch.</p><p>The data discovered to directly base CEA upon is very limited. The Swefot trial only includes 258 patients over the course of 2&#x000a0;years. The setup of the trial does not fully reflect German guidelines.
