Vaccination is the most cost-effective public health intervention to combat influenza (<xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">Petrie et al., 2015</xref>). Current seasonal influenza vaccines induce humoral immune responses to external glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). However, the error-prone nature of influenza virus replication leads to the accumulation of drift mutations within antigenic sites, allowing escape from serological immunity conferred by prior infection or vaccination. The requirement to make advance predictions of which viruses to include in vaccines for the forthcoming influenza season can result in vaccine mismatches (<xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">Pebody et al., 2015</xref>). Additionally, responses to seasonal influenza vaccines are subtype-specific, only inducing immune responses to strains included in the vaccine and offer no heterosubtypic protection against novel subtype reassortants or emerging viruses like H5N1 or H7N9 avian influenza. This is particularly critical in the elderly in whom vaccine efficacy is lower, increasing their risk for severe illness (<xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">Jefferson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">Haq and McElhaney, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">Rivetti et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p id="p0020">A protective role for CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells in humans has been demonstrated in experimental challenge studies (<xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">McMichael et al., 1983b</xref>; <xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">Wilkinson et al., 2012</xref>). More recently, in community cohort studies, T-cells have been shown to be associated with reduced viral shedding and limited severity of illness. Sridhar et al. identified a correlation between the frequency of IFN-&#x003b3;<sup>+</sup>/IL-2<sup>&#x02212;</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells and protection against symptomatic influenza (<xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">Sridhar et al., 2013</xref>). Hayward and colleagues found that higher frequencies of nucleoprotein (NP)-specific IFN-&#x003b3;<sup>+</sup> CD3<sup>+</sup> T-cells were associated with a lower risk of symptomatic, PCR-confirmed influenza infection and viral shedding (<xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">Hayward et al., 2015</xref>). As the induction of such cross-protective T-cells following vaccination with current influenza vaccines is limited (<xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">He et al., 2006</xref>), alternative vaccination approaches to induce T-cell responses against highly conserved internal influenza antigens capable of protecting against antigenically distinct viruses with pandemic potential, such as NP or matrix protein 1 (M1), are needed. This would particularly benefit high-risk populations, such as the elderly, in whom there is a high risk of severe disease.</p><p id="p0025">We have developed viral vectored vaccines, using the replication-deficient chimpanzee adenovirus ChAdOx1 and the attenuated orthopoxvirus modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) expressing NP and M1 influenza virus antigens (ChAdOx1 NP&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;M1 and MVA-NP&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;M1) as one approach to combat this problem.

However, whether a vaccination strategy using a heterologous combination of these two viral vectors is synergistic in inducing higher magnitude, improved quality and longer durability of T-cell responses, as seen with other antigens, is not known. We conducted this randomized, open-label, Phase I clinical trial to assess the safety and cellular immunogenicity of prime/boost vaccination regimes employing MVA-NP&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;M1 and ChAdOx1 NP&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;M1 in young and older adults.</p></sec><sec id="s0010"><label>2</label><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s0015"><label>2.1</label><title>ChAdOx1 NP&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;M1 and MVA-NP&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;M1 Vaccines</title><p id="p0030">Both vaccines have been described previously and consist of viral vectors expressing NP and M1 antigens from influenza A virus (H3N2, A/Panama/2007/99) as a single fusion protein (<xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">Antrobus et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">Berthoud et al., 2011</xref>).

Where a response at a time point was missing, we took the mean of imputed values from twenty imputed datasets (generated using multiple imputation by chained equations and the predictive mean matching method). Secondary analyses were performed using a t-test on the available data only, to compare between pre-specific groups. No formal adjustment for multiple significance testing was carried out for this phase I study, but note that all other analyses were exploratory. Primary, secondary and post-hoc immunogenicity analyses were carried out using STATA 14.2: StataCorp. 2015. <italic>Stata Statistical Software: Release 14</italic>.

To compare ELISpot responses between selected, matched time-points in a group, a Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test was used. To compare baseline IFN-&#x003b3; ELISpot responses between G1-6 a 1-way ANOVA was used with Kruskal-Wallis test and Dunn's multiple comparison test. Area under the curve (AUC) analysis can be used in immunological studies as a tool to estimate overall vaccine immunogenicity and durability (<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">Heldens et al., 2002</xref>). AUC values for identical time periods post-vaccination were calculated per individual for each time point. AUC is presented as AUC/total number of days post-vaccination when comparing between groups which did not have match volunteer visits. In order to calculate AUC values when timepoints were missing due to absent volunteer visits or ELISpot plate failures, the average of the group at that time-point was used for analysis.

This study evaluated the combination of these two vaccines to identify the optimal order and interval in the vaccination schedule. We tested MVA-NP&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;M1 followed by ChAdOx1 NP&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;M1 (MVA/ChAdOx1) and ChAdOx1 NP&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;M1 followed by MVA-NP&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;M1 (ChAdOx1/MVA) with an interval of either 8&#x000a0;weeks or 52&#x000a0;weeks between the two vaccines. Both vaccination combinations were well-tolerated in young and older adults with mild to moderate injection site pain the most commonly reported adverse event. In young adults with pre-existing influenza-specific T-cell responses, all four vaccination regimes increased and maintained T-cell responses above pre-vaccination frequencies for 18&#x000a0;months. However, the MVA/ChAdOx1 regimen with either an 8&#x000a0;week or 52&#x000a0;week interval maintained T-cell responses at higher levels compared to the ChAdOx1/MVA regimen.</p><p id="p0140">The long-term maintenance of T-cell responses is a critical component of successful vaccination strategies as T-cell responses are thought to be short lived following natural infection. A prospective study of T-cell responses after a symptomatic infection found rapid decline in responses within a few months after infection (<xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">Hillaire et al., 2011</xref>) while others have suggested that responses have a half-life of 2&#x02013;3&#x000a0;years (<xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">McMichael et al., 1983a</xref>). More recent work has reported detection of T-cell responses many years after an infection, although it is unclear whether this was due to natural boosting in the intervening period.(<xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">van de Sandt et al., 2015</xref>) More importantly, detectable T-cell responses following natural infection are not necessarily present at protective levels. Although memory responses can still be boosted following natural infection, cohort and challenge studies indicate that there is a correlation between higher T-cell responses and reduction in symptom severity, viral shedding and illness duration (<xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">Hayward et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">McMichael et al., 1983b</xref>; <xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">Sridhar et al., 2013</xref>). This study shows that after vaccination with viral vectors, T-cell responses are maintained at high levels for a long period of time, raising the possibility that T cell mediated protection after vaccination could last for considerably longer than T-cell mediated protection after natural infection. This report is the longest follow-up of T-cell responses following influenza vaccination. Our study demonstrates long-term maintenance (up to 18&#x000a0;months) of T-cell responses with a heterologous viral vector vaccine strategy. Moreover, even a single dose of either viral vector vaccine in young adults can maintain T-cells above pre-vaccination frequencies for up to 1&#x000a0;year post-vaccination.</p><p id="p0145">This long-term maintenance is critical in older adults in whom reducing severity of illness is paramount, particularly as seasonal influenza vaccines have reduced efficacy (<xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">McElhaney et al., 2016</xref>). In contrast to young adults, a single dose of ChAdOx1 did not durably maintain T-cell responses above pre-vaccination levels in older adults. However, the two-dose heterologous combination schedule of ChAdOx1/MVA boosted pre-existing T-cells and maintained these T-cells at significantly higher frequencies compared to pre-vaccination levels up to 8&#x000a0;months after the first vaccination. Longer follow-up of these responses is warranted. It is notable that reactogenicity after the ChAdOx1/MVA vaccination regimen was significantly lower in older adults compared to younger adults.</p><p id="p0150">Our study showed no significant difference in generation and maintenance of immune responses between vaccination schedules with an 8&#x000a0;week or 52&#x000a0;week interval between doses. The two dose heterologous regimen administered 1&#x000a0;year apart is of particular interest to integrate into existing vaccination schedules and our data paves a development pathway for viral vectored vaccines administered in conjunction with existing strain-specific annual influenza vaccination. However, in older adults a shorter interval is likely to be needed as T-cell responses decline to pre-vaccination levels within 8&#x000a0;weeks after a single dose of ChAdOx1. In an outbreak scenario or pandemic setting, rapid induction of protective immune responses following vaccination is valuable to limit the severity and spread of the outbreak.</p><p id="p0155">Studies conducted during the evolution of the H1N1 pandemic in 2009 have demonstrated that cross-reactive T-cells can provide protection against symptomatic pandemic influenza in the absence of cross-protective antibodies. We show that both ChAdOx1 NP&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;M1 and MVA-NP&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;M1 rapidly boost pre-existing cross-reactive T-cells to significantly higher levels within 1&#x02013;3&#x000a0;weeks after vaccination. These responses remain above pre-existing frequencies up to 1&#x000a0;year post-vaccination, although MVA-NP&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;M1 induces significantly higher responses than ChAdOx1 NP&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;M1. A single dose of MVA-NP&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;M1, potentially stockpiled, is an attractive option for rapid development of T-cell immunity in the event of a pandemic to mitigate the severity of the pandemic, particularly in high-risk populations.</p><p id="p0160">One limitation of this study is the lack of data on protective efficacy. However, in a previous experimental challenge study demonstrating reduced viral shedding and symptoms with a single dose of MVA-NP&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;M1, median IFN-&#x003b3; ELISpot values of protected volunteers was 627 SFU/10<sup>6</sup> PBMC. In comparison, long-term IFN-&#x003b3; ELISpot responses at 18&#x000a0;months and peak responses were higher than this value (at least 1.25-fold greater) for all two dose vaccination regimes. Based on these data, we would speculate that a two-dose regimen is likely to confer higher levels of protection in a challenge study or efficacy trial. Further work is necessary to determine efficacy of these vaccines and the durability of protection. A key question in the potential deployment of our broadly protective T-cell vaccines is their use with existing inactivated and live vaccines, particularly in the elderly. Our study does not address this issue although further work is underway to assess strategies combining these viral vector vaccines with existing influenza vaccines (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="ctgov:NCT03300362" id="ir0015">NCT03300362</ext-link>).</p><p id="p0165">In conclusion, we have demonstrated that vaccines which stimulate T-cell responses against conserved antigens generate robust and durable immune responses that could confer broad and potentially long-lasting protection against influenza virus. This has the potential to profoundly impact both seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccination strategies, especially in high risk groups such as older adults.</p></sec><sec id="s0085"><title>Role of the Funding Source</title><p id="p0170">The funder had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report.
