Two statistical analyzing methods, intention to treat (ITT) and per protocol (PP), were applied to assess the main curative indexes, including Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD), Self-rating depression scale (SDS), and Rating Scale for Side Effects (SERS) scores.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Numbers of patients dropping out during the treatment were 3, 5, and 1 in the three groups. Patients in the two acupuncture groups got a more remarkable reduction in HAMD and SDS scores compared with those in the medicine only group, especially in the somatic factor scores. No significant differences were found between the two acupuncture groups (p&#x0003e;0.05). SERS scores in the 2<sup>nd</sup>, 4<sup>th</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> week showed significant differences among the three groups (p&#x0003c;0.05).</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The findings indicate that the combination of acupuncture and antidepressant is superior to the antidepressant treatment only in term of improving patients&#x02019; depressive symptoms, especially somatic symptoms. Acupuncture combined with antidepressant medicine can substantially improve patients&#x02019; subjective feelings for quality of life. Acupuncture plays an important role in reducing the side effects caused by the antidepressant medicine and enhancing its curative effects.</p></sec></body></article>
