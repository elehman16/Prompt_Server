The baseline survey including 447 staff (response rate: 93.1%) was conducted in 2012, and followed by a six-month workplace social capital intervention, including team building courses for directors of community health centers, voluntarily public services, group psychological consultation, and outdoor training. The follow-up survey in July 2013 was responded to by 390 staff members (response rate: 86.9%).

According to the view of Putnam, social capital refers to those features of social relationships that facilitate collective action for mutual benefit <xref rid="pone.0114924-Putnam1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. In the workplace, social capital (WSC) refers to shared attitudes and values among members of a work unit, reciprocity, mutual respect and trust between workmates, collective action and participation in the networks at work, and trust in and trustworthiness of a supervisor <xref rid="pone.0114924-Oksanen1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Although previous studies have traditionally focused on social capital in residential or geographical areas, it has now been suggested that social capital at work should also be targeted <xref rid="pone.0114924-Baum1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0114924-Kawachi1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Workplace may constitute an important social unit because many people spend more working hours together than elsewhere, and workplace is a significant source of social relations. Compared to geographic units, workplaces might more appropriately capture the important social interactions and networks that constitute the core elements of social capital <xref rid="pone.0114924-Sundquist1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. A recent review summarized the present extension of social capital research into workplaces <xref rid="pone.0114924-Oksanen2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. WSC is contextually patterned, and workplace demographic and employment patterns as well as the size of the work unit are important in understanding variations in WSC <xref rid="pone.0114924-Oksanen3" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0114924-Ferrie1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. In a cohort of Finnish public sector employees, lower WSC was associated with the onset of depression <xref rid="pone.0114924-Kouvonen1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, poorer health of employees <xref rid="pone.0114924-Oksanen1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, higher risk of co-occurrence of multiple lifestyle risk factors <xref rid="pone.0114924-Vaananen1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> and higher mortality <xref rid="pone.0114924-Oksanen4" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Another group in Japan found that company-level mistrust was associated with higher likelihood of smoking and poor health among Japanese employees <xref rid="pone.0114924-Suzuki1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0114924-Suzuki2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, and individual perceptions of mistrust and lack of reciprocity at work had adverse effects on self-rated health among Japanese workers <xref rid="pone.0114924-Suzuki2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Recent studies in China also showed that higher individual-level WSC was associated with a lower likelihood of smoking among Chinese male employees <xref rid="pone.0114924-Gao1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, and WSC was positively associated with self-reported health and mental health <xref rid="pone.0114924-Gao2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Some researchers demonstrated that WSC represents a significant predictor of job satisfaction of those working in the field of patient care <xref rid="pone.0114924-Ommen1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0114924-Huang1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Sometimes, WSC is also called organizational social capital (OSC). In a study focusing on Chinese universities and enterprises, OSC was associated with organizational commitment, and inversely associated with turnover intention <xref rid="pone.0114924-Ma1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>.</p><p>WSC could play an important role in human resource management and performance improvement among working populations. Concern about turnover of medical staff is rising in a number of countries. While numerous factors have been linked to their turnover intention, job satisfaction and organizational commitment are regarded as the major risk factors <xref rid="pone.0114924-Hayes1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0114924-Simon1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Therefore, improving job satisfaction and organizational commitment are important management strategies of human resources for health institutions. Ling et al. put forward five types of organizational commitment among Chinese working population: affective, normative, ideal, economic and choice <xref rid="pone.0114924-Ling1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. They analyzed determinants of these types, and found such organizational or workplace factors as trust toward the leaders, organizational support, the maintenance behavior of the leader, the perceived dependability of the organization, employee's satisfaction towards colleagues, and the morale of employee's belonging organization. In fact, several of these factors can be integrated into the theoretical framework of WSC.</p><p>How to attract and retain qualified human resources is a major challenge in the recent years, for governments at all levels in China to develop an effective and efficient community health services, especially after a great deal of money has been invested in the infrastructure of community health services. A survey in Beijing in 2009 showed that 36.9% of community health staff had turnover intentions <xref rid="pone.0114924-BeijingYouthDaily1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. A review <xref rid="pone.0114924-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref> indicated that main influencing factors of job satisfaction included income level, work environment, facility management level and occupation development. In the new health reform of China, strengthening community health services is a key point. Community health workers in China are bearing a great deal of job pressures while receiving poor salary and welfare, which may exacerbate low job satisfaction and high turnover rate. It has been suggested that fostering social capital among workers might increase organizational commitment and decrease turnover <xref rid="pone.0114924-Potts1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. However, only a limited number of empirical intervention studies have sought to foster social capital in community settings. A cluster randomized intervention study in rural South Africa found higher levels of structural and cognitive social capital in the intervention group than the comparison group <xref rid="pone.0114924-Pronyk1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. In Japan, the Taketoyo Project aims at promoting social interaction among community-dwelling older adults in several communities <xref rid="pone.0114924-Murayama1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Murayama et al. argued that observed increase of social support and participation in the Project improved health <xref rid="pone.0114924-Murayama1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. However, it is not known how to increase social capital in the workplace. Therefore, we aimed to examine whether WSC will be improved after we implemented a WSC intervention in community health centers (CHCs) in China.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>The Institutional Review Board (IRB) of School of Public Health in Shandong University of China approved the study.

Jinan, the Capital city in Shandong province, is one of the Chinese cities which initiated community health services very early. By the end of 2012, there were 60 CHCs in five urban districts. Based on power calculations referring to the pilot test of this intervention program, at least 20 centers (10 intervention centers and 10 control centers) were needed. According to the geographical distribution, willingness in participation, and facility characteristics, we selected 20 middle-size centers (the number of employees ranged from 13 to 56, and in 75% of the centers it was between 15 and 32; 2 from Licheng, 4 from Lixia, 2 from Huaiyin, 6 from Tianqiao and 6 from Shizhong) to participate in this study.

One was the team leadership training activity, which was a one-day team building courses for CHC directors; the other three non-leadership activities for CHC staff included self-organizing voluntarily public services for disadvantaged community residents, a half-day group psychological consultation and one-day outdoor experiential trainings. The directors in intervention centers were asked to join and coordinate all activities. The team building courses including team management and communication skills and practical team leadership experiences were given in January. The trainers included a team management expert, the director of health bureau in one district of Jinan, a psychology expert and an excellent CHC director famous for team building. To improve the sense of group solidarity and communications among staff, each intervention center was asked to self-organize public services for the older adults, the disabled or the poor within their communities during March to April. Two psychology experts supplied half-day consultations for each center during April to May, focusing on team communications and stress management.

It has been shown to be a reliable and valid measure of social capital <xref rid="pone.0114924-Kouvonen2" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. A recent psychometric evaluation in Chinese employees has demonstrated the scale to have high internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha of 0.94) <xref rid="pone.0114924-Gao2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. In our study, the Cronbach's alpha coefficients of total scale, horizontal and vertical subscales were 0.90, 0.85 and 0.87, respectively. The response options were given in a 5-point Likert scale. We computed the WSC total score (ranging from 8 to 40) by summing scores of all the 8 items, and higher score indicated higher social capital. According to the factor analysis results in our study, following the dimensions in previous studies <xref rid="pone.0114924-Oksanen5" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0114924-Lindstrom1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, we divided the eight items into two dimensions: vertical WSC and horizontal WSC (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0114924-t001">table 1</xref>). The vertical dimension is related to employees' relations with their employers and supervisors, while the horizontal dimension captures issues related to bonding and bridging social capital <xref rid="pone.0114924-Lindstrom1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0114924-Engstrom1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, which involves social contacts, cooperation and trust in relation to coworkers. We computed the score of each dimension by summing the scores of all the items in each dimension.

In this study, we focused on the health center level analysis, and analyzed the intervention effects in all baseline and follow-up participants, except those from Weibei Center, leading to a sample of 19 centers, 427 baseline respondents and 377 follow-up respondents. Because the director of Weibei center (an intervention center) changed during the intervention, this center was removed from the analysis.

The DID method compares the differences in WSC in pre- and post-intervention periods in the intervention and control groups. The DID approach seeks to measure the effect of the intervention while controlling for unobserved heterogeneity. The method relies on the assumption of a &#x0201c;parallel trend&#x0201d; which states that time trends for the outcome would have been identical in the intervention and the control group in the absence of the intervention. This assumption is strong yet never testable. Moreover, the DID estimates are more reliable when the outcomes are compared just before and just after the intervention, as done in our study, because the parallel trends assumption is more likely to hold over a short time window.</p><p>Stata12.0 software was used to analyze the data with the two-tailed significance level at 0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><p>

The composition of the groups also differed slightly in relation to occupation type (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.07) and income gap group (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.10).</p><table-wrap id="pone-0114924-t002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0114924.t002</object-id><label>Table 2</label><caption><title>Baseline characteristics comparison between the intervention and control CHCs.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone-0114924-t002-2" xlink:href="pone.0114924.t002"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Intervention centers (N&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;10)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Control centers (N&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;10)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">P value</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">

The intervention package was comprised of four parts: the team building course for CHC directors, self-organized volunteer public services for disadvantaged community residents, group psychological consultations and outdoor trainings. Compared to the pre-intervention situation, the total scores of workplace social capital and its vertical and horizontal dimensions were improved after the intervention in Chinese community health centers. The increase was observed in both the individual-level and facility-level workplace social capital, although the facility-level increase was smaller and insignificant. However, high attrition rates limit any causal interpretation of the results. Further studies are needed to test these findings.</p><p>The leader has the responsibility to plan, coordinate, and monitor the group's activities and to convey a vision, inspiring team collaboration <xref rid="pone.0114924-Homans1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Therefore, the involvement and commitment of the community health center directors was essential in the study. If a CHC director did not understand the significance and skills of team leadership and communications, the director would not actively and effectively prioritize and participate in the WSC intervention. So, the reason that we put the team-building course for CHC leaders in the beginning the whole intervention is not only to directly promote the vertical WSC focusing on the vertical relationship between CHC directors and staff, but also to maximize the involvement and commitment of the CHC directors. The increased WSC scores together with decreased variations of the total scale and the vertical dimension in the intervention group gives support that our strategy was necessary and effective. Similarly, a previous study, focusing on improving group cohesion and nursing satisfaction, found that there is a critical role of nurse managers, and they need to be committed to the development of the leadership skills and team cohesiveness <xref rid="pone.0114924-DiMeglio1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. In China, the majority of CHC directors who originally were doctors or nurses lack in formal team management training and skills. Indeed, it has also been emphasized in the United States that additional leadership training opportunities for active and future CHC medical directors are needed <xref rid="pone.0114924-Markuns1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>.</p><p>Among three non-leadership intervention activities focusing on community health staff, human resource management literature has suggested that voluntarily public service programs are not only linked with the enhancement of the organization's public image <xref rid="pone.0114924-Finney1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0114924-Caudron1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, but also associated with higher organizational commitment <xref rid="pone.0114924-Peterson1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. It is plausible that, providing voluntarily public services for disadvantaged community residents by CHC staff members can effectively improve team cohesiveness through establishing a good public image and improving organizational commitment. Psychological consultations were included in the intervention because needs assessment indicated that CHC staff was lack of skills of communicating with colleagues and directors, and dealing with job stress. The positive impact of such psychological consultation activities was found on communication and job satisfaction of nursing staff <xref rid="pone.0114924-Amos1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Outdoor experiential trainings have been extensively used in team building programs <xref rid="pone.0114924-Williams1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. Results from an outdoor training study on team-building for health care in Italy, showed a good levels of satisfaction and knowledge increase, which resulted in better team-building and mutual appreciation <xref rid="pone.0114924-Cominetti1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Limitations</title><p>This study has six main limitations. Firstly, owing to the relatively small sample size, it was impossible to examine the separate effect of each intervention activity on WSC improvement. Secondly, the follow-up survey was conducted right after the 6-month intervention. Thus, we had no data available to observe any long-term effects of the WSC intervention. Thirdly, owing to the small sample sizes of health centers, the randomization may not necessarily have guaranteed the high comparability between the intervention and the control groups. Fourthly, our study had a relatively high proportion of lost to follow-up, which may have introduced attrition bias. Such bias is often assumed to exaggerate the effect. In addition, the attrition rate limits any causal interpretation of the results. Fifth, the baseline WSC scores were higher in the participants lost to follow-up, which may have lead to an overestimation of the facility-level intervention effects especially when concerning the possibility of regression to the mean. Finally, this intervention was implemented in the context of urban CHCs in a single city, and, therefore, the results are not necessarily generalizable to other health facilities (such as hospitals) or rural areas in China or other countries.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The findings of this study suggest that implementing a comprehensive WSC intervention slightly improved WSC in community health centers of urban China. However, the high drop-out rate in the study limits any causal interpretation of the results. Further studies are needed to test these findings, and especially, to examine whether an increase in workplace social capital in community health centers can increase organizational commitment and decrease turnover rates among staff.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0114924.s001"><label>S1 Database</label><caption><p>
