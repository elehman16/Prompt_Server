In osteoarthritis, HA molecular weight (MW) and concentration are decreased. Exogenous HA is available as a viscosupplementation device or a drug for intra-articular use in the treatment of knee osteoarthritis symptoms.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref> Different HA formulations are currently available worldwide: from the reference low MW preparation (range 500 000&#x02013;730 000 Daltons) to more recent intermediate MW (range 800 000&#x02013;2 000 000) and even cross-linked, high MW formulations (average 6 000 000 Daltons) including hylans, non-animal-derived HA and others. However, the efficacy of HA in knee osteoarthritis is still debated, which is reflected in several meta-analyses;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref> the majority suggest small to strong effects of HA,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref> while a minority failed to show a greater effect than placebo.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref> Despite controversies, HA injections are recommended by the current Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) guidelines and previous practice guidelines.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></p><p>While a more recent re-appraisal suggests that there is poor evidence of significant pain relief when the analysis is restricted to high-quality studies,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref> one early meta-analysis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref> suggested that the large heterogeneity between trials might be caused by the possible greater efficacy of high MW HA products. This was recently negated by a meta-analysis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref> in which high MW, cross-linked HA was not significantly superior to lower MW preparations, but had a doubling frequency of post-injection joint flares. In addition, HA was found to have longer-lasting pain control compared with intra-articular corticosteroids, and the majority of trials has been performed with the low MW HA product.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></p><p>Low MW HA thus often remains the preferred option when using HA in knee osteoarthritis. However, there is a paucity of appropriately sized, high-quality trials comparing the effects of different MW preparations, with particular regard to potential differences between low and intermediate MW products, given the worse safety profile of high MW formulations.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref> The present study was therefore designed to compare the effects of the reference low MW HA product (Hyalgan) with a well-characterised intermediate MW preparation (GO-ON) on knee osteoarthritis symptoms.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="s1"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2"><title>Study design</title><p>This was a multicentre (50 orthopaedics and/or rheumatology practice sites in France and Germany), prospective, randomised, double-blind, controlled, parallel-group trial, to compare the efficacy and safety of GO-ON with that of Hyalgan according to a non-inferiority design, with the possibility to shift to superiority following current regulatory guidelines.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>

Ethics approval was provided by the ethics review boards of the coordinating investigators (co-authors FB and JG) in France and Germany (Comit&#x000e9; de Protection des Personnes, AP-HP St-Antoine Hospital, Paris and the ethics committee of Regensburg University, respectively) and by all applicable local ethics committees. After signing an informed consent, patients were screened at least 7 days before randomisation. Patients received 3-weekly injections of the test or comparator preparations (1:1 allocation ratio) and were then seen at weeks 6, 14, 20 and 26, ie, 4, 12, 18 and 24 weeks following the end of treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Patient selection</title><p>Patients of either sex, aged 50&#x02013;80 years, fulfilling the American College of Rheumatology clinical and radiological criteria for knee osteoarthritis,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref> were enrolled if they had a history of symptoms for at least 6 months and insufficient/failed response to analgesics and/or regular non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), or were intolerant to regular NSAID or weak opioids. Current symptoms (after &#x02265;2 days wash-out from NSAID, including topical agents, or 1 day from non-narcotic analgesics) had to include global knee pain of 40 mm or greater on a 100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS), Western Ontario and McMaster Universities (WOMAC) pain subscale score of 25 or greater on the 0&#x02013;100 normalised scale and Lequesne index of 4 or greater. x-Rays (past 12 months) had to show Kellgren and Lawrence stage II or III; radiological evidence of bilateral knee osteoarthritis was accepted if global pain VAS in the contralateral knee was less than 30 mm. Main exclusions were: isolated/predominantly patellofemoral symptomatic osteoarthritis, secondary knee osteoarthritis, symptomatic hip osteoarthritis homolateral to the target knee, inflammatory or other rheumatic diseases, clinical joint effusion, excessive (&#x02265;8&#x000b0;) varus or valgus knee deformity (at physical examination, as confirmed by standard radiograph).</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Treatments, randomisation, allocation concealment and blinding</title><p>GO-ON (Rottapharm|Madaus, Monza, Italy) is a preparation of sodium hyaluronate obtained by fermentation from <italic>Streptococcus equi</italic>, with an intermediate MW (range 800 000&#x02013;1 500 000 Daltons), presented in 2.5 ml prefilled syringes and a concentration of 10 mg/ml. Hyalgan (Fidia Abano Terme, Italy) is sodium hyaluronate derived from rooster combs, with a low MW (range 500 000&#x02013;730 000) and a concentration of 10 mg/ml in 2 ml. Both preparations are recommended for cycles of 3&#x02013;5-weekly injections, but studies have shown no apparent difference between the two regimens with Hyalgan.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref> Treatments were therefore administered intra-articularly, using a lateral femoropatellar approach, at 3-weekly intervals.</p><p>A block randomisation list was computer-generated and electronically associated to a pack list (each pack containing one syringe) by independent groups who maintained their secrecy, having no contacts with the investigators or personnel involved in the conduct of the study. Blocks were balanced at each site and their size was secret to maintain blinding. Randomisation was centralised by an interactive voice response system: the randomisation call assigned the first available position in the randomisation list and therefore the first treatment pack (identified by a unique number) available at the site. Two additional calls were made to obtain the pack number for the second and third injections. Consequently, there was no possibility for the investigator to predict the next treatment assignment, thus ensuring adequate allocation concealment.</p><p>Given the impossibility of obtaining identical presentations of the compared medications, double-blind conditions were obtained by appointing at each site one &#x02018;injector investigator&#x02019; in charge of independently administering the treatments and one &#x02018;assessor investigator&#x02019; performing all assessments blinded to the treatment. Patient blinding was ensured by avoiding visual access to the injection field (eg, by a screen between the patient and his/her knee). Double-blind conditions were successfully achieved for all patients (as noted in the case record form).</p><p>Use of paracetamol up to 4 g per day for four consecutive days was allowed as rescue medication if unbearable pain had not improved after at least 1 h rest. In case of paracetamol failure or contraindication, NSAID could be prescribed for a limited and specified period. Paracetamol or NSAID had to be stopped 24 h or 2 days, respectively, before each assessment visit. Daily consumption of the rescue medication was recorded in a patient diary. No other use of paracetamol or NSAID (excluding aspirin &#x0003c;325 mg/day as antiaggregant) was allowed during the study, similar to opioids, intra-articular or systemic corticosteroids (washout &#x02265;1 and 3 months, respectively), or other HA preparations (washout &#x02265;12 months). Glucosamine sulphate, other glucosamines or other slow-acting drugs for osteoarthritis (eg, chondroitin sulphate, diacerhein or avocado/soybean unsaponifiables) were allowed if at a stable dosage for 3 months or more.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Efficacy outcomes</title><p>The pain subscale of the WOMAC osteoarthritis index (VAS version VA3.1) was the study primary endpoint.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref> Results were normalised on a 0&#x02013;100 scale for each domain, with the total index, physical function and stiffness subscales being assessed as secondary endpoints.</p><p>Other secondary efficacy endpoints included: global knee pain during the past 48 h on a 0&#x02013;100 mm VAS; the Lequesne algofunctional index;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref> the intermittent and constant osteoarthritis pain (ICOAP) index on the 0&#x02013;100 score transformation recommended by the OARSI and outcome measures in rheumatology (OMERACT);<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref> patient global assessment (PGA) on a 100 mm VAS (see supplementary material 2, available online only, for the exact wording of this and the global knee pain VAS question); the proportion of OARSI/OMERACT responders.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref> The proportion of patients achieving the minimum clinically important improvement (MCII) and patient acceptable symptom state (PASS)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>

However, the effect size ranged between 0.21 and 0.26 for the two pain endpoints, representing a small albeit clinically relevant difference. Moreover, there was a significantly higher proportion of OARSI/OMERACT responders after 6 months with GO-ON (73%) than with Hyalgan (58%), ie, a 15% difference that is beyond the accepted minimum clinically relevant improvement. The OARSI/OMERACT criteria require high improvement in pain or function (&#x02265;50% with absolute 0&#x02013;100 change &#x02265;20), or a moderate improvement (&#x02265;20% with &#x02265;10 absolute change) in two out of pain, function or PGA, thus representing a real clinical improvement.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref> Notably, there were significantly more OARSI/OMERACT responders with GO-ON already at the 12-week endpoint, as a prelude to the better carry-over effect that was then fully substantiated after 6 months. Similar proportions and differences in response rates were observed for patients reaching the MCII<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref> on pain and function after 6 months. Moreover, approximately 60% of patients achieved a PASS<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref> with GO-ON, with a significant difference compared with Hyalgan for function, but not for pain. PGA provided a slightly lower degree of improvement, without differences between treatments in absolute terms and as MCII, but with a more than 15% significantly higher proportion of patients reaching PASS with GO-ON.</p><p>A favourable feature of the present trial is that it assessed knee osteoarthritis symptoms through several different measures, providing a complete evaluation. Beside all WOMAC subscales showing a significant advantage for the intermediate MW product, the Lequesne index resulted in an effect size of 0.36 in favour of GO-ON. In addition, pain was also assessed by the new ICOAP index;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref> interestingly, patients had slightly more severe baseline values for &#x02018;intermittent&#x02019; pain, in which the two treatments displayed a similar efficacy, while GO-ON was better than Hyalgan on the slightly less severe &#x02018;constant&#x02019; pain.</p><p>This study also has some limitations. First, there was no placebo comparison. This might have been an issue in the case of results limited to non-inferiority, given the debated efficacy of HA in general.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref> However, as GO-ON was statistically superior to the low MW product and most of the differences were clinically relevant, this might represent sufficient evidence of efficacy. Moreover, ethics review boards might have raised ethical concerns in using intra-articular saline as a placebo when HA injections are now widely prescribed in knee osteoarthritis.</p><p>Second, it was not possible to provide identically appearing test and comparator preparations: the commercial preparations had to be used for obvious reasons, after appropriate packaging, and their effects may also differ given the different injected volumes. On the other hand, double-blind conditions were ensured by nominating at each site an &#x02018;injector&#x02019; and a blinded &#x02018;assessor&#x02019; investigator, while avoiding the patient's visual access to the injection field. Despite these difficulties, which are standard practice in these kind of trials, there was no evidence of broken double-blindness for any patient, reinforced by the strict assurance of adequately concealed random allocation by the interactive voice response system.</p><p>Third, this was a regulatory trial that was therefore industry-funded. Compared with non-industry-funded trials, sponsored studies more often yield results in support of the sponsor's drug.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref> To avoid any potential allegations, an independent steering committee (FB, XC, FR, EM) supervised the trial design and study conduct, participated in blind data review meetings before database lock and provided binding recommendations for data management, finally accessing all results.</p><p>A fourth limitation was that the present trial only compared the intermediate HA product GO-ON with the reference low MW preparation, but not with a higher MW, cross-linked, formulation. While former studies suggested that high MW HA might have greater efficacy,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref> in a recent meta-analysis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref> showing that HA has more prolonged efficacy than intra-articular corticosteroids in knee osteoarthritis, five of the seven considered studies (and the only two high-quality trials) were performed with the low MW HA product used as reference in the present trial. Corticosteroids had a superior analgesic effect over the first 2 weeks, as expected, but from 8 weeks onwards and in particular 6 months after treatment HA had better pain control, with an effect size up to 0.39. Another meta-analysis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref> found no evidence of a clinically relevant benefit of hylan compared with lower MW HA preparations, and a recent trial concluded to the non-inferiority between another intermediate MW HA and hylan G-F20.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref> Actually, a study of single intra-articular hylan injection showed only a modest, albeit significant, benefit versus placebo over 6 months on knee pain, with less OARSI/OMERACT responders than with GO-ON in the present trial and a non-significant difference with placebo.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></p><p>A recent study has shown that low MW (50 000 Daltons) HA may have pro-inflammatory activity on chondrocytes, while intermediate MW preparations were neutral in this model of inflammation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref> It is difficult to transpose in-vitro results to humans and to the actual preparations used here, but this may partly explain the efficacy results of the present study, with good safety at the injection site compared with even higher MW products. Indeed, while in a recent trial hylan showed only a trend towards a higher incidence of local adverse reactions compared with placebo,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref> previous studies suggested a doubling risk of local AE with the high MW HA preparation compared with lower MW products,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref> which may be due to peptide contaminants, formaldehyde, or crystal-induced inflammation. In the present study, GO-ON and Hyalgan were equally well tolerated at the injection site, although numerically more local reactions occurred with Hyalgan than with GO-ON, therefore showing a very good safety of the latter.</p><p>In conclusion, this trial shows that the intermediate MW HA preparation GO-ON is effective on knee osteoarthritis symptoms over 6 months after a 3-weekly injection course, and may be more effective than the reference low MW formulation. Further studies are warranted to elucidate the mechanism of this possible superiority and more pronounced carry-over effect and to test whether this selected HA preparation has a prominent therapeutic profile compared with other HA products.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors wish to thank all the clinical investigators who took part in the conduct of this trial and provided and cared for study patients.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding:</bold> This was a trial conducted for regulatory purposes and therefore received full financial support from the sponsor Rottapharm|Madaus.
