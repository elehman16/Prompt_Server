It is estimated that 0.7% of women 65 years or older will suffer a hip fracture during their lifetime, and demographic trends predict that the demand for care will double in the next 40 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. A total of 4-8% of these patients will die during hospitalization, and fewer than 25% will regain mobility and preserve autonomy at hospital discharge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Socioeconomic burden associated to HF is enormous (40.000 euros (57.000 US dollars)) per patient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Anemia is the one of the most frequent complications of HF; around one third to one half of patients will require red-cell pack(s) (RCP) transfusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. RCP transfusion has been the classical choice in treating severe anemia of these patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Nevertheless, as already stated, the increasing incidence of HF in this population has also raised the need for this valuable and scarce resource. Additionally, RCP transfusions are not without complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In very old and often fragile patients, these effects may involve excess morbidity and mortality, making it necessary to develop blood-saving strategies (BSS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>The most important factor in the development of anemia is blood loss, but some other mechanisms (renal failure, inflammation, iatrogenic hemodilution) are also implicated, prompting the choice of different therapeutic approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. These rely in three cornerstones: firstly minimizing blood loss in the operating room, secondly rationalizing RCP transfusion protocols, and thirdly enhancing bone-marrow red blood cell production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Although evidence that this last measure saves RCP is weak, an increasing number of works have demonstrated notable reductions in RPC transfusion, nosocomial infections, hospital stay, and even survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Nevertheless, some biases in the nature of said studies could partly explain some of the obtained results.</p><p>All these previous studies were performed using 300 to 600 mg of intravenous iron sucrose administered in a period ranging from 2 to 6 days. Ferric carboxymaltose (FC) has considerable advantages over iron sucrose because it allows doses of 1 g in a single session, equivalent to 1000 mg of iron sucrose. Moreover, FC also provides an excellent tolerability and safety profile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Therefore, it is very useful in situations where quick replacement is required as is the case of HF. It has been used successfully in iron deficiency-, inflammatory-, and in postpartum anemia, however there are no data on its efficacy in HF.</p><p>Preliminary results of perioperative use of EPO in HF are promising; however, these results suffer from bias because trials were not randomized and/or blinded. On the other hand, all studies were performed with iron sucrose, so that any additional benefit related to FC cannot be extrapolated. Therefore we have promoted and developed a phase III clinical trial (CT) in order to definitively assess the benefit of RCP saving with the use of EPO with/without FC in patients with HF. The main objective of the present CT was to evaluate the efficacy of combined treatment of i.v. ferric carboxymaltose and erythropoietin (EPOFE arm) versus i.v. ferric carboxymaltose (FE arm) versus placebo (placebo arm) in reducing the percentage of patients who receive blood transfusions in the perioperative period of hip fracture intervention.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>This is a multicentric, randomized, controlled, double blinded clinical trial of parallel groups, performed on adult in-hospital patients admitted with an HF.

The core components of monitoring are to ensure patient protection and to validate integrity of the data. Monitoring involves periodic on-site visits by monitors each year for the duration of a study as part of a quality process. Significant findings identified as a result of monitoring are escalated for review by the sponsor who may then be managed as a suspected significant deviation. Risk assessments and evaluations are then conducted. There are circumstances where decisions have to be made with regard to taking remedial actions, which may include notifying regulatory authorities and ethics committees of any significant regulatory and/or GCP requirements. At all times, the safety and rights of subjects are the top priority for the trial sponsor.</p><p>The clinical trial monitor or clinical research associate (CRA) will verify that the data have been faithfully transcribed from the medical records of patients to the CRF, keeping the confidentiality of patients according to Spanish data protection law. If the CRA detected a mismatch between the CRF data and medical history, he/she will open a query with discordant data to be reviewed by the investigator or investigating staff. This query should be corrected by the investigating team.

The investigator will warrant that all the people involved in the study will respect the confidentiality of any information on the subjects of the trial, as well as the protection of their personal character data (according to Spanish Law 15/1999, on Protection of Personal Data, from the 13th of December). The anonymity of the participants in the study will be preserved at all times. Only the main researcher of each center and the coordinator of the study will have access to the personal information of participants.</p><p>The study data will be transcribed onto CRF and only include a code assigned to each patient, to provide a patient identification code. Only investigators, pharmacists and nurses in the study and authorized by government agencies, if necessary, will be able to access the medical records of patients according to Spanish law 15/1999, on Personal Data Protection, from the 13<sup>th </sup>of December. This confidential information will remain the exclusive property of the principal investigator and investigating team, may not be disclosed to others without prior written consent from the investigating coordinator and the other principal investigators and may not be used except for this study.</p><p>The information originated during the course of this trial is also considered confidential and only to be used by investigators in relation to the objectives of the study and its development.</p><p>In all stages of the trial development, patient confidentiality will be guaranteed under current regulations. Once the consent form is signed, a subject code is assigned as detailed in the previous section. This code will be the only possible identification for the patient in the CRF. The CRF consists of AutoCalc paper (original + copy), and will be guarded at all times in a locked place by the researcher responsible for the inclusion of the patient. When the collection of clinical information and follow-up of the subject is finished, the CRA will take the original pages and leave a copy in the custody of the investigator responsible for the inclusion of the patient. Original documents and copies of CRF have to be preserved for at least 10 years from the close-end of the trial. All CRF data on each subject will be turned into a database using SPSS 18.0 version, which is encrypted and stored on external memory devices, in the custody of the CRA and the clinical trial sponsor.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethic, deontological and regulatory considerations</title><p>The Investigator will ensure that this study is conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, ICH Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice and in full conformity with relevant regulations.</p><p>The protocol, informed consent form, participant information sheet and any applicable documents will be submitted to an appropriate Ethics Committee (EC) and Regulatory Authority for written approval.</p><p>All substantial amendments to the original approved documents will also be sent to an appropriate Ethics Committee (EC) and Regulatory Authority for written approval.</p><p>The trial staff will ensure that the participants' anonymity is maintained. The participants will be identified only by a participant ID number on the CRF and any electronic database.

The study will comply with the Data Protection Legislation which requires data to be anonymized as soon as it is mandatory to do so.</p><p>Once it is established that the patient meets the selection criteria for recruitment and before starting treatment, the investigator is responsible for obtaining signed informed consent of patients participating in the study after having provided appropriate information about objectives, methods, anticipated benefits and potential risks. In the event that the patient is unable to read or to give consent, the legal representative must be present during the informed consent process and the legal representative must sign the consent form to attest that the information contained in the form has been explained and understood accurately and, where appropriate, give consent. The investigator must also explain that patients are completely free to refuse to participate in the study or withdraw at any time for any reason.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Preliminary results of perioperative use of EPO with or without intravenous iron in HF are promising [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]; however, these results suffer from bias because trials were not randomized and/or blinded. With the present CT we are trying to definitively demonstrate the efficacy, and if possible the cost-effectiveness of this clinical practice.</p><p>Human recombinant EPO has already demonstrated benefits in cardiac, cancer, orthopedic, and bloodless surgery. With respect to orthopedic surgery, its positive impact is readily apparent in patients undergoing elective procedures associated with substantial blood loss (those with hemoglobin levels &#x0003e; 10 and &#x02264;13 g/dl, whose risk for transfusion is estimated to exceed 10%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery who receive EPO have a nearly six-fold reduction in allogeneic transfusion risk; this benefit extends to elderly patients undergoing major hip or knee reconstruction, and also to more heterogeneous populations of patients needing total joint arthroplasty or major hip or knee surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. These data point towards the hypothesis of similar benefits in the case of HF due to similarities in the diseases, the clinical, anesthetic, and surgical procedures, and postoperative care. Nevertheless, some differences make HF patients a unique population, and results obtained in the previous trials are difficult to extrapolate to patients with HF.</p><p>On the other hand, iron deficiency correction by oral iron intake is always slower than the correction obtained with parenteral formulations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. There are some retrospective studies showing positive results with the use of iron sucrose in preventing RCP transfusions in patients with HF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The authors pointed out that, once injected in vivo, the iron-carbohydrate complexes are metabolized, the iron is released where it then binds transferrin in the plasma, and the redundant carbohydrate moiety is then cleared via the liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. This treatment option increases the erythropoietic effect (4.5-5.5 times that of basal) of intravenous iron, which lasts 7-10 days, after which the iron is sequestered by the reticuloendothelial system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. In addition, the availability of iron sucrose, and iron carboxymaltose, two intravenous iron preparations with much lesser and milder side effects than iron dextran, has renewed the interest in these therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. In this regard, the effectiveness of iron carboxymaltose, which has additional advantages with respect to sucrose, in the correction of anemia after orthopedic surgery, postpartum, as well as in other medical conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease, heart failure, or chronic kidney disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], has prompted us to assess its safety and efficacy in the present trial.</p><p>In conclusion we think that this trial will contribute with evidence about the safety and efficacy of ferric carboxymaltose with or without EPO in preventing RPC transfusions in patients with hip fracture.</p></sec><sec><title>PAHFRAC-01 investigators</title><p>M&#x000e1;ximo Bernabeu-Wittel (1), Mercedes Galv&#x000e1;n Banqueri (1), Maria Dolores Vega Coca (1), Francisco Javier Galindo Oca&#x000f1;a (1), Ricardo Parra Alcaraz (1), Manuel Rinc&#x000f3;n G&#x000f3;mez (1), Mar&#x000ed;a del Val Mart&#x000ed;n Sanz (1), Miguel &#x000c1;ngel Gir&#x000e1;ldez S&#x000e1;nchez (1), Manuel Anaya Rojas (1), Larbi Lezama N&#x000fa;&#x000f1;ez (1), Manuel Ollero-Baturone (1), Javier Bautista Paloma (1), Bernardo Santos Ramos (1), Reyes Aparicio Santos (2), Ricardo Espinosa Calleja (2), Boris Garc&#x000ed;a Ben&#x000ed;tez (2), Abelardo Montero S&#x000e1;ez (3), Alberto Ruiz Cantero (4), Jos&#x000e9; Luis Ruiz Arranz (4), Jos&#x000e9; Murcia Zaragoza (5), Javier Santesmases Ejarque (6), Manuel Jes&#x000fa;s Romero Jim&#x000e9;nez (7), Miguel &#x000c1;ngel P&#x000e9;rez Ramos (7), Miguel &#x000c1;ngel Pascual D&#x000ed;az (7), Mar&#x000ed;a Melero Bascones (8), Teresa Ros Ample (8), Rafael Monte Secades (9), Mar&#x000ed;a Guil Garc&#x000ed;a (10).</p><p>(1) Hospitales Universitarios Virgen del Roc&#x000ed;o, Sevilla (HVR).</p><p>(2) Hospital San Juan de Dios del Aljarafe, Sevilla (SJD).</p><p>(3) Hospital Universitario de Bellvitge, Barcelona (HBV).</p><p>(4) Hospital de la Serran&#x000ed;a, Ronda, M&#x000e1;laga (HSR).</p><p>(5) Hospital de la Vega Baja, Orihuela, Alicante (VBO).</p><p>(6) Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Badalona, Barcelona (HGT).</p><p>(7) Hospital Infanta Elena, Huelva (HIE).</p><p>(8) Hospital General Universitario de Albacete (HUA).</p><p>(9) Complexo Hospitalario Xeral-Calde, Lugo (HXC).</p><p>(10) Hospital Comarcal de la Axarqu&#x000ed;a.
