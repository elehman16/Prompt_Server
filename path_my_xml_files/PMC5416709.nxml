Previous oxytocin studies are male biased and often constrained by task-based inferences. Here, we investigate the impact of oxytocin on resting-state connectivity between subcortical and cortical networks in women. We collected resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data on 26 typically developing women 40&#x02009;min following intranasal oxytocin administration using a double-blind placebo-controlled crossover design. Independent components analysis (ICA) was applied to examine connectivity between networks. An independent analysis of oxytocin receptor (<italic>OXTR</italic>) gene expression in human subcortical and cortical areas was carried out to determine plausibility of direct oxytocin effects on <italic>OXTR</italic>. In women, <italic>OXTR</italic> was highly expressed in striatal and other subcortical regions, but showed modest expression in cortical areas. Oxytocin increased connectivity between corticostriatal circuitry typically involved in reward, emotion, social communication, language and pain processing. This effect was 1.39 standard deviations above the null effect of no difference between oxytocin and placebo. This oxytocin-related effect on corticostriatal connectivity covaried with autistic traits, such that oxytocin-related increase in connectivity was stronger in individuals with higher autistic traits. In sum, oxytocin strengthened corticostriatal connectivity in women, particularly with cortical networks that are involved in social-communicative, motivational and affective processes. This effect may be important for future work on neurological and psychiatric conditions (for example, autism), particularly through highlighting how oxytocin may operate differently for subsets of individuals.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Oxytocin is a neuropeptide hormone involved in sexual intercourse, childbirth and parent&#x02013;infant bonding, affecting reward processing, anxiety and social salience.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref></sup> Oxytocin is not necessarily a &#x02018;pro-social' hormone, as effects are highly context- and person-dependent.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref></sup> Oxytocin has received substantial interest as a potential treatment for psychiatric conditions such as autism spectrum conditions (ASC; henceforth autism),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref></sup> although clinical trials show modest effects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref></sup> Given the marked heterogeneity in autism,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref></sup> it is possible that the benefits of oxytocin may vary substantially between individuals. For example, on average intranasal oxytocin improves eye contact during naturalistic social interaction, but the largest effects occur for individuals who typically make the least amount of eye contact.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref></sup> Thus, in evaluating oxytocin's therapeutic potential, we must move towards a more precise understanding of how its effects may vary across individuals.</p><p>We have theorized that the widespread effects of oxytocin on complex human social behavior may be due to distributed influence at a neural circuit level.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref></sup> Although oxytocin acts directly at a local level via the oxytocin receptor (<italic>OXTR</italic>), it can potentially affect widespread circuit-level dynamics via connections to areas that are densely populated with <italic>OXTR</italic>. One way to test the hypothesis that oxytocin affects circuit-level organization in the human brain is through oxytocin-administration studies within the context of <italic>in-vivo</italic> measurement of intrinsic functional brain organization (that is, connectome or brain network organization) with resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) data. Although there are a number of existing neuroimaging oxytocin-administration studies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref></sup> most have relied on task-based fMRI paradigms and largely focus on males. In the oxytocin literature there is a prominent bias towards males, and one that affects much of neuroscience and medical research.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref></sup> Sex differences in the <italic>OXTR</italic> system are documented,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref></sup> suggesting that findings in males may not generalize to females. Furthermore, task-based fMRI has often shown opposite findings in males and females namely in terms of amygdala activation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref></sup> Because oxytocin is viewed as a potential pharmacotherapy for conditions like autism, and given that sex may have a large moderating roles in drug effectiveness,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref></sup> it is essential to begin examining how oxytocin operates in the female brain. In addition, although there is a strong male bias in autism diagnoses,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref></sup> there is reason to believe that females are strongly underrepresented that may have increased the male-biased understanding of autism.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref></sup> Given the lack of prior literature on oxytocin's network level effects on brain connectivity in women we chose to use a robust data-driven (hypothesis-free) approach to assess potential connectivity differences.</p><p>The majority of studies investigating how oxytocin affects the human brain use task-based fMRI paradigms. Although task-based studies are important for targeting specific psychological processes, examination of oxytocin-related effects may, as a result, be neuroanatomically constrained to specific circuits related to those tasks. Examination of functional connectivity using rsfMRI data allows for task-independent assessment of oxytocin's effect on intrinsic functional brain organization across the entire connectome. Furthermore, the small number of existing rsfMRI oxytocin-administration studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref></sup> use seed-based analyses that do not allow for hypothesis-free examination across the connectome. Thus, a more unconstrained approach could provide novel insights into oxytocin-related effects on connectome organization, especially when little to no prior hypothesis can be derived from existing literature.</p><p>Here, we use independent components analysis (ICA) to examine how connectivity between-circuits (that is, between-component connectivity)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref></sup> differs across oxytocin and placebo. To facilitate our understanding of oxytocin effects on connectivity in the human brain, we analyzed two publicly available post-mortem human brain gene-expression data sets to answer the question of how the oxytocin receptor (<italic>OXTR</italic>) is expressed across a variety of subcortical and cortical areas in the human brain. To date, information on OXTR expression has largely been confined to animal studies and translation from that is problematic.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref></sup> We predicted that oxytocin would have largest impact on connectivity between the densely <italic>OXTR</italic>-populated striatum and cortical circuits. Furthermore, we predicted that impact of oxytocin on connectivity would vary as a function of variation in autistic traits, with larger effects for individuals with higher levels of autistic traits.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref></sup></p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Participants</title><p>All research was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the study had received ethical approval from the NHS Research Ethics Service (NRES Committee East of England&#x02014;Cambridge Central; REC reference number 14/EE/0202). This study was exempt from clinical trials status by the UK Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Agency (MHRA).</p><p>In a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled crossover design, 26 women (age: 23.6&#x000b1;4.6 years, range (21&#x02013;50)) received an oxytocin nasal spray (24 IU, 40.32&#x02009;&#x003bc;g, Syntocinon-spray; Novartis, Switzerland, pump-actuated) in one session and placebo (the same solution except for the active oxytocin) in the other session in a counterbalanced order. After instruction by a trained medical doctor the sprays were self-administered 40&#x02009;min prior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref></sup> to undergoing resting-state fMRI imaging. Participants confirmed no nasal congestion or obstruction on the day of testing. This timing and dosage are by far the most commonly used in oxytocin administration studies to date.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref></sup> Sessions were separated by at least 1 week (to ensure full wash-out from the first administration) when participants were on hormonal contraceptive (19/26). When participants were not on hormonal contraceptive (7/26) both sessions took place in the early follicular phase of the menstrual cycle to ensure similar hormone levels between sessions. Exclusion criteria included pregnancy, smoking, a diagnosis of bipolar, obsessive-compulsive, panic or psychotic disorder, use of any psychoactive medication within 1 year prior to the study, substance dependence, epilepsy and being post-menopausal. These criteria were assessed by self-report and participants' general practitioners were given the full protocol prior to participation and asked to notify the research term if they thought there was any reason for exclusion. More details on the testing procedure and sample are provided in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Information</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>. Briefly, all subject completed the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref></sup> (mean 115.3&#x000b1;13.19), empathy quotient<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref></sup> (mean 55.6&#x000b1;14.53)) and autism quotient<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref></sup> (mean 14.4&#x000b1;7.32) questionnaires prior to the first scanning session. None of the participants had received a formal diagnosis of autism nor did they give any indication that they may have gone undiagnosed. Although we acknowledge no assessment was done to formally rule this out. They were instructed to refrain from alcohol or caffeine on the day of testing and from food and drink 2&#x02009;h prior to testing (except for water).</p><p>To understand whether oxytocin or some other placebo-related effect that explains any drug-related differences in connectivity, we utilized an independent data set of age-matched typical females to ascertain what are the normative baseline between-component connectivity effects. Our logic here is that if normative connectivity looks similar to patterns we see during placebo, then we can reasonably infer that oxytocin is the primary reason for the induced change in connectivity and not due to some placebo-related change and no effect of oxytocin. This independent data set consisted of 50 females whom were slightly older but did not statistically differ in age (mean age 31.6&#x000b1;12.2, Wilcoxon rank-sum test: <italic>W</italic>=764.5, <italic>P</italic>=0.117) collected on the same scanner and which used a similar multi-echo echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence for data collection (see Morris <italic>et al.</italic>, <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref></sup> for full details).</p></sec><sec><title>Image acquisition and pre-processing</title><p>MRI scanning was done on a 3T Siemens MAGNETOM Tim Trio MRI scanner at the Wolfson Brain Imaging Centre in Cambridge, UK.

The BrainSpan atlas covers a number of cortical areas the might provide insights into potential cortical targets of oxytocin expression, whereas the GTEx data set does not have many regionally specific areas of the cortex (only BA9 and BA24) and mostly includes more detailed information on several subcortical brain regions. In these analyses we used all postnatal (birth to 79 years) samples in each data set, stratified by biological sex. <italic>OXTR</italic> was isolated and plots were produced to descriptively indicate expression levels across brain regions.

To examine whether <italic>OXTR</italic> expression levels were significantly elevated in each brain region, we compared expression levels against zero and, as a more conservative test, against another tissue from GTEx, where we would not expect <italic>OXTR</italic> to be expressed (that is, skin).

Cortical regions from the BrainSpan data set also exhibit significant <italic>OXTR</italic> expression (above 0 and when compared to skin; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>), albeit at much more modest levels than some subcortical regions. This modest degree of <italic>OXTR</italic> expression may be particularly relevant given studies that show broad oxytocin-related effects on complex human social behavior, social communication and social cognition that affects distributed cortical regions (for example, superior temporal gyrus, medial prefrontal cortex). However, there is a lack of specificity apparent in <italic>OXTR</italic> expression in cortex, as most regions show similar levels of expression. As a whole, these data indicate that oxytocin could have potent direct effects on <italic>OXTR</italic> within subcortical circuitry, particular areas of the striatum and midbrain, but may also have similar <italic>OXTR</italic>-driven effects to a lesser extent across most cortical areas where <italic>OXTR</italic> expression is modest. Given the lack of specificity within cortex, these data also support an approach for examining oxytocin-related effects on intrinsic functional connectivity that examines all between-networks connections, as all may be susceptible to plausible effects. However, given the enrichment particularly in striatal and midbrain regions, it is likely that oxytocin-related effects on connectivity may particularly affect connections between cortex and the densely <italic>OXTR</italic>-populated striatum and midbrain.

However, within the oxytocin condition, connectivity was substantially elevated above 0 (<italic>t</italic>(24)=6.22, <italic>P</italic>=1.95e&#x02212;6).</p><p>The IC11 component comprised regions in primary auditory cortex, middle and posterior divisions of the insula, superior temporal gyrus, posterior superior temporal sulcus, middle and posterior cingulate cortex, ventromedial prefrontal cortex, amygdala and superior parietal lobe. These brain regions overlap with areas typically considered important in processes such as language, social communication, self-referential and social cognition, pain and emotion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref></sup> NeuroSynth decoding revealed that most of the terms with the highest correlation with IC11 were predominantly terms referring to pain-related, motor-related or language/speech-related processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). The IC21 component was comprised entirely of subcortical regions such as the striatum, basal ganglia, amygdala, thalamus, midbrain and brainstem. These regions, particularly the striatum, midbrain and amygdala, are typically considered highly involved in reward and emotion-related processes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref></sup> This was again confirmed with NeuroSynth decoding showing a predominance of reward, motivation and affective terms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>).</p><p>Next, we examined whether individual differences in autistic traits accounted for variability in oxytocin-related effects on connectivity between these networks in an exploratory analysis. Given prior work suggesting that oxytocin may have its largest effect on individuals who show the most atypical social behavior,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref></sup> we hypothesized that oxytocin may have the largest effects on connectivity in individuals with the highest degree of autistic traits. Here, we found evidence confirming this hypothesis, as oxytocin's effect on between-component connectivity appeared to increase with increased degree of autistic traits: <italic>r</italic>=0.41, one-tailed <italic>P</italic>=0.0351 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we ran further analyses to aid the interpretation of such an effect. One interpretation could be that oxytocin is the primary driver of enhanced connectivity between these components. However, the alternative could be that oxytocin has no effect on connectivity, and that the placebo might somehow induce a decrease in connectivity between these components. To tease apart these different interpretations, we looked to an independent data set of rsfMRI to ascertain what the normative connectivity strength is between these two components. If oxytocin was truly enhancing connectivity between these components, we would predict that connectivity between these components under normative conditions would be similar to those seen under placebo. That is, normative connectivity effects between these components should manifest similarly to placebo and on average show no difference from 0. We identified two components that spatially appeared nearly identical to the component pair we observed an oxytocin effect in; nIC4 and nIC21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2i and j</xref>). Quantitatively confirming this similarity, we find very large correlations between the spatial component maps of the normative and oxytocin/placebo data sets (nIC4-IC11, <italic>r</italic>=0.80; nIC21-IC21, <italic>r</italic>=0.69, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2h</xref>). No other components showed anywhere near such strong correlations (all <italic>r</italic>&#x0003c;0.2). Similar to our placebo condition, this component pair showed connectivity that was not significantly different from zero: <italic>t</italic>(49)=1.23, <italic>P</italic>=0.22 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g</xref>). Furthermore, comparison between normative connectivity and connectivity during placebo revealed no statistical difference (<italic>t</italic>-test with unequal variance assumed and degrees of freedom estimated using Satterthwaite's approximation; <italic>t</italic>(64.6)=&#x02212;1.507, <italic>P</italic>=0.1370). This further clarifies our interpretation that it is indeed the oxytocin condition that drives enhancements in connectivity between these components and that the placebo condition is a good approximation of normative functional connectivity effects within this corticostriatal circuit.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate how oxytocin affects intrinsic functional organization of the human brain at the level of between-network interactions. We discovered a specific corticostriatal network implicated in social-communicative, motivational and affective processes that is heavily affected by oxytocin. Under oxytocin, the connectivity between these two components was substantially elevated on average and an oxytocin-related boost was observed in almost all participants. The fact that these corticostriatal connections are not particularly strong under normative conditions and with the administration of placebo, but become increasingly coordinated under oxytocin may be important for understanding how oxytocin influences cognition and behavior. Future work is needed to examine oxytocin-related strengthening of connectivity between these circuits and its effect on specific cognitive and behavioral processes. For example, these corticostriatal connections under pain or social-communication processes may illuminate important brain-behavior links that are affected by oxytocin. These results also illustrate how oxytocin is likely to extend beyond certain brain regions traditionally thought to be important.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref></sup> For example, previous neuroimaging studies in humans have largely focused on amygdala-related effects and to a lesser extent on striatal regions. The current study suggests oxytocin's effects may extend well beyond the amygdala and striatum, and most importantly, may incorporate interactions between subcortical striatal regions with cortical areas.</p><p>The degree to which oxytocin enhanced connectivity was also associated with continuous variation in autistic traits, such that those with the highest levels of autistic traits showed the largest oxytocin-related effect on connectivity. These results may point towards the idea that oxytocin may have varying impact on different subsets of individuals. Individuals with the highest levels of autistic traits seem to show the largest oxytocin-related connectivity boost. It will be important to extend these ideas into neuropsychiatric conditions such as ASC. Oxytocin is hypothesized to be of some potential value therapeutically for autism.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref></sup> However, given the large degree of heterogeneity in ASC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref></sup> and the knowledge that therapies may work well for some individuals and not others, it will be of the utmost importance to examine how oxytocin may or may not work well on specific subsets of affected individuals.</p><p>Supporting the plausibility of oxytocin-related effects on connectivity between these circuits, we also showed evidence supporting the idea that many of the brain regions involved in both IC11 and IC21 maps show some degree of <italic>OXTR</italic> expression. For instance, it is well known from non-human animal work that the striatum and regions within the midbrain are highly populated with oxytocin receptors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref></sup> Here, we confirmed such finding with evidence from <italic>OXTR</italic> expression in the brain in human females and furthered a proof-of-concept evidence that oxytocin may leverage this enrichment in <italic>OXTR</italic> to influence neural circuits connected to the striatum. We also discovered that there are modest levels of <italic>OXTR</italic> expression throughout many cortical areas. Given the lack of cortical specificity for <italic>OXTR</italic> enrichment, it remains possible that the observed connectivity effects with rsfMRI may not necessarily be mediated by direct action of oxytocin on <italic>OXTR</italic> in specific cortical regions. Rather, oxytocin could exert such effects via other indirect routes, perhaps originating in striatal circuitry where there is highly enrichment in <italic>OXTR</italic> or via other mechanisms of action.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref></sup> Although expression patterns of <italic>OXTR</italic> were not specific to cortical regions it may be that more fine-grained spatial maps of <italic>OXTR</italic> might provide a clearer picture. For example, the development of a PET ligand could certainly further advance our understanding of <italic>OXTR</italic> distribution <italic>in-vivo</italic> in the human brain.</p><p>This study has several novel elements that need to be highlighted. Specifically, this study focusses specifically on oxytocin-related resting-state effects in women. There are notable male biases throughout neuroscience and medical research and this bias may explain why studies looking at the effects of drugs tend to miss many adverse effects or show a lack of efficacy when applied to females.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref></sup> This bias can be observed in much of the prior work on oxytocin in humans as well, with some neuroimaging studies indicating potential differences in the oxytocin system between sexes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">49</xref></sup> Part of this bias in oxytocin research might be explained by the higher risk of side-effects (for example, lactation in mothers, abnormal uterine contractions and elevated blood pressure), though the intranasal administration has proven to be a safe methods of administration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref></sup> There have been a few studies that assessed the effect of gender in oxytocin administration. For example, previous studies examining functional connectivity during tasks show enhanced connectivity in women but decreased connectivity in men.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref></sup> Although our study was not explicitly set to examine sex differences in the effects of oxytocin, future research should focus on how oxytocin may have different effects across males and females.</p><p>Second, surpassing much of the existing neuroimaging work on oxytocin, to our knowledge, our study is the first to take a whole-brain, unsupervised approach to examine connectivity between neural networks. The small number of studies examining <italic>in-vivo</italic> oxytocin-related changes to functional connectivity in humans utilized a seed-based connectivity approach. This approach elucidates effects of oxytocin on connectivity with the pre-selected seed region, but is limited by the <italic>a priori</italic> selection. As we have shown with the analysis of OXTR expression much of the prior work is not necessarily informed by this expression pattern. It partly lacks specificity for certain regions and the present data suggest that other brain regions, not traditionally reported in oxytocin administration literature, might also have OXTR expression that would make it a potential target for administration. Rather, prior work tends to be heavily directed to regions that are justified based on their role in psychological processes that are linked to oxytocin (for example, amygdala). In our work, we have taken an unbiased approach to provide insight into oxytocin's effect on corticostriatal connectivity. These circuits might not have been identified with an approach constrained by task-based activation or seed-based connectivity based on this task-related activation.</p><p>The highlighted effect places emphasis on striatal interactions with cortical areas that are associated with pain processing. These results are interesting in light of work showing that oxytocin can not only act as an anxiolytic,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">52</xref></sup> but can also act as a painkiller.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">53</xref></sup> It should be noted that the anxiolytic effect might not fully explain oxytocins effect on behavior as benzodiazepines do not show a similar behavioral effect. To our knowledge, there is little neuroimaging work in females focusing on oxytocin and its influence on neural systems for pain processing, as most published work is exclusively on males and/or is focused on empathy for pain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">57</xref></sup> Similar to oxytocin research, research on pain has traditionally been heavily male biased,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref></sup> whereas women tend to suffer more from acute and chronic pain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">58</xref></sup> Our results suggest that future work is needed in this area, particularly on oxytocin's effect on pain and how such corticostriatal networks may be involved. In addition, areas identified by this data-driven approach show that key areas in the brains reward circuitry are modulated by oxytocin administration. It has been previously hypothesized that oxytocin exerts its effect on social salience and social cognition by modulating stress and reward processing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref></sup> The present study also highlights neural systems underlying these cognitive processes as key target for oxytocin administration. Further research into how oxytocin specifically modulates social reward processing might shed further light on its potential to more broadly modulate social cognition.</p><p>There are some caveats and limitations to keep in mind. First, the sample size is moderate and potentially provides low power to detect small effects. However, our multi-echo fMRI approach is a strength that could help counteract issues associated with statistical power. Multi-echo EPI acquisition and the ME-ICA denoising technique employed here is known to greatly enhance temporal signal-to-noise ratio and allow for enhanced ability to reduce false positives.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref></sup> These enhancements tied to principled elimination of non-BOLD noise in rsfMRI could be beneficial for power because reduction in noise potentially increases observable effect sizes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">59</xref></sup> and reduce effect size estimates for false-positive effects. Future work collecting larger samples to replicate and extend these findings would be facilitated by characterizing individuals in continuous variation in autistic traits. Our study indicates that oxytocin-related effects tend to be stronger in individuals with more autistic traits. As noted in the points about sex and gender, future work should also examine whether similar or different effects are present in males. It would also be important to further extend this work in clinically diagnosed individuals with autism. Our exploratory analysis revealed a potential correlation with autistic traits that may suggest that oxytocin could facilitate corticostriatal connectivity in clinically diagnosed patients. If such a relationship extends into the clinically diagnosed population of the autism spectrum, we may expect to see that oxytocin provides the largest enhancements to the most affected individuals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref></sup> This should however at this point be considered exploratory.</p><p>Furthermore, there has been some debate in recent years about the extend to which oxytocin crosses the blood&#x02013;brain barrier.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">60</xref></sup> A recent study that assessed cerebrospinal fluid and plasma concentrations after intranasal administration found elevated levels in plasma after 15&#x02009;min and a peak in cerebrospinal fluid elevation at 75&#x02009;min.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">61</xref></sup> By far, most studies have used the 24 IU dose and timing of 40&#x02009;min to show behavioral effects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref></sup> Yet, is is possible some behavioral effects might originate from peripheral elevation as opposed to a central effect.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">60</xref></sup> Nonetheless, a recent review on the issue suggest that the intranasal route is likely still the best candidate for administration and found no effects from intravenous administration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">62</xref></sup> The relation between increased cerebrospinal fluid oxytocin and timing of potential behavioral effect also remains unclear. The present study was not set out to determine the best dose or timing or to assess whether oxytocin could cross the blood&#x02013;brain barrier. Unfortunately, there is currently no PET ligand available to definitively assess the timing and central binding of intranasal oxytocin, though animal work on this is progressing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">64</xref></sup> Thus, to be able to compare the present findings to existing literature, we chose to use the same timing and dosage.</p><p>Finally, underpowered studies are common amongst oxytocin administration studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">65</xref></sup> The observed effect here between IC11 and IC21 is large. For the current sample size, the minimum effect size achieving 80&#x00025; power at an alpha of 0.05 is <italic>d</italic>=0.6. An effect this low or lower was never observed in our bootstrapping analysis to estimate variability in the IC11-IC21 effect (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>). Therefore, we can reason that we had sufficient power to detect such an effect at the current sample size. As for other more subtle effects, our report here is likely underpowered to detect such effects and much larger studies are likely needed to detect such smaller effects. To our knowledge, this is the first work on the topic of between-component connectivity in a female rsfMRI oxytocin administration study, we have provided effect sizes estimates for all IC comparisons to aid others in future power calculations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>). Each of the corresponding 22 IC maps can be viewed and downloaded on NeuroVault (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://neurovault.org/collections/2154/">http://neurovault.org/collections/2154/</ext-link>).</p><p>In conclusion, we have discovered that oxytocin enhances corticostriatal connectivity in women. These corticostriatal networks have roles in social-communicative, motivational and affective processes, and the results may be particularly important for understanding how oxytocin changes neurodynamics that may be relevant for many neuropsychiatric conditions with deficits in those domains and neural circuits. Future work examining these effects in males as well as clinically diagnosed samples will be important, as will be the examination of what subsets of individuals may benefit most from oxytocin-related changes in between-network connectivity.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank John Suckling and Pradeep Nathan for valuable discussions during this study.
