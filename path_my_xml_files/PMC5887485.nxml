However, as yet no reliable biological marker has been established to differentiate CHR subjects who will develop psychosis from those who will not. This study investigated abnormalities in graph-based gyrification connectome in CHR subjects and patients with first-episode psychosis (FEP) and tested the accuracy of this systems-based approach to predict the transition to psychosis among CHR individuals.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>44 healthy controls (HC), 63 at-risk mental state (ARMS) subjects without later transition to psychosis (ARMS-NT), 16 ARMS subjects with later transition (ARMS-T), and 38 antipsychotic-free patients with FEP were recruited from the specialized clinic for the early detection of psychosis at the Department of Psychiatry, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland. Gyrification-based structural covariance networks (connectomes) were constructed to quantify global integration, segregation and small-worldness. Extremely randomized trees with repeated, nested cross-validation was performed to differentiate ARMS-T from ARMS-NT individuals. Permutation testing was used to assess the significance of classification performance measures.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><p>Small-worldness is reduced in both ARMS-T and FEP patients, secondary to reduced integration and increased segregation in both groups. In addition, we also found that transitivity (segregation) was significantly higher in ARMS-T and FEP groups compared to both ARMS-NT and healthy controls. Using the connectome properties as features, we obtained a high classification accuracy of 90% (balanced accuracy: 81%, positive predictive value: 85%, negative predictive value: 92%.) All performance measures were highly significant as indicated by permutation tests (all p &#x0003c; 0.01).</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our findings suggest that there is poor integration in the coordinated development of cortical folding in patients who develop psychosis. This study further indicates that gyrification-based connectomes might be a promising means to generate systems-based measures from anatomical data that improves individual prediction of psychosis transition in CHR subjects.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="2"/></counts></article-meta></front></article>
