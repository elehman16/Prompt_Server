intervention on visual-motor integration and activities of daily living performance of
children with cerebral palsy as subjects. [Methods] This study was conducted with 56
children who were diagnosed as having cerebral palsy. The visual perceptual intervention
was implemented for 8 weeks, 3 times a week, for 30 minutes per session, for a total of 24
sessions. All children were assessed using the VMI and WeeFIM to evaluate visual motor
integration and activities of daily living skills, immediately before and after the 8-week
intervention. [Results] The VMI and WeeFIM scores of all of the 56 children with CP who
participated in the study improved, and the improvements were statistically significant.

integration and activities of daily living performance of children with cerebral
palsy.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Visual perceptual intervention</kwd><kwd>Visual-motor integration</kwd><kwd>Activities of daily living</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The incidence of cerebral palsy (CP) is showing a tendency to increase, and this means that
the number of children with serious functional disorders are increasing. This increase has
relevance for advances in medical technology and the preparation to provide social services
and health for children with functional disorders<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Children with CP have accompanying perception disorders due to motor disturbance, the main
disturbance, and disorders of the sensory organs, which receive environmental information,
and disorders of the central nervous system, and it is well-known that the most general
disorder is visual perception disorder. Children with visual perception deficiency show
difficulties with wearing shoes, using clips, completing jig-saw puzzles, playing with toys
and building blocks, color identification, and learning letters, all of which influence
their daily living and general activities such as social participation<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>With regard to visual perception ability, children with CP have difficulties with
visual-motor integration. Visual-motor integration is the interaction of visual skill,
visual perceptual skill, and motor skill<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Efficient eye-hand coordination is necessary for successful performance of visual and
spatial activities of daily living<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
ultimate therapeutic aim for children with CP is to develop their potentiality as much as
possible to allow full participation in home, school and the local community, and individual
elements and environmental elements affect each other and are closely connected with the
functional abilities of these children<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.
The degree of impairment of movement of children with CP differs from individual to
individual, so there is a wide range of levels of participation in activities of their daily
living<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. The visual perception ability
of children with CP is inferior to that of normal children, and it has been reported that
this ability can be markedly improved by a visual perceptual training program. However until
now, the study of visual perceptual training programs for children with cerebral palsy for
the improvement of visual-motor integration and activities of daily living has been
rare<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, this study
investigated the influence of a visual perceptual training program on visual-motor
integration and activities of daily living of children with CP.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study used pre/post-test design, and it was carried out at S hospital in a city of
Korea in 2013. The subjects were children diagnosed as having CP by a rehabilitation medical
treatment specialist and their occupational therapist performed the pre-test. The subjects
were 56 children aged 4&#x02013;7&#x02005;years old (35 boys and 21 girls). Children whose parents did not
give permission to participation in this study or who could not perform VMI according to
directions of the tester were excluded. This study was approved by the Institutional Review
Board of Inje University.</p><p>The intervention was performed for a total 24 sessions. Each session lasted for 30 minutes,
during which three times a week for eight weeks. Each task was repeated two tasks were
performed. In addition, more than two times to allow sufficient learning by the children.
The place of intervention was a pediatric treatment room that was quiet and organized, and
the visual perceptual training program was conducted by 3 occupational therapists with more
than five years experience of pediatric treatment.</p><p>The visual perceptual training program comprised of 48 tasks, which were compiled by Yeo on
the basis of a comprehensive training program for the development of visual perception, the
Frostig Developmental Program in Visual Perception, proposed by Frostig. The contents of
this program are 48 items such as visual-motor coordination, figure-ground perception,
perceptual constancy and position in space and spatial relationship, and the order of
training is comprehensively arranged according to the level of difficulty.</p><p>All the children were assessed using the Developmental Test of Visual-Motor Integration
(VMI) and the Wee Functional Independent Measure (WeeFIM) immediately before and after
8-week intervention. VMI is a testing tool for visual-motor integration, which has
structured test and grading standard. The test consist of 24 figures arranged by level of
difficulty. WeeFIM is a tool for evaluating activities of daily living, and it is divided
into six areas with 18 items of basic activities of daily living.</p><p>The data collected in this study were statistically processed using SPSS 18.0. Pre- and
post-test results of VMI and WeeFIM were the raw scores of 2 occupational therapists with
more than five years experience of pediatric treatment who followed the grading standards
and grade lists of the testing tools. The raw scores of VMI were adjusted for the children&#x02019;s
chronological age (CA) and developmental quotient (DQ). To examine the improvement in
ability of each individual, the pre- and post-test results were compared using descriptive
statistics. The significance of differences was tested using the paired t-test. The level of
significance for the statistics was chosen as 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The general characteristics of subjects are reported in <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Demographic characteristics (n=56)</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Variables</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Number (%)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Gender</td></tr><tr><td align="left" style="padding-left:10pt" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Male</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">35 (62.50%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" style="padding-left:10pt" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Female</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">21 (37.50%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Age (months)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" style="padding-left:10pt" rowspan="1" colspan="1">48&#x02013;59</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">12 (21.43%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" style="padding-left:10pt" rowspan="1" colspan="1">60&#x02013;71</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">32 (57.14%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" style="padding-left:10pt" rowspan="1" colspan="1">72&#x02013;83</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">12 (21.43%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Gestational period (wks)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" style="padding-left:10pt" rowspan="1" colspan="1">26</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2 (3.57%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" style="padding-left:10pt" rowspan="1" colspan="1">27</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6 (10.71%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" style="padding-left:10pt" rowspan="1" colspan="1">28</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">16 (28.57%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" style="padding-left:10pt" rowspan="1" colspan="1">29</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8 (14.29%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" style="padding-left:10pt" rowspan="1" colspan="1">32</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">24 (42.86%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" style="padding-left:10pt" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Type of CP</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" style="padding-left:10pt" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Spastic diplegia</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">36 (64.29%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" style="padding-left:10pt" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Spastic hemiplegia</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">20 (35.71%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Use of assistive devices</td></tr><tr><td align="left" style="padding-left:10pt" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Cochlear implants</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6 (10.71%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" style="padding-left:10pt" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Glasses</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">37 (66.07%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" style="padding-left:10pt" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Lower limb orthosis</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">29 (51.79%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" style="padding-left:10pt" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Wheelchair</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8 (14.29%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" style="padding-left:10pt" rowspan="1" colspan="1">None</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">14 (25%)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>CP: cerebral palsy</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap>.

cognitive function and motor skills, and hinder the acquisition of new motor skills and
independent performance of activities of daily living such as standing erect, and
disorientation. Impairment of visual perception ability can be an obstacle to the
rehabilitation process<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In this study, a visual perceptual training program was conducted aiming to improve
activities of daily living and visual-motor integration at a low level, and we examined its
therapeutic effects on visual-motor integration and activities of daily living. The results
demonstrate that the visual perceptual training program had a positive influence on
visual-motor integration and activities of daily living. The conclusion of Parush et al.
that visual perception and visual-motor integration are independent skills, but there is a
significant correlation between them in clumsy children<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>, is supported by the results of the present study.</p><p>We consider that a visual perceptual training program could be usefully conducted as a
clinical method for functional recovery of visual-motor integration and activities of daily
living, the essential elements for learning. Rehabilitation programs for children with CP
should be appropriate for their ages and functional condition<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. To establish the results of this study, it will be necessary for
systematic study over long term involving many handicapped children, and studies of visual
perceptual intervention stratifying the characteristics of handicapped children should also
be performed.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Pharoah</surname><given-names>PO</given-names></name><name><surname>Platt</surname><given-names>MJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Cooke</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>The changing epidemiology of cerebral
