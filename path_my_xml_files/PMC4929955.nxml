In Australia, the prevalence rate of sleep disorders in the general population are considered to be high, and are estimated to affect about 1.5 million or 8.9% of the population;[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] the most common are obstructive sleep apnea (4%),[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] chronic insomnia (5%),[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and periodic limb movement disorder (3.9%).[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Sleep disorders are known to be associated with diseases and problems such as diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, impaired cognitive function, poor school or work performance, and memory disturbance.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>New interventions are needed to provide more accessible primary care options to assist those with/or at risk of sleep disorders, as alternatives to sleep specialists who often have longer waiting times, and can be expensive if additional procedures are required. In fact, it was found that treatment under a primary healthcare model, compared with a specialist model, resulted in similar patient outcomes.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Community pharmacists can offer primary assistance to help individuals with sleeping disorders because they are usually more accessible, and also highly trained in therapeutics, medicines, diseases state management, health education, and face-to-face counseling.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] This, therefore, places them in an ideal position to play a role in the management of sleep-related disorders, by initiating conversation, discussing medicines, and providing continuous assessments. Monitoring and following up individuals with sleeping disorders can be difficult without appropriate instruments or standard intervening measures. While most previous research on community pharmacy-based interventions for sleep disorders focused on developing screening tools, [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] there is an opportunity to develop an intervention that monitors and follows-up the patients, particularly after treatment was sought.</p><p>Using a step-wise approached, this feasibility study was conducted to tackle &#x0201c;poor sleep&#x0201d; in walk-in individuals who attended the community pharmacy seeking help for the condition. An intervening model of care inclusive of baseline assessment, monitoring, and follow-up to gain feedback on sleep, was developed. For this purpose, a wrist-watch device, actigraph, was utilized. Being convenient and portable, actigraph is a practical device for use in the community and home-based environment.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] While assessing sleep/wake patterns is difficult when self-reporting is poor or subjective measuring tools are used, actigraph can overcome this challenge by providing objective and graphical data, and by measuring gross motor activities to infer sleep/wake patterns.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Actigraph can identify certain sleep parameters and can also be used to validate self-reported feedback whenever self-report and actigraphy data are used concurrently.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p><p>This paper describes an intervention developed to assist the pharmacist in improving the management of sleep disorders at the community pharmacy.

However, in contrast, the differences between and within groups for ISI mean scores were observed at week 2. These results were consistent with other studies that used actigraph to assess insomnia patients.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] Although the study initial aim was generally to focus on &#x0201c;poor sleep,&#x0201d; the majority of participants were found to be at higher risk of insomnia at baseline. Hence, the intervention appeared to be most effective in those with this condition. Another possible explanation is that in this study population, it could be easier to detect a difference due to a larger number of participants who were identified to be at risk of insomnia.</p><p>The intervention also included two consultation sessions, consisted of elements such as sleep education, sleep hygiene and discussion of sleep parameters (with actigraphy sleep reports forming the focus). The use of actigraphy sleep report during consultation especially in those with an insomnia-related disorder appears to have a positive impact. However, at this point there are no published studies of community pharmacy using actigraphy sleep reports during the consultation for sleep-related disorders; hence the results of this intervention could not be compared with similar situations and settings. However, this approach is almost similar to the &#x0201c;gold standard&#x0201d; treatment for insomnia, that is, the cognitive behavioral therapy (CBTI), which includes consultation to help patients change their sleep habits.[<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] CBTI which combines elements such as sleep education, sleep hygiene, sleep restriction, and cognitive therapy is suggested to be effective in addressing the issues with sleep onset and maintenance of sleep in insomnia patients in primary healthcare settings.[<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref><xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] One study which evaluated the effectiveness of CBTI (by evaluating changes in the ISI mean scores), found that the scores for the CBTI group was significantly reduced from pre-treatment to post-treatment.[<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] Having significantly reduced mean scores for ISI in this study, the findings could suggest that this current study might be non-inferior to the study that used CBTI approach as an intervention. Although with a different setting and study population, this intervention study has shown that it is possible to adapt this approach into the community pharmacy workflow in providing an intervention that is more convenient and easier to conduct.</p><p>As part of the intervention, actigraph was also used to compare pre- and post-mean sleep parameters (SE%, TST, SOL, and NWAK) scores to identify changes in sleep/wake patterns in the ICG and evaluated the effectiveness of the intervention, as conducted in previous studies.[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref><xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] Although, as a whole, the findings could not observe significant differences, these are still need to be interpreted with caution as there may be significant discrepancies for some individuals, but was not observed in this study. The type of actigraph model and accompanying proprietary algorithm from the software, the sensitivity level and use of the non-dominant and dominant wrist, may also have affected the actigraphy results in this study.[<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]</p><p>In research and clinical settings, the literature suggests combining actigraph monitoring with a sleep diary to better characterize sleep/wake patterns in individuals with disturbed sleep.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] Similar sleep parameter results for SOL and NWAK found in both sleep diary and actigraphy data suggests that actigraph is an appropriate objective sleep assessment instrument to validate SOL and NWAK in this study. However, a significant difference was found when comparing post-TST mean scores between actigraphy data and sleep diary at week 2. This is in accordance with previous studies,[<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref><xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] which found significant differences when comparing TST between these two tools.</p><p>Overall, actigraphy data revealed that mean scores for SE% were lower than the cut-off value at both pre- and post-assessment; suggesting that in the ICG, at both time points, the mean scores for SE% could not reach the expected level for a &#x0201c;good sleeper.&#x0201d; However, this study found a negative correlation between SE% and SOL, which meant that those who took longer to fall asleep (longer SOL) had a lower SE%. This correlation is supported by one study[<xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] that also found a negative correlation between sleep quality and SOL. However, to better confirm this, studies using actigraphy data from larger samples should be conducted.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-5"><title>Limitation</title><p>Due to its exploratory nature, one obvious limitation is the fact that the study has relatively small number of participants despite <italic>a priori</italic> power calculation. With a small sample size, caution must be applied, as the findings might not be transferable to the general community. However, the results could be used as representative of the customers experiencing certain sleep disorders attending the community pharmacy.</p><p>One more limitation is the time frame of the whole study. An extension of the study over a longer time frame would be supportive to test the hypotheses. With a longer time frame to recruit the participants, recruitment of a larger sample size would be possible. The challenges also were due to constraints outside of the research team's control, such as difficulties in recruiting the community pharmacies and participants within the time frame.</p><p>Another limitation is that the study was designed to recruit participants conveniently, and no randomization was conducted. The participants in the intervention group were aware of the intervention hence some of them might have reacted according to the researcher's expectation. This can be explained as &#x0201c;Hawthorne effect;&#x0201d; a phenomenon which suggests that study subjects&#x02019; behavior are altered by the subjects&#x02019; awareness that they are being studied or that they received additional attention.[<xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-6"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Although the intervention had limited success with regards to participant outcomes, it has offered some insights into the development of a community pharmacy-based intervention to improve the management of sleep disorders in the future.

The findings from this study have important implications for recommending further research using a larger sample size and different study populations, before the effectiveness of the &#x0201c;model of care&#x0201d; can be clearly understood. This study hence concluded that for a community-based intervention to be effective, and yet be able to be widely implemented, it needs to be practical, convenient for use and, easily conducted and implemented by the pharmacists and pharmacy staff.</p><sec id="sec2-12"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-13"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors would like to thank Terry White and Malouf Pharmacies study teams for their assistance.
