Metabolic syndrome is a clustering of risk factors that increases the risk of developing type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Recent reports have shown that the prevalence of cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and metabolic syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] is higher in rural compared to urban settings. Much of the disparity is associated with demographic and behavioral factors associated with rural living [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Evidence suggests that lifestyle interventions aimed at controlling cardiometabolic risk factors can reduce the incidence of type 2 diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], but access to healthcare and lifestyle change programs is limited in rural communities. Novel interventions aimed at improving short-term uptake and long-term maintenance of such programs are needed for this population.</p><p>Mobile health (mHealth) has the potential to reach broad populations and may provide the opportunity to support lifestyle changes in rural populations. A number of studies have shown that mHealth is effective in the self-management of type 2 diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and hypertension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Specifically, one study examining the effects of mHealth added to a hypertension management program showed improvements in both mHealth intervention and active control groups but greater improvements in BP in the mHealth intervention group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. These findings suggest that mHealth may have additional benefits when added to an existing treatment program; however, the use of mHealth to enhance exercise therapy has not been examined. Management of cardiometabolic risk factors prior to disease onset may have the potential to reduce disease burden. To date, however, evidence supporting the use of mHealth technologies for disease prevention is sparse. We recently completed a pilot study, which demonstrated that an intervention aimed at increasing physical activity while using mHealth technologies to monitor biometrics, improved diastolic blood pressure (DBP), total cholesterol and physical fitness over an eight-week period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. It remains unknown whether the mHealth tracking provided any added benefit over the exercise intervention alone and whether the improvements would be maintained over a longer follow-up period. The findings from this pilot study along with participant and clinician feedback was used to develop the intervention for the present study.</p><p>The purpose of this study was two-fold: first, to investigate the effects of a mHealth supported exercise intervention compared to an active control group receiving only the exercise prescription over a short-term (12-week) period; and second, to examine the long-term maintenance over 24 and 52&#x000a0;weeks of follow-up. The primary hypothesis was that the intervention group receiving mHealth support would have greater reductions in systolic blood pressure (SBP) and other cardiometabolic risk factors at 12&#x000a0;weeks compared to the active control group. Secondary hypotheses were that the mHealth intervention group would also have greater decreases in DBP, waist circumference, lipids (with the exception of high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), which was expected to increase) and markers for blood glucose and inflammation compared to the active control group. It was hypothesized that all improvements would be better maintained over the 52-week follow-up period in the intervention group compared to the active control group.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Full details of the study protocol have been previously published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Community-dwelling adults aged 18-70 years from Huron-Perth and Grey-Bruce counties (Ontario, Canada) were recruited via print and radio advertisements, word of mouth, community presentations and physician referral. Participants with at least two metabolic syndrome risk factors as defined by the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III [waist circumference &#x02265;88&#x000a0;cm (women) or 102&#x000a0;cm (men); SBP &#x02265;135&#x000a0;mmHg and/or DBP &#x02265;85&#x000a0;mmHg; fasting plasma glucose &#x02265;6.1&#x000a0;mmol/L; fasting triglycerides &#x02265;1.7&#x000a0;mmol/L; fasting HDL &#x02264;1.29&#x000a0;mmol/L (women) or 1.02&#x000a0;mmol/L (men)] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] presented to a community-based research centre (Gateway Rural Health Research Institute, Seaforth, Ontario, Canada) and voluntarily provided informed consent to participate in this parallel-group, randomized controlled trial (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01944124). Exclusion criteria, evaluated by self-report during a screening phone call and verified in-person were: SBP &#x0003e;180&#x000a0;mmHg and/or DBP &#x0003e;110&#x000a0;mmHg; type 1 diabetes; history of myocardial infarction, angioplasty, coronary artery bypass or cerebrovascular ischemia; symptomatic congestive heart failure; atrial flutter; unstable angina; unstable pulmonary disease; use of medications known to affect heart rate; second or third degree heart block; history of alcoholism, drug abuse or other emotional cognitive or psychiatric problems; pacemaker; unstable metabolic disease; and orthopedic or rheumatologic problems that could impair the ability to exercise. This study was approved by the Western University Health Sciences Research Ethics Board (Protocol # 15828).</p><p>Participants (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;149) were randomly assigned (1:1 allocation) to the mHealth supported exercise intervention group or the active control group. To accommodate deployment and activation of technology and implementation of technology training sessions, randomization was blocked based on appointment time, such that all participants attending appointments during week 1 were randomized to the intervention group, those attending appointments during week 2 were randomized to the control group, and so on. Due to this randomization procedure, research staff could not be blinded to group allocation. At baseline and at 12, 24, and 52&#x000a0;weeks of follow-up, participants reported to the clinic for assessment following a minimum eight-hour fast. Waist circumference was measured at the mid-point between the twelfth rib and upper border of the iliac crest following normal expiration. Supine blood pressure was measured with an automated sphygmomanometer (BPTru<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Coquitlam, Canada) following a five-minute rest period. Blood was drawn and sent to a central laboratory for analysis of fasting plasma glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, glycated hemoglobin (HbA<sub>1C</sub>), insulin and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP<sub>hs</sub>; a biomarker, which is increased with systemic inflammation). Insulin resistance was calculated using the Homeostatis Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>Following a light, standardized snack, participants&#x02019; fitness was assessed and a tailored exercise program was prescribed by an exercise specialist according to the Step Test and Exercise Prescription (STEP&#x02122;) protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Aerobic exercise was prescribed on most days of the week (5-7 days per week) at a training heart rate of 70, 75, 80 or 85% of an estimated maximum heart rate for those whose fitness was classified as poor, good, very good or excellent, respectively. Participants were to accumulate 30 to 60&#x000a0;minutes of exercise per day with bouts of at least 10&#x000a0;minutes each. Resistance training was prescribed two to four times per week. The exercise prescription was updated at 12 and 24&#x000a0;weeks. While the exercise specialist ensured that the exercise prescription complied with current global physical activity guidelines, which are recommended for optimal general health, including blood pressure control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] (i.e., 150&#x000a0;minutes per week of moderate-to-vigorous intensity exercise), during the exercise counselling session, participants self-selected goals that were important to them. This was done in an attempt to motivate participants to adhere to the program to reach their own personal goals rather than attempting to encourage them with our pre-determined study goals. Participants were instructed to record all planned exercise sessions. Participants in the intervention group logged exercise using mHealth tools (described below) and the active control group logged exercise in a paper journal.</p><p>In addition to the exercise prescription, participants in the mHealth intervention group received a kit, which included a smartphone data portal (Blackberry<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Curve 8300 or 8530) equipped with Healthanywhere health monitoring application (Biosign Technologies Inc., Markham, Ontario, Canada), a Bluetooth&#x02122; enabled blood pressure monitor (A &#x00026; D Medical, UA-767PBT, San Jose, California, USA), a glucometer (Lifescan One Touch Ultra2&#x02122;, Milpitas, California, USA) with Bluetooth&#x02122; adapter (Polymap Wireless, PWR-08-03, Tucson, Arizona, USA) and a pedometer (Omron, HJ-150, Kyoto, Japan) (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The mHealth technologies were provided primarily as a self-management tool. Participants attended a two-hour session, during which they learned how to use the technologies; were provided with information regarding normal values for fasting glucose, blood pressure and pedometer steps; and were encouraged to use the technologies to monitor their own health. Participants contacted research staff for troubleshooting as needed, but they did not receive additional lifestyle coaching compared to the active control group. The home-monitoring protocol required participants to input pedometer steps and exercise daily; measure blood pressure and fasting blood glucose three times per week; and measure body weight with their own home scale once per month. When measurements were outside of pre-determined safety limits, an automated alert was sent to the study physician&#x02019;s smartphone for follow-up. Full details of database security, automated alerts and follow-up are reported elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>

A common standard deviation of 12&#x000a0;mmHg was assumed. The sample size calculation assumed 80% power and two-sided significance level of 0.05. It was determined that 63 participants would be required per group and by assuming a 15% drop-out rate, the required sample size increased to 73 participants per group. Secondary outcomes were DBP, waist circumference, fasting plasma glucose, HbA<sub>1C</sub>, triglycerides, HDL, low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), total cholesterol, HOMA-IR and CRP<sub>hs</sub>. An <italic>a priori</italic> decision was made to require a minimum of two data points (i.e., data from baseline visit and at least one follow-up visit) to impute missing data. All participants with complete data at baseline and at least one other time point (i.e., 12, 24 and/or 52&#x000a0;weeks) were included in the analyses (n =127). Last observation carried forward was used to impute missing data. For our primary analysis (12-week analysis for SBP), 2% of participants had their data carried forward from baseline. These participants had missed their 12-week visit but since they attended either the 24 and/or 52-week visit, data was carried forward from baseline (to 12-weeks) in these instances. For 12-week analysis of secondary outcomes, the proportion of participants with data carried forward ranged from 2 to 3%. For the longitudinal analyses, approximately 15% of participants had data carried forward in time.</p><p>Descriptive statistics were computed for baseline demographic and clinical characteristics at each time point by group. Specifically, means and standard deviations were calculated for continuous variables and frequency counts and percentages were calculated for categorical variables. Exercise compliance was calculated as the percentage of weeks in which at least 150&#x000a0;minutes of exercise was recorded. Compliance to the mHealth monitoring protocol was calculated as the percentage of measurements submitted for each monitoring tool over the 52-week intervention period and from weeks 1-12, 13-24 and 25-52. Analysis of covariance was used to examine differences between groups in mean change over 12&#x000a0;weeks, adjusting for baseline values. Thus, the outcome variable was change between baseline and 12-weeks and model terms included group and the baseline value of outcome. Two-way repeated measures ANOVA was used to extend the 12-week analyses to include data collected at all time-points, for each outcome of interest [i.e., four measurements in total, one corresponding to each time point, were included as part of the outcome variable]. For each model (outcome), the terms group, time, and group&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;time were included. Due to non-normality, triglycerides, HOMA-IR and CRP<sub>hs</sub> were transformed to the natural logarithm scale for these analyses. Post-hoc comparisons were done using the Bonferroni method. Analyses were performed using R 3.0.1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec4" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Participant flow</title><p>During the recruitment period (November 2009 to December 2010) 238 individuals contacted the study coordinator to inquire about the trial and 89 individuals were excluded as they did not meet inclusion criteria (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;61) or they were not interested in participating (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;28).

By 52&#x000a0;weeks, however, the reduction in SBP compared to baseline was similar between groups. At 12&#x000a0;weeks, the mean change in all secondary outcomes examined was similar between groups. Over the 52-week follow up period, the improvements in DBP, waist circumference, HbA<sub>1C</sub>, LDL and total cholesterol were similar between groups, with no change in HDL for either group.</p><p>This study was limited to highly motivated adults residing in rural communities who volunteered to participate in an intensive lifestyle intervention. Therefore, findings may not be generalizable to less motivated adults or to those residing in urban centres. Since the study was conducted in small rural communities and a considerable amount of recruitment was accomplished by word-of-mouth, it is likely that there was contact between participants in the mHealth intervention and active control groups throughout the course of the study. Social support was not controlled for and may have biased results. The randomization procedures were pragmatically designed for deployment of technology kits and activation of smartphones and the mobile application. While a more typical randomization procedure would have made the study design stronger (i.e., completing randomization after baseline assessments), it would have been impractical due to the logistics associated with implementing the technology component. Although the primary outcome measure was SBP, blood pressure reduction was not necessarily the goal of the exercise program. Rather, participants&#x02019; self-selected goals and the exercise specialist provided guidance and prescribed an exercise program to achieve these goals; had all participants received exercise prescriptions based on the study goals, greater improvements may have occurred. Tailored exercise programs, however, are generally more effective and participants may have been less motivated to adhere to their exercise prescription if it had not been based on their personal health goals. In fact, the STEP&#x02122; tool has been investigated in previous randomized clinical and observational studies and has been proved to positively effect exercise behaviours and cardiometabolic risk factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The STEP&#x02122; protocol requires little equipment and can be easily translated to community settings. The mHealth monitoring technology and protocol was tested for feasibility and the development of this protocol was guided by our previous pilot study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>Lifestyle modification is known to improve cardiometabolic risk status and is recommended as first line therapy for prevention and treatment of metabolic syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Longitudinal studies have demonstrated the efficacy of lifestyle modification interventions targeting physical activity, diet and other behaviours to improve metabolic syndrome risk factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Such programs, however, are often not available to rural populations. mHealth-supported interventions are accessible to a broad population, including those in rural communities, and have the potential to be delivered as sustainable programs for behaviour modification and maintenance. Research supports the use of electronic health, including mHealth interventions for management of diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and hypertension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Contrary to these findings, and those of a meta-analysis that examined the effects of long-term exercise interventions on metabolic syndrome and showed reductions in fasting plasma glucose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] the present study did not find positive effects on fasting plasma glucose. HbA<sub>1C</sub>, which is a marker of three-month glucose regulation, showed a different trend with small, but significant reductions in the mHealth intervention group at 24 and 52&#x000a0;weeks and a transient reduction in the active control group at 24&#x000a0;weeks. Average values for both groups over the 52-week period, however, remained within the clinically defined healthy range, which may have limited the potential for improvement. Both SBP and DBP, on the other hand, were improved over the course of the 52-week study, though the active control group had greater improvements in SBP at 12&#x000a0;weeks compared to the intervention group. This result is supported by a recent meta-analysis that showed that internet-based blood pressure control interventions were more effective when they were at least six months in duration compared to those of shorter duration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Similar analyses have not been completed for smartphone interventions, but a longer time period may be required to elicit change. Since the active control group received only the tailored exercise prescription, these participants may have been more focused on completing exercise sessions, while the intervention group may have been initially overwhelmed with the exercise prescription and mHealth technology. Once their comfort with the mHealth monitoring protocol increased, they may have changed their focus to the exercise prescription. Exercise compliance over the first 12&#x000a0;weeks was, however, similar between groups. Contrary to the hypothesis and results of similar interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] there were no between group differences in SBP or DBP at 24 or 52&#x000a0;weeks. In another year-long intervention study for patients with diabetes and uncontrolled hypertension, the intervention group, which received immediate feedback regarding submitted blood pressure measures, reduced daytime ambulatory SBP by 9&#x000a0;mmHg, while the control group who monitored blood pressure but did not receive feedback, did not experience improvements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Targeted feedback may be an important component to mHealth interventions. Although participants in our study were able to review past measurements and trends on their own, tailored feedback messages might have resulted in greater improvements in metabolic risk factors in the mHealth intervention group compared to the active control group.</p><p>mHealth has been suggested as an alternate or even replacement for traditional clinical management of chronic disease risk factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Access and availability of care could include mHealth solutions among patients and health care providers. Such considerations currently lack rigorous investigation. In this study, both the mHealth intervention and active control groups showed improvements in cardiometabolic risk factors over the course of the study, highlighting the importance of exercise prescription for cardiometabolic risk management. An interesting finding in the present study was that, contrary to the hypothesis, SBP was initially reduced (at 12-weeks) to a greater extent in the active control group compared to the mHealth technology intervention group, though there was no difference between groups at 24 and 52&#x000a0;weeks of follow-up. While more research is needed, it may be that an exercise program alone should be prescribed at the onset of risk management and mHealth could be added as a tool to aid in long-term maintenance of behavior change. As discussed above, more sophisticated applications involving immediate automated feedback may be more effective for supporting optimal health behaviours. Additionally, with the exponentially increasing number of health management applications available for smartphones, clinicians and patients could chose those that specifically suit management and lifestyle needs and preferences.</p><p>Although the differences in change in cardiometabolic risk status were similar between the mHealth intervention and active control groups, this study provides insight to guide design and implementation of future, more sophisticated mHealth applications, which may lead to improved long-term management of chronic disease risk factors. The ideal protocol for mHealth monitoring remains unknown, though it is likely that it should be tailored to suit individuals&#x02019; lifestyle preferences and risk factor modification needs. Additionally, it is unclear why the active control group reduced SBP at 12&#x000a0;weeks while the mHealth intervention group did not realize improvements until 24&#x000a0;weeks. While these findings correspond with those from internet-based health intervention studies, research is needed to examine the underlying reasons for the extended timeline for SBP reductions to enable implementation of interventions for optimal risk management.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, there appears to be no clear advantage of a mHealth-supported exercise intervention in patients with increased cardiovascular risk, over an active control group receiving the STEP&#x02122; exercise prescription alone. In fact, the STEP&#x02122; exercise prescription alone elicited greater reductions in SBP after 12&#x000a0;weeks compared to the mHealth intervention group. Over the long-term, however, changes in SBP and other cardiometabolic risk factors were equal between groups, suggesting that short-term improvements in cardiometabolic risk may be more effective with simpler interventions, but long-term improvements can be realized with both exercise prescription and mHealth supported exercise prescription. Perhaps an exercise prescription following the STEP&#x02122; protocol is best to achieve the initial SBP reduction and then mHealth tracking could be offered as an assistive tool for interested patients or for patients in need of monitoring for control of other diseases such as hypertension or pre-diabetes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec15"><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1"><media xlink:href="12889_2014_7183_MOESM1_ESM.docx"><caption><p>Additional file 1:
