Visit 2 and visit 3 microbiological eradication rates for Gram-positive and Gram-negative isolates and for individual species were consistent with the overall eradication rates. The majority of observed eradication failures in any treatment group were due to the persistence of the pathogen isolated at baseline. Eradication failures in the besifloxacin treatment group were not associated with lower antimicrobial susceptibility at baseline.

Data listings for the noneradication categories (eg, reduction, persistence, proliferation) from each study were combined and used to characterize microbiological eradication failures in the integrated analysis. The initial characterization into noneradication categories was based on the assumption that when the infecting species was present at follow-up, it was the same strain as that present at baseline.</p><p>To further investigate the potential cause(s) of observed microbiological eradication failures, several analyses were conducted. First, to determine if microbiological eradication failures were associated with antimicrobial susceptibility at baseline, the numbers of isolates eradicated/noneradicated at visit 2 and visit 3 with besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension and moxifloxacin ophthalmic solution were plotted as a function of the besifloxacin or moxifloxacin MICs, respectively, for the pathogen at baseline. Secondly, to determine the contribution of new infections as opposed to persistence or proliferation of the strain present at baseline, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) testing was performed for all isolates that were recovered at or above threshold at both baseline and any follow-up visit.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-opth-5-1359">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27-opth-5-1359">27</xref> PFGE gel-banding patterns were captured by a digital imaging system, and isolate pairs were classified as concordant (closely related), discordant (different strain), and indeterminate or nontypeable by standardized criteria. Finally, to determine if microbiological failures were due to treatment-emergent resistance development, susceptibility results for any concordant isolate pairs was examined further using a &#x02265;four-fold increase in MIC values for besifloxacin or moxifloxacin as indicative of antimicrobial resistance development during study treatment.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Study populations</title><p>A total of 2393 patients were enrolled across the three studies, 2387 patients were randomized and treated, and of these 43.6% (1041/2387) were culture-confirmed.

The current analysis includes microbiological eradication data for 1324 bacterial pathogens across the three studies.</p><p>As expected, the most frequently isolated pathogens (<italic>H. influenzae</italic>, <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>, <italic>S. aureus</italic>, and <italic>S. epidermidis</italic>) were consistent with those isolated in each of the pooled studies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-opth-5-1359">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-opth-5-1359">18</xref> Also, the relative frequencies of each of these pathogens were similar to those previously reported in patients with bacterial conjunctivitis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-opth-5-1359">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28-opth-5-1359">28</xref> A detailed analysis of the causative organisms of bacterial conjunctivitis observed in the pooled studies along with their baseline antimicrobial susceptibility profiles is provided in the companion paper by Haas et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-opth-5-1359">19</xref></p><p>Consistent with the individual study results,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-opth-5-1359">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-opth-5-1359">18</xref> integrated microbiological eradication rates with besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension were generally 90% or better at visit 2 (day 4 or 5), attesting to the reproducibility of the clinical microbiological eradication data for besifloxacin. Besifloxacin treatment resulted in microbiological eradication outcomes that were superior to those observed with vehicle treatment and similar to those observed with moxifloxacin treatment. This was the case for the overall eradication (ie, all isolates) for Gram-positive and Gram-negative isolates and individual species despite the presence of drug resistance phenotypes at baseline (see companion paper by Haas et al).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-opth-5-1359">19</xref> In addition, 100% of the less frequently isolated pathogens from genera of ophthalmic interest (<italic>Moraxella</italic> spp. [n = 8], <italic>Neisseria</italic> spp. [n = 5], <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> [n = 4], and <italic>Serratia marcescens</italic> [n = 3]) treated with besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension were successfully eradicated (data not shown).</p><p>There were few microbiological eradication failures with either of the active treatments at either of the follow-up visits. There was no association between eradication failure and any particular bacterial species and/or the presence of viral co-infection. Of the failures, approximately half were imputed due to missing data, while the majority of the observed failures were due to persistence of the baseline pathogens at the follow-up visit. Few failures in the active-treatment groups were due to a reduction in bacterial count below the Cagle threshold without complete eradication. As expected, the proportion of microbial eradication failures in eyes treated with vehicle was higher, as was the percentage of eradication failures due to proliferation of the baseline pathogen. Visit 3 (days 8 or 9) microbiological eradication rates for both of the active treatments were slightly lower than those observed at visit 2. These results were consistent with the lack of antimicrobial treatment beyond day 5. As expected, microbial eradication failures decreased between visit 2 and visit 3 in vehicle-treated eyes, presumably due to individual host immune factors that characterize this self-limited disease.</p><p>Further investigation showed that microbiological eradication failures in the active treatment groups were not due to antimicrobial resistance at baseline or antimicrobial resistance development during study treatment. There was no apparent relationship between microbiological eradication failures and besifloxacin MIC values for the pathogen at baseline in besifloxacin-treated eyes, although the results were not as clear for isolates from moxifloxacin-treated eyes. In fact, all isolates with MICs &#x02265; 2 &#x003bc;g/mL from besifloxacin-treated eyes were successfully eradicated; whereas 11.8% of moxifloxacin-treated infections with MICs &#x02265; 2 &#x003bc;g/mL were not eradicated. The majority of isolate pairs from eyes with microbiological failures were determined to be concordant based on PFGE banding pattern, and susceptibility data for these isolate pairs did not reveal any &#x02265; four-fold increases in MIC, indicating that there was no development of fluoroquinolone resistance during the treatment period.</p><p>Most pathogens isolated from patients with bacterial conjunctivitis are components of the normal lid and nasopharyngeal flora.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-opth-5-1359">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-opth-5-1359">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27-opth-5-1359">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29-opth-5-1359">29</xref> It follows that microbiological eradication failures observed in eyes treated with besifloxacin or moxifloxacin may not be actual eradication failures but rather the result of eradication and subsequent recolonization/reinfection of eyes with the same strains of bacteria present at baseline. It should be noted that the characterization of the majority of observed eradication failures being due to persistence of the baseline pathogen does not distinguish between true persistence and eradication followed by recolonization/reinfection. While recolonization/ reinfection with the baseline pathogen could explain the observed eradication failures, especially those additional failures observed after treatment termination in the active treatment groups, it should be noted that no anti-infective studied to date has yielded a 100% microbiological eradication rate. A recent systematic review of placebo-controlled bacterial conjunctivitis studies reported rates from 64.8% to 94.3% depending on the time of assessment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-opth-5-1359">3</xref> From the data presented here, it is clear that the relatively low rate (&#x0003c;10%) of microbiological eradication failures in besifloxacintreated eyes is not associated with decreased susceptibility of the causative bacteria at baseline and/or de novo development/ acquisition of drug resistance during treatment with this topical ophthalmic agent.</p><p>A limitation of each study included in this analysis is the absence of a nontreatment control. Both besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension and its vehicle contain benzalkonium chloride (BAK), a quaternary ammonium compound with bacteriostatic as well as bactericidal activity,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30-opth-5-1359">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31-opth-5-1359">31</xref> as a preservative. BAK could in theory contribute to bacterial eradication rates in both the vehicle treatment group and besifloxacin treatment group. Without inclusion of a true nontreatment control, the full treatment effect of besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension cannot be determined.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension, 0.6%, administered topically TID for 5 days demonstrated a consistently high rate of clinical microbiological eradication, generally 90% or better, for the causative agents of bacterial conjunctivitis across three independent, prospective, and double-masked bacterial conjunctivitis studies. Microbiological eradication failures were few and were not related to fluoroquinolone resistance at baseline and/or resistance development during treatment.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>Species identification, antibacterial susceptibility testing, and PFGE analysis was performed by Covance Laboratory Services, Inc
