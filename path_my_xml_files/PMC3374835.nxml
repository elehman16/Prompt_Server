This study investigated the effects of meal frequency on 24 h profiles of metabolic markers and substrate partitioning.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Twelve (BMI:21.6&#x000b1;0.6 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) healthy male subjects stayed after 3 days of food intake and physical activity standardization 2&#x000d7;36 hours in a respiration chamber to measure substrate partitioning. All subjects randomly received two isoenergetic diets with a Low meal Frequency (3&#x000d7;; LFr) or a High meal Frequency (14&#x000d7;; HFr) consisting of 15 En&#x00025; protein, 30 En&#x00025; fat, and 55 En&#x00025; carbohydrates. Blood was sampled at fixed time points during the day to measure metabolic markers and satiety hormones.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Glucose and insulin profiles showed greater fluctuations, but a lower AUC of glucose in the LFr diet compared with the HFr diet. No differences between the frequency diets were observed on fat and carbohydrate oxidation. Though, protein oxidation and RMR (in this case SMR &#x0002b; DIT) were significantly increased in the LFr diet compared with the HFr diet. The LFr diet increased satiety and reduced hunger ratings compared with the HFr diet during the day.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The higher rise and subsequently fall of insulin in the LFr diet did not lead to a higher fat oxidation as hypothesized. The LFr diet decreased glucose levels throughout the day (AUC) indicating glycemic improvements.

Energy intake is influenced by the effect of food&#x02019;s energy density, total energy content and meal frequency and the extent to which these alter satiety. Of these factors, meal frequency has received least attention <xref rid="pone.0038632-Solomon1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>.</p><p>Epidemiological evidence indicates increasing trends in recent years of dietary snacking and increased meal frequency <xref rid="pone.0038632-Samuelson1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0038632-BerteusForslund1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. The current literature is mixed with regard to the efficacy of increased meal frequency (or snacking) regimens in causing metabolic alterations, particularly in relation to weight management <xref rid="pone.0038632-Solomon1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Increasing eating frequency has been postulated to increase metabolism, reduce hunger and food cravings (better appetite control), improve glucose and insulin control, and reduce body weight and body fat storage <xref rid="pone.0038632-Leidy1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. However, there are suggestions from experimental studies to date as well as from cross-sectional epidemiological studies, in which energy intake underreporting is taken into account, that greater eating frequency (snacking) may promote positive energy balance in free-living adults <xref rid="pone.0038632-Chapelot1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0038632-McCrory1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. On the other hand, well-controlled intervention studies do not support an association between eating frequency and body weight <xref rid="pone.0038632-McCrory1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0038632-Palmer1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p><p>Eating three meals a day is suggested to result in a higher postprandial insulin peak due to the higher carbohydrate (CHO) intake and thereby increasing cellular glucose uptake and oxidation. As a consequence, dietary fat is primarily stored in the adipose tissue (insulin stimulated activation of lipo-protein lipase) during the postprandial phase. In between meals, the fasting state, when insulin levels are decreased and lipolysis is activated this substrate flux is reversed <xref rid="pone.0038632-Miller1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0038632-Astrup1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p><p>Given the inconclusive evidence in the literature regarding meal frequency and its metabolic implications, very well-controlled trials are necessary to resolve speculation that the current increase in snacking habits contribute by its metabolic changes during the day to the escalating obesity epidemic. For that reason, the aim of the present study was to investigate the mechanistic effects of meal frequency on 24 hr insulin, glucose profiles, appetite profiles and substrate partitioning under well-controlled energy balance conditions. We hypothesized that in an energy balanced situation eating 3 meals a day gives better opportunities to turn the metabolic flux into a prolonged fasting state with a higher fat oxidation compared to eating 14 meals a day where subjects remain in a continuous postprandial status.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>The protocol for this trial is available as supporting information; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0038632.s001">Protocol S1</xref>.</p><table-wrap id="pone-0038632-t001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0038632.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Subject characteristics at baseline.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone-0038632-t001-1" xlink:href="pone.0038632.t001"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Subject characteristics</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Group (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;12)</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (yrs)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">23&#x000b1;1.2(18&#x02013;31)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">BMI (kg/m<sup>2</sup>)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">21.6&#x000b1;0.6 (19.1&#x02013;24.6)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Fat free mass (kg)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">62.1&#x000b1;1.3 (52.1&#x02013;67.8)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Body fat (&#x00025;)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">14.1&#x000b1;1.4 (5.1&#x02013;21.6)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Systolic blood pressure (mm/Hg)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">114&#x000b1;2.9 (98&#x02013;133)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Diastolic blood pressure (mm/Hg)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">69&#x000b1;2.3 (59&#x02013;83)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Fasting glucose level (mmol/L)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5.2&#x000b1;0.1 (4.8&#x02013;5.7)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2 h glucose level after OGTT (mmol/L)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.1&#x000b1;0.3 (3.2&#x02013;7.1)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Fasting insulin level (mU/L)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">13.4&#x000b1;2.9 (5.9&#x02013;44.6)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">OGIS<sub>120</sub> (ml/min<sup>/</sup>.m<sup>2</sup>)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">455.1&#x000b1;8.5 (396&#x02013;495)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">HOMA<sub>IR</sub>

The chamber is ventilated with fresh air at a rate of 70&#x02013;80 l/min. The ventilation rate was measured with a dry gas meter (type 4; Schlumberger; Dordrecht, The Netherlands).

Ingoing air was analysed one every 15 minutes and outgoing air once every 5 minutes. The gas sample to be measured was selected by a computer, which also stored and processed the data. Physical activity was monitored using a radar system, which is based on the Doppler principle. 24 h urine samples were collected in containers with 10 ml HCL to prevent nitrogen loss by evaporation. The 24 h urine nitrogen concentration was used to calculate total daily nitrogen excretion, which was measured with a nitrogen analyzer (CHN-O-Rapid; Heraeus, Hanau, Germany). 24 h EE was calculated from 08.00 hours (first morning) to 08.00 hours (second morning). Diet induced thermogenesis (DIT) was calculated by plotting EE against radar output; both averaged over 30-minutes periods. The radar output during stepping has been excluded, because it is not reliable measurement for the 24 h EE components calculation. The intercept of the regression line at the lowest radar output represents the EE in the inactive state (resting metabolic rate; RMR), consisting of DIT and SMR.

Nevertheless, no effect of meal frequency was observed on substrate partitioning of CHO and fat. Protein oxidation, RMR (in this case SMR &#x0002b; DIT) and appetite control increased significantly in the LFr diet compared with the HFr diet.</p><p>Our results are in accordance with findings from Solomon et al. <xref rid="pone.0038632-Solomon1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, who found that 2 meals per day led to greater fluctuations in glucose, insulin, and ghrelin responses (i.e. greater peaks and lower troughs) compared with the 12 meals per day assessed throughout an 8-h period. Nevertheless, the lower AUC of glucose in the LFr indicates glycemic improvements, we suggest that this can lead to a better body weight control on the long term.</p><p>The CGMS data showed the glycemic excursions and clearly indicated the differences between the two diets during the day. However, baseline values are somewhat lower than the glucose levels measured at the fixed time points. The accuracy of the sensor has been discussed and discrepancies occasionally were seen between interstitial tissue and blood glucose levels in detecting low glucose values. Therefore, the CGMS is a good method to assess patterns of glycemic excursions and not the absolute degree of glycemic excursions <xref rid="pone.0038632-McDonnell1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.</p><p>The higher rise and subsequently fall of insulin in the LFr diet was suggested to result in a higher fat oxidation, which was not observed in this study. These findings are in line with a review by Bellisle <xref rid="pone.0038632-Bellisle1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> and a recent review by Leidy et al, who discussed eating frequency and energy regulation in controlled feeding studies <xref rid="pone.0038632-Leidy1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Those reviews also indicated that eating frequency appears to have no effect on energy expenditure. Another explanation might be that the insulin levels did not increase high enough to inhibit fat oxidation in the HFr diet. Maybe a certain threshold has to be reached before substantial inhibition will occur. The half-maximal suppression of lipolysis is seen at around 120 pmol/l (17 &#x000b5;U/ml) of insulin, and at the peak of insulin after a typical carbohydrate breakfast (400&#x02013;500 pmol/l; 57&#x02013;72 &#x000b5;U/ml), adipocytes lipolysis will be maximally suppressed <xref rid="pone.0038632-Frayn1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. In addition, Mandarino et al. demonstrated with euglycemic insulin infusions that basal rates of FFA and fat oxidation were suppressed by 70&#x02013;80&#x00025; at an insulin level of 20&#x02013;25 &#x000b5;U/ml and were essentially completely suppressed at insulin concentrations &#x0003e;50 &#x000b5;U/ml <xref rid="pone.0038632-Mandarino1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Our data showed insulin levels between 30 and 40 &#x000b5;U/ml in the HFr diet, which suggests that the threshold for maximal suppression of lipolysis was not reached in these subjects.</p><p>Protein oxidation increased significantly in the LFr diet, which could be explained by body&#x02019;s limited capacity to store protein. The larger portion size and thus absolute amount of protein intake at each meal in the LFr diet resulted consequently in a higher protein oxidation. We speculate that the lower protein oxidation in the HFr diet might be a relevant dietary strategy in elderly to increase daily protein uptake and preserve lean tissue, because aging is accompanied by a progressive decline in skeletal muscle mass, also known as sarcopenia <xref rid="pone.0038632-CruzJentoft1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Additionally, it is suggested that the postprandial rise in plasma essential amino acids concentration, particularly leucine, defines the subsequent postprandial rate of muscle protein synthesis <xref rid="pone.0038632-Pennings1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Nevertheless, observed changes in protein metabolism on whole-body level do not necessarily represent changes on muscle level <xref rid="pone.0038632-Nair1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Therefore, more research is necessary to investigate effects of different meal frequencies in elderly and in particular on muscle protein synthesis.</p><p>The trend of a higher DIT (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.094) and SMR in the LFr diet is translated into a significantly higher RMR. This is a relevant observation because a low RMR is considered a risk factor for weight gain leading to obesity <xref rid="pone.0038632-Ravussin2" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. The higher RMR in the LFr diet might have been stimulated by a plasma insulin induced increase in the activity of the sympathetic nervous system <xref rid="pone.0038632-Rowe1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0038632-Berne1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Other studies reported that no changes in RMR were observed as a result of increased meal frequency <xref rid="pone.0038632-VerboeketvandeVenne1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0038632-Taylor1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. However, these studies investigated meal frequency at a range of 2 vs. 7, and our study investigated meal frequency at a larger range (3 vs. 14).</p><p>Consuming the LFr diet resulted in increased feelings of satiety (AUC), and more inhibition of the satiety hormone ghrelin-active after breakfast and decreased feelings of hunger (AUC) throughout the day. Hence, we suggest that the LFr diet resulted in a better appetite control, although subsequent food intake (ad libitum meals) has not been measured in present study. Therefore, the results should be interpreted with caution. On the contrary, studies examining nibbling (small, frequent meals) compared to gorging (large, few meals) under isoenergetic conditions over a range of meal frequencies from 2 to 12 meals/d provided conflicting evidence, but over a narrower range suggest there may be some tendency for a 6-meals/d pattern to improve appetite control relative to a 3-meals/d pattern <xref rid="pone.0038632-McCrory2" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. A point to consider when interpreting the study findings includes the energy level of the study diets (varied from energy restriction to isoenergetic) and resulting meal portions. The differential responses between smaller and larger eating occasions may simply be due to the inability of the body to detect the size of a smaller eating occasion as an adequate physiological load, reducing or eliminating the eating-related responses typically observed when larger eating occasions occur <xref rid="pone.0038632-Leidy1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p><p>We designed this study to investigate different meal frequencies under isoenergetic well-controlled conditions, eliminating differences in energy balance as a confounding factor. Furthermore, potential interactions with factors such as dietary composition, food form, nutritional quality, and portion size served were also minimal in this study. A disadvantage of this study design is that the changes in feelings of hunger and satiety could not result in adjustments in subsequent energy intake since the diet was not <italic>ad libitum</italic>. Accordingly, it is difficult to generalize these metabolic results to a daily life setting. It is unclear what will happen when subjects consume meals with a higher frequency, have <italic>ad libitum</italic> access to food and how this would affect total energy intake. In addition, in our study a snack was chosen to represent a smaller-sized portion of a typical meal taken more frequently throughout the day. In a free-living situation snacks are generally high-sugar or high-fat foods <xref rid="pone.0038632-Solomon1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref> and therefore total energy intake probably will increase.</p><p>The subjects of our study were young and healthy, therefore they have a good capacity to switch between substrates, which indicate a high metabolic flexibility. However, when subjects are overweight, obese or have type 2 diabetes their metabolic flexibility is reduced. For that reason, subjects with metabolic inflexibility could have more difficulties handling a high meal frequency diet and this would be interesting to investigate in the future.</p><p>In conclusion, glucose and insulin profiles showed greater fluctuations, but a lower AUC of glucose in the LFr diet compared with the HFr diet. The higher peaks and subsequently lower troughs of insulin in the LFr diet did not lead to a higher fat oxidation as hypothesized. RMR and appetite control increased in the LFr diet, which can be relevant for body weight control on the long term. However, this was studied for one day in young healthy males, which are very metabolic flexible. Therefore, populations at risk related to substrate partitioning and long-term effects have to be studied before firm conclusions can be made about the mechanistic effects of meal frequency on the metabolic profile and substrate partitioning.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0038632.s001"><label>Protocol S1</label><caption><p>
