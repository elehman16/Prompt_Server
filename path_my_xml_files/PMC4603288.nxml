In fact, many patients with type 2 diabetes who undergo bariatric surgery achieve complete remission of their disease (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). It has been proposed that, in addition to the known therapeutic effects of weight loss on glycemic control, surgical procedures that involve anatomical bypass of the upper gastrointestinal (UGI) tract, such as Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery, have weight loss-independent effects in ameliorating type 2 diabetes (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). One of the most compelling arguments for weight loss-independent effects of UGI tract bypass surgery is the observation that remission of type 2 diabetes without weight loss has occurred in patients who have had duodenal-jejunal bypass (DJB) surgery (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).</p><p id="P6">However, these data are based on case reports and small patient series, which can be influenced by inherent bias associated with observational studies. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are considered the most robust method for evaluating the efficacy of an intervention and are needed to reliably demonstrate a cause-and-effect relationship between an intervention and a clinical outcome.</p><p id="P7">The purpose of the present study was to conduct a 1-year RCT to evaluate the effect of modified DJB surgery (DJB with minimal gastric resection) on glycemic control, oral glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, &#x003b2;-cell function, and diabetes remission in patients with type 2 diabetes. This procedure involves creating a duodenojejunostomy, which prevents ingested nutrients from direct contact with the duodenum and proximal jejunum, in conjunction with resection of the gastric fundus to reduce the risk of impaired gastric emptying observed after DJB alone. A 5-hour modified oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed in patients randomized to DJB surgery or continued standard care before and at 1, 6 and 12 months after surgery or after beginning standard care.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="S6"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S7" sec-type="subjects"><title>Subjects</title><p id="P8">Between May 2012 and October 2013, a total of 247 potential subjects who were seen at the University Hospital of the Sao Paulo University School of Medicine, Brazil, were screened for this study. Twenty-three of these subjects were considered eligible to participate in the study and were randomized to treatment with either DJB with minimal gastric resection (DJBm) (n=12) or standard care (n=11). All subjects had type 2 diabetes and were overweight (body mass index [BMI] 25.0-29.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) or had class I or II obesity (BMI 30.0-39.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). Potential subjects who had a history of diabetes for more than 10 years, plasma c-peptide &#x0003c;1 &#x003bc;g/mL, or were being treated with insulin were excluded. Additional exclusion criteria included age &#x02265;65 yrs old, previous gastrointestinal surgery, history of cancer in the last 5 years, plasma creatinine &#x0003e;1.5 mg/dL, and alcohol or drug abuse.</p><p id="P9">During the 12-month follow up, 4 subjects in the Standard Care group and 2 in the Surgery group discontinued the study because they no longer wanted to participate in the study for personal reasons and withdrew consent (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Figure S1</xref>). Therefore, data were collected and final analyses were performed on a total of 17 subjects, 10 in the Surgery group (age 47&#x000b1;8 yrs old, BMI=29.7&#x000b1;1.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) and 7 in the Standard Care group (44&#x000b1;5, BMI=31.7&#x000b1;3.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>).</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Study protocol</title><p id="P10">This study was conducted at the Center of Excellence of Bariatric and Metabolic Surgery, Hospital Oswaldo Cruz, and Department of Surgery, University Hospital, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil, and Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, USA. The surgical procedure and the 5-hour OGTT were performed at The University of Sao Paulo Hospital in Sao Paulo, and the analysis of data and mathematical modeling were conducted at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. All subjects provided written informed consent before participating in this study, which was approved by the Institutional Review Board of University Hospital, University of Sao Paulo. This study was registered in the Current Controlled Trials website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov">http://ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link>, NCT01771185).</p><p id="P11">After subjects fasted for 12 h overnight, they were admitted to the outpatient clinical research unit, where a modified 5-h OGTT was performed. A 5-h OGTT, rather than a 2-h OGTT, was performed to permit assessment of the full time course of the glucose, insulin, and c-peptide response to glucose ingestion including a nearly complete return to baseline. Subjects stopped taking all hypoglycemic medications 2 days before the OGTT. Baseline blood samples were obtained for plasma glucose, insulin, c-peptide, HbA1C, and lipid profile. Subjects then ingested 75 g of glucose given as a liquid drink, and blood samples were obtained at 10, 20, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 240, and 300 min after ingestion to determine plasma glucose, insulin and c-peptide concentrations.</p><p id="P12">Subjects randomized to the Standard Care group were treated in accordance to the guidelines provided by the Federal Health Authority of Brazil. Patients were instructed to monitor their blood glucose concentrations every day; at each monthly visit the subject's dietary habits were reviewed and discussed with the study dietitian (T.S.) and a medical evaluation was performed by the study (T.Z.P.), and medications adjusted accordingly.</p><p id="P13">Subjects randomized to the Surgery group underwent laparoscopic DJB surgery with partial gastrectomy within 2 weeks of the baseline 5-h modified OGTT. All surgery procedures were performed by the same surgeon (R.C.) at University Hospital, University of Sao Paulo. The surgical technique consisted of a Roux-en-Y duodenojejunostomy in conjunction with a minimal proximal gastrectomy over a 62F bougie, equivalent to a &#x0201c;fundectomy&#x0201d; and resulting in about a 15% reduction in gastric volume (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). A minimal proximal gastric resection was performed to enhance gastric emptying, because delayed gastric emptying was observed in previous patients who had DJB surgery alone. The duodenum was transected 1&#x02013;2 cm below the pylorus, and the jejunum was transected 80 cm from the ligament of Treitz. The proximal end of the jejunum was anastomosed end-to-end to the subpyloric duodenum, and the distal end of the jejunum was anastomosed end-to-side to the jejunum, 150 cm from the duodenojejunostomy. Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis was provided by using sequential compressive devices and subcutaneous injections of low molecular-weight heparin during hospitalization. After surgery, all subjects consumed clear liquids for 5 days, followed by pureed food for 5 days, before advancing to a regular diet. All subjects were treated with a proton pump inhibitor for one month after surgery. One subject had a postoperative complication: a duodenal-jejunal anastomotic leak occurred 36 h after surgery, which was surgically repaired without further complications.</p><p id="P14">Both the Standard Care group and the Surgery group returned at 1, 6, and 12 months to assess body weight, use of diabetes medications, and plasma lipids, and to complete the 5-h modified OGTT test.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Sample collection and analysis</title><p id="P15">Blood samples were collected in chilled tubes containing sodium ethylenediamine-tetra-acetate and placed on ice.

Glycosylated hemoglobin was determined by using HPLC and the Variant II Hemoglobin Testing System (Bio-Rad Laboratories Diagnostic Group, Hercules, CA).

Insulin sensitivity was also evaluated by using the oral glucose insulin sensitivity (OGIS) index which uses blood samples obtained before and at 120 and 180 min after the 75 g oral glucose load to estimate the glucose clearance rate (mL/min/m<sup>2</sup>), which has been shown to correlate with values achieved by using the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp procedure (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). The area under the curve (AUC) for glucose during the 300 min after glucose ingestion was calculated by using the trapezoidal rule (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Several indices of &#x003b2;-cell function were determined: 1) insulin secretion rate (ISR) calculated by deconvolution of plasma c-peptide concentrations (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>); 2) ISR AUC/glucose AUC during the 300 min after glucose ingestion, which is an overall index of &#x003b2;-cell response or sensitivity to glucose (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>); and 3) acute insulinogenic index, assessed as the increase in plasma insulin divided by the increase in plasma glucose at 30 min of the OGTT [(insulin<sub>30</sub> &#x02212; insulin<sub>0</sub>) &#x000f7; (glucose<sub>30</sub> &#x02212; glucose<sub>0</sub>)] (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).</p><p id="P17">A scoring system based on the number of medications being taken and medication dose was used to assess the use of diabetes medications (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).

Partial remission was defined as A1C &#x0003c;6.5% and fasting glucose 100&#x02013;125 mg/dL (5.6&#x02013;6.9 mmol/L) in the absence of active pharmacologic therapy.</p></sec><sec id="S12"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p id="P19">All data sets were tested for normality according to Shapiro-Wilks, and non-normally distributed variables were log-transformed for analysis and back-transformed for presentation.

When significant interactions between time and group were found, the effect of time within each group was evaluated by one-way repeated measures ANOVA, and differences between groups at each time point were evaluated by Student's independent t-test. Results are presented as means with SDs (for normally distributed variables) or 95% CIs (for not-normally distributed variables), unless otherwise indicated.

Accordingly, overweight and obese patients with type 2 diabetes were randomized to receive either standard care or undergo DJBm. Compared with standard care, DJBm demonstrated several beneficial effects on glucose homeostasis, specifically an improvement in: 1) oral glucose tolerance (decreased 2-hr OGTT glucose concentration), 2) insulin sensitivity (decreased HOMA-IR and increased OGIS), 3) the early insulin response to a glucose load (increased insulinogenic index), and 4) overall glycemic control (reduction in HbA1c with less diabetes medications). However, DJBm also induced moderate (&#x0223c;10%) weight loss, which can improve glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, &#x003b2;-cell response to glucose, and glycemic control (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), making it impossible to separate the effect of weight loss, itself, from UGI tract bypass on the observed benefits in metabolic function. Moreover, no subject who had DJBm experienced remission of their diabetes, suggesting that marked weight loss is an important contributor to high rate of diabetes remission observed after RYGB surgery (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>).</p><p id="P29">The results from the present study provide additional insights into the mechanism responsible for RYGB-induced weight loss. Although both RYGB and DJBm involve anatomical bypass of the UGI tract, weight loss after RYGB is usually three-fold greater than the weight loss we observed after DJBm. Furthermore, weight loss after DJBm was greater than the weight loss we previously found after DJB alone (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). In total, these findings suggest that resection or bypass of the stomach per se, rather than bypass of the UGI tract, is primarily responsible for weight loss induced by RYGB surgery. However, the specific hormonal, metabolic, or neural mediator(s) responsible for the profound RYGB-induced weight loss effect is not known. The potential importance of the stomach in regulating food intake is further supported by the considerable weight loss observed after sleeve gastrectomy (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>), which removes a large portion of the stomach but does not divert ingested food away from the UGI tract.</p><p id="P30">The results from several RCTs have demonstrated that RYGB surgery is more effective than intensive medical therapy in achieving successful glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes, and about half of the patients who have RYGB surgery with a marked 25%-30% weight loss achieve complete remission of diabetes (defined as HbA1c &#x0003c;6.0% without diabetes medications) by 1 year after surgery (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). In contrast, none of our subjects who had DJBm with moderate 10% weight loss achieved diabetes remission. It is unlikely that the absence of diabetes remission in our subjects was due to severe and refractory diabetes, none of our subjects had any features that have been associated with poor remission rates, including being treated with insulin, a long duration of diabetes, or age &#x02265;65 yrs old (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Therefore, these results suggest that &#x0003e;10% weight loss is needed to achieve diabetes remission in patients who have had UGI tract bypass. Nonetheless, our data do not mean that UGI tract bypass, itself, does not contribute to an improvement in glycemic control observed after RYGB.</p><p id="P31">An important limitation of our study is the absence of a weight loss-matched control group, which would have been able to separate the effects of moderate weight loss from UGI tract bypass on our different assessments of metabolic function. Nonetheless this limitation does not affect our observation that DJBm did not induce diabetes remission in any subject, despite experiencing a 10% weight loss. In addition, our study demonstrates the importance of including a control group in this type of study. Subjects randomized to SC demonstrated improvements in glycemic control without a change in body weight, presumably caused by an increase in the use of diabetes medications.</p><p id="P32">In summary, we found that DJBm surgery improved metabolic function and glycemic control in overweight and obese subjects with type 2 diabetes. However, this procedure also caused a 10% weight loss, so it is not possible to separate the effect of UGI tract bypass from weight loss itself on the therapeutic effects of surgery. DJBm did not induce diabetes remission in any subject, which suggests that another factor(s), possibly the nearly three-fold greater weight loss observed after RYGB than DJBm, is an important contributor to glycemic control after RYGB surgery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="S25"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><media xlink:href="NIHMS699127-supplement-supplement_1.pdf" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d37e545" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S26"><p>The authors thank the nursing staff for their help in performing the studies, and the study subjects for their participation.
