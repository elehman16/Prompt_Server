Inaccurate risk perception is a common finding in women with a family history of breast cancer attending genetic counseling. As yet, it is unclear how risks should best be communicated in clinical practice. This study protocol describes the design and methods of the BRISC (Breast cancer RISk Communication) study evaluating the effect of different formats of risk communication on the counsellee's risk perception, psychological well-being and decision-making regarding preventive options for breast cancer.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and design</title><p>The BRISC study is designed as a pre-post-test controlled group intervention trial with repeated measurements using questionnaires. The intervention-an additional risk consultation-consists of one of 5 conditions that differ in the way counsellee's breast cancer risk is communicated: 1) lifetime risk in numerical format (natural frequencies, i.e. X out of 100), 2) lifetime risk in both numerical format and graphical format (population figures), <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) lifetime risk and age-related risk in numerical format, 4) lifetime risk and age-related risk in both numerical format and graphical format, and 5) lifetime risk in percentages. Condition 6 is the control condition in which no intervention is given (usual care). Participants are unaffected women with a family history of breast cancer attending one of three participating clinical genetic centres in the Netherlands.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The BRISC study allows for an evaluation of the effects of different formats of communicating breast cancer risks to counsellees. The results can be used to optimize risk communication in order to improve informed decision-making among women with a family history of breast cancer. They may also be useful for risk communication in other health-related services.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN14566836.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Risk communication aims to improve people's understanding of health risks in order to contribute to informed decision-making. Of particular interest and complexity are risks regarding hereditary or familial cancer, such as breast/ovarian or colon cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. It is commonly assumed that 5&#x02013;10% of all breast cancer cases can be attributed to a genetic predisposition, of which the breast cancer genes <italic>BRCA1 </italic>and <italic>BRCA2 </italic>have been identified as most important [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Mutations in these genes increase the lifetime risk of breast cancer substantially, e.g. from a 10% population risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] to a risk of 60&#x02013;85% of developing cancer by age 70 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. However, <italic>BRCA1/2 </italic>mutations account for only a small subgroup of women with a family history of breast cancer. A substantial group of women attending genetic counselling because of their family history have a slightly (11&#x02013;20%) or moderately (20&#x02013;30%) increased risk of getting breast cancer. Genetic counselling generally takes place at specialised centres and focuses on the communication of personalised risk information. The aim is to have a well-informed counsellee, who understands both risks and consequences, and acts accordingly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>The multiple risks and uncertainty of the risks, e.g. because of the incomplete penetrance of <italic>BRCA1/2 </italic>mutations, introduces complexity into risk communication regarding hereditary and familial breast cancer. Based on these complex risk contexts, decisions have to be made such as whether and when to start mammography screening, and, assuming eligibility, whether to test for mutations in <italic>BRCA1/2</italic>, and subsequent decisions in the case of positive or negative genetic test-outcome. Understanding risks is considered to be crucial for informed decision-making [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], whereas inappropriately high (or low) perceptions of risk can lead to various and potentially harmful decisions, for example overscreening due to overestimation of risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Overestimation of risk is also shown to be positively correlated with breast cancer worry, which may affect psychological well-being negatively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Previous studies found a high percentage of unaffected women with a family history of breast cancer overestimating their breast cancer risk, although underestimating also occurred (see review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]). In general, genetic counselling decreases generalized anxiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], and significantly improves the accuracy of women's perceptions of their breast cancer risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], but not necessarily to the correct level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], or for the long term [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Therefore, it is important to identify strategies that will optimize understanding of risk.</p><p>Risk communication in genetic counselling is difficult, not only due to the complexity of the risks involved, but also due to problems that counsellors themselves experience in conveying these risks in an understandable way [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In addition, the counsellee's understanding and retention of the information given may be problematic. Personal experiences with breast cancer and counsellee's personal characteristics could have mediating effects on the efficacy of risk communication. For instance, the impact of a woman's family history can influence her risk perception prior to counselling through phenomena such as "anchoring" or availability heuristics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Additionally, people with a high need for cognition potentially process risk information more thoroughly and have a higher need for additional risk information compared with people with a low need for cognition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Moreover, women who face difficult decisions with respect to, for instance, genetic testing, may cope differently as a result of their dispositional decision-coping patterns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>Regarding the risk communication process, research has shown that the context and format in which genetic risks are presented affect people's risk perception, and their subsequent decisions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Although risk presented in numeric terms are precise and preferred by healthy counsellees [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] and patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], risks in verbal terms (e.g. "a high risk") are generally more familiar and easier to understand. However, the inherent vagueness of verbal risks leads to substantial variation in their interpretation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Risks presented frequentistically (e.g. "1 in 10 cases"), may result in more accurate risk perception and better-founded decisions compared with risks presented in percentages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. When frequencies are used, rates (i.e. X in 100) are easier to understand than proportions (i.e. 1 in X) when comparing risks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. In sum, both numerical and verbal formats have their pros and cons (see also Lipkus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]). Several recommendations have been made directed at the use of graphical displays in risk communication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], which may provide helpful support, particularly for persons with low cognitive capacity such as low levels of numeracy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Baty et al., for example, reported that graphical displays enabled women to quickly understand their risks of getting breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. However, others have shown that risks presented as icons or pictographs (e.g. population figures in 10 rows of 10) did not result in a better understanding, while having a higher affective impact, and were perceived as larger compared to numerical formats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><p>Furthermore, the time horizon in which risks are presented is relevant. Time horizons may raise confusion, especially for long-term cumulative risks such as lifetime breast cancer risks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Short-term risks such as risks for the next ten years may therefore be more meaningful and immediate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], and may result in less overestimation. Research showed that for the presentation of breast cancer risks, women preferred risk information framed over multiple time horizons (10-year-, 20-year- and lifetime horizons) to risk information framed at one time point [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Until now, most studies used hypothetical scenarios in exploring patients' preference for the manner in which risk information is given. However, it is important to discover the best format for communicating cancer risk information in practice tailored to individual counsellees [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><p>Several dimensions or outcomes in evaluating the effectiveness of the risk communication process have been distinguished [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Among these dimensions are, firstly, a cognitive evaluation, which refers to risk perception, and understanding and recalling the information provided. Acquisition of knowledge in the context of familial breast cancer comprises of understanding the nature of (familial) breast cancer, knowledge of personal risk factors, understanding the probability of developing breast cancer when having a genetic predisposition, and understanding what actions can be taken to reduce the risk. A second dimension is psychological well-being, including affective reactions and concern, for example, anxiety, (breast cancer) worries, and intrusive thoughts. A third dimension is the decision-making process including a behavioural evaluation, for example with regard to adherence to recommended behaviours (e.g. monthly breast self-examinations, mammography screening) and other decisions such as informing relatives who may be at risk. Finally, another dimension is how counsellees evaluate the information that is provided, which includes the extent to which the risk information is regarded as helpful and clear by counsellees.</p><p>Currently, protocols in genetic counselling for breast cancer contain no guidelines for the optimal format of risk communication. Therefore, counsellors present risks in ways that seem right to them despite a lack of evidence to support this [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Observational research shows that in breast cancer counselling, risks are given at least half of the time in verbal terms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], and in 25% of the consultations in percentages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>].</p><p>In the Netherlands, current information booklets on hereditary breast cancer to support genetic counselling generally present risks, e.g. chance of developing breast cancer, as absolute percentages with a long-term time horizon ('lifetime risk'). In genetic counselling, generally the same formats are used, although one study recently revealed that a time horizon is not often stated in breast cancer counselling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. In addition, age-related risks regarding breast cancer counselling are usually not communicated, although in other countries, such as the UK, age-related risks are more commonly used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><sec><title>Objectives and research questions</title><p>The main objective of the present study is to evaluate the effects of different formats of risk communication on the counsellee's understanding and perception of the risk (cognitive outcomes), psychological well-being, and decision-making. In particular, we aim to investigate numerical versus graphical risk formats and lifetime breast cancer risks versus age-related risks. The research questions are:</p><p>1) What is the effect of the addition of a graphical format to standard risk information on cognitive outcomes, psychological well-being, and decision-making?</p><p>2) What is the effect of the addition of an age-related format to standard risk information on cognitive outcomes, psychological well-being, and decision-making?</p><p>3) What is the effect of the combination of both the addition of a graphical format and the addition of an age-related format on outcomes compared to research questions 1 and 2 (i.e. effect modification/interaction)?</p><p>4) How do the counsellee's personal experiences and characteristics mediate the effect on the communication of risk?</p><p>This article describes and discusses both the design and the content of the intervention of the BRISC (Breast cancer RISk Communication) study, a multicentre controlled clinical trial, to optimise the communication of breast cancer risks in genetic counselling among women with a family history of breast cancer.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Methods and design</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>The BRISC study is designed as a pre-post-test controlled group intervention trial with repeated measures using questionnaires. The trial is carried out in three of the nine familial cancer clinics in the Netherlands. The Medical Ethics Committees of the VU University Medical Center Amsterdam, the University Medical Center Groningen, and the Leiden University Medical Center approved the protocol in 2005.</p></sec><sec><title>Intervention</title><p>The intervention consists of one additional consultation by a trained "risk counsellor" immediately after a standard genetic counselling session with a clinical geneticist, a clinical geneticist in training, or non-medical genetic counsellor, henceforth defined as a "genetic counsellor" (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Since genetic counselling is seen as a psycho-educational endeavour with both educational and therapeutic elements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], it is considered unethical to ask the genetic counsellors to present the intervention in a standardized and as objective a way as possible, thereby ignoring the specific needs of the patient. In addition, we assume that besides being unethical, it will not be feasible due to an additional workload for genetic counsellors.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Time planning of the intervention and questionnaires in the intervention group (conditions 1&#x02013;5) and control group (condition 6).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2407-8-283-1"/></fig><p>During the additional consultation, risks are communicated in one of five ways (conditions), namely:</p><p>1) lifetime breast cancer risk in numerical format (in natural frequencies, i.e. X out of 100),</p><p>2) lifetime breast cancer risk in both numerical format and graphical format (i.e. population figures in 10 rows of 10),</p><p>3) lifetime breast cancer risk and age-related breast cancer risk in numerical format,</p><p>4) lifetime breast cancer risk and age-related breast cancer risk in both numerical format and graphical format, and</p><p>5) lifetime breast cancer risk in percentages.</p><p>Since the information given during the intervention not only differs from usual care regarding the format of the risks but also to the extent to which the information is structured, two control conditions are included. Condition 5, in which the risk is communicated in percentages as in the standard genetic counselling session (usual care), controls for the effect of giving risk information also in a structured way, enabling us to compare the effects of different risk formats. Condition 6, in which no intervention is given (usual care, henceforth defined as the control group) is used to control for the effect of repetition of the risk information (as compared to condition 5), and will control for Hawthorne effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].</p><p>As is shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>, the intervention includes information about risks of developing breast cancer, and having a hereditary predisposition for breast cancer. This includes: risk for an "average" woman in the Netherlands (population risk), risk for women with a <italic>BRCA1/2 </italic>mutation (carriers), and risk for women with the same family history as the counsellee. An example of risk information given in condition 1 is: "On average, 10 out of every 100 women in the Netherlands will develop breast cancer during their lifetime". In conditions 3 and 4, not only the structure of a cumulative risk is explained, but also age-related risks are presented (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). These age-related risks are computed based on Jonker et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] and comprise breast cancer risks for the next ten years. An example of condition 3 is "In the current situation, on average 2 out of 100 women in the Netherlands of the same age as you (40), will develop breast cancer in the next ten years". In condition 2 and 4 risks are also presented as graphical display (see for example Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Overview of risk information communicated in the intervention</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td align="left"><bold>Population risk:</bold></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Lifetime breast cancer risk: 10 out of 100 for breast cancer patients</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Breast cancer risk due to hereditary causes: 5 to 10 out of 100</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold>Carriers of </bold><bold><italic>BRCA1/BRCA2</italic></bold><bold> mutation:</bold></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Lifetime breast cancer risk: 60 to 80 out of 100</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Risk passing a <italic>BRCA1/BRCA2 </italic>mutation to children: 50 out of 100</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold>Women with the same family history:</bold></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Lifetime breast cancer risk:</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;- 11&#x02013;20 out of 100 for women in a low risk category</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;- 20&#x02013;30 out of 100 for women in a moderate risk category</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;- 30&#x02013;40 out of 100 for women in a high risk category</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Risk having a <italic>BRCA1/BRCA2 </italic>mutation: less than 10 out of 100 and specified if more than 10 out of 100</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Risk communication formats in conditions 1&#x02013;4.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2407-8-283-2"/></fig><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Example of graphical risk format used in condition 4</bold>.

Based on the individual lifetime risk, three breast cancer risk groups are distinguished: low (11&#x02013;20%), moderate (20&#x02013;30%), and high (30&#x02013;40%). These estimates are mostly calculated using the Claus tables and modified Claus method, and primarily based on a woman's age and family history, including the number of first-degree- or second-degree relatives with breast cancer and the ages of onset of breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>].</p><p>Based on these guidelines, consensus is reached for the study to standardize the content and structure of the standard genetic counselling sessions (usual care) by presenting the woman's breast cancer risk as one of three risk groups, and using percentages for presenting risks. A "counselling checklist" is designed to be used as a guideline during the counselling session. The standard counselling procedures will be discussed with all counsellors involved.</p></sec><sec><title>Study population</title><p>Women with a family history of breast cancer who are first-time attendees applying for breast cancer counselling are invited to participate in the study. A family history of breast cancer is defined as having or having had at least one first-degree- and/or paternal second-degree family member with breast cancer. Women are considered ineligible if they are under 18 years of age, have evident psychiatric illness or terminal disease, and are unable to read and write Dutch. Women with a personal history of breast or ovarian cancer are also excluded, because of the complexities in risk counselling of women with a previous history of cancer. Participants are allocated into an intervention or control group (for randomisation procedure, see below). Stratification to first-degree family members is applied to ensure that all family members receive the same condition.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample size and power</title><p>The study will be powered on the main outcome measure, namely (change in) risk perception. In order to be able to detect a clinically relevant difference of 10&#x02013;20% difference between the intervention group and the control group, a sample of 60 women per condition is needed (total n = 360). These calculations are based on a power of 0.80 (1-&#x003b2;) and a significance level of 0.05 (a; two-sided). With an expected drop-out rate of 20%, the sample size for the study is therefore determined at 450. Recruitment and data collection (including follow-up) is anticipated to continue for 31 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Randomisation</title><p>Randomisation takes place at 'condition round' level. The inclusion period is divided into condition rounds using a Latin Square design. Every round takes 5 months and switches when a total of n = 75 is reached.

All participants provide written informed consent. In the intervention group, participants receive a self-administered questionnaire at four points in time (T0, T1, T2, T3), the control group receives this at three points in time (T0, T1C, T2C) (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>):</p><p>- T0 (baseline): The women will receive the first questionnaire at home before their first appointment with the genetic counsellor.</p><p>- T1 (after standard counselling session): A second questionnaire will be given after the standard genetic counselling session with the genetic counsellor and prior to the intervention (additional counselling with the risk counsellor).</p><p>- T2/T1C (2 weeks follow-up): A third questionnaire will be sent to the woman's home address at 2 weeks after the intervention, or a comparable point in time (control group).</p><p>- T3/T2C (6 months follow-up): The final questionnaire will be sent to the woman's home address.</p><p>A maximum of two reminders is sent to participants not returning their questionnaires. The three risk counsellors (one for each clinical genetics centre) who provide the intervention, have been specifically trained for this study. The intervention lasts for approximately 30 minutes. The risk counsellor is informed about the content of the previous standard counselling session by means of a "checklist after standard counselling", which the genetic counsellor fills in immediately after each session. This checklist includes information about the participant's risks e.g. individual estimated risk of getting breast cancer, also describing the risks formats that were used during counselling. When risks are not yet known, because, for instance, medical records need to be checked, intervention takes place after a second visit. Thus, enforcement of an intervention implies that in the genetic counselling session with the genetic counsellor at least the woman's breast cancer risk group (e.g. low, moderate, high) was communicated.</p><p>After the intervention, all participants receive a BRISC brochure in which risks are presented corresponding to the format of the intervention given.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Measures</title><sec><title>Outcome measures</title><p>Outcome measures are classified in four dimensions: 1) cognitive outcomes; 2) psychological well-being; 3) decision-making; 4) evaluation of the intervention (i.e. additional risk consultation).

However, inaccurate risk perception is a common finding in women attending genetic counselling regarding breast cancer. Although the literature provides recommendations for the use of frequencies, graphical displays and short-term risks such as age-related risks (i.e. risks for the next ten years) in risk communication, these recommendations are based primarily on research using hypothetical scenarios. In addition, the recommended approaches are not generally used in standard care. The BRISC study is designed to fill the gaps with an evaluation of the effects of different formats of communicating risks to counsellees facing real decisions in a clinical setting. Results will be used to improve risk communication in order to stimulate informed decision-making among women with a family history of breast cancer.</p><p>The BRISC study is a field study; in other words, a clinical trial which offers a unique opportunity to evaluate effects of different formats of communicating risks to counsellees facing decisions such as informing relatives who may also be at risk, whether and when to start mammography screening, and, assuming eligibility, whether to test for mutations in <italic>BRCA1/2</italic>.</p><p>Quantitative outcome measures are collected using questionnaires at four points in time. The follow-up questionnaire is sent 6 months after the intervention, thereby enabling medium-term effects to be detected. With this comprehensive collected data, it will be possible to clarify the various effects of different formats on four dimensions evaluating the effectiveness of the risk communication process. It is not inconceivable to expect that some formats have positive effects on one of the dimensions and negative effects on another dimension. Additionally, the outcomes of this project will give a better understanding of who, for example, as a function of cognitive capacity, might or might not benefit from different formats.</p><p>Two control conditions are introduced in the BRISC study: condition 5 in which the risk information is communicated in percentages as is commonly done in usual care, and a second control condition (condition 6) in which no intervention is given. With these two control conditions, it is possible to distinguish between the effect of repetition and the effect of giving the risks in a structured way on the one hand, and between the effects of giving the risks in a structured way in different formats on the other.</p><p>Because the genetic counsellor involved has no role in the inclusion of participants, selection bias is restricted, other than from self-selection. Cluster-randomisation is applied as it is too complex to randomise at the level of counsellees because in that case a risk counsellor is asked to give different risk formats of genetic risks to different counselees on the same day. An exception is made for participants who are close family members.</p><p>The risk counsellors who give the intervention are not involved in usual care. This will overcome concerns of contamination bias. All risk counsellors are women, eliminating bias due to gender differences. The Latin Square design and the control group, which is constructed in addition to all condition rounds, both serve to eliminate bias due to time. To achieve uniform risk communication in the genetic counselling sessions, several precautions have been taken (e.g. striving for a standard counselling procedure, "counselling checklist", "checklist after standard counselling"), minimising confounding.</p><p>Some limitations of the BRISC study need to be addressed. This study aims at improving women's understanding of the risks, and we acknowledge that there are factors other than risk that can influence the decision-making process. In addition, although several precautions have been taken to achieve an optimal standardisation in counselling and procedures, interactive features must be acknowledged. Another limitation of this study is that it is not possible to blind the genetic counsellors completely because of the nature of the intervention. This applies to the intervention allocation and to the age-related formats due to anticipation of questions by the counsellee. Participants are informed that the BRISC study concerned different kinds of risk counselling and are blinded. Furthermore, although we would have preferred to test an integrated intervention in standard counselling sessions, it is not considered feasible, either ethically or practically, to have the intervention done in a structured way by the genetic counsellors themselves. If one of the formats proves to be most effective, this format could be integrated into the standard counselling session. Since members of the research team provided the additional consultations (interventions), implementation of a format in daily practice will need to receive further attention.</p><p>Finally, results may be extended to women with a personal history of cancer, other cancers, and also other diseases and settings, but further study would be required. Imprudent generalization should be avoided, although the BRISC study may provide an indication for risk communication in healthcare in general and cancer genetic counselling in particular.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>CO is responsible for data collection and drafted the manuscript.
