techniques in the management of patients with adhesive capsulitis. [Subjects and Methods]
Thirty non-diabetic men and women with adhesive capsulitis were randomly allocated to the
reverse distraction group (n=15) or Kaltenborn group (n=15). The reverse distraction
technique and Kaltenborn&#x02019;s caudal and posterior glides (grades III and IV) were applied
10&#x02013;15 times along with conventional physical therapy for 18 treatment sessions in 6 weeks.
Pain was measured with a visual analog scale, abduction and external rotation range of
motion with goniometry, hand behind back reach with inch tape, and functional disability
with the Flexilevel scale of shoulder function before and after the treatment. [Results]
Although all the variables improved significantly in both groups after 18 intervention
sessions, reverse distraction was significantly better than Kaltenborn&#x02019;s caudal and
posterior glides in decreasing pain and improving abduction range of motion and functional
scores. [Conclusion] This study supports the clinical use of reverse distraction as an
alternative to conventional mobilization techniques to decrease pain and improve range of
motion and functional scores in patients with adhesive capsulitis.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Reverse distraction technique</kwd><kwd>Kaltenborn&#x02019;s glide</kwd><kwd>Adhesive capsulitis</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Adhesive capsulitis can be defined as a common condition characterized by insidious and
gradual inflammation of the glenohumeral joint capsule leading to its contracture and thus
resulting in stiffness and loss of shoulder mobility<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. The prevalence rate has been reported to be 2&#x02013;5.3%<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>,
with individuals in the age group between 40 to 70&#x02005;years commonly affected<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Secondary adhesive capsulitis is a result
of a pre-existing shoulder condition such as dislocation, humeral fracture, and
osteoarthritis or a neurological condition leading to muscular imbalances. The prevalence of
secondary adhesive capsulitis related to type 2 diabetes and thyroid disease is between 4.3%
and 38%<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>According to the literature, inflammatory changes in the capsule and synovium of the
glenohumeral joint are responsible for contracture of the capsule<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. This contracture brings the humeral head close to the glenoid
fossa<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. The overall active and passive
range of motion (ROM) of the shoulder joint in the capsular pattern is reduced, with the
largest changes in ROM observed, in descending order, in external rotation, abduction, and
internal rotation<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. These limitations in
shoulder motion, which are referred to as frozen shoulder, greatly affect patient&#x02019;s
activities of daily living<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Although this condition is found to be self-limiting and gradually resolves within 3&#x02005;years
in most patients<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>, the course of the
disease can extended beyond 3&#x02005;years in some cases<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. This results in a greater emotional and economic distress, with
the patient suffering from long-term pain and limited shoulder movement<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Joint mobilization, including Maitland&#x02019;s oscillatory techniques and Kaltenborn&#x02019;s sustained
stretch technique, is used clinically to treat adhesive capsulitis. The purpose of the
mobilizing exercise therapy for a frozen shoulder is primarily to increase shoulder movement
by stretching the glenohumeral joint capsule<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. Research has shown that Maitland&#x02019;s and Kaltenborn&#x02019;s techniques are
similarly effective in reducing pain and improving ROM in adhesive capsulitis patients.</p><p>These techniques mobilize the glenohumeral joint while keeping the scapula fixed relative
to the thorax and glenohumeral joint<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>.
To improve the external rotation ROM of the shoulder, glenohumeral anterior glide
mobilization has been used by physical therapists, which follows the principle of the
&#x0201c;convex on concave rule&#x0201d; of joint movement. Harryman et al.<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup> postulated the capsular constraint mechanism, which contrasts the
convex on concave theory. Some researchers have found that the external and internal
rotation ROM increases with posterior gliding manipulation of the shoulder<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus, according to Roubal et al.<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>, caudal glide increased flexion and abduction ROM. Johnson et
al.<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup> conducted a randomized control
trial in 20 patients with adhesive capsulitis, which compared anterior and posterior glide
mobilization with lateral traction of the glenohumeral joint. It was concluded that an
increase in external rotation ROM can be achieved by Kaltenborn&#x02019;s grade III posterior glide
mobilization. Sarkari et al.<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup> also
suggested that glenohumeral abduction ROM in these patients can be improved by end-range
caudal and posterior glide mobilization.</p><p>Stenvers<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup> stated that the glenohumeral
joint capsule can be stretched by fixing the scapula and moving the humerus or by fixing the
humerus and moving the scapula. In terms of biomechanics, it was suggested that during the
movement of the humerus with respect to the scapula, the scapula is eventually fixed, but in
an unnatural position. Furthermore, movement of the humerus causes pain. Because of this
pain, it is not possible to exert force on the glenohumeral joint capsule. For this reason,
movement of the humerus with respect to the fixed scapula, as implemented in traditional
gliding techniques, is not an effective mobilization method. Movement of the scapula with
respect to the humerus is a better mobilization method because it stretches the capsule
directly and is painless. Vermeulen et al.<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup> used this reverse distraction technique on the glenohumeral joint
at different angles of abduction and flexion at end ranges with a purpose of stretching the
contracted periarticular structures in patients with adhesive capsulitis. Their results
showed an increase in mean capacity of the glenohumeral joint capsule, improved active
mobility for flexion and external rotation, and improvement in shoulder function after 3
months of treatment.</p><p>Although both manual shoulder mobilization techniques are widely used in the treatment of
adhesive capsulitis, they are different in terms of therapeutic implementation. Thus,
Kaltenborn&#x02019;s caudal glide and posterior glide techniques involve lateral distraction of the
humeral head followed by caudal and posterior stretch mobilization of the glenohumeral
joint, with the patient in the supine position with the scapula stabilized, whereas the
reverse distraction technique involves glenohumeral distraction at varying angles of
abduction and flexion along with lateral border scapula mobilization via medial and downward
rotation, with the patient in the lateral position.</p><p>Vermeulen et al.<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup> used the reverse
distraction technique in combination with other oscillatory glides to prove that high-grade
mobilization (Maitland grades III and IV) techniques are more effective than low-grade
mobilization (grade I) techniques in the treatment of adhesive capsulitis. The studies
mentioned above used the reverse distraction technique (involving movement of the scapula
relative to the thorax, with the glenohumeral joint distracted) in combination with other
mobilization techniques; at present, there is no evidence proving that reverse distraction
alone can be effective in the management of adhesive capsulitis. Thus, the aim of the
present study was to compare the efficiency of the reverse distraction technique with that
of traditionally used gliding techniques (posterior and caudal glides) in improving joint
mobility and alleviating pain and disability in patients with adhesive capsulitis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Initially, 43 patients were evaluated at a physiotherapy outpatient department, Jamia
Millia Islamia, New Delhi, India. Subjects were included if they had unilateral idiopathic
or primary adhesive capsulitis, were between 40 and 70&#x02005;years old, and had pain, stiffness,
and limitation of passive shoulder lateral rotation, abduction, and internal rotation of
more than 50% compared with the opposite side for at least 3 months. The exclusion criteria
were presence of neurological disorders (e.g., stroke, Parkinson&#x02019;s disease) leading to
deficiency of shoulder muscles activity, diabetes, severe trauma related to painful stiff
shoulder, bony changes or osteoarthritis of the affected shoulder on radiographs, and
previous surgeries and manipulation under anesthesia of the affected shoulder. Ethical
approval was granted by the institutional human ethical committee, and the subjects who
agreed to participate signed written informed consent in accordance with the declaration of
Helsinki. Instructions were given to use their effected arm in activities of daily living
within pain-free limits and to avoid activities demanding resisted movements (e.g.,
gardening, vacuuming, sawing, pulling, pushing, stiff door opening or closing) or lifting
heavy weights. Patients were asked about their occupation, dominant arm, affected arm, time
when they started to experience the discomfort when moving the arm, and any minor or trivial
injury preceding the onset of the symptoms.</p><p>Thirty patients that fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion criteria were recruited and
randomly allocated to one of two treatment groups (15 patients in each): a) reverse
distraction group and b) Kaltenborn&#x02019;s caudal and posterior glide mobilization group. Two
subjects, one from each group, left the study within two weeks of the intervention.
Assessments were made at baseline (before the first treatment session) and after 18
treatment sessions (6 weeks). All the measurements were performed by the same therapist
(SA).</p><p>For assessing pain during shoulder joint movement, subjects used a visual analogue scale
(VAS)<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup> consisting of a 10-cm vertical
line, with one end corresponding to no pain during shoulder movement and the other end to
maximal pain. The reliability of this test was reported to be 0.94 for literate and 0.71 for
illiterate patients<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>. Criterion validity
has not been evaluated because of the absence of a gold standard for pain measurement<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In the present study, active and passive abduction (in the frontal plane) and external
rotation (with the arm at 0 degrees of abduction) ROM was measured with a conventional
goniometer as per the guidelines given by the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup>. Goniometric measurements are highly
reliable provided measurements are conducted by same therapist<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup> (test-retest reliability: 0.94&#x02013;0.98)<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Hand behind back (HBB) reach was measured in centimeters using inch tape with subjects in
the standing position. They were instructed to achieve the maximum HBB reach position by
moving their affected extremity upwards and towards the midline with the thumb extended. In
this position, the distance between the L5 spinous process and the radial styloid process
was measured. The radial styloid process was used to decrease the measurement error related
to movements at the wrist and thumb joints<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><sup>)</sup>. If a patient was not able to reach the posterior inferior iliac
spine (considered as the starting point) with his/her hand, the distance (in centimeters)
was considered negative. If the hand could not reach the midline, measurements were taken by
drawing a horizontal line from the reached position to the central level<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><sup>)</sup>. The distance between the L5 and C7
spinous processes was also measured to normalize the distance between the L5 spinous process
and the radial styloid process, thereby eliminating differences due to variations in
height<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Functional disability was measured with a self-administered, shoulder-specific, fixed-item
index, Flexilevel score of shoulder dysfunction (FLEX-SF). FLEX-SF measures three levels of
function, with each item scoring the level of function as low, medium, or high. Subjects
responded only to the items that reflected their functional level. Scores ranged from 0,
indicating the most limited function, to 60, signifying no functional limits. This scale has
been reported to have a high reliability (ICC=0.90) and validity (responsiveness
index=1.2)<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In the reverse distraction group, patients were asked to lie on their unaffected side at
the edge of a plinth. The upper hand of the therapist was placed on patient&#x02019;s humeral head
just below the acromion for applying glenohumeral distraction at various angles of abduction
and flexion<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. The upper hand maintained
the required angle of abduction or flexion, whereas the lower hand was placed on the lateral
border of the scapula for mobilizing it in medial and downward rotation<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. There were
10&#x02013;15 repetitions per each of 3 treatment sessions administered each week; a total of 18
sessions were performed during 6 weeks. After each session of mobilization, movements within
the active, pain-free ROM were encouraged.</p><p>In the Kaltenborn group, stretch mobilization techniques (glide) were used<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref><sup>)</sup>, which can be characterized as low-rate,
low-amplitude techniques with sustained loading of restricting tissue at the end ranges of
abduction and/or external rotation with a uniform, gliding movement. Each Kaltenborn grade
III glide (&#x0201c;after the slack of the joint has been taken up&#x0201d;) was given for 1 minute for a
total of 15 minutes of sustained stretch, without giving any oscillatory glides.</p><p>For posterior glide, lateral humeral distraction was maintained with abduction in the end
range, with the patient in the supine lying position and the scapula stabilized. The
progression arm was put at the flexion end range, and posterior stretch mobilization was
performed along with lateral humeral distraction.</p><p>For caudal glide, the patient was placed in the supine position with the scapula
stabilized. Lateral humeral distraction was maintained, and caudal stretch mobilization was
done in the resting position of the shoulder joint. For progression of the caudal glide,
lateral humeral distraction was followed by caudal stretch mobilization. Subjects were
treated in 3 sessions per week for 6 weeks. After each session of mobilization, movements
within the active, pain-free ROM were encouraged. Both mobilization techniques were
administered by the same therapist (SA) to minimize the inter-therapist variability.</p><p>The conventional physical therapy treatment for adhesive capsulitis was administered in
both groups. A hot pack was applied as a superficial heating modality at the shoulder joint
for 15&#x02013;20 minutes. For relaxation of the muscles around the shoulder, Codman&#x02019;s pendular
exercises were performed<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref><sup>)</sup>. Four-direction shoulder stretching in forward elevation,
external rotation, horizontal adduction, and internal rotation was performed<xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref><sup>)</sup>. Stretches were performed 2&#x02013;3 times a day
and maintained for 1&#x02013;5 seconds in a comfortable range<xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Experimental results were statistically analyzed using SPSS 21, Windows version. The
Shapiro-Wilk test was applied to assess the normal distribution of scores. All the data were
normal, except VAS and HBB reach. Accordingly, we log-transformed the VAS scores. Since HBB
reach data could not be normalized because of the presence of negative values, a
non-parametric test was applied for analysis. For between-group comparison of demographic
characteristics at baseline, the independent t-test (age, height, and body mass),
&#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test (gender, dominant arm, side of affected arm, occupation, and any
previous minor injury to the affected shoulder recalled by the subject), and Mann-Whitney U
test (duration of symptoms) were employed. Shoulder abduction and external rotation active
and passive ROM, VAS scores for pain, HBB for internal rotation, and FLEX-SF scores at
baseline were analyzed using the independent t-test.</p><p>VAS, abduction and external rotation active and passive ROM, and FLEX SF score were
measured at baseline and at the end of the 6-week therapy (18 treatment sessions) using the
dependent t-test and compared between the groups using the independent t-test. Changes in
HBB reach were assessed using the Wilcoxon signed rank test, and between-group changes were
analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U test. The level of significance was set at p&#x0003c;0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>At baseline, the VAS scores of the two groups were similar (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Comparison of demographic characteristics of patients in the reverse distraction

distraction and Kaltenborn&#x02019;s end-range caudal and posterior glides with lateral distraction,
in adhesive capsulitis patients. The patients were treated for 3 sessions per week for 6
weeks, and changes in pain, ROM, and functional disability were recorded before and after
the intervention. No published study has compared these two techniques directly. Although
some studies have evaluated the effectiveness of the reverse distraction technique along
with other mobilization techniques<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>, the effectiveness of reverse distraction
alone in increasing mobility and reducing pain has not been investigated.</p><p>Most variables were comparable at baseline; however, the right arm was dominant in 13 and
12 cases in the reverse distraction group and Kaltenborn group, respectively. This small
difference was found to be statistically significant. However, a one-unit change between the
groups will hardly influence the result clinically. Similarly, although differences in
affected arm, occupation, and minor injury history were statistically significant between
the groups at baseline, they are unlikely to be important clinically as the groups were
assembled randomly.</p><p>Scapular mobilization has been proven to be an effective treatment technique for improving
shoulder mobility in patients with adhesive capsulitis<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><sup>)</sup>. The corresponding
studies used scapular mobilization procedures, such as superior and caudal gliding, upward
and downward rotations, and distraction of the scapula from the thorax with the patient
lying on the unaffected side. Surenkok et al.<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><sup>)</sup> have suggested that enhanced scapular movement may be due to
disintegration and release of adhesions in the scapulothoracic muscles induced by scapular
mobilization. This increased scapular movement may constitute the mechanism of improving
shoulder movement. The reverse distraction technique, which was proposed by Stenvers<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup> and later used by Vermeulen<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>, is different from the scapular
mobilization technique in that glide is applied to the scapula in the medial and downward
rotation direction, along with lateral distraction at desired elevation angles to the
humerus at the glenohumeral joint, with the patient lying on the unaffected side.</p><p>In this study, there was a significant improvement in pain in both groups, which is in
accordance with previous studies<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>. A decrease in pain after joint
mobilization has been attributed to various mechanisms, such as neurophysiological effects
achieved by the stimulation of type II mechanoreceptors and by inhibition of type IV
nociceptors<xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref><sup>)</sup>, stimulation of Golgi
tendon organ activity, and reflex inhibition of the muscle at the end of the passive joint
mobilization<xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref><sup>)</sup>. Joint mobilization
decreases muscle activity, reducing muscle concentric activation, pain, and muscle tension
in periarticular tissue<xref rid="r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The comparison of the two techniques revealed that the reverse distraction technique was
significantly better than the Kaltenborn technique. There is presently no published study
that can support and explain this finding, and further research is required in this
regard.</p><p>Stenvers<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup> stated in a retrospective
study that the glenohumeral joint capsule can be stretched both by fixing the scapula and
mobilizing the humerus and by fixing the humerus and mobilizing the scapula. In
biomechanical terms, it was suggested that during the movement of the humerus relative to
the scapula, the scapula is not stabilized effectively. As a result, a laterally directed
force is applied to the acromion and further to the clavicle to help stabilize the scapula
indirectly via the sternoclavicular and acromioclavicuar joints. Furthermore, the movement
of the humerus causes pain. Because of this pain, it is not possible to exert force on the
glenohumeral joint capsule effectively. Thus, the movement of the humerus relative to the
fixed scapula, as used in traditional gliding techniques, is not an effective mobilization
method. In contrast to the first method, in reverse distraction no force is applied to the
acromion in order to counteract the rotation of the scapula since the scapula is held in
place by the joint capsule. The mobilizing force on the scapula is applied only to load the
joint capsule, with no pain being caused. During the movement of the scapula with respect to
the humerus, only the glenohumeral joint is involved, and the glenohumeral joint capsule is
stretched without causing pain. Because of this mechanism, reverse distraction is a better
mobilization method in terms of being less painful clinically.</p><p>In this study, active and passive abduction ROM in the frontal plane increased
significantly after 18 treatment sessions in both groups, which supports the results of the
studies conducted by Johnson et al., Vermeulen et al., and Stenver<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>. This can be
attributed to the following mechanical effects of mobilization on joint mobility: adhesions
break up, realignment of collagen, or fiber gliding increase by specific movements that
stress the capsular tissue<xref rid="r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref><sup>)</sup>. Moreover,
the induced rheological changes in synovial fluid, increased exchange of fluid between
synovial tissue and the cartilage matrix, and enhanced synovial fluid turnover are found to
be affected by joint mobilization<xref rid="r42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>However, in the present study, the reverse distraction technique was found to be
significantly better than the traditionally used mobilization techniques in increasing
shoulder abduction mobility. It is known that patients with adhesive capsulitis may develop
an alternative compensatory elevation strategy<xref rid="r43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,
<xref rid="r44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref><sup>)</sup>, in particular by using excessive
scapular movement during arm elevation. Fayad et al.<xref rid="r45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that there is increased scapulohumeral rhythm and scapular
lateral rotation and decreased scapular protraction in patients suffering from frozen
shoulder compared to those with glenohumeral osteoarthritis, with limited global arm
elevation. Vermeulen et al.<xref rid="r46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref><sup>)</sup>
demonstrated that scapular lateral rotation of the arm affected by frozen shoulder occurred
earlier and was larger during forward flexion, scapular abduction, and horizontal abduction
to compensate for the decrease in mobility at the glenohumeral joint. This could be due to
capsular adhesion that prevents external rotation and gliding of the head of the humerus
under the acromion simultaneously with elevation of the humerus in several planes. Thus, the
glenohumeral joint is blocked and the scapula is distracted outwards earlier by the humerus
during elevation. Moreover, Lin et al.<xref rid="r47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref><sup>)</sup>
noticed higher upper trapezius activity than lower trapezius activity in patients with
adhesive capsulitis. They suggested that this increased trapezius muscle activity occurred
to compensate limited glenohumeral motion in patients with adhesive capsulitis, resulting in
abnormal scapular motion, excessive scapular elevation, and upward rotation during elevation
of the arm.</p><p>Thus, it can be concluded from the above studies that scapulohumeral rhythm is altered and
there is excessive elevation, upward rotation, and lateral rotation of the scapula, with the
aim to compensate for the limited glenohumeral elevation, in patients with adhesive
capsulitis. To restore normal glenohumeral ROM, abnormal scapular movement patterns should
be corrected<xref rid="r48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="r49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="r50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Because of capsular restriction, glenohumeral joint mobilization applied before scapular
mobilization can be very painful, and improvement in joint mobility cannot be appreciated.
It is known that the glenohumeral and scapulothoracic joints are in a closed kinetic chain.
Therefore, it was assumed that, if glenohumeral mobilization increases shoulder
movements<xref rid="r51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref><sup>)</sup> and normalizes
scapulohumeral rhythm<xref rid="r52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>, <xref rid="r53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref><sup>)</sup>, the reverse distraction technique should improve shoulder
movements as it is directed towards gliding the scapula in medial and downward rotations
with the humerus distracted at varying angles of elevation and forward flexion. Thus, as
positional correction of the scapula occurs with reverse distraction, there is an increase
in mobility at the glenohumeral joint.</p><p>Although no difference was found between the groups in external ROM and HBB reach measured
for internal rotation, these variables improved significantly in both groups after the 18
treatment sessions. This can be attributed to the fact that both techniques employed
stretching of the posterior capsule, resulting in an increase of internal rotation ROM. In
this study, HBB reach was used to measure internal rotation because it is particularly
difficult to measure internal rotation using a goniometer with the arm in the neutral
position because the abdomen prevents achieving the maximal internal rotation<xref rid="r54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref><sup>)</sup>. Although this movement is complex, the
method is effective and used clinically for measuring internal rotation of the shoulder
joint<xref rid="r55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, there are studies
that demonstrate that HBB reach is not an exact measure of the range of internal
rotation<xref rid="r56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>, <xref rid="r57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The FLEX SF scores improved significantly in both groups, with reverse distraction showing
better results than the Kaltenborn technique. In accordance with published results, this
study demonstrated that shoulder function gets better with improvement in scapular and
shoulder movements<xref rid="r58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, the
significant improvements in abduction mobility and pain achieved by the reverse distraction
technique can correlate with functional improvement.</p><p>Clinically, reverse distraction improves abduction ranges, decreases pain, and improves
functional status more effectively than conventionally used mobilization techniques in
adhesive capsulitis patients. As opposed to other techniques, application of this technique
was found to be painless, which allows applying greater force directed to the glenohumeral
capsule, thereby achieving mobility at the glenohumeral joint easily and efficiently.
Moreover, this can also be useful in positional correction of the scapula in patients with
adhesive capsulitis.</p><p>The limitations of the present study are as follows. First, convenience sampling was used
in this study, which limits the generalizability of the results to the entire population.
Second, the duration of the treatment was relatively low, and further studies are
recommended to evaluate the effect of longer treatment. Third, the study allowed all
movements during daily activities, making it impossible to control for individual
differences in motions. Future studies are therefore necessary, which may also involve
scapular dyskinesis to investigate the effect of revere distraction on scapular
positioning.</p><p>In conclusion, the present study supports the clinical use of the reverse distraction
technique as a mobilization method alternative to conventionally used techniques aimed at
decreasing pain and improving ROM and functional scores in patients with adhesive
capsulitis.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The project was full financially supported by King Saud University, through Vice Deanship
