by comparing class-based task-oriented circuit training (CTCT) and individual-based
task-oriented circuit training (ITCT). [Subjects and Methods] The subjects were 30
patients who had been diagnosed with hemiplegia due to stroke more than six month
previously. They were divided into Group I (n=9) for conventional therapy, Group II (n=10)
for conventional therapy and ITCT, and Group III (n=11) for conventional therapy and CTCT.
In order to determine self-satisfaction as a psychological factor in patients, we used a
self-esteem scale (SES), motivation of rehabilitation scale (MR), and relationship change
(RCS) scale. [Results] SES, MR, and RCS, which were measured to determine self
satisfaction as a psychological factor were significantly different between groups. The
Bonferroni post hoc test revealed a significant difference between Group I and Group III
in SES, a significant difference between Group I and Group III and Group II and Group III
in MR, and a significant difference between Group I and Group III were found. [Conclusion]
Based on the above results, task-oriented circuit training was more effective when
performed in a class than when performed individually in terms of self-satisfaction. Based
on this result, we determined that CTCT has as positive an effect on the mental aspects of
stroke patients compared with ITCT.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Self-satisfaction</kwd><kwd>Stroke</kwd><kwd>Task-oriented circuit training</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Half of stroke patients experience hemiplegia, which limits independent life and social
participation<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. As a rehabilitation
processes, many complicated and unique methods can be adopted, physically, socially, and
mentally<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the biomedical field,
rehabilitation refers to the recovery of damaged individual functional abilities<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>, and task-oriented training may be used as a
physical method to improve lost gait ability after stroke. Rensink et al.<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that functional motion can improve
the life quality-related health of stroke patients.</p><p>In addition, Thaut et al.<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup> showed that
emotional disorder in stroke patients was caused by physical disabilities and limitations in
daily living, thereby emphasizing a treatment procedure that included not only physical
function recovery but also addressed emotional issues during the rehabilitation period. The
World Health Organization<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup> announced a
core model of 12 major chronic diseases for the International Classification of Functioning
(ICF), Disability and Health which is a method to record and classify functional
disabilities and health-related information for disabled persons. Geyh et al.<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup> summarized previous studies to develop a
comprehensive ICF core set for stroke patients. He suggested that temperament, personality,
and energy dynamics in the physical function category were a mental function subcategory and
a component of the interpersonal relationships in the activity/participation category. This
indicated that functional disorder due to the sudden onset of stroke represents a major area
of adjustment in terms of social function and psychological factors<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, not only physical aspects but also psychological
and social aspects should be considered to improve the recovery of stroke patients.
Class-based training can enhance motivation, encouragement, health awareness, and skill
related to communication with others<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>However, few studies have been done on changes in psychology (self-esteem, motivation of
rehabilitation, and relationship change), which has in advantage of class training. In
addition, although a number of studies have reported the positive effect of the
task-oriented circuit training (TOCT) and class-based task-oriented circuit class training
on functional movements, no studies have been done that have shown effective clinical
application of TOCT.</p><p>Therefore, this study aimed to determine whether there is a difference in self-satisfaction
when TOCT is applied through class- and individual-based programs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects in this study were selected from patients who were diagnosed with stroke more
than six months previously, had a score of 24 points or more on the Korean version of the
mini-mental status examination, had no prior orthopedic diseases, could walk more than 10
meter without assistance, and could grasp an object on the floor in a standing position.
This study was approved by the hospital it was performed in, and all the participants
provided written informed consent.</p><p>Group I had five males and four females, Group II had eight males and two females, and
Group III had nine males and two females. The general characteristics of Group I, Group II,
and Group III were as follows. Their average ages were 53.78&#x000b1;9.97&#x02005;years, 58.70&#x000b1;8.61&#x02005;years,
and 55.82&#x000b1;6.29&#x02005;years. Their average heights were 162.00&#x000b1;7.86&#x02005;cm, 168.40&#x000b1;6.48&#x02005;cm, and
165.18&#x000b1;6.00&#x02005;cm. Their average weights were 60.44&#x000b1;9.32&#x02005;kg, 69.10&#x000b1;8.69&#x02005;kg, and 70.00&#x000b1;5.13&#x02005;kg,
respectively. Group I, II, and had two, seven, and eight subjects with paralyzed right sides
and seven, three subjects with paralyzed left sides, respectively. Paralysis in Group I was
due to cerebral hemorrhages in three cases and cerebral infarctios in six cases. Paralysis
in Group II was due to cerebral hemorrhages in five cases and cerebral infactions in five
cases. Paralysis in Group III was due to cerebral hemorrhages in three cases and cerebral
infarctions in eight cases.</p><p>This study aimed to determine the difference in gait ability and self-satisfaction
resulting from CTCT. To achieve this goal, 42 subjects were divided into three groups to
conduct the study experiment. Twelve patients were excluded due to health problems, so
subjects were randomly assigned to Group I (n=9) as a conventional therapy group, Group II
(n=10) as a ITCT group, and Group III (n=11) as a CTCT group. Groups II and III participated
in TOCT 30 minutes per day, three times a week for four weeks.</p><p>The TOCT that was proposed by Salbach et al.<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup> and Kim et al.<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>
was modified into a circular mode. The training tasks were sitting in a chair and walking,
walking over the obstacles, carrying goods, turning the goods upside down, and walking fast
in a circle. Group III (CTCT) was divided into two teams to conduct the tasks, while Group
II (ITCT) conducted the same tasks as Group III individually. The tools used in TOCT
included four 55-cm-high chairs with armrests, a 13 &#x000d7; 13&#x02005;cm square card with different
colors on either side, a standardized 11-cm-high footrest, 130&#x02005;&#x000d7; 200&#x02005;cm green mats, and
20-cm-high bowling pins.</p><p>To measure the self-satisfaction of subjects, the self-esteem scale (SES), motivation of
rehabilitation (MR), and relationship change (RCS) scale were used. To measure self-esteem,
the SES developed by Rosenberg in 1965 was used<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. The confidence level of the measurement tool was &#x003b1;= 0.85. In order
to evaluate the psychological change in the subjects participating in the rehabilitation,
the MR developed by Garrett<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup> was
employed. The confidence level of the measurement tool was &#x003b1;= 0.86. To determine
relationship changes, the RCS modified by Burnett<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup> was used. The confidence level of the measurement tool was &#x003b1; =
0.88.</p><p>The statistical analysis in this study was done using SPSS 18.0 for Windows<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>.
The general characteristics of the subjects were analyzed by descriptive statistics. To
determine the difference in self-satisfaction (SES, MR, and RCS) between groups, the data
were analyzed using ANCOVA while the Turkey method was used for the posttest. The
statistical significance level was set to &#x003b1; = 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>To determine the difference in the SES scale between groups, ANCOVA was conducted, and the

psychological viewpoint between individual and class TOCT applications, which were based on
the motor learning theory.</p><p>The training tasks were sitting at a chair and walking, walking over obstacles, carrying
goods, turning goods on the floor upside down, and walking fast in a circle. Group III,
which participated in CTCT, consisted of four to six people who were divided into two teams.
Group II participated in TOCT and individually performed the same tasks as Group III. In
order to determine the effect of TOCT, Group I, which received conventional therapy, was
assigned as a control group.</p><p>There was an improvement in physical functions as well as improvements in psychological
aspects. Improvements in psychological aspects are considered to enhace the effect of
therapy in stroke patients. Therefore, the need to develop programs that take into
consideration patients psychology, such as motivation, was emphasized<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. A therapy method focusing on positive psychological
change was conducted on a group rather than individual basis. Nayak et al.<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup> used group music therapy to provide a
positive opportunity for social interaction in patients with stroke and acute traumatic
brain injury. This improved the motivation of participants to engage in social interaction
and exercise, and significant changes in patient psychology were reported in their music
therapy group, although no significant difference was found between groups.</p><p>The present study provided class-based training combined with TOCT, which can positively
affect psychological changes in stroke patients, to determine the effect of the training on
self-esteem, motivation of rehabilitation, and relationships. These factors can in turn
affect the psychology of patients during the rehabilitation process. As a result, Group I
and Group III showed a significant difference in the SES (p &#x0003c; 0.05), while Group I and
Group III show a significant change in the RCS (p &#x0003c; 0.05). The present study aimed to
determine how stroke patients who lived with various functional difficulties thought about
themselves. The groups participating in TOCT showed greater improvement of self-esteem and
self-acceptance as well as interpersonal relationships than the group that received
conventional therapy. Such results are consistent with previous studies in which class-based
training had a positive effect on the psychology of patients. This positive effect was
obtained because patients with similar difficulties attempted to solve the same task
together. Regarding the change in motivation for rehabilitation, a significant difference
was revealed between Group I and Group III (p &#x0003c; 0.01) and between Group II and Group III
(p &#x0003c; 0.05). These results are also consistent with previous studies, and they were
thought to be due to an increase in motivation for participation in rehabilitation resulting
from encouragement and competition with others to solve difficulties in group TOCT, which
does not occur in the case of performing TOCT individually.</p><p>This study found a more positive effect on patient psychology when TOCT was applied to
patients as a group rather than as individuals. CTCT had a positive effect on the psychology
of the stroke patients; therefore, CTCT can be effective for training programs that aim to
change psychological factors in clinical practice.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Dobkin</surname><given-names>BH</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Clinical practice.
