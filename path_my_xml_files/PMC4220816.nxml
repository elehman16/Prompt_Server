About 25% of medicines prescribed for long-term conditions are not taken as directed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], and 15% of people receiving new medicines take few, if any, doses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Many have problems with their medicines and have information needs, but often fail to discuss these concerns with their prescriber. Furthermore, prescribers do not ask about, and so are generally unaware of, patients&#x02019; behavior regarding following instructions, experimentation and self-medication with other therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Prescribers may overestimate adherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], and be reluctant to voice suspicions about non-adherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Harm caused by non-adherence includes poor health-related quality of life, increased hospitalizations and premature mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Wider burden includes cost to patients, healthcare providers and society. Improving adherence in asthma, type 2 diabetes and hypertension could save the English National Health Service (NHS England) &#x000a3;290 million, annually [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><sec><title>Definition of adherence</title><p>In this study we have taken the definition of adherence from the World Health Organization: &#x02018;the extent to which a person&#x02019;s medication-taking behavior, following a diet, and/or executing lifestyle changes, corresponds with agreed recommendations from a healthcare provider&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. In this study we operationalize adherence behavior by defining a patient as non-adherent if any scheduled doses were missed at various time points as a result of different adherence measures deployed.</p></sec><sec><title>Pharmacist-provided interventions to improve medicines use</title><p>Pharmacist-provided interventions exist to facilitate improved medicines usage and health outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. They are also viewed by some as a means to enhance pharmacist professional status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Some interventions are effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], but not all [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. There is little evidence around cost effectiveness of clinical community pharmacy interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Most studies have methodological limitations: absence of a control, exclusion of pharmacist employment cost, use of intermediate outcomes, exclusion of health benefits, and absence of incremental analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Interventions to improve medicines adherence have been disappointing in producing sustained behavior change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], consistent health benefits, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] or demonstrable cost effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. This can be attributed to poor study design, not using evidence on reasons for non-adherence, poor intervention development, lack of understanding of intervention complexity and its effects, and lack of integration into service delivery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].</p><p>Implementing clinical services run by community pharmacists has been hampered by insufficient integration into patient pathways; poorly developed relationships between pharmacists and general practitioners (GPs); lack of access to patient information; inadequate methods for targeting services; and pharmacists&#x02019; lack of willingness to provide the service [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Medicines Use Reviews (MURs) are a recent example of a community pharmacy-based intervention. However, there has been variable uptake of MURs, mostly in chain pharmacies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. MURs have been carried out to variable standards by pharmacists, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>], partly due to variable understanding of what constitutes an MUR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>The New Medicine Service</title><p>The New Medicine Service (NMS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>] in England is based on evidence derived from our research that studied doctor-patient communication concerning medicines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. This and subsequent work established that problems with newly prescribed medicines appeared rapidly, were widespread and that a significant proportion of patients on a long-term medication quickly become non-adherent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. A pharmacist&#x02019;s intervention could significantly reduce reported problems and non-adherence in a cost effective manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. Within the NHS community pharmacy contract, the NMS is classified as an Advanced Service, whereby community pharmacists can opt to provide the service from their pharmacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. This comes at a time when efficient medicines use could not be more important, in the face of economic pressures on the public sector budget. England&#x02019;s ageing population now receives 50% more prescriptions items per capita for conditions such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes, COPD and asthma than in 1990 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. This proposed study is therefore timely as it is essential to evaluate whether NMS is effective, cost effective and acceptable to patients and healthcare providers. Supplementary policy-relevant outcomes from this service are opportunities to intervene regarding lifestyle and potential improved tracking of medicines-related adverse events by community pharmacists and patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Aims of the study</title><p>The aims of this study are to:</p><p>&#x02022;evaluate effectiveness and cost effectiveness of the NMS, from an NHS perspective, to inform decisions about continuation of the service</p><p>&#x02022;explore operation of the NMS to determine acceptability to patients, pharmacists and GPs, indicators of successful implementation, generalizability and replicability across four therapeutic groupings in multiple pharmacy settings</p></sec><sec><title>Specific objectives</title><p>This study has two work streams: an RCT and a qualitative investigation/appraisal. The purpose of the RCT is to evaluate effectiveness and cost effectiveness of the NMS from an NHS perspective to inform decisions about continuation of the service.</p><p>Data collected from the RCT will be used to:</p><p>&#x02022;evaluate the impact of the NMS on patient medicines-taking behavior, patient outcomes, and cost effectiveness from an NHS perspective</p><p>&#x02022;determine patients&#x02019; understanding of their medicines and the extent to which they are informed and supported in their medicines-related behavior</p><p>&#x02022;examine whether NMS encourages pharmacovigilance by community pharmacists and patients</p><p>&#x02022;inform and support future implementation and support development of outcome and quality measures for community pharmacy</p><p>The purpose of the qualitative workstream is to understand how NMS is implemented and experienced as a situated complex healthcare intervention.

It is a multi-center, pragmatic RCT involving a parallel group design. The health technology appraisal will assess the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of NMS via a patient-level pragmatic RCT of NMS versus current practice combined with modeling of long-term economic impact. Results generated from the technology appraisal will be combined with NMS audit data to provide wider estimates of effectiveness and cost effectiveness.</p></sec><sec><title>Qualitative study design</title><p>The qualitative workstream comprises three distinct research activities:</p><p>a) pharmacy profiling will generate data on the organizational variables associated with the implementation, configuration and delivery NMS. Profiling will involve ethnographically informed observations and semi-structured interviews within participating community pharmacies, including non-participatory observations of work organization and pharmacy practice, guided tours, shadowing of pharmacy staff and interviews with pharmacy staff over a three to five day period. Observations will be guided by a standardized profiling tool to acquire common data set from across different sites.</p><p>b) patient tracking will generate data on the real-time delivery of NMS as a situated social interaction. Based upon pharmacy profiles, it involves producing a descriptive understanding of the &#x02018;expected&#x02019; patient pathway to identify key interaction, communication and decision-making points followed by focused observations of, and interviews with, pharmacist and patient &#x02018;before&#x02019;, &#x02018;during&#x02019; and &#x02018;after&#x02019; the NMS consultation. A range of methods of recording data will be offered to participants, including video and audio recording or direct observation by research staff. Participant patients to be tracked will be recruited via the patient pool from the RCT.</p><p>c) stakeholder interviews will generate additional qualitative understanding on the organization and experience of NMS from the perspective of community pharmacy staff including pharmacists, dispensers and technicians. Patients who decline the invitation for an NMS in the pharmacy will also be invited to take part in short semi-structured interview to incorporate their views. Additionally, one-to-one interviews will be conducted with patients whose voices are seldom heard, and pharmacist and GP interviews will also be conducted to explore the professional perspective of the NMS.</p></sec><sec><title>Eligibility for pharmacies to join the trial</title><p>Community pharmacies providing NMS in East Midlands and South Yorkshire (EMSY) and Greater London (GL) are eligible.

Patients who have consented to the NMS will be invited to take part in the study. It will be explained to patients that taking part in the study is optional and if they decide not to take part they will be offered the NMS service as normal.</p><p>The study-designated pharmacist will inform the patient or their nominated representative (other individual or other body with appropriate jurisdiction), of all aspects pertaining to participation in the study. If the patient agrees to take part, the pharmacist will randomize the patient to receive the NMS or allocated to receive current practice. Patients could, if they were eligible for the NMS, volunteer for the study once they have seen the study poster displayed in the pharmacy. If a study-designated pharmacist is not present in the pharmacy at the time the patient presents with a prescription for a new medicine eligible for the NMS, the patient cannot be recruited into the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Participants for the qualitative analysis</title><sec><title>Pharmacy profiles</title><p>Twenty pharmacies will be recruited for pharmacy profiling from those sites recruited to the RCT.

A purposive sampling strategy will be used to identify and recruit a range of participants linked to the participating pharmacies: pharmacists, pharmacy technicians, counter assistants, GPs, nurse prescribers and patients in both geographical regions. Written informed consent will be obtained before interviews will take place.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec><title>Interventions</title><sec><title>Current practice</title><p>Those patients randomized to this arm will receive current practice where the patient receives their prescription, with advice as clinically necessary from the pharmacist at point of supply. It is not routine for patients to have any follow-up in this arm. Patients in this arm are not restricted from contacting the pharmacist for advice should they wish to.</p></sec><sec><title>NMS intervention</title><p>Those patients randomized to this arm will receive the NMS. The NMS will be offered by community pharmacists to people starting a new medicine for asthma/COPD, type 2 diabetes, hypertension or antiplatelet/anticoagulant treatment. The NMS can be summarized as patient engagement, intervention and follow-up (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).

Training will be delivered by the study team and includes an overview of the study, study aims and objectives, research governance (including principles of Good Clinical Practice (GCP)), conducting the study in your pharmacy and interactive practice sessions.</p><p>Pharmacist study training will be followed up by an abridged training session in each pharmacy. This training provides all staff members with an overview of the study and enables them to assist the pharmacist in identifying potential study participants.</p></sec><sec><title>Allocation of trial intervention</title><p>Following the consenting process, patients will be randomized into their respective study groups. The randomization sequence will be generated by the study statistician (RM).</p><p>Patients will be 1:1 randomized into one of the two study arms stratified by drug/disease group within each pharmacy using the SAS statistical software (version 9) (SAS UK Headquarters Wittington House Henley Road Medmenham Marlow, Buckinghamshire SL7 2&#x000a0;EB). Block randomization at the pharmacy level is necessary to avoid imbalances due to individual pharmacy variability. Separate randomization sequences were produced for patients 16&#x000a0;years and over and for patients aged 14 and 15&#x000a0;years old. The separation by age is required as study documents for the 14 and 15&#x000a0;year-old group include patient assent and parental consent instead of the usual normal patient consent forms. It is anticipated that there will be an unequal distribution across the four groups; therefore, stratification by drug/disease group is necessary, each with a different baseline adherence and/or effect size. The intervention arm will receive the NMS as per service specification while the control arm will receive care as per current practice. Concealment of sequence allocation will be achieved as pharmacists will randomly allocate patients to the two study arms using disease and age group specific, sequentially numbered tamper-proof opaque sealed envelopes containing details of allocation group. Periodic checks will be undertaken by a researcher to assess the integrity of study sites adhering to the randomization procedures.

The adherence measure in the interview schedule for the NMS intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>] and follow-up interview is a simple question: &#x02018;People often miss taking doses of their medicines, for a wide range of reasons. Have you missed any doses of your new medicine, or changed when you take it? (Prompt: when did you last miss a dose?)&#x02019;</p><p>Adherence in our original work was measured using self-report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>], using a similar question to that in the NMS interview. The patient was defined as non-adherent if any doses were missed in the previous seven days, partly because simply asking patients about their adherence will identify at least 50% of those with low adherence, with a specificity of 87% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. We will validate the NMS adherence measure by using an existing validated scale alongside it (Morisky Eight Item Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS-8)) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Secondary outcome measures</title><p>We are collecting data on a number of secondary outcome measures relating to number of medicines-related problems reported by patients, and resolved; adverse events and NHS contacts associated with adverse events; health status; resource use and costs; length of initial and subsequent NMS consultations; NHS contact (primary and secondary care) and non-medical costs.</p></sec><sec><title>Composite outcomes</title><p>In the original work, most &#x02018;withdrawals&#x02019; were that the patients in the intervention arm were referred back to the GP by the pharmacist due to side effects, lack of effect or patient non-adherence&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. In this study, these events are being recorded and will be combined into a composite outcome.</p><p>Adherence will be reported as adherence in the group eligible to be adherent (that is, still meant to be taking the medicine). We will also report patients referred back to the GP (whether a new medicine is prescribed or not) as a separate outcome. This information will be available from the six week call for both intervention and current practice arm.</p><p>A composite outcome that combines proportion of adherent patients and patients appropriately referred back to the GP will be derived and summary statistics presented.</p></sec><sec><title>Data for the economic analysis</title><sec><title>Costs of the intervention</title><p>Costs will be incurred at the patient level, in delivering the intervention. Variable costs refer to items where the quantity of resources used is determined only by the need for them as inputs to individual patient care. Variable resource use associated with the interventions (time spent, costs of telephone calls, printing and posting) will be recorded for each patient. Fixed costs are those costs that are not affected by patient activity in the short term. UK standard costs will be used for unit costs. This may somewhat over- or under-estimate local unit costs, but allows explicit comparison of costs and local adjustments can be made. Unit costs associated with the intervention will be obtained from the Personal Social Services Research Unit (PSSRU) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>], Department of Health reference tables and other reference costs.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical and economic impact of non-adherence</title><p>The trial will not observe patient outcomes and NHS costs resulting from non-adherence to their newly prescribed medicine. Rather, outcomes will be derived from published evidence on the link between adherence improvement and impact on health. The NMS study is not designed to calculate the impact of the intervention on patient health outcomes, either in terms of sample size or length of follow-up. Use of proxy measures such as number of primary and secondary care contacts (hospital admissions, accident and emergency visits and outpatient visits) may be subject to difficulties if considered as patient outcomes. This is because the intervention may lead to increased NHS contact in the short term. Thus, we will estimate the long-term effect of the observed adherence improvements on patient outcomes and NHS costs. Data on natural history of diseases, treatment effectiveness, resource use, and health status (utility) will be obtained from published literature to populate the model.</p><p>We will develop at least one treatment pathway model for each of the four treatment groups targeted by NMS, encompassing the consequences of being adherent or non-adherent (see Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). A common generic approach will be used to develop the models. We will undertake the economic analysis from the perspective of the English NHS in terms of the direct costs of providing an intervention to improve medicines adherence in chronic illnesses and the long-term costs of managing the conditions for adherent and non-adherent patients (to estimate cost of non-adherence).</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Decision-analytic model for NMS economic evaluation.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1745-6215-14-411-3"/></fig><p>Markov models will be designed and populated, incorporating the measures of uncertainty around the point estimates, to conduct probabilistic sensitivity analysis.

Interviews will incorporate a range of patient and professional views and will be digitally recorded and transcribed. All accompanying field notes will be retained.</p></sec><sec><title>Adverse events</title><p>The nature of the study presents a low risk to participants.

All adverse events will be reported to the study sponsor.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample size</title><p>The estimated change in prevalence of non-adherence behavior (primary outcome) is expected to fall from 20% to 10%. A sample size of 250 patients/arm is sufficient to detect this change with 80% power, 5% significant level (two-tailed) at a projected 20% drop-out rate. Therefore, the total number of patients to be recruited for the RCT is 500 patients.</p><p>Data obtained a few months post-NMS implementation indicated that on average, two NMS consultations were initiated per pharmacy per week. It was initially estimated that on average there will be 52 eligible patients per pharmacy in six months. Based on the assumption that 50% of eligible NMS patients consent to be part of the study, there will be 26 in each pharmacy over the required six months.</p></sec><sec><title>Revision of clinical site recruitment strategy</title><p>To deliver the sample as quickly as possible, patients were to be recruited from 20 pharmacies which, assuming the above drop-out rate, would deliver 520 patients within six months. However, of 24 pharmacies initially recruited, at least ten have not delivered patients to the study due to lack of both NMS service uptake and patients declining to be in the study. Therefore, we are currently replacing these pharmacies with &#x02018;NMS-active&#x02019; pharmacies. The pharmacy profiling has provided insights into the reasons that affect service uptake and facilitators to recruitment to the study. This has enabled us to develop a site suitability survey to better identify more appropriate and potentially more successful pharmacy sites for recruitment (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Table S1).</p></sec><sec><title>Compliance</title><p>We recognize that it can be a challenge to encourage community pharmacies and patients using community pharmacies to engage in interventions.

The main reason was that the patients in the intervention arm were referred back to the GP by the pharmacist due to side effects, lack of effect or patient non-adherence. In this study, these events are being recorded and will be combined into a composite outcome. Loss to follow-up for other reasons is expected to be less than 10%.</p></sec><sec><title>Withdrawal of patients from the study</title><p>A patient will be considered to have withdrawn from the study if the study team receives any notification that the patient wishes to withdraw. This notification might come from the patient themselves, the patient&#x02019;s representative or from the patient&#x02019;s pharmacist. We have accounted for withdrawal in our sample size calculations to minimize the effect on the analysis.</p><p>As the NMS is a nationally available service which all patients have the right to receive, some patients allocated to the current practice study arm may decide post-randomization that they still wish to receive the NMS. Should this occur this will be counted as a withdrawal at randomization. If a patient &#x02018;loops&#x02019; through the NMS due to referral back to their GP or addition/change of medication (which may mean they received a second new medicine so will start at the beginning of the NMS for this medicine), this patient will continue in the RCT/study as normal.

The data will be then imported into qualitative analysis package NVivo; QSR International Pty Ltd. Version 9, 2010 (QSR International (UK) Limited, Warrington, Cheshire, WA2 7LT, United Kingdom) for the purpose of coding and thematic analysis.

These codes will be compared for their internal consistency and boundaries. A coding framework will be constructed iteratively and two members of the research team will systematically code data according to this framework. Coded extracts will be compared and differences of opinion discussed until agreement is reached. Actively searching for disconfirming data will be undertaken as well as regular detailed discussions amongst the qualitative researchers.

However, some pharmacies were only offering the service to a limited number of patients, which has affected our patient recruitment rate and has required further site recruitment. We have also revised recruitment targets for individual pharmacies and developed a site suitability survey. On-going support provided to sites includes regular visits to sites have been made by members of the research team. Sites have also been kept up-to-date with recruitment progress through newsletters.</p><p>One strength of this study is the substantial qualitative workstream, supplemented by engagement and implementation activity. Many studies of pharmacy interventions have not included qualitative work. Qualitative work will enable us to learn about how this service is actually being implemented in practice and will enable us to explain the quantitative results we obtain. We will be carrying out stakeholder days where we will be inviting patients, service providers and commissioners to attend, to obtain views on the NMS in particular, and on managing medicines for long-term conditions in general.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial status</title><p>At the time of submission of this article, 58 pharmacies have been recruited into the study.
