extremity kinematic patterns in individuals with hemiplegia. [Subjects and Methods] Twelve
patients were recruited in accordance with the inclusion criteria. The experimental group
(n=6) was trained with a purposeful action observation program. The control group (n=6)
was trained with only purposeful action without action observation. The programs were
performed 30&#x02005;min/session, 5 times per week for 30 sessions in 6 weeks of training. Upper
extremity kinematic patterns were measured by a 3-dimensional motion analysis system
before and after training, and the results were analyzed. [Results] The experimental group
and the control group showed improvements in average velocity, trajectory ratio, and
movement degree, but no statistically significant differences were observed between the
groups. The experimental group showed statistically significant improvements in average
velocity, trajectory ratio after the intervention. The experimental group also showed an
improvement in movement degree, but the post-intervention difference was not significant.
[Conclusion] The results of this study show that purposeful action observation training
program improved the average velocity and trajectory ratio of stroke patients. Further
research should enroll more subjects divided into more specific groups for treatment.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Action observation</kwd><kwd>Kinematic patterns</kwd><kwd>Stroke</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Stroke is one of the three largest causes of death. Fifty-three out of 100,000 people die
of stroke, and people older than 65 have a higher stroke rate<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. The number of stroke victims in 2030 is expected to be 3 times
higher than that of today<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Neurological
disorders including motor disorder, sensory disorder, cognitive disorder, perceptual
disorder, speech disorder, and affective disorders may occur after a stroke. Motor disorders
occur in about 80% of stroke patients and more than half of stroke patients suffer
restriction of upper and lower extremity movement of the affected side due to
hemiparesis<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Especially, restriction of
the upper extremity movement causes difficulty with maintaining an independent daily life. A
recent development in the treatment and prognosis of upper limb function restoration is
action observation training<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Action observation training is based on the mirror neuron system theory which asserts that
the same neurological changes occur when observing an action without actual performance as
when actually performing the action. The mirror neuron system has been reported to be more
activated when observing purposeful action than when observing simple action, and action
observation training is more effective when a program uses assignments related to daily
living activities<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Buccino et al.<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup> studied neurologic changes elicited by
action observation training. By showing that same area of the brain is activated in both
situations they demonstrated that the same nervous system is used when observing an action
as when performing it. Jong Man Kim et al.<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup> reported increases in the excitability of the corticospinal cord, as
measured by the amplitude of movement evoked potentials during action observation
training.</p><p>Porro et al.<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup> reported functional change
is an effect of action. They found that finger abduction increased after observing abduction
action using the index and middle fingers of the right hand. Tae Woong Ha et al.<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that daily living activities and
upper extremity function improved through observing the actions of holding a ball, a can,
and a cup with a handle, and turning a faucet. Jin Woo Jo et al.<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup> reported the effect of purposeful action observation on
upper extremity function and promptness.</p><p>This study conducted a purposeful action observation program for stroke patients to
identify the effect of the purposeful action observation program by measuring the kinematic
patterns of the upper extremity before and after the program. This study also aimed to
recommend purposeful action observation program as a mediating strategy for occupational
treatment based on the results.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study selected 12 study subjects from among patients who were diagnosed as having
hemiplegia due to stroke. The subjects understood the purpose of this study and agreed to
participate in the study. A nonequivalent pretest-posttest control group design was used.
The subjects were randomly assigned to the experimental group (n=6) and the control group
(n=6). The experimental group subjects received traditional occupational treatment and also
performed a purposeful action observation training program. The control group subjects
received traditional occupational treatment and topological treatment in which they
performed purposeful action observation program assignments without actually observing the
purposeful actions. The interventions were performed for 30 minutes per session, 5 sessions
per week for 6 weeks, a total of 30 sessions.</p><p>A 3-dimensional motion analysis system was used to measure the changes in kinematic
patterns of movement of the upper extremity. Winam software of Zebris Medical GimbH, was
used to analyze the motion of the arms of the affected side in 3-dimensions.The experimental
equipment consisted of a measurement system for recording the movement, the Campact
Measuring System10, a holding device, body surface markers, pads, cables, targets, and a
computer. The study subjects were asked to sit on a chair located 10&#x02005;cm away from their
desk, trunk on the backrest move their hands to the starting point which was marked with
tape, 5&#x02005;cm from the edge of the desk, and adopt a posture of elbow flexion of 90&#x000b0;.</p><p>Three markers were attached to analyze the aiming motion of the upper extremity (average
velocity and trajectory ratio). The markers were attached to the side of the index finger
proximal interphalangeal and metacarpophalangeal joints, and the wrist. Markers for
measuring the range of motion (motion angle) were attached to the dorsal side of the wrist
in the middle, the elbow lateral epicondyle, and the insertion of the deltoid muscle.</p><p>The intervention period of the purposeful action observation program was selected based on
the study of Feys et al.<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>: 30 minutes a
day, 5 sessions a week for 6 weeks. Previous studies were reviewed for the design of
assignments for purposeful action observation. The validity of the program was confirmed by
1 occupational treatment professor and 3 professional occupational therapists with more than
5&#x02005;years of clinical experience. The purposeful action observation program is composed of
assignment composition, selection of the difficulty levels, and methods.</p><p>The analysis of the data was performed using SPSS V18.0. The general characteristics of the
study subjects are reported using descriptive statistics. The Mann Whitney U test was used
to compare the results of the experimental and control groups. Wilcoxon&#x02019;s signed rank test
was used to compare the upper extremity function of the affected side and kinematic patterns
(average velocity, trajectory ratio, and motion (angle). A statistical significance level of
0.05 was used for all analyses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The results of comparison of the kinematic patterns of the two groups are shown in <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Comparison of upper extremity changes in kinematic patterns of the groups and the

imitation is often used as the intervention method in rehabilitation. Action observation
training is an action imitation method<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The theoretical basis for action observation training is the activity of the mirror neuron
system (MNS), and it utilizes observation of the actions of other people or a model shown in
a video. The observed action activates the same nervous structure as the one activated when
performing the actual action<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Previous studies which have used purposeful action observation program utilized simple
repetition assignments for the training. However, the present study designed assignments
imitating daily life related activities to support the assertion that action observation
training is more effective when purposeful actions are observed rather than a simple action,
and that assignments related to daily life change the functional effects of the
training<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The level of the assignment was considered in the selection of the purposeful action
observation program assignments and patients were motivated by selecting patient-oriented
assignments<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Two assignments were
picked for each session and repeated over one week. This was identical to the method of the
study conducted by Feys et al., who suggested an intervention of 30 minutes a session, 5
sessions a week for 6 weeks. When a patient couldn&#x02019;t perform a difficult assignment, two
assignments were repeatedly performed during the 6 weeks; thus, there was a possibility of
lack of motivation and concentration in performance of the assignments.</p><p>The displacement and time from the ready position to the target was measured, and the
average velocity was calculated using the two measurements. Therefore, higher average
velocity means improved reactivity<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
ratio of the distance actually moved to actual distance from the ready position to the
target was calculated, and a ratio close to 1 implies high motion efficiency<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. In other words, the statistically
significant improvements in average velocity and trajectory ratio mean that the reactivity
and efficiency of motion improved.</p><p>The strengths of this study are the inspection of validity by professionals, the design of
the daily life related assignments of the action observation program through a review of
previous studies, and patient motivation as the patients were given freedom to choose the
assignments. Also, this study used a motion analysis system to objectively measure the upper
extremity motions and kinematic patterns before and after the intervention, and analyzed the
improvement in motion efficiency and velocity.</p><p>A limitation of this study was that it is hard to generalize the results of the study since
the number of study subjects was small. Also, the measurements were taken only before and
after the program; therefore, this study did not provide any information about the duration
of the effects on upper extremity function after the intervention.</p><p>Future studies must investigate purposeful action observation programs with many more
subjects to generalize the results. Follow-up studies are also needed to find out the
post-intervention duration of improved kinematic patterns. Furthermore, future studies must
pay attention to not only the upper extremity functions of stroke patients but also the
efficiency, angle, and reactivity of the motion.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="eref">National Statistical Office:
