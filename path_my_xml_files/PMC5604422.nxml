Additionally, vaccine induced epitope spreading to other TAA participates to the enrichment of the diversity of the anti-tumor response.

Accordingly, numerous studies have reported a clear patient benefit in various cancer types, including aggressive tumors such as non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. However, clinical results are seldom supported by mechanistic evidence underlying the specificity and diversity of CD8+ T-cell reactivity.</p><p id="Par22">In this study, we provide first data reporting the link between the development of a specific immune response and clinical benefit for a viral-based immunotherapeutic in advanced NSCLC. TG4010 is a therapeutic cancer vaccine based on a modified vaccinia Ankara strain (MVA) encoding for the full-length cancer antigen Mucin 1 (MUC1) and human IL-2. Administration of TG4010 in combination with chemotherapy (CT) has resulted in improved clinical outcomes in several clinical studies over the standard chemotherapy regimen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. We used combinatorial two color encoding of MHC multimers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] for the parallel detection of T-cell epitopes from TG4010 and other antigens reported to be prevalent in lung cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Interactions between the vaccine and the development of T cell responses against other neo-antigens was also evaluated to evaluate the possible development of further anti-tumor response through epitope spreading.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Patients and study design</title><p id="Par23">The TIME trial (NCT00415818) is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized phase 2b/3 clinical study aimed at assessing the combination of TG4010 with first-line chemotherapy in advanced NSCLC. Inclusion criteria included age&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;18&#x000a0;years, histology-confirmed diagnosis of previously untreated stage IV NSCLC, expression of MUC1 in at least 50% of tumor cells, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, and adequate hepatic, renal, and hematologic function. Patients were randomly allocated to receive subcutaneous injections of either 108 plaque-forming units of TG4010 or placebo, from the beginning of chemotherapy every week for 6&#x000a0;weeks and then every 3&#x000a0;weeks up to progression (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1). Chemotherapy regimen were chosen by the investigator: paclitaxel and carboplatin, pemetrexed and cisplatin or gemcitabine and cisplatin. Bevacizumab and Erlotinib were allowed as maintenance therapy. The trial included 222 patients (TG4010 and chemotherapy: 111 patients [50%]; placebo and chemotherapy: 111 patients [50%]).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Monitoring of T cell responses by combinatorial encoding of MHC multimers and validation of the method</title><p id="Par24">Patients enrolled in this trial were sampled 10&#x000a0;mL of blood at different time points along the trial (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1). Samples were shipped at ambient temperature 15&#x02013;25&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C in a single use shipping container validated accordingly to principle set forth in the U.S. Pharmacopeia. PBMC were extracted, frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen within 24&#x000a0;h after collection. To recover enough cells for the immunomonitoring, samples collected at baseline and 6&#x000a0;h following the first treatment were pooled to evaluate the T cell response to various antigens before treatment (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1). Similarly, samples collected from the first day of the third treatment cycle and thereon were pooled to measure the T cell response to the same pool of various antigens after treatment (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1). Frozen vials were thawed in a 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C water bath under agitation and then transferred to complete RPMI medium (Sigma-Aldrich, R0883) containing 10&#x000a0;mL of 10% FCS (PAA Laboratories, A512110908312016), 0.01&#x000a0;g/L gentamycin (Schering Plough, U570036), 50&#x000a0;U/mL Benzonase nuclease (Merck, 1,016,970,001), 10&#x000a0;mM/L L-glutamine (Sigma-Aldrich, G5792). PBMCs were washed once again in 10&#x000a0;mL of complete RPMI medium before being resuspended in 2&#x000a0;mL PBS 2% FCS (FACS buffer) and counted manually by Trypan blue exclusion to also determine viability. To standardize the quality of the tested samples, pooling of these various time point was conditional on the viability of the latter. The acceptance criteria for cell viability was set at 80% with a median stability of 86% for pre-treatment samples and 85% for post-treatment samples (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1). PBMCs were then enriched in CD8+ T cells using CD8+ T Cell Isolation Kit (Miltenyi Biotech, 130&#x02013;096-495) before staining with 0.5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g of various tetramers (TC Metrix, Switzerland) for 15&#x000a0;min at 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. Tubes were then transferred on ice and cells were further incubated for 30&#x000a0;min with 4&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L of 40-fold dilution of near IR live dead (Invitrogen, L10119) and 1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L of AF700 mouse anti-human CD8a (clone HIT8a, Biolegend 300,920). After washing in FACS buffer, cells were acquired on a Becton Dickinson ARIA III cell sorter equipped with 4 lasers and 16 detectors. For each sample, all available cells were acquired. Flow cytometry files were analyzed with the Kaluza software (Beckman Coulter). The strategy of CD8+ T cells selection is described in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S2A. Tetramer stained cells were gated as shown in a representative example in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S2B and then Boolean gating was applied as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] to monitor T cell responses to MUC1, MVA, other tumor associated antigens described in advanced non-small cell lung cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] as well as predicted neoantigens from somatic mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] by two-color combinatorial detection of antigen specific T cells. Flu and CMV epitopes were added as controls. Operators during sample processing and flow cytometry data analysis were blinded to treatment arm.</p><p id="Par25">Prior to clinical sample analysis, this method was validated (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Validation method) with blood samples from healthy donors to determine the limit of blank and the limit of detection for each MHC multimer. This was based on the assumption that healthy donors have very low frequencies of circulating specific T cells against the antigens tested in this study with the exception of positive controls (hCMV and Flu). Hence, for any of the TIME trial sample, a response was considered positive as being below the limit of detection (LOD) prior to treatment and above LOD post treatment. For those patients who displayed a response to a given epitope that was above the corresponding LOD prior treatment, positivity of the response to treatment was determined by specific T CD8+ frequency increase of at least two times the corresponding standard deviation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="Par26">Log-rank Mantel-Cox tests were used to compare survival between different groups. Hazard Ratios (HR) and corresponding 95% Confidence Interval (95% CI) were estimated using a Cox regression model. For comparisons on the number of responses between the two groups of response to MUC1, non-parametric Mann-Whitney U tests were used given the limited number of data. Prism (GraphPad Software Inc., v5) was used for graphical representation of data, and both Prism and SAS (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) were used for statistical testing. P values &#x0003c;0.05 were considered statistically significant. Differences on continuous clinical and demographic baseline parameters between subgroups of patients were tested using the non-parametric Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test and Fisher exact test was used for categorical parameters.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec7"><title>Safety and efficacy of TG4010</title><p id="Par27">No grade 3&#x02013;4 adverse events nor serious adverse events were considered related to TG4010 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].

This approach allowed the multiplexed detection of CD8+ T cell response against HLA-A02*01 restricted epitopes of MUC1, of the viral vector MVA, and of 15 NSCLC-associated antigens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S2).

Surprisingly, frequencies of onset of responses to MUC1-specific epitopes were equivalent between both arms of the study (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). Representative examples of detected immune responses to MVA and MUC1 epitopes are shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c and d</xref>, respectively. The development of a response against MUC1 during treatment with TG4010 was associated with an improved clinical outcome (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>), with a median OS of 32.1&#x000a0;months for patients who acquired a response against at least one MUC1 epitope under TG4010 treatment versus 12.7&#x000a0;months in non-responders (HR 0.43 [95% CI 0.20&#x02013;0.93]; p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.03). Furthermore, in the TG4010 arm, response against 2 or more MUC1 epitopes post-treatment was significantly associated with a longer OS (23.5&#x000a0;months, high diversity response; HDMUC1) as compared to patients with no response or limited to one MUC1 epitope (9.7&#x000a0;months, low diversity response; LDMUC1) (HR 0.48 [95% CI 0.18&#x02013;0.99]; p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.04) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>).

Demographic baseline characteristics between the patients of the different subgroups were not different (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S3 and S4) and clinical outcome was not correlated to specific response against Flu or hCMV epitopes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref> and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S5) indicating that the extended survival was not merely reflecting an overall better physiological status.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>

Hence, we analyzed MUC1 response in patients with low or elevated TrPAL levels. In patient with low TrPAL levels, the population is equally segmented across LDMUC1 and HDMUC1 responders, while HDMUC1 responders are slightly underrepresented in patients with elevated TrPAL (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S5).</p><p id="Par31">As indicated in the Material and Methods section, different chemotherapy regimen were used in this study.

Indeed, there was a higher proportion of patients showing an amplification of response in the TG4010 arm (9 TAA out of 15) in comparison to that of the placebo arm (5 TAA out of 15).

</p><p id="Par34">In summary, in the setting of the TIME trial, TG4010 treatment is associated with a longer overall survival for those HLA-A02*01 patients who either acquire a cellular immune response or are able to mount a diverse cellular immune response to MUC1. Spreading of the cellular immune response to other TAA is also associated with the acquisition and the diversity of the cellular response to MUC1 under TG4010 treatment.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par35">To our knowledge, this work is the first report of an association between therapeutic vaccine, specific cellular immune response, broadening of this response to other TAA and improvement in clinical outcome in advanced NSCLC. Previous studies reported sporadic response immune responses in patients treated with a MUC1 vaccine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] or increases in diversity of response against epitopes that were not part of the vaccine formulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] but these studies were limited by a low number of patients and did not allow to conclude on clinical significance of these findings. The diversity of the MUC1-specific CD8+ response was associated with a significantly longer OS. The study could not evidence any prominence for a particular MUC1 epitope but instead showed that multiplicity of the response both against MUC1 and other tumor antigenic determinants, including predicted neo-epitopes was beneficial for the patient. We had to focused on a set of 11 previously described epitope sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and further evaluated 4 predicted neo-epitopes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. A fraction of patients developed an amplification of immune CD8+ responses against the said TAA either after receiving TG4010 combined with CT or CT alone. This fraction represented from 5% to 39% of the patient population depending on the considered TAA. Ideally, these numbers would require interpretation in light of TAA expression in patient tumor. The absence of individual information on the presence of each TAA in the study subjects constitute a limitation of our study. Despite this shortcoming, an association between response to MUC1 and TAAs could be observed. This observation is in line with the epitope spreading hypothesis suggesting that epitopes distinct from and non-cross-reactive with an inducing epitope become targets of an evolving immune response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Broadening of epitope recognition is likely to lead to the long-term control of tumor and to prevent negative selection of cancer cells not expressing the targeted antigen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Standard chemotherapy (CT) on its own also triggered the development of immune responses against MUC1 and other tested tumor associated antigens including predicted neo-epitopes. This effect was reported for certain drug classes and is believed to result from the release of antigens upon lysis of cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], activation of cytotoxic T cells or depletion of regulatory cells by CT agents. However, in this study, acquisition of a MUC1 response under CT regimen without administration of TG4010 was not associated with an expansion of the breadth of anti-TAA responses nor with an extended OS. Hence, while the repertoire of the immune response induced by TG4010&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;CT was slightly broader than that of CT alone, we believe that the difference in overall survival outcome for the patients receiving TG4010 may result from either a change of functional state of generated T cells, a modification of the composition of the tumor micro-environment or a combination of both. Our earlier preclinical work reported the ability of a subcutaneous viral based vaccination to trigger a detectable infiltration of the tumor environment by CD8+ and CD4+ lymphocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Hence, in our case, broadening of the immune response might have synergized with CD8+ T cell enrichment of tumor sites after vaccination, consistently to what has been reported in melanoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Alternatively, it could be hypothesized that the viral nature of the vector, as well as the IL-2 encoded in TG4010, likely act as adjuvants which further assist the generation of functional T cell responses to MUC1 and other TAA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. For instance, it has been reported that anergic T cells in breast carcinoma have defective IL-2 secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Furthermore, subcutaneous injection of immunotherapeutics at a distance from the tumor site has been shown to qualitatively and quantitatively influence antigen presentation with evidence that the relative distance to the tumor is positively correlated with efficacy of the induced adaptive response in both in preclinical and clinical models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. As the vaccine induced immune response is elicited outside of the tumor immunosuppressive environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], it might have led to a more efficacious anti-tumor response. Although fully hypothetical at this stage of the clinical development of TG4010, it could be that functional MUC1-specific CD8+ T cells primed by TG4010, infiltrate the tumor, kill MUC1-expressing cancer cells, and thus release additional TAA that are subsequently presented to the immune system to generate more functional TAA- and neo-epitope-specific CD8+ T cells. Such an iterative broadening of anti-tumor response would fit with the cancer-immunity cycle model proposed by Chen and Mellman [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Future clinical monitoring of TG4010 should aim at validating this hypothesis.</p><p id="Par36">Synergy between cancer vaccines and CT is a largely recognized phenomenon based on numerous preclinical and clinical observations. While the study was not intended to compare the effect of different chemotherapy regimen with respect to their interaction with the vaccine, we observed a slight tendency toward increased immune responses under cisplatin combined with pemetrexed or gemcitabine versus carboplatin and paclitaxel regimen. Accordingly, in the TIME study addition of TG4010 to CT resulted in a gain in overall response rate of 12% over placebo in patients receiving cisplatin based regimen versus 2.4% in patients receiving carboplatin plus paclitaxel. This suggests that some CT regimen may be preferable in combination with TG4010, however further studies are warranted to better characterize the interaction between immunotherapeutics and CT.</p><p id="Par37">An elevated baseline peripheral ratio of lymphocytes expressing CD16, CD56 and CD69, described by Quoix et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] as Triple Positive Activated Lymphocytes (TrPAL), was associated with poor clinical response and outcome under TG4010. These cells constitutes a heterogeneous cellular phenotype comprising innate immunity Natural Killer lymphocytes and, to a lesser extent, Natural Killer T cells. It is a plausible that the complex interplay between NK cells and adaptive immunity results in decreased MUC1 response. Such negative modulation was reported elsewhere through direct toxicity toward CD8+ T cells or indirectly mediated by decreased antigen presentation by dendritic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. This subgroup analysis was not sufficiently powered to reflect the observation of Quoix et al. at the level of the cellular immune response to MUC1 and other TAA in HLA-A02*01 patients, although we noticed that responders with high diversity to MUC1 were slightly under represented in those HLA-A02*01 patients with an elevated baseline peripheral ratio of TrPAL.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par38">Finally, this work demonstrates that the viral vaccine TG4010 modulates the CD8+ T cell response and that changes induced by the vaccine are associated with improvements of clinical outcome. Monitoring of specific CD8+ T cells functionality induced by TG4010 (both toward MUC1 and other TAA), should be included in future clinical trials concerning this immunotherapeutic to allow confirmation in an independent cohort, as a predictor of treatment outcome and thus, as a biomarker to support the treatment of patients with TG4010.</p><p id="Par39">From the results of this trial and those of pre-clinical observations (Remy-Ziller et al., in revision), TG4010 is now pursuing its clinical development in combination with Nivolumab (NCT02823990) in second line treatment for advanced NSCLC patients and soon in combination with Nivolumab + standard chemotherapy in first line treatment for advanced NSCLC patients. Such trials as well as others with similar vaccines with immune checkpoints inhibitors that are currently ongoing, should provide precious insights on how to optimize the use of vaccines by combining it with the right immune checkpoint blocker and the right cytotoxic agent. Associated to a precise characterization of patient immune status, there is a high probability that such combined targeted interventions will harness the anti-tumor potential of the immune system and result in significant improvement in cancer care.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec11"><p>
