We report the 12-month (midpoint) effects of a 2-year multicomponent physical activity intervention implemented in disadvantaged secondary schools.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A cluster randomised trial was undertaken in 10 secondary schools located in disadvantaged areas in New South Wales, Australia. Students in Grade 7 were recruited, with follow-up in Grade 8. The intervention was guided by socioecological theory and included seven physical activity strategies, and six implementation adoption strategies. The primary outcome was mean minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) per day assessed using Actigraph GT3X accelerometers. Outcome data were analysed using repeated measures linear mixed models.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>At baseline, 1150 (93%) students participated in the data collection (mean age 12&#x02005;years, 48% boys) and 1050 (79%) students participated at 12-month follow-up. By the 12-month follow-up, the six implementation adoption strategies had been used to support schools to deliver four of the seven physical activity elements. There was a significant group-by-time interaction for mean minutes of MVPA per day in favour of the intervention group (adjusted difference between groups at follow-up=3.85&#x02005;min, 95% CI (0.79 to 6.91), p&#x02264;0.01), including significantly more vigorous physical activity (2.45&#x02005;min, p&#x02264;0.01), equating to 27&#x02005;min more MVPA per week.</p></sec><sec><title>Summary</title><p>At 12-month follow-up, the intervention had reduced the decline in physical activity among adolescents from disadvantaged schools.

In the first 12-month period, two curriculum-based strategies started, including teaching strategies to maximise activity in PE and the development of individualised student physical activity plans. To facilitate adoption, PE teachers were provided training on strategies to maximise physical activity in PE, prompted by the change agent to teach pedometer-based lessons and support students to complete personalised physical activity plans, were given resources (such as templates and instructions for use) to support students in developing personal activity plans, and given feedback on activity levels in PE based on SOFIT observations. One strategy targeting the school ethos and environment started within the first 12-month period. Offering physical activity in school breaks (lunch and/or recess) started in each school twice per week. Schools were provided equipment, including a variety of balls, hoops and ropes in a secure locked box to facilitate the start of these activities. The final strategy to start within the first 12-month period focused on parent engagement, whereby hard copy newsletters and websites were used to provide parents with updates in the programme being implemented at school plus articles about ways to support students to be active outside of the school. To facilitate the adoption of these physical activity strategies, schools established committees to oversee the changes and were provided with feedback reports outlining the schools progress towards programme adoption at the end of each term. Meetings were held with school executives, PE teachers and the school change agent to communicate the content of each feedback report.</p><sec id="s2d1"><title>Comparison</title><p>Schools allocated to the control group participated in the measurement components of the study only.

The school change agent sent weekly prompts to PE teachers encouraging pedometer-based PE lessons and completion of student physical activity plans. A range of equipment to facilitate recess and/or lunch activities and a storage box were delivered to each school, and feedback reports outlining progress against each strategy were delivered and discussed with school executives and the head PE teacher at the end of each school term.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>We report the 12-month mid-intervention findings from a multicomponent physical activity intervention implemented in disadvantaged secondary schools. At 12-month follow-up, students attending intervention schools participated in nearly 4&#x02005;min more MVPA per day than control group students. To some readers, this may not sound like a clinically meaningful difference. However, it represents 27&#x02005;min more of MVPA over the course of a week.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Small, but clinically significant effect at 1&#x02005;year</title><p>Research in children and adolescents has identified a dose&#x02013;response relationship between the total volume of MVPA and a reduction in cardiometabolic risk;&#x000a0;therefore, any increase in MVPA has public health benefit.<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> Students in the intervention group participated in significantly more vigorous activity and spent a greater proportion of time in MVPA and vigorous activity each day. We suggest that this magnitude of change in physical activity, particularly the increase in vigorous activity, is clinically meaningful, and may facilitate the prevention of chronic disease such as type 2 diabetes and obesity.<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48&#x02013;50</xref></p><p>The results displayed at 12 months extend the results described in a meta-analysis of physical activity interventions in children and adolescents;<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref> however, most interventions focus on children and few on adolescents. As a result, the effect size seems larger than other school-based interventions targeting adolescents.

<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref> Other school-based interventions targeting adolescents demonstrated positive postintervention findings in favour of the intervention group, with effect sizes ranging from 1.9&#x02005;min of MVPA per day after 2&#x02005; years of intervention in the TAAG study,<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref> 3.5&#x02005;min MVPA per day for males only in the 2-year study by Haerens <italic>et al,</italic><xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref> and 50 accelerometer CPM after the 20-month Health in Adolescence study (HEIA).<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref></p><p>More recently, three interventions<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16&#x02013;18</xref> have specifically targeted adolescents from lower socioeconomic backgrounds; however, none have shown a significant intervention effect on MVPA. Given the challenges in conducting intervention research targeting disadvantaged adolescents and schools, a positive mid-intervention effect demonstrates potential to intervene with this target group.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Innovations in this study</title><p>The PA4E1 intervention differed from previous trials as it focused on students attending schools located in disadvantaged areas, targeted the whole school community while incorporating strategies to engage low-active students. In addition, the PA4E1 intervention was longer in duration, and included a school change agent position within a set of clear adoption strategies. Including explicit implementation strategies, as recommended in systematic reviews,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> may explain our positive findings.</p><p>In particular, the change agent, someone located within the school 1&#x02005;day per week to support schools in implementing the physical activity strategies (not to deliver them) is novel. Schools often report time and demanding workloads as barriers to implementing intervention strategies.<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55&#x02013;57</xref> The addition of a change agent aims to overcome these barriers, and maximise intervention reach and fidelity. The addition of a further three physical activity strategies to the PA4E1 intervention in the second phase of intervention, may enhance the likelihood of sustained success. Systematic reviews have concluded that study duration, study size and positive mid-intervention results are associated with a significant intervention effect at follow-up.<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Limitations</title><p>As subgroup analyses were exploratory due to limited power, results should be seen as suggestive and interpreted with caution. At 12-month follow-up, the results were only statistically significant for boys&#x02014;the intervention appeared to be effective for male students, but there was no significant effect among females. These results are in contrast to a systematic review by Yildirim<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> finding girls responded better to interventions than boys. If our midpoint assessment holds true, it would have heath implications as female students who participate in less MVPA per day are less likely to achieve the daily physical activity guidelines and reduce their activity throughout adolescence at a faster rate.<xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref></p><p>Although programme records showed that recess and lunch activities were offered in all intervention schools, girls were less likely to report that their school offered organised recess and lunchtime physical activities compared to boys; a substantial proportion of both sexes were not aware of the activities. As physical activity during recess and lunch has been reported to contribute as much as 40% towards daily physical activity recommendations,<xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref> the introduction of recess and lunchtime activities that are more evident to students, especially those that appeal to girls, seems an important consideration for future research. However, our mid-intervention results may also indicate girls take longer to respond to interventions than boys.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Strengths</title><p>The strengths of this study include the group randomised controlled design, use of an objective measure of physical activity, the focus on disadvantaged populations and the multicomponent socioecological design. However, there are limitations. Obtaining valid accelerometer data in this age group was challenging,<xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref> as has been discussed elsewhere.<xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref></p><p>Although a high proportion of students who participated in baseline also participated at midpoint (84%), only 61% of the baseline sample provided at least three days of valid data at 12&#x02005;months. This decrease, however, seems consistent with other studies for this target group.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>
<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref> Lubans <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref> found that although 79% to 85% of the baseline sample was retained after 12&#x02005;months, only 53.5% of the sample of disadvantaged girls provided three or more days of valid accelerometer data. Similarly, only 64% of students in the HEIA study in Norway provided useable accelerometer data at the 20-month postintervention.<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref> Although accelerometers are considered the optimal method for measuring physical activity, compliance to protocols among the students, particularly disadvantaged students, has been documented as a challenge.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
<xref rid="R63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref> The study did not assess maturation status, which is known to impact on physical activity levels of adolescents.<xref rid="R64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref></p><p>In summary<bold>,</bold> the mid-intervention effects of PA4E1 demonstrates the potential to implement a multicomponent school-based intervention in disadvantaged secondary schools. We will report 24-month follow-up as that is the primary outcome of the study.
