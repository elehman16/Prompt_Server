Dietary advice or supplementation is clearly an attractive option since it has low toxicity and ease of implementation on a population level. We have previously demonstrated that sulforaphane, a dietary isothiocyanate derived from its glucosinolate precursor which is found in broccoli, can prevent cartilage destruction in cells, in <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> models of osteoarthritis. As the next phase of this research, we enrolled 40 patients with knee osteoarthritis undergoing total knee replacement into a proof-of-principle trial. Patients were randomised to either a low or high glucosinolate diet for 14 days prior to surgery. We detected ITCs in the synovial fluid of the high glucosinolate group, but not the low glucosinolate group. This was mirrored by an increase in ITCs and specifically sulforaphane in the plasma. Proteomic analysis of synovial fluid showed significantly distinct profiles between groups with 125 differentially expressed proteins. The functional consequence of this diet will now be tested in a clinical trial.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Osteoarthritis (OA) of the hip or knee is ranked as 11<sup>th</sup> of 291 conditions that contribute to global disability; and the consequent years lived with disability (YLDs) are estimated to have risen by 61% from 1990&#x02013;2010<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. There are no disease-modifying OA drugs (DMOADs) currently available, and pharmacological interventions provide symptomatic relief only, which is frequently insufficient<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>.</p><p>The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and the American College of Rheumatology both recommend OA management strategies based upon activity and exercise, and weight loss if overweight or obese. A third core treatment area recommended by NICE focuses on information to support self-management<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Within these core treatment areas, dietary and exercise advice have been identified as cost effective approaches to the treatment of OA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>.</p><p>We and others have shown previously that sulforaphane (1-isothiocyanato-4-methylsulfinylbutane, SFN) is a chondroprotective agent <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. SFN is derived from a precursor, glucoraphanin, gained from eating brassicas, particularly broccoli. Sulforaphane has broad biological activity and its role in joint health was recently reviewed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. SFN can repress the expression of key metalloproteinases implicated in OA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, regulate NF-&#x003ba;B and Nrf2 signalling, inhibit production of prostaglandin E2 and nitric oxide in chondrocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> and prevent cytokine-induced cartilage destruction <italic>in vitro</italic>
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. <italic>In vivo</italic>, SFN reduces cartilage destruction in the &#x02018;destabilisation of the medial meniscus&#x02019; (DMM) murine model of OA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> and inhibits synovial hyperplasia in collagen-induced arthritis (CIA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Nrf2 knockout mice also showed increased cartilage lesions and oxidative damage in antibody-induced arthritis (AIA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>.</p><p>The pharmacokinetics of SFN has been studied, with one report measuring the average peak plasma concentration of SFN (2.2&#x02009;&#x000b5;M) approximately 2&#x02009;hours following consumption of 100&#x02009;g of broccoli florets prepared as a soup.

In terms of minor events, one participant reported bloating (high glucosinolate group), although the participant continued with the intervention.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec30" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our results provide the first evidence that following broccoli intake, the bioactive constituent ITCs reach the synovial fluid at concentrations with biological impact on the articular joint tissues, and alter the synovial fluid protein profile. This study clearly demonstrates that a dietary bioactive with chondroprotective properties can penetrate the knee in osteoarthritis. These data support our previous mouse model work, where we showed that a SFN-rich diet can provide chondroprotection in a mouse model of OA, though SFN and its metabolites were not measured directly in the joint.</p><p>Mean total ITC levels were 4.47-fold lower in the synovial fluid than the plasma. The concentration of small molecules in synovial fluid often reflects that of plasma since permeability into synovial fluid occurs through free diffusion from the endothelium of the synovial microvasculature and surrounding interstitium. The synovial lining has no basement membrane and therefore small molecule diffusion is limited only by the volume of intercellular space<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, however, many non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs also show lower concentrations in synovial fluid than plasma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. This reflects the kinetics of elimination of the drug, repeat administration and also protein binding. In this study we did not standardize the timing of broccoli intake compared to sampling of blood or synovial fluid. It is also possible that the diet modifies synovial fluid volume which was not monitored in this study, though this is unlikely to be significant. Plasma levels for ITCs and SFN were higher than expected given the limited available published data. In the current study the timing of the broccoli meal during the day was not controlled. This and possible differences in the rate of metabolism by each patient&#x02019;s unique microbiome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> may explain the greater variation observed for plasma ITC levels in the high glucosinolate group. Twelve of the 29 synovial fluid proteins with significant difference between groups are commonly found in plasma, and 10 of these were decreased in the high glucosinolate group. In the inflamed joint, changes in the permeability of the synovium have been described, whereby increases in protein and solute concentration within the joint cavity have been observed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Resolution of aberrant synovial permeability by the high glucosinolate diet may offer one possible explanation for a reduction in the number of plasma proteins observed in this group, though this remains to be confirmed. Furthermore, a number of the proteins highlighted in our study (table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>) have been reported in human OA synovial fluid previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>.</p><p>Common plasma proteins aside, there were a number of interesting proteins decreased in abundance with the high glucosinolate diet including NBL1, CALR, SMARCC1 and type VI collagen. NBL1 is an antagonist of bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), key in cartilage homeostasis. Increased gene expression of NBL1 in cartilage is reported in mouse and rat models of OA and in human OA cartilage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. Calreticulin has functions outside of calcium regulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. Calreticulin is increased in the plasma and synovial fluid of RA patients and this correlated with swollen joint count and disease activity score<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. SMARCC1 is a regulator of gene transcription through chromatin remodelling, and is found in exosomes in cancer with no reported function in the joint<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. Type VI collagen is a structural component of the perichondral matrix within articular cartilage. It has been reported in synovial fluid, with no significant difference between OA and control<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Methyltransferase-like 18 (METTL18) was significantly increased in abundance in the high glucosinolate group. It is a putative methyltransferase, and interacts with molecular chaperones<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. Individual neopeptides were not reproducibly identified across all samples and this technology requires further development to be conclusive.</p><p>Gene expression in either cartilage or fat was not significantly different between groups when data were adjusted for multiple testing. Genes shown to be significant in unadjusted data are therefore of uncertain importance.</p><p>The collagen degradation biomarker Coll 2-1 has previously been shown to decrease after supplementation with a form of curcumin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>, however only at the 85&#x02009;day time point and not at the earlier 14&#x02009;day time point.</p><p>Validated diet diaries showed that patients consumed similar levels of energy, fat, protein and fibre during the intervention. The high glucosinolate group consumed significantly higher levels of vitamin C, likely due to the high vitamin C content of broccoli. We therefore cannot rule out the contribution of vitamin C to the effects observed in the study. Future studies involving broccoli intake should include a control for vitamin C levels.</p><p>The interaction of GST genotype and ITC metabolism measured as rate of urinary secretion has been reported previously with differing associations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. It has been suggested that specific GST null genotypes may confer a protective effect through a lowered rate of metabolism that extends tissue exposure time. Our cohort showed no associations of genotype with study outcomes though numbers in each subgroup were small (data not shown).</p><sec id="Sec31"><title>Limitations</title><p>Our study was a proof-of-principle study and limitations of the trial design were the short intervention time and unspecified timing of broccoli intake. These limitations and/or the use of end-stage OA patients whose tissue gene expression maybe beyond modification by dietary intervention, may have contributed to the small changes in gene expression observed. Similarly, cartilage degradation rates <italic>in vitro</italic> were likely affected by rapid metabolism of dietary SFN in these cultures. The link between ITCs in the joint and changes in the synovial fluid may be indirect and this requires further investigation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec32" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This is the first human study to show that increased broccoli intake results in ITC uptake into the joint, with concomitant changes in the joint. Coupled with our earlier data showing efficacy of SFN in both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> laboratory models of OA, this supports the need for an appropriately designed clinical trial to determine the impact of dietary SFN in OA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec33"><p>
