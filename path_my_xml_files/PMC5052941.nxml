The aim of this study was to compare methylphenidate with the combination of methylphenidate and risperidone in preschool children with ADHD. Forty-two preschool children, aged 3&#x02013;6 years, diagnosed with ADHD by a child and adolescent psychiatrist according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition-Text Revision criteria, were enrolled in a 6-week, single-blind clinical trial and administered with methylphenidate (5&#x02013;30 mg/dl) or the combination of methylphenidate and risperidone (0.25&#x02013;2 mg/dl) in Iran. Treatment outcomes were assessed using the Conners' Rating Scale and Clinical Global Impression (CGI) Scale at baseline and 3 and 6 weeks after starting the drugs administration. Side effects were rated by a checklist and body weight was measured at each visit. There were no significant differences between the two protocols in Parent Conners' Rating Scale scores (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05) and CGI scores (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05). Both groups showed a significant improvement in ADHD symptoms over the 6 weeks of treatment for Parent Conners' Rating Scale (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). The combination group used significantly lower doses of methylphenidate compared to the other group (<italic>P</italic> = 0.002). The most common adverse effects were anorexia (21.7%) and daytime drowsiness (17.4%) in combination treatment group and insomnia (33.3%) and anorexia (25%) in methylphenidate group. Risperidone and methylphenidate may be effective and well tolerated in preschool children with ADHD, and adding risperidone to methylphenidate may decrease the occurrence of some side effects of methylphenidate such as insomnia and anorexia and lower the dose of methylphenidate may be needed to control symptoms.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder</kwd><kwd>methylphenidate</kwd><kwd>preschool children</kwd><kwd>risperidone</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Chronic disease has a significant impact on the physical and mental health of patients and their families.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common psychiatric disorders in children.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] ADHD is highly prevalent in Iran, and there are obstacles to accessing mental health services.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Children with ADHD are predisposed to academic failure, substance abuse, and social adjustment problems.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Care and effective treatment can improve the quality of life considerably.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Sympathomimetics are the first-line medications for ADHD, and methylphenidate is one of the most frequently used drugs of this class.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>Methylphenidate is the first-line psychopharmacological treatment for preschool ADHD in the Preschool Psychopharmacology Working Group algorithm,[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] but the Preschool ADHD Treatment Study showed that the effect size in preschoolers is smaller than in older children.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] This age group shows higher rates of emotional adverse effects such as nervousness, irritability, and crying as well.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Loss of appetite, short duration of action (3&#x02013;4 h), and rebound phenomenon are some issues that limit the use of methylphenidate to treat ADHD.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] The number of controlled clinical trials conducted on stimulant drugs in preschool children is limited.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>In addition, other pharmacological strategies such as mood stabilizers and antipsychotic drugs have been used for ADHD.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Risperidone has been reported to be an effective and safe drug for disruptive behavior disorders (DBDs) and ADHD in children.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Effect of the combination of risperidone and methylphenidate has already been investigated in some studies.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>In the few studies which used risperidone in preschool children, it was found to be an effective and tolerable drug for this age group although they showed considerable weight gain and increased level of prolactin.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] The use of atypical antipsychotics has been risen significantly for treating DBDs in children,[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and positive effects of this class of drugs for disruptive behavior have increased their use in children with ADHD.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>As methylphenidate can cause insomnia, loss of appetite and emotional side effects which can be problematic, especially in preschool children, adding risperidone to it may improve some of these negative side effects and lower doses of methylphenidate may be needed to control symptoms of ADHD.

The study protocol was approved by the respective institutional research center. The study population consisted of preschool children with ADHD comorbid with DBDs. The sample size was decided to be 21 children in each group selected based on convenience sampling from children referred to the clinic. The parents provided written informed consent for their children's participation in the study after they were informed about the procedures and purposes. Participants were randomly assigned to one of the treatment groups of methylphenidate alone (Group 1) and methylphenidate plus risperidone (Group 2).</p><p>Inclusion criteria were being 3&#x02013;6 years old, suffering hyperactive/impulsive or mixed subtype of ADHD comorbid with DBDs diagnosed by a child psychiatrist based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition-Text Revision criteria, and exclusion criteria having mental retardation or other developmental disorders and any physical disorder, and being on treatment with any psychotropic drug during the last 4 weeks. Besides that, if children showed significant or intolerable adverse effects during the treatment, they were excluded from the study.</p><p>Data were collected using a demographic data questionnaire, revised Conners' Parent Rating Scale-short form, clinical global scale severity and improvement (CGS-S and CGS-I), and a checklist of medication side effects and body weight measurement. The primary assessment instrument was Conners' Parent Rating Scale-revised, which consists of 27 items and four subscales. Each item is scored as 0-3. This scale has been translated into Persian and standardized in Iran.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] The CGS-S and CGS-I scores of the disorder range from 0 to 7. In this study, 68 parents of children who met the inclusion criteria were approached, of whom 47 consented to participate in the study. Methylphenidate was started at a dose of 2.5 mg twice daily and was increased by 2.5&#x02013;5 mg each week based on the treatment response and the patient's tolerance, to a maximum of 20/day.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Risperidone was started with a single dose of 1.25 mg/day and was increased by 0.25&#x02013;0.5 mg each week to a maximum dose of 2 mg/day.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] For blinding, the assessing psychiatrist was blind to group assignment of the participants. Before starting the drug, Conners' scale score, CGI-S score, and weight were measured for each patient. Measurements were repeated after 3 and 6 weeks of treatment.</p><p>Independent <italic>t</italic>-test was used for comparison of age and Conners' Rating Scale scores between the two groups at baseline. Chi-square test was used to compare gender between the two groups. Mann-Whitney test was used for comparison of methylphenidate dose at weeks 3 and 6, and CGI-S scores at baseline. Two-way repeated measures analysis of variance (time &#x000d7; treatment interaction) was run for Conners' Rating Scale and its subscales. The two groups were considered between-subjects factor (group) and the measurements during treatment the within-subjects factor (time). Furthermore, repeated measures analysis of variance (time &#x000d7; body weight) was conducted to compare body weight between two groups. Mann-Whitney test was used to compare CGS-I at weeks 3 and 6 of assessment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Forty-seven children with ADHD aged 3&#x02013;6 years participated in the study.

The most common adverse effects in this group were insomnia (33.3%) and anorexia (25%) [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec1-4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Results of this study showed that in both groups, the total and subscale scores of Conners' Rating Scale were significantly reduced, but there was no significant difference between the two groups. Both protocols were well tolerated and no serious side effects occurred. In the study of Arabgol <italic>et al</italic>., risperidone was compared with methylphenidate in preschool children with ADHD in a 6-week, double-blind clinical trial. Results showed that there was no significant difference between the two protocols in the Parent ADHD Rating Scale scores and Parent Conners' Rating Scale scores. They concluded that risperidone monotherapy might be effective and well tolerated in preschool children with ADHD. The most common adverse effects seen with risperidone were daytime drowsiness and anorexia, and with methylphenidate anorexia, nervousness, and disturbed sleeping.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>In the study of Safavi <italic>et al</italic>., comparing risperidone with aripiprazole in ADHD preschool children, both medications were relatively safe and effective; however, some patients experienced reduced effectiveness of the medications during the 6 weeks of the trial.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>The results of a retrospective analysis of 44 cases showed that bitherapy decreased the symptoms of ADHD and conduct disorder, sleep disorders, and anxiety. Regarding the safety of the bitherapy, a compensation effect on weight gain and appetite was observed in 70% and 50% of patients, respectively. They concluded that bitherapy appears to be particularly effective on ADHD with conduct disorder symptoms. Although tolerance may limit its use, the benefit/risk ratio seems favorable for a number of children.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>Another study evaluated 52-week clinical outcomes of children with co-occurring ADHD, DBD, and serious physical aggression who participated in a prospective, longitudinal study that began with a controlled, 9-week clinical trial comparing the relative efficacy of stimulant medication versus stimulant plus risperidone. The results showed that only 43% of participants in the augmented group and 36% in the basic group still adhered to their assigned regimen (not significant). Both treatment strategies were associated with clinical improvement at follow-up, and primary behavioral outcomes did not differ significantly. The participants in the augmented group were more likely to have a CGI severity score of 1-3 (i.e, normal to mildly ill) at follow-up than those in the basic group. The augmented group had elevated prolactin levels, and the basic group lost weight over time. Findings were generally similar whether group assignment was conducted randomly or according to follow-up treatment status.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>Aman <italic>et al</italic>. study showed that adding risperidone to methylphenidate results in significant improvement in antisocial behaviors in school-aged children with ADHD. They concluded that risperidone causes moderate but variable improvement, does not have severe adverse effects, and can be used combined with stimulant drugs.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] In our study, inconsistent with Aman <italic>et al</italic>.'s study, adding risperidone to methylphenidate did not cause significant improvement of symptoms. This may be explained by the fact that in Aman <italic>et al</italic>.'s study, children received psychostimulant for 3 weeks, titrated for optimal effect, and if improvement was likely at the end of week 3, either placebo or risperidone was added; however, in the present study, one group received the combination from baseline, and patients in the combination treatment group used lower doses of methylphenidate than the methylphenidate alone group.</p><p>In our study, the most frequent side effects in methylphenidate group were insomnia, loss of appetite, agitation, and nervousness, but in the combination group, the most frequent side effects were loss of appetite and sedation. Regarding weight variation, the combination group gained more weight than methylphenidate group, yet with no significant difference. Adding risperidone to methylphenidate may decrease the frequency of adverse effects such as insomnia, anorexia, weight loss, and nervousness. Moreover, in the combination treatment group, the patients needed lower doses of methylphenidate which can alleviate side effects in the patients who cannot tolerate higher doses of methylphenidate to control symptoms.</p><p>In this study, as with similar studies, patients showed no serious side effects.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>The results of the present study show that risperidone and methylphenidate may be effective and well tolerated in preschool children with ADHD.
