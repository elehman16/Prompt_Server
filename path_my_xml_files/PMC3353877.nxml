The primary outcome was the number of days with dysmenorrhoeic pain over 140 days. Secondary outcomes included other dysmenorrhoea-related pain outcomes, bleeding profile, satisfaction and safety.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Overall, 223 patients received study medication.

Moderate dysmenorrhoea was defined as requiring OTC analgesics during menstruation with significant pain relief upon intake, as well as the presence of symptoms that interfere with usual activities. Severe dysmenorrhoea was defined as requiring analgesics during menstruation, with inconsistent relief from OTC analgesics, prescription analgesics required in at least some cycles, as well as discomfort that resulted in an inability to work or to carry out usual activities. Additionally, to meet the inclusion criteria, patients were required to have a self-rated sum pain total score of at least eight on the Andersch and Milsom dysmenorrhoea grading scale<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref> over the two baseline menstrual cycles.</p><p>At the screening phase, eligible women were grouped as COC switchers (who were required to have a washout phase comprising three menstrual cycles, the second and third of which constituted baseline cycles one and two) or COC starters (who did not require a washout phase and simply had two baseline cycles).</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Study regimens</title><p>Eligible women were randomly allocated to one of two regimens of EE/DRSP: a flexible<sub>MIB</sub> and a conventional 28-day regimen. For the flexible<sub>MIB</sub> group, women took EE 20 &#x000b5;g/DRSP 3 mg at around the same time each day, continuously for at least 24 days (mandatory phase). After 24 days, EE/DRSP tablets could be continued for up to a maximum of 120 consecutive days (flexible intake phase). During the flexible intake phase (Days 25&#x02013;120) women were, however, instructed to finish the intake cycle by observing a 4-day tablet-free interval if they experienced three consecutive days of bleeding or spotting. The 4-day tablet-free interval had to be taken no later than after a maximum 120 days of continuous tablet intake. After each 4-day tablet-free interval, women started a new cycle with a minimum of 24 days and a maximum of 120 days. Treatment was intended to last at least 140 days and, therefore, a flexible number of cycles were required to reach this duration, with the 140 days including at least one 4-day tablet-free interval.</p><p>For the conventional group, women took EE 20 &#x000b5;g/DRSP 3 mg for five 28-day cycles (total 140 days); each cycle consisted of 24 days of active hormonal intake followed by a 4-day hormone-free interval (during which women received hormone-free tablets).</p><p>Patients were permitted to take ibuprofen as rescue medication (which was documented).</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Study variables</title><p>The primary efficacy variable was the number of days with dysmenorrhoeic pain over 140 days. Dysmenorrhoeic pain was defined as any spasmodic pelvic, lower abdominal pain with possible radiation towards the back or thighs recorded in a daily diary in correspondence with a withdrawal and/or menstrual bleeding episode. Pain severity was self-assessed on a daily basis using a verbal rating scale with the following four categories: 0, no pain; 1, mild dysmenorrhoeic pain with no need for an analgesic; 2, moderate dysmenorrhoeic pain with need for an analgesic; and 3, severe dysmenorrhoeic pain with the need for an analgesic.</p><p>Secondary efficacy variables included: days with at least moderate dysmenorrhoeic pain; days with dysmenorrhoeic pain associated with withdrawal or unscheduled bleeding; days with pelvic pain; days with dysmenorrhoeic pain that interfered with daily activities; bleeding profile (including the number of days and episodes of bleeding/spotting by 90-day reference periods, bleeding intensity (none, spotting, light, normal or heavy) and the proportion of subjects with withdrawal and intracyclic bleeding during individual cycles); investigator-assessed global improvement in dysmenorrhoea (seven-point scale ranging from 1=very much improved to 7=very much worse); and user satisfaction (seven-point scale ranging from 1=very much satisfied, to 7=very much dissatisfied).</p><p>Safety evaluations included AEs, metabolic parameters, carbohydrate metabolism, vital signs, clinical laboratory tests, and physical and gynaecological examinations.</p></sec><sec id="s7"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The study sample size was determined on the assumption that for the primary efficacy variable there would be a mean difference between the flexible<sub>MIB</sub> and conventional groups of 5 days, with a standard deviation (SD) of 10 days. Based on a standardised effect size of 0.5, a dropout rate of 20%, &#x003b1; of 0.05 (two-sided) and 90% power, a sample size of 108 women per regimen was required to have 86 evaluable women per group. At screening, eligible subjects were sequentially assigned a unique three-digit patient identification number. Subjects were then randomised 1:1 using a computer-generated randomisation list using randomisation blocks of four. These blocks were assigned to study centres. Within each centre the allocation of a randomisation number was linked in a chronologically ascending manner to the sequence of arrival of the patients at the study centre.</p><p>All data were evaluated according to the type of data, that is, descriptive statistics (including at least arithmetic mean, SD, minimum, median and maximum) for continuous variables and frequency tables for categorical data.

Because patients were not receiving COCs for up to three menstrual cycles during this period, it was possible to compare the number of days with pain during screening with the number of days with pain during treatment. For this purpose, pre-treatment days with dysmenorrhoeic pain were projected to a 140-day period.

When looking at the results of the primary efficacy variable (see above), the overall benefit of treatment in terms of a reduction in the total number of days with dysmenorrhoeic pain was approximately one-third for patients who received the conventional regimen and approximately one-half for patients who received the flexible<sub>MIB</sub> regimen.</p></sec><sec id="s15"><title>Number of days with dysmenorrhoeic pain in relation to cycle length</title><p>In an exploratory <italic>post hoc</italic> analysis, the number of days of pain in patients who received the flexible<sub>MIB</sub> regimen were analysed according to the length of the flexible intake cycle.

Compared with a conventional regimen of 24 days of active treatment followed by a 4-day tablet-free interval, the flexible<sub>MIB</sub> regimen was associated with significantly fewer days with dysmenorrhoeic pain over 140 days, as well as considerably fewer days with at least moderate dysmenorrhoeic pain, dysmenorrhoeic pain associated with withdrawal bleeding, days in which dysmenorrhoeic pain interfered with daily activities, and days with pelvic pain. This effect may have been even more pronounced if the flexible<sub>MIB</sub> regimen had been compared with a conventional 28-day regimen COC that uses a 7-day hormone-free interval and 21 days of active treatment. Additionally, investigator-assessed global improvement and user satisfaction scores were more favourable in the flexible<sub>MIB</sub> group compared with the conventional group. The small difference between the groups in favour of the flexible<sub>MIB</sub> regimen may be explained by its bleeding pattern with fewer menstrual periods compared with the well-known standard application of COCs that mimic a normal menstrual cycle. Furthermore, the flexible extended regimen may lead to better patient compliance.</p><p>In addition to reducing the frequency of withdrawal bleeding episodes by extending the menstrual cycle, the benefit of the flexible<sub>MIB</sub> regimen was that it provided a method to manage any intracyclic (breakthrough) bleeding that occurred during the flexible intake phase (Days 25&#x02013;120). By observing a 4-day tablet-free interval after experiencing three consecutive days of bleeding/spotting, breakthrough bleeding was turned into withdrawal bleeding. This facilitated better management of intracyclic (breakthrough) bleeding, enabling women to experience fewer overall days of bleeding over 140 days and fewer bleeding episodes, compared with the conventional regimen.</p><p>The MIB strategy meant that the bleeding profile was somewhat different between the flexible<sub>MIB</sub> regimen and the conventional regimen; the mean length, maximum length and range of length of bleeding/spotting episodes and the mean length of withdrawal bleeding episodes were all slightly higher in the flexible<sub>MIB</sub> group than in the conventional group. This probably relates to the fact that, by definition, the withdrawal bleeding episode under treatment with the flexible<sub>MIB</sub> regimen often included the 3-day &#x02018;wait and see&#x02019; period of bleeding/spotting that was instructed before women managed their intracyclic (breakthrough) bleeding by taking a 4-day tablet-free interval. The onset of the withdrawal bleeding episode occurred 3 days earlier in relation to the hormone-free interval in the flexible<sub>MIB</sub> group compared with the conventional regimen. Again, this was likely a result of the 3-day &#x02018;wait-and-see&#x02019; period.</p><p>The occurrence of intracyclic bleeding, the number of intracyclic bleeding days and episodes and the maximum length of intracyclic bleeding episodes varied markedly between the two groups. Such differences can be explained, at least in part, by between-treatment differences in the way in which data were analysed and differences in the two regimens themselves (as described above). In addition, the flexible<sub>MIB</sub> regimen was designed to achieve prolonged bleeding-free intervals. While bleeding/spotting episodes of three consecutive days were to be managed by introducing a 4-day tablet-free interval (thus converting them into withdrawal bleeding episodes), episodes of bleeding/spotting of less than 3 days were to be ignored. Not managing shorter bleeding/spotting episodes was considered a suitable strategy to avoid too frequent withdrawal bleeding episodes; however, this ultimately increased the incidence of intracyclic bleeding in women who received the flexible<sub>MIB</sub> regimen (data not shown).</p><p>There have been relatively few randomised studies that have specifically assessed the effect of continuous use or fixed extended regimens of COCs on dysmenorrhoea. Several studies have, however, assessed the effect of such regimens on menstrual-related symptoms in general, including dysmenorrhoea. In a study among women with menstrual-related symptoms (<italic>n</italic>=50), extending the number of consecutive days of active pills (up to a maximum of 12 weeks) was shown to reduce dysmenorrhoea, menorrhagia and premenstrual symptoms.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref> Two studies have shown that the COC EE 30 &#x000b5;g/DRSP 3 mg, when used continuously for either 84 or 168 days, improved menstrual-related symptoms, including dysmenorrhoea.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>

In a pooled analysis of three large-scale observational studies assessing the benefits and risks of this COC in an extended regimen (mean treatment duration 5.8 months), a reduction in dysmenorrhoea symptoms was observed, as measured by a reduction in analgesic use, absence from school/university/work and restrictions in leisure and sporting activities.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref> Overall, the results from the current study and those previously published support the extended use of COCs to reduce menstrual-related symptoms such as dysmenorrhoea.</p><p>In this study, both regimens were generally well tolerated and the overall incidence of AEs was similar between the two groups.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s21"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Compared with a conventional regimen of EE/DRSP, a flexible extended regimen of EE/DRSP with management of intracyclic (breakthrough) bleeding was associated with better relief of dysmenorrhoeic complaints, including significantly fewer days with dysmenorrhoeic pain, in women with moderate-to-severe primary dysmenorrhoea. The flexible extended regimen has the advantage of being able to delay menstruation for up to 124 days. The flexible phase of the intake cycle allows women to react to the occurrence of breakthrough bleeding/spotting by initiating a 4-day break that concludes the cycle. The strategy of managing breakthrough bleeding/spotting by initiating a withdrawal bleeding has been shown to reduce the overall number of bleeding days, bleeding episodes and menses, and the number of days with pain in women suffering from primary dysmenorrhoea.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Medical writing support was provided by Matt Weitz and Clare Wheatcroft (of <italic>in</italic>Science Communications) during the preparation of this manuscript.
