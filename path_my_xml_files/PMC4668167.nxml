maintaining forward head posture, muscular endurance, and cervical mobility. It also
examined the effectiveness of deep cervical flexor training with a pressure biofeedback
unit. [Subjects and Methods] Twenty college students were recruited and randomly assigned
to groups that underwent either deep cervical flexor training with a pressure biofeedback
unit (experimental group, n=10) or conventional deep cervical flexor training (control
group, n=10). The craniovertebral angle of each subject was measured with a lateral-view
picture. Neck mobility was assessed using a cervical range of motion device and muscular
endurance was measured using a pressure biofeedback unit. Both groups performed
conventional deep cervical flexor exercises three times a week for six weeks. The
experimental group underwent a pressure biofeedback unit training was 5 to10 minutes/day,
thrice a week. [Results] Cervical range of motion in the experimental group increased
significantly between the end of training and the end of the four week detraining period,
compared to that in control group. [Conclusion] Deep cervical flexor training with a
pressure biofeedback unit is a useful method for maintaining neck mobility and muscular
endurance in people with forward head posture.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Forward head posture</kwd><kwd>Deep cervical flexor</kwd><kwd>Pressure biofeedback unit</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Forward head posture (FHP) occurs when the head is anterior to a vertical line through the
individual&#x02019;s center of gravity<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. FHP can
include both an upper cervical extension and a lower cervical flexion<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>, and it can induce lengthening and weakness of the anterior
cervical muscles and shortening of the posterior region<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. If this abnormal change in the muscles and joints of the cervical
region is prolonged, it may cause to restrict cervical mobility and decreased muscular
performance. Early research on FHP suggested that deep cervical flexor (DCF) play a major
role in supporting and straightening the cervical spine<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. This research also suggested that the proper use of DCF, before
beginning the strengthening of the global cervical muscles, is an effective rehabilitation
strategy for cervical disorders<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Previous
studies have shown that four weeks of DCF training improved the FHP in dentists with chronic
neck pain<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. These studies suggest that
people with FHP should complete DCF training, because it would help them maintain a proper
cervical posture. However, there is still insufficient evidence in support of the use of DCF
training for correcting FHP. This may be because many of the previous studies on DCF
training were focused mainly on alleviating headaches and neck pain<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>It has been suggested that using a pressure biofeedback unit (PBU) is a more effective
method for DCF strengthening than conventional exercises<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, until now, there has been little information regarding the
ability of subjects to maintain the benefits of DCF training. There are in sufficient data
regarding the longevity of these benefits after the completion of training. If
physiotherapists are aware of this longevity, they will be able to plan more effective
rehabilitation programs. Therefore, it is important to confirm whether there are factors
that increase or decrease the angle of FHP, muscular performance, and cervical mobility
following DCF training. Therefore, the purposes of this study were to investigate the
effects of DCF training on maintenance of FHP, muscular endurance, and cervical mobility.
This study also aimed to find an effective method of DCF training with a PBU.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects of this study were twenty college students (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>General characteristics of the subjects</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (yrs)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Height (cm)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Weight (kg)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">NDI (score)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Experimental group (Males, 5 ; Females, 5)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">23.9&#x000b1;3.3</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">166.9&#x000b1;12.9</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">61.8&#x000b1;15.5</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7.3&#x000b1;3.6</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Control group (Males, 6 ; Females, 4)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">23.1&#x000b1;3.1</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">169.0&#x000b1;9.3</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">60.8&#x000b1;8.0</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">12.4&#x000b1;8.2</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Mean &#x000b1; SD</p><p>NDI: neck disability index</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap>).

defined as the maximum time that subjects could maintain a base pushing pressure greater
than 50 mmHg. The 50 mmHg threshold was established through pilot tests. Without dominantly
using the superficial neck flexors, the subjects lifted their heads and time was measured
until the each subject&#x02019;s chin was lifted in a supine position. The subjects bent their hip
and knee joints to avoid lumbar lordosis. Contractions of the superficial neck flexors were
carefully avoided by the subjects. These contractions were monitored by the examiner using
palpation.</p><p>All exercise protocols and programs were taken from previously published studies<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.

trapezius and SCM muscle, and in lengthening and weakening of the cervical flexors<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. An earlier research has suggested that
when performance is impaired, the balance between the stabilizers on the posterior region of
the neck and the DCF is damaged, resulting in a loss of proper alignment and posture. This
loss of alignment, can then induce cervical impairment<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, using DCF training as a rehabilitation program for FHP
is based on the rationale that DCF plays a major role in the stabilization of the head and
on neck posture<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>This study was designed to investigate whether the angular degrees of FHP, muscular
endurance, and cervical mobility are affected by DCF training. It also aimed to find the
effectiveness of DCF training with a PBU in comparison to conventional DCF training. The
results of our study confirmed that six weeks of DCF training with a PBU improves the
cervical mobility and muscular endurance of DCF in subjects with FHP even after four weeks
of detraining. Moreover, DCF training with a PBU was more effective than DCF training
without a PBU. As mentioned previously, until now, there has been little research regarding
the ability of people with FHP to maintain the benefits of DCF training and there are
insufficient data to suggest how much these benefits decrease over time. The lack of
research in this area limited the possibility for direct comparison with other studies.
Therefore, only a partial discussion of the comparisons of our work with other studies was
possible.</p><p>The results of this study suggest that DCF training with a PBU improves muscular endurance
by facilitating DCF contraction, and that stretching exercises induce increases mobility of
shortened muscles in subjects with FHP. Consequently, the beneficial effects of this
training lasted for up to four weeks following a six-week training program.</p><p>Muscular performance can also be increased with the use of PBU training. Craniocervical
flexion is the basic action of DCF<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup> and craniocervical flexion exercises using a
PBU aim to train the longus capitus and colli<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. The results of our study are similar to earlier studies, which
examined the direct application of massage to the longus colli and the results of this on
increases of cervical ROM<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. In these studies, stretching seemed to improve cervical
mobility. Stretching, was conducted with a conventional DCF exercise and consisted of
stretches in the neck muscles, shoulders and scapular region. PBU training and stretching
are beneficial because stretching the shortened muscles and strengthening the weak muscles
are required to achieve these optimal length and strength of those muscles thereby improving
muscular performance<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. In this sense, the
results of this study seems logical, as it is generally true that PBU training facilitates
effective contraction of the longus colli and flattening of the cervical curve<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The results of this study have some potential limitations. As the endurance of the DCF
increase, the degree of cervical lodorsis decreases. Therefore, cervical posture is related
more closely to muscular endurance than to muscular strength of the DCF<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Unfortunately, no significant changes in craniovertebral
angle were shown in this study following DCF training, even though the muscular endurance of
the DCF increased significantly. This may have been influenced by musculoskeletal problems
in the study&#x02019;s subjects. Additionally, the duration of the follow-up period was too short.
Future studies should be designed to address these factors.</p><p>In conclusion, six weeks of DCF training with a PBU is a useful method for maintaining neck
mobility and muscular endurance in people with FHP.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>MY</given-names></name><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>HY</given-names></name><name><surname>Yong</surname><given-names>MS</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Characteristics of cervical position sense in subjects
