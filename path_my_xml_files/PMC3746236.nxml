Various researches have demonstrated the underlying importance of Wnt proteins and wound growth factors in stimulating DP associated stem cells. Microneedling works by stimulation of stem cells and inducing activation of growth factors.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>Hundred cases of mild to moderate (III vertex or IV) androgenetic alopecia (AGA) were recruited into 2 groups. After randomization one group was offered weekly microneedling treatment with twice daily 5% minoxidil lotion (Microneedling group); other group was given only 5% minoxidil lotion. After baseline global photographs, the scalp were shaved off to ensure equal length of hair shaft in all. Hair count was done in 1 cm<sup>2</sup> targeted fixed area (marked with tattoo) at baseline and at end of therapy (week 12). The 3 primary efficacy parameters assessed were: Change from baseline hair count at 12 weeks, patient assessment of hair growth at 12 weeks, and investigator assessment of hair growth at 12 weeks. A blinded investigators evaluated global photographic response. The response was assessed by 7- point scale.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>(1) Hair counts &#x02013; The mean change in hair count at week 12 was significantly greater for the Microneedling group compared to the Minoxidil group (91.4 vs 22.2 respectively). (2) Investigator evaluation &#x02013; Forty patients in Microneedling group had +2 to +3 response on 7-point visual analogue scale, while none showed the same response in the Minoxidil group. (3) Patient evaluation &#x02013; In the Microneedling group, 41 (82%) patients reported more than 50% improvement versus only 2 (4.5%) patients in the Minoxidil group. Unsatisfied patients to conventional therapy for AGA got good response with Microneedling treatment.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Conclusion:</title><p>Dermaroller along with Minoxidil treated group was statistically superior to Minoxidil treated group in promoting hair growth in men with AGA for all 3 primary efficacy measures of hair growth.

The transition of telogen follicles into anagen is associated with activation of Wnt/beta-catenin/Lef1, Sonic Hedgehog (Shh), and STAT3 pathways and down-regulation of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] The growth factor BMP-4, also appears to play an important role in suppressing follicular growth and differentiation during telogen.</p><p>Androgenetic alopecia (AGA), is the most common type of alopecia in men, which is an androgen mediated event. Circulating androgens, including, dihydrotestosterone (DHT), enter the follicle via the DP's capillaries, bind to the androgen receptor within the DP cells and then activate or repress molecular signaling pathways responsible for premature transition from anagen to catagen and follicular miniaturization. This include suppression of stimulatory pathways of Wnt, Stat 3 and Shh and up-regulation of suppressive pathways (e.g., Dickkopf-related protein 1 and BMP 4). Dkk-1, which is secreted from DP cells in response to DHT pathway, is a potent inhibitor of Wnt pathway.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] BMP 4 protein also acts through the activation of DKK pathway, thereby inhibiting hair follicular growth.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>]</p><p>The only Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved treatment options for male AGA are Finasteride and Minoxidil, which show cosmetically acceptable new hair growth in modest percentage of patients.

They were randomly allocated into Microneedling (<italic>N</italic> = 50) and Minoxidil group (<italic>N</italic> = 50) by using the &#x02018;tossing coin&#x02019; method. All patients&#x02019; scalp was shaved off before treatment to ensure equal length of hair shaft at baseline. In the Microneedling group, patients received a weekly Microneedling procedure on the scalp with 1 ml of 5% Minoxidil lotion applied twice daily. In Minoxidil group, patient applied only 1 ml of 5% Minoxidil lotion twice daily.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Microneedling procedure</title><p>The shaven scalp was prepared with betadine and normal saline.

In animal studies, topical Minoxidil shortens telogen, causing premature entry of resting hair follicles into anagen, and it probably has a similar action in humans. Minoxidil may also cause prolongation of anagen and increases hair follicle size.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>]</p><p>Minoxidil and Finasteride show their greatest efficacy in reducing loss of hair with small percentage of new hair growth seen after at least 4 months of daily usage.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>]</p><p>Efficacy of Minoxidil varies from 20% to 40% as per various studies.
