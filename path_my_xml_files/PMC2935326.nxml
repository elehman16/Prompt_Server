Patients continued background MTX and were randomly assigned to placebo or rituximab (MabThera, Roche, Welwyn Garden City, UK; Rituxan, Genentech, South San Francisco, California, USA and Biogen Idec, San Diego, California, USA). Rituximab 1000 mg was administered by intravenous infusion on days 1 and 15. All patients received corticosteroid treatment, consisting of intravenous methylprednisolone 100 mg before each infusion and oral prednisone during the 2-week treatment period (60 mg on days 2&#x02212;7, 30 mg on days 8&#x02212;14).</p><p>From weeks 16 to 24, patients who failed to respond to treatment could receive rescue therapy. Patients randomised to placebo could receive rituximab and patients randomised to rituximab could receive standard care. Patients completing week 24 were eligible to receive further courses of rituximab within an open-label extension study. Further courses of rituximab were also available for placebo patients who had responded to rescue treatment.</p><p>Radiographs of hands, wrists (posterior/anterior) and feet (anterior/posterior) were performed at screening (baseline) and at weeks 24, 56 and 104, relative to randomisation.

All assessments compared baseline and week 104. Radiographic changes were also determined during discrete time intervals of baseline to 24 weeks, 24&#x02013;56 weeks and 56&#x02013;104 weeks. The annualised progression rate (APR) was calculated to provide a measure of the rate of change in progression standardised to a common time interval.

The proportion of patients with no progression (57%) achieved with rituximab treatment compares well with that seen with other treatments with biological agents, albeit in less treatment-refractory patient populations.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref> Importantly, of those rituximab patients with no progression in the first year, 87% maintained a non-progressive status during the second year.</p><p>Although patients were initially randomised to either rituximab or placebo, 82% of placebo patients had switched to rituximab by 2 years. The impact of this switch on the progression of joint damage in this placebo&#x02013;rituximab group is evident by the reduced changes in scores between time periods and the gradual slowing in their APR. The consequence of this switch to active treatment is that the degree of progression observed in the &#x02018;placebo&#x02019; group is less than would have been observed had those patients been maintained solely on MTX, thereby underestimating the relative treatment effect. The extent of this discrepancy can be estimated using the method devised by Strand and Sharp<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref> for estimating APRs. By dividing the baseline mean mTSS (32.5) by the mean disease duration (11.7), the predicted progression for the placebo group over 2 years was 5.55. However, the observed progression was much lower (2.81), suggesting that the switch to rituximab had a large influence on the progression of joint damage in this control group. Consequently, the relative treatment effect size cannot be accurately measured. Nevertheless, using the predicted and observed progression in the placebo group a reduction in joint damage of 59&#x02013;79% for rituximab plus MTX compared with placebo plus MTX could be estimated. Given the estimated nature of this effect, together with the lack of available radiographic data in similar patient populations, comparisons of this effect size with other biological agents used for RA would not be appropriate.</p><p>In conclusion, this 2-year analysis demonstrates that rituximab plus MTX has significant and sustained effects on the inhibition of joint damage in a population of patients with active RA who had previously experienced an inadequate response to TNF inhibitors.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Writing assistance was provided by Claire Snowball (Adelphi Communications Ltd) in consultation with the authors, Roche Products Ltd and Genentech.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding:</bold> This study was sponsored by F Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd, Genentech, Inc and Biogen Idec, Inc.
