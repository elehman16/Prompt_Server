It is difficult to achieve good analgesia only with opioids, even when combined with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Epidural analgesia and peripheral nerve blocks are frequently being used.

To make this transition successful, we needed some additional analgesics drugs. Consulting our pain team specialists and accepting multimodal analgesic strategy as standard practice in TKA patients,[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] we have chosen the addition of pregabalin[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and s-ketamine[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] to the standard regimen. After obtaining good results of our pilot study (LIA-PREGABA-KET),[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] we started this randomized, double-blind trial to evaluate the opioid-sparing effect and benefits of pregabalin and s-ketamine, when added to a multimodal, standardized postoperative analgesic regime of LIA, paracetamol, diclofenac, and patient-controlled analgesia (PCA)-piritramide compared to placebo.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Material and Methods</title><p>After finishing the observational study[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and prior to starting recruitment of the patients for the present trial, the protocol of this study was registered with the Netherlands Trial Register (NTR:9102) and also approved by the European Drug Registration Association (EUDRA CT-number: 2011-002019-27) and the CMO-Regional Ethics Committee on July 21, 2011. Patients with osteoarthritis scheduled for primary TKA were asked to participate and were randomly allocated to either study or control group. The inclusion of the patients took place at the Orthopedic Department, between November 2011 and May 2013. Exclusion criteria were patient refusal, pre-existing neurological or psychiatric illnesses, chronic pain syndrome, alcohol or drug abuse, risk of perioperative delirium, communication difficulties, rheumatoid arthritis, revision knee surgery, or participation in another study and American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Class &#x0003e;III. All patients signed written informed consent. The Clinical Pharmacology Department randomized the patients and supplied the coded study medication. Not a single person from the Department of Anesthesiology or the Orthopedics knew what medication was administered to any individual patient. Only after the last patient had been treated, the list with the randomization key was issued to the investigators.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study design and intervention</title><p>This was a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled evaluation of analgesia after TKA where the control group received standardized multimodal analgesic regime of paracetamol, diclofenac, and piritramide-PCA, including ropivacaine knee infiltration during surgery (LIA). Pregabalin orally and s-ketamine intravenously were added to the study group whereas the control group received placebo (placebo capsules orally and normal saline intravenously).</p><p>Premedication consisted of two 500 mg paracetamol tablets (total 1000 mg) for all patients and of two capsules of 75 mg pregabalin (total 150 mg) or identical placebo capsules. The dose of pregabalin or placebo was reduced to one capsule ASA III patients and in patients &#x0003e;65 years of age.</p><p>According to their preoperative wishes, patients received spinal or general anesthesia. Bupivacaine plain 0.5% was used for spinal anesthesia. For induction of general anesthesia, patients received sufentanil, propofol, and rocuronium, if intubated, with inhalation of sevoflurane/oxygen/air for maintenance.</p><p>After the induction of anesthesia, the patients received a slow, intravenous (IV) bolus of 2 ml of s-ketamine (5 mg/ml) or placebo. Continuous infusion followed at a rate of 2 ml/h for 24 h. The bolus and the continuous infusion were reduced to 1 ml and 1 ml/h respectively in ASA III patients and in patients &#x0003e;65 years of age.</p><p>All patients received LIA during surgery. After cementing the components, 100 ml of ropivacaine 0.2% with epinephrine (1 mcg/ml) was used for infiltration of the posterior and the anterior knee capsule. Another 50 ml of ropivacaine 0.2% without epinephrine was injected in the subcutaneous tissue.</p><p>The IV study medication (an identical solution of s-ketamine or placebo) was continued for 24 h. Oral study medication (identical pregabalin or placebo capsules) was continued twice daily from the operation day to the 3<sup>rd</sup> postoperative day.</p><p>In the recovery room, a standard piritramide-PCA device (set at 1 mg bolus, 6 min lockout period) was connected and explained to all patients. They were encouraged to use PCA-piritramide in case of residual knee pain up to 48 h postoperatively. Paracetamol (1000 mg) and diclofenac (50 mg) were prescribed orally, 4 and 3 times a day, respectively, for the first 3 postoperative days.</p><p>The vital signs and AVPU scores (A for &#x0201c;alert,&#x0201d; V for &#x0201c;reacting to vocal stimuli,&#x0201d; <italic>P</italic> for &#x0201c;reacting to pain,&#x0201d; and U for &#x0201c;unconscious&#x0201d;) were used during the study period as a simple physiological scoring system suitable for bedside use in the ward. The side effects of medication such as dizziness, diplopia, postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), constipation, and urine retention were noted.</p><sec id="sec3-1"><title>Physiotherapy protocol</title><p>Our institution implemented a new fast-track physiotherapy protocol after the elective TKA. On the day of surgery, the patients were allowed to actively flex and extend the knee in bed. Guided exercise took place on the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> postoperative days. The physiotherapist used a goniometer to measure the progress in maximal knee flexion angle during the exercise. The patients exercised actively, twice daily, and were encouraged to make a move from bed to chair and to walk on the walkway. By day 3, the patients were expected to reach more than 70&#x000b0; flexion with the full extension of the knee. They should also be able to walk freely with elbow crutches and start climbing stairs. Succeeding in these exercises meant they reached the functional discharge criteria.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-2"><title>Objective of the study</title><p>The primary goal was to determine if the additional analgesics (pregabalin and s-ketamine) could reduce pain and opioid consumption.</p><p>The secondary goals were to examine if there was some improvement in postoperative knee flexion, reduction in the LOS, and to evaluate the side effects of the additional drugs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Primary study parameters</title><p>Pain at rest, pain on movement, and piritramide consumption were recorded by a trained PACU or ward nurse. The standard numeric rating scale (NRS) was used to measure pain. The patient could grade the intensity of knee-related pain on a scale of 0&#x02013;10, where 0 means no pain and 10 is the worst imaginable pain. Pain scores at rest (NRS-R) were taken and recorded by a nurse in the ward starting from day 0 (the operation day) to day 2, 3 times a day. Dynamic pain scores (NRS-D), from day 1, until the day of discharge, were recorded during the exercises by a specially instructed physical therapist. The piritramide consumption during the first 24 h and total consumption (48 h) were noted.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Secondary study parameters</title><p>The knee flexion angle was measured daily, from the 1<sup>st</sup> postoperative day (D-1) until the day of discharge (D-D), by a physical therapist as flexion 1, flexion 2, flexion 3, etc.</p><p>LOS presented the number of days between surgery and discharge from the hospital.</p><p>Drug side effects were as follows:</p><p>

</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Statistics</title><p>Sample size calculation was based on morphine consumption results from our previous study.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Assuming a level of significance of 5% and a power of 0.80, a minimum of 26 patients per group were required to detect a 30% reduction of morphine consumption. Due to a switch in our hospital protocol from morphine to piritramide, we accepted this because there is almost equipotency for these two drugs. It was also verified that this group size would suffice to detect a 5&#x000b0; improvement in knee flexion during physical therapy. To compensate for dropouts, 30 patients were included in each group. SPSS for Windows Version (16.0) Chicago: SPSS Inc. software was used for statistical analysis. The data were tested for a normal distribution with the one-sample Kolmogorov&#x02013;Smirnov test. For comparing means of the primary endpoint results, an unpaired Student's <italic>t</italic>-test was used. The Chi-square test was used to detect differences in the incidence of medication side effects (number of nauseated or vomiting patients, dizziness, etc.).

However, the pain scores at rest and during the exercise were comparable between the groups. Most patients in both groups achieved functional discharge criteria on the 3<sup>rd</sup> postoperative day.</p><p>There were neither signs of local anesthetic toxicity nor infections reported due to LIA in any of the patients, but more medication-related side effects were registered in the study group. Diplopia, a known side effect of pregabalin, was noted within the first 24 h only in the study patients (<italic>n</italic> = 6). As we used s-ketamine at this time, which is known to cause nystagmus and sometimes diplopia, possibly it also contributed to this problem.</p><p>Dizziness appeared in one-half of study and one-third of control patients. In general, orthostatic dizziness[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] is a well-known postoperative problem in orthopedic patients. It presents itself frequently while the patient attempts to come out of bed on the 1<sup>st</sup> postoperative day. In our patients, this was a transitory problem, rarely followed by general weakness and causing minor delay in exercises. In a few patients, low hemoglobin count may have caused this problem. If we assume that an equal number of study and control patients had the orthostatic dizziness, the higher incidence of dizziness in the study group was probably a result of pregabalin side effects,[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] since the s-ketamine was already stopped.</p><p>This study showed no difference in LOS between the two groups. However, after introducing LIA, an important reduction in hospital stay has been achieved in our institution. In these LIA patient groups, a full physiotherapy regime including the walking test starts on the 1<sup>st</sup> postoperative day. This is possible since there is no nerve block-related quadriceps muscle weakness (CFNB) delaying the exercise, with falling accidents of 2.7% in spite of safety strategies.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Comparing this new LIA-PREGABA-KET study to our previous randomized controlled trial-TKA with CFNB,[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] not only an improved (mean) knee flexion angle is achieved on the day of discharge, but also LOS has now been shortened by 36 h, which brings an improved cost-benefit ratio. In general, the LOS following TKA in fast-track setups, with functional discharge criteria, has been reduced to about 3 days and our findings are in accordance with those of Husted <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] While in earlier studies, patient's characteristics alone were used to predict LOS, these authors recommend that future efforts should focus on analgesia, the rapid recovery of muscle function, and prevention of orthostatic hypotension. In the present study, good analgesia and rapid recovery of muscle function appear to facilitate reduced LOS. However, no reduction in dizziness or orthostatic hypotension has been found. According to Husted <italic>et al</italic>., this is the third main cause of prolonged LOS. Nausea, vomiting, confusion, and sedation appear to delay discharge minimally.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Harsten <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] have suggested that avoiding spinal anesthesia might result in less dizziness, muscle weakness, PONV, and even less postoperative pain. The present study could not confirm these findings. We also agree with Schug and Goddard[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] that recent advances in the pharmacological management of pain are not so much the result of new &#x0201c;miracle&#x0201d; drugs, but new ways of using old drugs often as components of a multimodal approach to pain relief.</p><p>The potential benefits of the study medications on the incidence of chronic postoperative pain still have to be investigated.</p><sec id="sec2-7"><title>Limitations</title><p>Since the power analysis was used for opioid consumption, the number of patients and their high comorbidity may have limited the expression of differences in other parameters and might explain the wide variability in some results. Further investigation is also required to see whether a combination of both additional drugs is better than one of each.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>A lower piritramide consumption was found in the pregabalin/s-ketamine group than in the placebo group during the first 24 h postoperatively. Furthermore, a trend of better knee flexion was present on the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> postoperative days. There were no side effects observed due to the LIA with ropivacaine/epinephrine mixture in any of the patients. However, the appearance of diplopia and more dizziness in the study group suggests that further studies are required to determine the lowest effective dose of pregabalin with optimal analgesic and functional results and minimal incidence of side effects.</p><sec id="sec2-8"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-9"
