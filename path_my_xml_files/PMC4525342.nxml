The mean severity of post-episiotomy pain was assessed with the first complaint and at 6, 12, and 24 h after the delivery, and compared in the two groups. The visual analog scale (VAS) was used for pain recording and data were analyzed with independent-samples <italic>t</italic>-test, &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>, and Fisher's exact tests, and significance was defined as <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>With the first complaint of pain, the mean intensity of pain was 4.9 (1.9) in the indomethacin group and 4.9 (1.8) in the lidocaine group, and the difference was not significant (<italic>P</italic> = 0.25).

Application of heat or cold and sitz baths are examples of non-pharmacological methods of pain relief that are often inadequate. Acetaminophen with codeine is frequently used, but adverse effects, such as constipation, nausea, stomach pain, and dizziness, limit its appeal.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] In the management of post-episiotomy pain, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been found to be effective, without related illness from adverse effects.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Pitangui <italic>et al.</italic> examined the effectiveness of high-frequency transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) on pain of primiparous puerpera who had experienced natural childbirth with an episiotomy, and reported that high-frequency TENS treatment (100 Hz frequency and 75 &#x003bc;s pulse for 60 min) significantly reduced pain intensity of episiotomy.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] In the other study in 2012, Santos <italic>et al.</italic> examined the low-level laser therapy for pain relief after episiotomy and surveyed 115 women with right mediolateral episiotomy, and reported that low-level laser therapy cannot decrease perineal pain related to episiotomy.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Peter <italic>et al.</italic> compared ibuprofen (400 mg) versus acetaminophen (600 mg) with codeine (60 mg) in relieving perineal pain after childbirth, and reported that although both drugs have similar effect on patients&#x02019; pain, ibuprofen may be the preferred choice because it is less expensive and requires less nursing time to dispense.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] In another study, in 2004, Dodd <italic>et al.</italic> examined the effect of rectal NSAID suppository on perineal pain after childbirth in Australia and reported that diclofenac suppository is a simple, effective, and safe drug for reducing the pain experienced by women following perineal trauma within the first 24 h after childbirth.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>In Hajar Hospital in Iran, there is no national protocol for postpartum pain management. Various analgesic drugs such as acetaminophen, ibuprofen, naproxen, etc., are used for postpartum pain treatment. Regarding the adverse effects of oral analgesic medications to relieve pain, such as gastrointestinal problems, nausea, and vomiting, and the limited evidences on comparing the efficacy and safety of rectal and local analgesia, this study was aimed to compare the effectiveness of indomethacin suppository and lidocaine cream on post-episiotomy pain.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ATERIALS AND</sc> M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><p>This study is a randomized, controlled trial conducted from February 2011 to December 2011 at the antenatal clinic and post-delivery ward in Hajar Hospital, a university hospital and referral center for obstetric care in Shahrekord, Iran. Permission was obtained for this study from the deputy of research and also from the ethics board of the Shahrekord University of Medical Sciences (Code of Ethics: 90-4-9). The clinical trial code of the study was obtained from Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (IRCT201104253078N7). Primiparous women who have had normal vaginal delivery with mediolateral episiotomy and were experiencing perineal pain were recruited in the study. Exclusion criteria included women who had manual removal of placenta, severe asthma, gastric or duodenal ulcer, and preeclampsia. Women with a known sensitivity to NSAIDs, laceration of perineum, length of episiotomy larger than 5 cm, and adverse reaction to local anesthetics were also excluded. Participants received written and verbal information about the study at 37 weeks at the antenatal clinic and they were given the same information on admission to the postnatal ward by the ward midwife. All participants who agreed with the study procedures and voluntarily agreed to participate signed the free and informed consent form. The women were randomized by consecutively numbered sealed envelopes to one of the two study arms, that is, 2% lidocaine cream (<italic>n</italic> = 30) or 50 mg indomethacin suppository (<italic>n</italic> = 30). The study was not blinded to the women and investigators, but it was blinded for analyzer of data. The randomization schedules were prepared by a researcher not involved in patient care, using a computer-generated random number table, and the randomization was stratified for mode of birth (spontaneous vaginal birth vs instrumental vaginal birth).</p><p>After birth and at the time of post-delivery ward admission, the intensity of perineal pain was assessed with visual analog scale (VAS) by the ward midwife, with the first complaint of women and before the patients taking the first dose of medications in the two groups. Then 50 mg indomethacin rectal suppository was administered to patients in the first group and the patients in the second group received the 5 ml lidocaine cream 2% on the episiotomy line. Lidocaine topical cream was manufactured by Tehran Chemie Pharmaceutical Company (Tehran, Iran) and each 100 g of the cream contains lidocaine 2.5 g and prilocaine 2.5 g. Indomethacin suppository was manufactured by Caspian-Tamin Company (Rasht, Iran) and each suppository contains 50 mg indomethacin. Drugs were available in the hospital pharmacy. Socio-demographic information was obtained from the patient records. Women were asked to score their pain from 0 = no pain to 10 = worst possible pain in the VAS.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] The primary outcomes were pain scores at 6, 12, and 24 h after birth with rest. The secondary outcomes relating to pain were the number of doses of medication, use of additional analgesia, time from birth to first analgesia, dosing intervals, and adverse effects of therapeutic medications. Data were analyzed by SPSS (version 16). Categorical variables were compared using &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> and Fisher's exact tests and continuous variables were compared using independent samples t-test, and a P value of less than 0.05 was considered significant with confidence interval of 95%. The analysis was blinded to the treatment groups.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>R<sc>ESULTS</sc></title><p>During the study period, a total of 420 women who gave birth at Hajar Hospital had perineal trauma requiring repairing during childbirth. A total of 280 gave written informed consent and 118 of them were potentially eligible for taking part in the trial. Of these, 58 women were excluded from the study as they were not experiencing perineal pain and 60 women met the inclusion criteria and were included in the study, with 30 randomized to receive indomethacin suppositories and the other 30 to receive lidocaine cream. The two groups were well matched for demographic characteristics at the trial entry and labor and birth outcomes [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>]. Study outcome data were available for 100% of women at 6, 12, and 24 h after birth. Comparison of the mean intensity of pain in the two groups is presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>, showing that there was no statistically significant difference in the intensity of pain with the first complaint of pain at rest between the two groups. Also, no significant differences were found in the intensity of pain at 6 h after childbirth between the two groups. Mean intensity of post-episiotomy pain showed no significant difference at 12 h after childbirth between the two groups. Also, the difference was not significant at 24 h after childbirth between the two groups. The incidence of use of medications during the 24 h after delivery and receiving the additional analgesic for pain relief of episiotomy showed no significant difference between the study groups. No adverse effects of medications were noted in the treatment groups [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>].</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Maternal demographics and labor outcomes at trial entry</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJNMR-20-450-g001"/></table-wrap><table-wrap id="T2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Primary outcomes measures</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJNMR-20-450-g002"/></table-wrap><table-wrap id="T3" position="float"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Secondary outcomes measures</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJNMR-20-450-g003"/></table-wrap></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec1-4"><title>D<sc>ISCUSSION</sc></title><p>The results of the present study showed that the indomethacin suppository and lidocaine cream have similar effects on pain relief post episiotomy. Few studies have compared the effectiveness of indomethacin and lidocaine cream on post-episiotomy pain relief. In this regard, one study reported that the lidocaine cream has reduced the pain intensity at 15 min after childbirth, but not at other times, and this study concluded that the analgesic effects of lidocaine cream are comparable to those of indomethacin suppository.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] In other studies, the effects of indomethacin and lidocaine alone or in combination with other analgesic agents were assessed. In this regard, one study reported that the lidocaine jelly reduced the pain intensity in 6 and 12 h after administration.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Another study reported that there was not a significant difference between lidocaine jelly and placebo in reducing the pain intensity.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Another report indicated that lidocaine jelly and diclofenac suppository have similar effects on perineal pain during the first day after delivery.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>Women's perception of pain is subjective and the use of analgesia is influenced by many factors in addition to the level of pain experienced. These findings may reflect a policy of regular analgesia being offered and accepted on a routine basis to women in the postnatal period while in hospital.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Use of suppositories for the longer-term relief of pain and acceptability of rectal route of analgesia are less well reported. This study specifically addressed these questions. While rectal suppositories may be effective in reducing the perineal pain experienced after childbirth, drug effectiveness becomes a secondary consideration if women are not prepared to use a rectal route of administration. In detecting the acceptability of rectal analgesic suppositories, one study interviewed 400 surgical patients (both male and female), who were asked to choose between an intramuscular route of pain relief and rectal suppositories. Given a choice, only 18% of patients surveyed chose rectal suppositories as an acceptable method of pain relief.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p><p>Indomethacin is almost completely protein bound, and as a result, minimal amounts of the drug are excreted in breast milk - an important consideration for women who are breast feeding.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] One study reported that lidocaine jelly did not have any effect on women's consumption of oral analgesic.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] No side effects of indomethacin suppository and lidocaine cream were found in the present study. Similar findings were reported in a study.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Although in the present study we did not find the side effects of analgesic agents, care should be maintained in prescribing these medications.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] The strengths of our study include use of randomized design and measurement of the side effects of medications, and the study was limited by its small sample size and lack of follow-up of the participants at 48 h and in the first week of birth. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that the effectiveness of indomethacin rectal suppository and lidocaine cream was similar in post-episiotomy pain relief at 6, 12, and 24 h after birth.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSION</sc></title><p>The effectiveness of indomethacin rectal suppository and lidocaine cream was similar in post-episiotomy pain relief.
