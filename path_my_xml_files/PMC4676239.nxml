Buprenorphine, an agonist antagonist opioid has been used as an adjunct to prolong analgesia. We aimed to evaluate the quality and duration of postoperative analgesia by addition of buprenorphine to local anesthetic solution.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Material and Methods:</title><p>A prospective, randomized, double-blind control study was conducted on 50 healthy patients of ASA Grade I/II of age group 20-70 years scheduled for orthopedic and reconstructive surgery of upper limb under supraclavicular brachial plexus block. Patients were allocated into two groups, 25 in each group viz.: Group B (buprenorphine group) received 20 ml 0.5% bupivacaine + 15 ml 2% lignocaine with adrenaline (1:200,000) + 4 ml normal saline + 1500 units hyaluronidase + 3 &#x003bc;g/kg buprenorphine diluted to 1 ml normal saline.

Orthopedic, plastic surgery and general surgical procedures were included in this study.</p><p>Non-consenting patients, patients with peripheral neuropathy, coagulation disorders, known allergy to local anesthetic solution, local infection at site of injection, history of seizures were excluded from the study. After satisfying inclusion and exclusion criteria, a thorough preoperative evaluation was performed. The patient was briefed about the supraclavicular block to be performed, its advantages over general anesthesia (GA) and also about the associated complications. Informed consent was obtained from every patient prior to the study, and they were familiarized with the use of Visual Analog Scale (VAS) scoring system. Sensitivity testing was done for lignocaine in all patients, and the patients were kept fasting 6 hours prior to surgery.</p><p>Patients were randomly allocated into two groups. Randomization was done by allocating random number generated by the computer to each patient with each group consisting of 25 patients.</p><p>Group B (buprenorphine group) received 20 ml 0.5% bupivacaine + 15 ml 2% lignocaine with adrenaline (1:200,000) + 4 ml normal saline + 1500 units hyaluronidase + 3 &#x003bc;g/kg buprenorphine diluted to 1 ml normal saline.</p><p>Group C (control group) received 20 ml 0.5% bupivacaine + 15 ml 2% lignocaine with adrenaline (1:200,000) + 4 ml normal saline + 1500 units hyaluronidase + 1 ml normal saline.</p><p>The investigator, attending anesthesiologist &#x0201c;Y&#x0201d; and patients were unaware of the nature of group and drug allocation.</p><p>The study drug was prepared by &#x0201c;X&#x0201d; anesthetist not involved in performing the block, patient care or in data collection.

In our study, only those with zero effect were excluded.</p><p>Baseline (before start of procedure) pulse, blood pressure (BP), respiratory rate, peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) were recorded. Patient was positioned in supine position and arm to be blocked adducted and kept by the side. Head was turned to opposite side. Intravenous (IV) access was secured with 20G Teflon Cannula and IV fluid Ringer's lactate was started. Monitors were attached before performing the procedure for continuous recording of noninvasive BP, heart rate, electrocardiogram and SpO<sub>2</sub>. All patients included in the study received injection glycopyrrolate 0.2 mg IV and injection ondansetron 4 mg IV as premedication.</p><p>After sterile preparation of the region supraclavicular block was performed by the &#x0201c;Classic Approach,&#x0201d; which was first described by Kulenkampff[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] in 1911. In the initial few cases, the brachial plexus was located with the aid of a nerve stimulator, but due to technical snags, it could not be used further. So fresh cases were done by paresthesia method and walking on the first rib technique. 22G 1 inch hypodermic needle was used to perform the block. Oxygen was administered at rate of 3-5 L/min with face mask.</p><p>Vital parameters (pulse, respirations, BP) were monitored every 2 min for 30 min and then every &#x000bd; h till 8 h and then every 1 h till patient complaints of pain equivalent to VAS score of 4.
