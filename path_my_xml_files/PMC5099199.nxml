<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Several meta-analyses have shown that sequential therapy for 10&#x02005;days (S10) was superior to triple therapy for 7 or 10&#x02005;days.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5&#x02013;7</xref> In addition, our previous study showed that sequential therapy for 14&#x02005;days was superior to T14.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> However, whether S10 is superior to T14 remains controversial. In our previous study, we observed a trend of higher eradication rate (4.7%) of S10 than that of T14, but the difference was not significant.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> In contrast, a multinational study conducted in Latin America showed that T14 was superior to S10 by 5.6%.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Yet, both regimens failed to achieve acceptable eradication rates in that region.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p><p>Although a recent meta-analysis has shown that the efficacy of S10 was not different from that of T14, further large randomised trial is still necessary because of the following reasons. First, discrepancies (about 35%) between meta-analysis of randomised trials and subsequent large randomised trials were not uncommon, especially when significant heterogeneities were observed in the previous meta-analysis.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> In the previous meta-analysis by Gatta <italic>et al</italic>, unexplained significant heterogeneity (I<sup>2</sup>=61.1%) was observed.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Second, of the seven trials included in that meta-analysis,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> only the trial from our group provided information on antibiotic susceptibility, which might be the most important factor leading to the heterogeneity.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Therefore, further large randomised trial, which provides information on antibiotic resistance, is needed to identify the causes of the heterogeneity and to clarify when S10 would be the preferred regimen.</p><p>Emerging evidence suggests that eradication of <italic>H pylori</italic> has the potential to reduce the risk of gastric cancer.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12&#x02013;14</xref> However, the optimal regimen for targeting the asymptomatic population within the community remains unclear. Previous studies, which evaluated the efficacies of anti-<italic>H pylori</italic> treatment, focused mainly on symptomatic subjects who were recruited from hospitals,<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1&#x02013;8</xref>
<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> while treatment of asymptomatic carriers in the community may be more vulnerable to the side effects, which are highly associated with the length and complexity of the antimicrobial regimen.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> As a result, their compliance may be reduced. However, no evidence currently exists to support this speculation, and it is unclear if the results based on hospital populations can be extrapolated to community populations.</p><p>To address these issues, we conducted a randomised trial to compare the efficacy of S10 with that of T14 in first-line therapy of <italic>H pylori</italic> infection by recruiting both community-based and hospital-based populations. We aimed to comprehensively evaluate the impact of antibiotic resistance on treatment efficacies and also provide a predictive model to estimate the results in areas with a different prevalence of antibiotic resistance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Trial design and settings</title><p>This multicentre open-label parallel randomised trial was conducted in eight hospitals (outpatient department) on the main island of Taiwan and in a community population residing in an offshore island (Matsu Island) from February 2012 to March 2014.

Study research staff recruited potential participants, and explained the purpose and eligibility requirements of the study to them. Written informed consent was obtained from each subject prior to enrolment.

Subjects with positive results in at least two of the above tests were eligible for enrolment (criterion 1). In the community setting, a single positive <sup>13</sup>C-urea breath test (<sup>13</sup>C-UBT) was defined as <italic>H pylori</italic> infection (criterion 2),<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> and those with positive <sup>13</sup>C-UBT were invited to undergo endoscopic screening and biopsy for culture. The <sup>13</sup>C-UBT, which contained 75&#x02005;mg<sup>13</sup>C-urea, was dissolved in water and mixed with orange juice. Baseline and 30&#x02005;min breath samples were assayed with an infrared spectrometer at the Taipei Institute of Pathology, and computer-generated results were produced. Positive results were defined as a delta value of &#x02265;4&#x02005;units and negative results as &#x0003c;2.5&#x02005;units, with the sensitivity and specificity of 97.8% and 96.8%, respectively.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> For all participants, a follow-up <sup>13</sup>C-UBT was performed at least 6&#x02005;weeks after completion of treatment to confirm successful eradication. All subjects were asked to stop proton-pump inhibitors and histamine-2 blockers for at least 2&#x02005;weeks prior to the <sup>13</sup>C-UBT. Patients with inconclusive results received another <sup>13</sup>C-UBT at least 2&#x02005;weeks later until the results became conclusive. The technicians who performed the <sup>13</sup>C-UBT assays by infrared spectrometer were blinded to the treatment regimens.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Randomisation and blinding</title><p>Eligible subjects were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive one of the following regimens: S10: lansoprazole 30&#x02005;mg and amoxicillin 1&#x02005;g for the first 5&#x02005;days, followed by lansoprazole 30&#x02005;mg, clarithromycin 500&#x02005;mg, and metronidazole 500&#x02005;mg for another 5&#x02005;days (all given twice daily); or T14: lansoprazole 30&#x02005;mg, amoxicillin 1&#x02005;g and clarithromycin 500&#x02005;mg for 14&#x02005;days (all given twice daily). The permuted block randomisation sequence, with a block size of four, was computer generated. The sequence was concealed in an opaque envelope, and was kept by an independent research assistant at the National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH) until treatment was assigned. All investigators were blinded to the randomisation sequence. After obtaining written informed consents from eligible subjects, the study nurses contacted the independent assistant at NTUH to obtain the next allocation number by phone in order to ensure adequate allocation concealment.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Outcomes</title><p>The primary end-point of the study was the eradication rates in the first-line therapy. The secondary end-points were the frequency of adverse effects and compliance. Intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) analyses were performed in the assessment of the primary end-point. All randomised subjects were included in the ITT analysis. All protocol violators, such as subjects who failed to take at least 80% of their treatment drugs, or who had unknown post-treatment <italic>H pylori</italic> status, were excluded from the PP analysis. Subjects who did not return for a follow-up <sup>13</sup>C-UBT were considered treatment failures. Subjects were informed of the common side effects associated with the study drugs before the therapy began; they were also asked to record these symptoms during treatment. In both settings (hospital and community), a standardised interview was arranged at the end of treatment when patients were questioned regarding the incidence of any adverse events and the drug compliance. The pills not taken by the patients were also counted. Compliance was considered low if less than 80% of pills were taken. Subgroup analyses were conducted according to the demographics, host genetic polymorphism, bacterial antibiotic resistance and the community/hospital-based populations.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Determination of host CYP2C19 polymorphism and genotypic/phenotypic antibiotic resistance of <italic>H pylori</italic></title><p>The SEQUENOM MassARRAY System in the National Genotyping Center was used for genotyping of CYP2C19 polymorphism.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> PCR, with or without direct sequencing using the automatic sequencer (ABI PRISM 3100 Genetic Analyzer, Applied Biosystems), was used for the determination of genotypic antibiotic resistance, including 23S rRNA (clarithromycin resistance) and <italic>gyr</italic>A (levofloxacin resistance).<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>
<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> The phenotypic antibiotic resistance was determined by the minimum inhibitory concentration on the agar dilution test.

<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> our original sample size estimation was at least 500 for each group, given a power of 80% and a 0.05 two-side type 1 error, assuming a 10% loss to follow-up. Following an interim report, we decided to increase the sample size to a <italic>conservative</italic> estimate of 650 for each group, hoping to reach a power of 90% in the rejection of the null hypothesis. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to identify predictors of treatment failure. All p values were two-tailed, with the level of statistical significance set at 0.05. The statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS V.21.0 statistical software for Windows 7 (IBM, Armonk, New York, USA).

The efficacy of sequential therapy and triple therapy can be predicted in an area with clarithromycin resistance rate of p and metronidazole rate of q (0&#x02264;p&#x02264;1; 0&#x02264;q&#x02264;1) as long as the efficacies in resistant and susceptible strains are known.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> If the eradication rates of a regimen (containing these antibiotics) in strains susceptible to clarithromycin and metronidazole, susceptible to clarithromycin but resistant to metronidazole, resistant to clarithromycin but susceptible to metronidazole and dual resistant to both were A, B, C and D, respectively, the predicted eradication rate of that regimen would be A*(1&#x02212;p)*(1&#x02212;q)+B*(1&#x02212;p)*Y+C*p*(1&#x02212;q)+D*p*q. Then, we obtained the difference (&#x003b4;) in the efficacy of sequential therapy and triple therapy, which was a function containing p and q. The function of &#x003b4; was plotted using the Desmos Graph Calculator (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator">https://www.desmos.com/calculator</ext-link>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Baseline characteristics, <italic>H pylori</italic> eradication rates and adverse effects</title><p>From February 2012 to March 2014, a total of 1300 subjects were randomised to receive one of two treatments, as detailed in the Consort flowchart shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="GUTJNL2015310142F1">figure 1</xref>. Baseline characteristics of the two treatment groups (n=650) were similar (<xref ref-type="table" rid="GUTJNL2015310142TB1">table 1</xref>).

The frequencies of adverse effects were not significantly different between the two groups, except for a slightly higher proportion of nausea in S10 than T14 (5.3% vs 2.8%, p=0.04). Less than 3% of patients discontinued the drugs due to adverse effects.

The efficacies of both regimens were reduced by clarithromycin resistance and poor compliance. The efficacy of T14 was further affected by CYP2C19 polymorphism and the enrolment setting (ie, community or hospital based). Given the abundant data of antibiotic susceptibility testing, we are able to formulate a prediction model showing that whether S10 is superior to T14 depends on the prevalence of antibiotic resistance in that country.</p><p>The differences in the prevalence of antibiotic resistance might be the most important factor leading to the contradictory results of clinical trials comparing the efficacy of sequential therapy and triple therapy.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>

<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></p><p>The main novelty of our study included the extensive collection of antibiotic susceptibility data from both community-based and hospital-based populations.

<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23&#x02013;30</xref> only the study from our research group has provided information regarding antibiotic resistance, which was confirmed to be the most influential factor in the determination of treatment efficacy.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> In the present study, based on 1150 isolated <italic>H pylori</italic> strains, we again emphasised the importance of antibiotic resistance on the optimal choice of anti-<italic>H pylori</italic> treatment. In our predictive model, we found that S10 would be superior to T14 in areas with higher clarithromycin resistance, but lower metronidazole resistance (ie, zone 2 and zone 3 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="GUTJNL2015310142F2">figure 2</xref>C). T14 would be superior to S10 only in areas with concomitantly very low clarithromycin resistance and very high metronidazole resistance. In most regions (ie, zone 2), the differences between S10 and T14 would be minimal (less than 5%), which was consistent with the results from the literature.</p><p>Another important message provided by our study is the optimal treatment length of sequential therapy.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1&#x02013;3</xref> Previous meta-analyses showed that S10 was superior to T7 or T10.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5&#x02013;7</xref> Our previous study showed that S14 was superior to T14.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Direct evidence is not yet available with adequate statistical power to compare the treatment efficacy between S10 and T14, especially in regions with low clarithromycin resistance.

<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23&#x02013;27</xref>
<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> (the details are available on request). We found that the efficacy of S10 appeared to be similar to that of T14 (summarised OR 1.25, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.72, p=0.17). The finding was similarly seen when the studies were stratified according to the reported prevalence rate of clarithromycin and metronidazole resistance in areas where the clinical trials were conducted. While in areas with high clarithromycin resistance, the non-clarithromycin containing regimens, such as the bismuth quadruple therapy, may be considered as the first-line treatment.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p><p>In the present study, we found that the efficacy of T14 was affected by the CYP2C19 polymorphism, but not S10, which deserves special attention. Recent meta-analyses have showed that the efficacy of triple therapy containing amoxicillin and clarithromycin was higher in those with CYP2C19 loss-of-function variants, especially when omeprazole or lansoprazole were used, which was consistent with our finding.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>
<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Regarding the impact of CYP2C19 polymorphism on the efficacy of sequential therapy, we speculated that the use of metronidazole, which was less affected by intragastric pH, might be the possible explanation.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> This speculation was also consistent with our previous study showing that the efficacy of modified sequential therapy was not affected by the CYP2C19 polymorphism.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> Therefore, in populations where the proportion of extensive metabolisers is higher, such as Caucasians,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> sequential therapy might be the preferred regimen.</p><p>Our study also evaluated the efficacy of both treatments in a community-based population that underwent gastric cancer chemoprevention.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Theoretically, asymptomatic subjects are more subject to side effects (related to the dose, kind and number of antibiotics), treatment duration (eg, 14-day regimen) and complexity of the regimen (eg, sequential therapy), which may lead to a lower treatment compliance. Although we did not identify any significant differences in treatment efficacy between the two regimens (in either the community-based or the hospital-based populations), the efficacies of both regimens were lower in the community setting compared with the hospital setting, and T14 had reached a statistically significant level; this finding was consistent with our speculation. Given a similar or lower antibiotic resistance rate in the community population, the reason for such a difference in efficacy is likely related to their lower compliance.</p><p>The strength of this study included its large sample size, the analysis of eradication rate according to antibiotic susceptibility, the evaluation of host CYP2C19 polymorphism and the consideration of different enrolment settings. The prediction model was based on the direct comparison of S10 and T14 in our two large randomised trials, which could eliminate the confounding factors and provide more accurate prediction. Nevertheless, our study had several limitations. First, even though we had a high yield rate of bacterial culture of 82.4% (826/1003), the results of antibiotic susceptibility tests were not available in approximately 34% of patients in the present study, which was related to the inherent difficulty in performing such tests. However, this did not affect the main purpose of our study (S10 vs T14). The treatment efficacies were indeed similar between the groups with and without antibiotic resistance data; so, we believe that selection bias was unlikely. Second, the eradication of T14 (85.7%) was slightly higher than that (83.3%) reported in our previously trial, probably attributed to the non-significant lower clarithromycin resistance (9% vs 11%) and non-significant better compliance.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Third, subjects in the community were eligible only based on a positive <sup>13</sup>C-UBT such that the risk of misclassification in detection of <italic>H pylori</italic> infection might occur. However, through a randomised allocation, the main conclusion of our study was unlikely to be altered. Fourth, the present trial was conducted in Taiwan with a lower clarithromycin resistance rate, but a moderate metronidazole resistance rate. The regimens that were studied may not be applicable to areas with high clarithromycin or high metronidazole resistance. Further evaluation of other regimens may be needed (such as the bismuth-containing quadruple therapy) in order to improve the eradication rate for such areas. Nevertheless, the prevalence of clarithromycin remains lower than 15%&#x02013;20% in many countries, such as South America, North Europe, UK, Germany and Spain.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>
<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> Fifth, the genotyping for antibiotic resistance was missing in some cases for 23S rRNA (0.4%, 3/812) and <italic>gyr</italic>A (4.1%, 33/812) because of technical failure such that there was small discrepancy between the results of antibiotic resistance by the agar dilution method and the detection of 23S rRNA and <italic>gyr</italic>A mutations. Also, antibiotic resistance could be found when there was no genetic mutation. However, although the mutations at position 2142 and 2143 of 23S rRNA were the most important causes of clarithromycin resistance, there could be other point mutations or other mechanisms to account for the clarithromycin resistance.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>
<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> The same is true for the relationship between the <italic>gyr</italic>A mutation and levofloxacin resistance.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> Finally, it is interesting to find a persisting low prevalence rate of clarithromycin in our country. We believe it is due to the fact that, in National Health Insurance in Taiwan (coverage more than 99% over whole residents), there is a strict regulation of the use of antibiotics, including the macrolides, according to their indications. In addition, following the first-line treatment of <italic>H pylori</italic>, the retesting process is recommended and reimbursed by the National Health Insurance such that the occurrence of antibiotic-resistant strains of <italic>H pylori</italic> could be minimised.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>
<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></p><p>In conclusion, S10 was not superior to T14 in first-line therapy for <italic>H pylori</italic> infection in Taiwan where the clarithromycin and metronidazole resistance rates were approximately 10% and 25%, respectively. Our prediction model further suggested that the efficacies of S10 and T14 varied according to the prevalence of clarithromycin and metronidazole resistance.
