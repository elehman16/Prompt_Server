Patients received an injection of 80 units BTA (Dysport, Ipsen Ltd Company, UK) at a concentration of 200 mU/ml in normal saline on four spots in each side of the nose and were followed for 12 weeks. Data were analyzed using a chi-square or Fisher&#x02019;s test, and Mann Whitney U test.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The mean age of patients was 46.1&#x000b1;15.3 years, and the two groups did not differ significantly in demographic variables. The severity of rhinitis symptoms was reduced after 4 weeks of injections in the intervention group and then gradually decreased further until the 12th week. There was a statistically significant difference between the groups (P&#x0003c;0.05). No adverse effects were reported.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion: </title><p>Submucoperichondrial BTA injection can be considered an effective therapeutic option in patients with persistent AR and idiopathic rhinitis.

Idiopathic rhinitis has no cytologic evidence of inflammation and is associated with symptoms such as nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea, urge to sneeze and nasal pruritus. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) definition, idiopathic rhinitis is a case of allergic rhinitis (AR) that occurs for more than 4 days per week and lasts for more than 4 consecutive weeks. In many cases, the condition does not respond favorably to existing management protocols, and is not mitigated by avoiding allergens (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Studies conducted over the past 50 years have shown that there is a relationship between over-activity of the parasympathetic nervous system and reduced sympathetic activity of the nasal mucosa. </p><p>Since botulinum neurotoxin A (BTA) is a complex protein produced by an anaerobic bacterium (clostridium botulinum) that inhibits presynaptic release of acetylcholine at muscle nerve terminals and ultimately causes muscle paralysis of the nasal mucosa (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>), it has recently been considered as a therapeutic option for reducing symptoms of AR. In most studies and protocols, nasal turbinates are recommended as injection sites for BTA (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Saskia et al. demonstrated that cotton or sponge dipped in botulinum A and embedded in the nasal canal can reduce rhinitis symptoms in some cases (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). In a pilot study conducted in 2010, Braun et al. injected botulinum neurotoxins in the nasal septum in five patients. All symptoms were significantly reduced after 2 weeks of follow up (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). In another study by Yang et al. conducted in 2008 in South Korea in 39 patients suffering from AR, patients were divided into three groups. One group was treated with botulinum (injected into inferior turbinate), the second group received corticosteroid and the third group received placebo. After 12 weeks of follow up, symptoms of AR were significantly reduced in the first two groups, and botulinum provided better AR symptom relief than the corticosteroid (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Ozcan et al. performed a study on 30 patients with idiopathic rhinitis in which intraturbinate botulinum was injected in one group and normal saline was administered to a second group. After 12 weeks of follow up, all symptoms of rhinitis were significantly reduced in the first group (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Saskia et al. also studied 20 patients with idiopathic rhinitis. After 12 weeks of follow up, a reduction of symptoms was observed in the group receiving botulinum. In the group receiving botulinum plus normal saline, symptoms were also reduced, but to a less extent than in the first group. The group receiving normal saline experienced no change in symptoms (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Sapci et al. also conducted a study in 40 patients with idiopathic rhinitis in Turkey. A 12-week follow up showed a reduction in the severity of symptoms in groups treated with botulinum and ipratropium bromide up to 8 weeks, with a subsequent return to baseline levels. However, the group who received saline only showed no change in the severity of their symptoms (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). </p><p>Because of controversies in previous research results and the probable impact of BTA injection in reducing rhinitis symptoms, this study was performed in order to evaluate the impact of a submucoperichondrial injection of BTA in the treatment of idiopathic non-allergic and persistent AR with a larger sample size in Iran. </p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>This double-blind clinical trial was performed in 40 patients, aged 18&#x02013;65 years referred to the ear, nose and throat (ENT) outpatient clinic of Shafa Hospital affiliated to the Kerman University of Medical Sciences from March 2012 to August 2013. Patients receiving treatment with BTA, oral corticosteroids, anticho- linergics, antidepressants, sedatives, drugs affecting hypothyroidism or hyperth yroidism during the 2 months before the beginning of the study were excluded. Patients with conditions that would increase the level of blood prostaglandins (such as prostatic hyperplasia and pregnancy), or who had undergone nose surgery or planned such surgery within the next 3 months, had a risk of glaucoma, had undergone nose radiotherapy, had hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism were also excluded from this study. After patients had given written informed consent, demographic information (age, gender), duration, type and severity of symptoms, seasonal, occupational and environmental factors, and previously performed treatments were recorded. </p><p>Patients were randomly divided into two groups of 20 (intervention and control groups) using block randomization. Nasal wash was carried out in the two groups using normal saline. Cotton impregnated with lidocaine 2% was used as local anesthesia for 5 minutes before the submuco- perichondrial injection was performed in the resting position. Patients in the intervention group received a submucoperichondrial injection of 20 units (concentration of 200 mU/ml in saline normal) in two sites of the anterior nasal septum on both sides (two in the right and two in the left side of the septum); i.e. 80 mU of BTA (Dyspart, Ispern Pharma, UK) in total. </p><p>The control group received normal saline in a similar way. The patients were monitored on four occasions (2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks after injection), and their symptoms were recorded.Patients' nasal symptoms including nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea, urge to sneeze and nasal pruritus were classified using a five-point Likert scale (no symptom, mild, moderate, severe and extreme). The total score for nasal symptoms was calculated by adding the scores of each symptom.</p><p>The number of facial tissues used daily was also recorded before and after injection. The tolerance of the nasal injection of BTA was evaluated on a two-ended visual analogue scale ranging from &#x02019;not unpleasant&#x02019; (0 mm) to &#x02019;extremely unpleasant&#x02019; (10 mm). The adverse effects of the nasal septum injection (nose bleeds, dry eye, nasal dryness, allergic reactions and muscle paralysis) were examined and recorded at each visit.</p><p>Patients were instructed to call the research physician to perform emergency treatment in the case of any possible adverse effect such as nose bleeds, dry eye, nasal dryness, allergic reactions, facial weakness or paralysis, swallowing or breathing problems, foreign body aspiration, diplopia, tearing, blurred vision or inverted eyelids.</p><p>This study was authorized by the Ethics Committee of Kerman University of Medical Sciences (code: 268/91 k).

Mohammad Ibn Zakariya al-Razi (864&#x02013;925 A.D) described it when introducing hay fever and seasonal nasal allergy in his book, al-Hawi (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). In modern medical texts, the first detailed clinical description of AR (also known as hay fever) is attributed to an English physician named John Bostok. In 1828 he found that the symptoms are aggravated with the onset of flowering and after the hay harvest (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Since this time, AR has become known as a global problem that can cause illness and disability (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). </p><p>Many aspects of people&#x02019;s daily life have been affected by AR, regardless of age, sex, ethnicity, or country (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Idiopathic rhinitis is a type of non-allergic rhinitis with similar symptoms that is related to excessive parasympathetic activity or decreased sympathetic activity in the nasal mucosa (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Studies have shown that rhinitis, either allergic or non-allergic, can impose indirect financial costs, reduce quality of life and even lead to depression (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). </p><p>Recently botulinum neurotoxin has been proposed as a promising treatment for different types of rhinitis (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Wen et al. proved the role of local BTA injection as a long-lasting treatment in reducing symptoms of AR in rats (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). The effectiveness of BTA as a therapeutic choice for idiopathic rhinitis in humans was confirmed in studies by Ozcan et al. (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) and Sapci et al. (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Unal et al. also demonstrated similar results for patients with AR (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Injection of BTA into the middle or inferior turbinate had been used in all these investigations. Recently, Brun et al. demonstrated the safety of injecting botulinum neurotoxin A in the nasal septum in five patients with idiopathic rhinitis (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Abtahi et al. compared submucoperichondrial injection with inferior turbinate injection of botulinum neurotoxin A in patients with rhinitis and concluded that submucoperichondrial injection of BTA could be safer and easier. They suggested further investigations would be required to follow possible side effects (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>).</p><p>We examined the effect of BTA submucoperichondrial injection in patients with idiopathic rhinitis and persistent AR. Based on our findings, patients&#x02019; clinical symptoms including nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea, urge to sneeze and nasal pruritus were significantly reduced after the injection. The reduction of symptoms reached the highest level on the fourth week. After this, the impact of the drug declined, but the severity of clinical symptoms remained lower than it was before injection, and there was a significant difference compared with the control group regarding rhinitis symptoms. Although all previous studies showed a significant difference in the severity of symptoms pre- and post-injection (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), only Ozcan, Braun, Yang, and Spaci followed the patients over time (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>-<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). These studies were all based on injection into the nasal turbinate, and rhinitis symptoms decreased after 2 weeks; compared with 4 weeks in the present study. Furthermore, there was no significant difference between the two groups from the Week 8 onwards in the previous studies, while in our study the overall severity of symptoms was significantly lower in the intervention group up to Week 12. It seems that less blood flow in the nasal septum compared with the nasal turbinate results in a slow clearance rate of botulinum A in the nasal septum, and this is the reason for the prolonged reduction in rhinitis symptoms. The overall number of rhinitis symptoms was also significantly lower in the intervention group, consistent with other investigations using an intraturbinate injection (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>-<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Abtahi et al. also confirmed this finding (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). </p><p>Regarding the side effects of the injection, as with previous studies, we observed no adverse effects such as epistaxis or severe pain in the patients. </p><p>Our study seems to suggest that submucoperichondrial injection has advantages over intraturbinate injection. These advantages include the ability to control the technique under direct vision (whitening of the mucosa), a reduction in the risk of complications of systemic injection of botulinum (due to the possible entry of the drug into the bloodstream via intraturbinate injection), higher pain tolerance, and less blood flow in the nasal septum compared with nasal turbinate resulting in a greater stability of botulinum in the nasal septum and the increased efficacy of botulinum injection. Furthermore, our study demonstrated that submucoperichondrial injection of BTA in persistent and idiopathic AR is equally effective, and this technique can be used in both groups of patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Based on our findings, submucoperi- chondrial injection of BTA has the following advantages over other techniques:</p><list
