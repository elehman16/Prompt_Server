exercises (CKCEs) and open kinetic chain exercises (OKCEs) with elastic bands on the
electromyographic activity of patients with degenerative gonarthritis. [Subjects] The
study subjects were 30 degenerative gonarthritis patients who were divided into a CKCE
group (CKCEG, n=10), an OKCE group (OKCEG, n=10), and a control group (CG, n=10).
[Methods] The CKCEG and the OKCEG performed exercises with elastic bands, and the CG took
part in a quadriceps strengthening exercise. All three groups performed the exercises
three times per week for four weeks. The electromyographic activities of the subjects&#x02019;
vastus medialis (VM), rectus femoris (RF), vastus lateralis (VL), semitendinosus (ST), and
biceps femoris (BF) muscles were measured and compared. [Results] Within-group comparisons
revealed that the electromyographic activities of the VM, RF, VL, ST, and BF muscles
increased significantly in the CKCEG. The OKCEG displayed significant increases in the
electromyographic activity of the VM, RF, ST, and BF muscles, and the CG showed
significant increases in the electromyographic activities of the RF, VL, ST, and BF
muscles. In between-group comparisons after the intervention, the electromyographic
activities of the VM, RF, and VL muscles of the CKCEG were significantly higher than those
of the CG. The electromyographic activities of the VM, RF, and ST muscles of the OKCEG
were significantly higher than those of the CG. [Conclusion] We consider CKCEs with
elastic bands are an effective intervention for increasing the electromyographic
activities of the VM, RF, VL, ST, and BF muscles of degenerative gonarthritis patients,
and OKCEs with elastic bands are an effective intervention for increasing the
electromyographic activities of the VM, RF, ST, and BF muscles of degenerative
gonarthritis patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Elastic-band</kwd><kwd>Close kinetic chain exercise</kwd><kwd>Open kinetic chain exercise</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The prevalence rate of chronic degenerative arthritis is very high. Among elderly persons
aged 65&#x02005;years or more, females are estimated to have two times higher prevalence rates of
chronic degenerative arthritis than males, and most elderly persons have degenerative
arthritis<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. The physical characteristics
of chronic degenerative gonarthritis include pain, deformation, and edema. These physical
characteristics lead to postural deformation. Long-term postural deformation causes the
muscles to become fixed and rigid, resulting in reduced flexibility and abnormal gait. The
effects of gonarthritis lead not only to a lack of activity and exercise, but also to a
deterioration in patients&#x02019; physical fitness, forming a vicious circle<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Chronic degenerative arthritis leads to marked weakening of
the quadriceps femoris extensor muscle<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.
The quadriceps femoris muscle is a major knee-joint stabilizing muscle. Together with age,
atrophy of this muscle results in knee pain and functional impairment. Performing exercises
to strengthen this muscle can relieve pain and lead to functional recovery of the
muscle<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Chronic degenerative arthritis is treated with drug therapies, nonpharmacological
therapies, and surgery. Recently, among nonpharmacological therapies, exercise therapies
have been frequently used to improve patients&#x02019; physical functions. Among exercise therapies,
resistive exercises using bands have been reported to be very effective for elderly
persons<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Such exercises stimulate the proprioceptive senses of the joints
and muscles to transmit information on the location and the movement of the joints to the
cerebrum<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. In this way, correct posture is maintained, and little stress is
imposed on the joints, even when exercises are performed using diverse ranges of joint
motion<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In general, when elastic bands are used in CKCEs, the aim is to improve muscle strength.
They are frequently used in OKCEs due to their convenient use. When elastic bands are used
at home or in rehabilitation facilities, OKCEs are favored over CKCEs because they are more
convenient to use. CKCEs and OKCEs are customarily used when elastic bands are used without
any concrete evidence for difference between them. Although many previous studies of CKCEs
and OKCEs using elastic bands have reported the effects of the exercise on degenerative
gonarthritis patients, few studies have examined their effects on the electromyographic
activity. Therefore, this study investigated the effects of CKCEs and OKCEs using elastic
bands on the electromyographic activities of the leg muscles of patients with degenerative
gonarthritis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The study subjects were 30 elderly persons aged 60&#x02005;years or more who had been diagnosed
with degenerative gonarthritis. We selected them from among patients visiting G hospital
located in Gumi, Gyeongsangbuk-do. The mean age of the CKCEG (n=10) was 67.20&#x000b1;7.36&#x02005;years,
the mean height was 155.10&#x000b1;4.48&#x02005;cm, and the mean weight was 56.90&#x000b1;9.09&#x02005;kg. The OKCEG (n=10)
mean age was 65.50&#x000b1;5.85&#x02005;years, the mean height was 156.50&#x000b1;8.46&#x02005;cm, and the mean weight was
62.80&#x000b1;5.97&#x02005;kg. The CG (n=10) mean age was 67.40&#x000b1;6.11&#x02005;years, the mean height was
152.90&#x000b1;5.93&#x02005;cm, and the mean weight was 56.00&#x000b1;7.70&#x02005;kg. The inclusion criteria for the study
subjects were no clinical problems performing resistive muscle strengthening exercises using
elastic bands, not performing regular exercise, and not having previously undergone any
arthritis-related surgical operation. The subjects Kellgren-Lawrence (K/L) grade of the knee
joints was 2 or higher and their visual analog scale results for knee pain were 5 points or
lower. They were randomly and equally assigned to three groups: CKCEG, OKCEG, and CG.
Ethical approval for the study was granted by the Youngdong University institutional review
board.</p><p>During the exercise program, the CKCEG, OKCEG, and CG performed their exercises three times
per week for four weeks. Each exercise session included a warming-up exercise, the main
exercise, and a cooling-down exercise. The total exercise time for each session was 20&#x02005;min.
The warming-up exercises and the cooling-down exercises were performed for 5&#x02005;min each. The
main exercises consisted of a total of three sets, consisting of 10 repetitions of the
exercises.</p><p>Different colored elastic bands denote the degree of elasticity. The CKCEG and the OKCEG
used red elastic bands (Hygenic Corporation, USA), which have medium resistance. The CG
performed quadriceps strengthening exercises.</p><p>In the CKCEG, the subjects wore a Body Safe Belt (Black Diamond Equipment Ltd, USA) around
the lumbar region that was connected to the elastic bands. The lower ends of the elastic
bands were attached to the subjects&#x02019; shoes or their bare feet before performing the
exercises. During the first and second week, knee joint flexion and extension were performed
simultaneously with hip joint flexion and extension in minisquat exercises. During the third
and fourth weeks, squat exercises were performed by those subjects who were able to do so.
In the OKCEG, the subjects adopted a prone position, and one end of the elastic band was
attached to the wall, and the other end was attached to their ankles. The subjects then
performed knee joint flexion and extension. As resistance varies with the length of the
bands, the length of the bands was adjusted to allow the subjects to pull the bands 10 times
with the same motion. The subjects in the CG performed the quadriceps strengthening
exercises in a supine position with a towel rolled in the shape of a cylinder. The towel was
placed below their knees, and the subjects then slowly extended their knees while
maintaining ankle dorsiflexion. The exercise time depended upon the age of the subjects and
their levels of fatigue.</p><p>An MP 35 (Biopac System, USA) was used to measure the electromyographic activityes of the
quadriceps femoris muscle. Surface electrodes were attached to the vastus medialis (VM), the
rectus femoris (RF), the vastus lateralis (VL), the semitendinosus (ST), and the biceps
femoris (BF). Raw EMG signals were sampled at 1,000&#x02005;Hz and full-wave rectified. A 30&#x02005;Hz
low-pass filter was then applied to the root mean square (RMS) signals, which were then
sampled between 40 to 250&#x02005;Hz and stored in a computer file. A 60&#x02005;Hz notch filter was used to
remove unnecessary signals because the Korean electricity supply an alternating current
frequency of 60&#x02005;Hz. To stabilize variance in the collected data, the raw measurement data
were converted into root mean squares (RMS), and the values of the middle 3 sec of 5 sec a
measuring time, excluding the first and last second, were used in the analysis. The RMS
values obtained were divided by the maximum voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) value to
normalize the values to %MVIC values within a range of 0&#x02013;100%.</p><p>In this study, the paired sample t-test was conducted to examine changes in the
electromyographic activities of the muscles within the groups during the treatment period.
One-way ANOVA was conducted to examine significant differences in muscle activities among
the groups. The Bonferroni correction method was used as a post hoc test. SPSS 12.0 for
Windows was used for the statistical processing of the data, and a significance level of
0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>According to the results of the comparisons within the groups, the CKCEG showed significant

BF; and the CG exhibited significant increases in the electromyographic activities of the

CKCEG than in the CG, and the electromyographic activities of the VM, RF, and ST were
significantly higher in the OKCEG than in the CG (p&#x0003c;0.05) (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Changes in the electromyographic activities of the VM, RF and VL, ST, and BF

degenerative gonarthritis, movements will become further restricted due to joint
deformation, and the formation of osteophytes on articular surfaces will further restrict
activities, forming a vicious circle. Therefore, the maintenance of activity through
exercise therapy has been presented as a major treatment option for degenerative
gonarthritis. Among various treatment methods, muscle strength training using elastic bands
has been frequently used as a muscle strengthening exercise for elderly persons. Such
exercise is used not only because of its simplicity and low cost, but also because of its
ability to strengthen the musculoskeletal system of the lower extremities. Thus, it is the
most suitable resistive exercise program for elderly persons, enabling muscle strengthening
with a reduced burden on the joints<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Jo and Jung<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup> analyzed changes in the
electromyographic activities of 17 healthy males who performed OKCEs and CKCEs as part of an
isotonic exercise regime. They reported that the electromyographic activity of the long head
of the BF muscle increased significantly in the OKCEG. Kim<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup> suggested that CKCEs are useful for selective training of the
gluteus medius muscle and that OKCEs are desirable for gradual training in the early stage
of rehabilitation. Han<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that
subjects in an exercise group who participated in CKCEs showed greater increases in the
electromyographic activities of their left lower extremities than those in a group who
performed OKCEs. They attributed this finding to the body segments being fixed during CKCEs.
Kwon et al.<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that when 41
normal adults performed OKCEs and CKCEs for six weeks, the OKCEs were more effective at
strengthening the VM muscle and the anterior tibial muscle during the first two weeks of
exercises. They also found that the CKCEs were more effective in strengthening the vastus
lateralis muscle, the hamstring muscle, and the gastrocnemius muscle after two weeks.</p><p>In the study of Kim<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>, elderly persons
performed knee joint muscle strengthening exercises using elastic bands, and their lower
extremity muscle strength increased compared to before the exercise after performing the
exercises for five weeks. Yun<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup> reported
that chronic gonarthritis patients who performed isometric exercises and isotonic exercises
using elastic bands for five weeks showed significant increases in the electromyographic
activities of the quadriceps femoris muscle and the hamstring muscle following both
isometric exercises and the isotonic exercises using elastic bands. In comparisons between
the groups, the isotonic exercises using the elastic bands were more effective than the
isometric exercises at strengthening the quadriceps femoris muscle and the hamstring muscle
of the chronic gonarthritis patients. Mikesky et al.<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup> divided elderly persons aged 65&#x02005;years or more into an exercise
group which performed gradual muscle strengthening exercises using elastic bands and a
non-exercise group. They reported that the exercise group showed an increase of 12% in the
muscle strength of the knee joint extensor muscles and an increase of 10% in that of the
knee joint flexor muscles. Damush and Damush<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup> investigated the effects of resistance exercises using elastic
bands on the muscle strength and health-related quality of life of elderly women aged
68&#x02005;years on average. Their subjects showed increases in the muscle strength of the
latissimus dorsi muscle, the pectoralis major muscle, and the quadriceps femoris muscle of
15%, 13%, and 25%, respectively, but there were no significant changes in their mental and
physical health functions. Topp et al.<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>
reported that when elderly persons aged 65&#x02005;years or more performed elastic band exercises,
their gait and balance abilities improved. Krebs et al.<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that 132 elderly persons with functional restriction, who
performed muscle strengthening exercises using elastic bands, showed increases in the
strength of the lower extremity muscles (hip joint abductor muscles, extensor muscles, and
knee joint extensor muscles) of 17.6% and 7.3% in the exercise group and the control group,
respectively, after the exercises compared to before the exercises. Deyle et al.<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that when chronic gonarthritis
patients performed muscle strengthening exercise using elastic bands for four weeks, their
gait and functions improved. According to the results of our present study, in the
comparisons within the groups, the CKCEG showed significant increases in the
electromyographic activities of the VM, the RF, the VL, the ST, and BF; the OKCEG showed
significant increases in the electromyographic activities of the VM, the RF, the ST, and the
BF; and the CG showed significant increases in the electromyographic activities of the RF,
the VL, the ST, and the BF. In comparisons between the groups after the treatment, the CKCEG
showed significantly higher electromyographic activities of the VM, the RF, and the VL than
the CG, and the OKCEG showed significantly higher electromyographic activities of the VM,
the RF, and the ST than the CG. Studies by Han<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup> and Nougarou<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>
revealed that an increase in muscle activity was associated with an increase in muscle
strength. In the present study, muscle activity was a greater after the exercise than prior
to the exercise.</p><p>The results of the present study are in agreement with other published results in the
literature and suggest that CKCEs or OKCEs using elastic bands are considerably more
effective than quadriceps strengthening exercises at strengthening lower extremity muscles.
They also indicate that when patients are able to perform selective muscle strengthening
exercises, exercises tailored to such patients should be recommended. As single joint
exercises, OKCEs are considered very useful for patients with limited ranges of joint
motion. They are also useful in early stage muscle strengthening programs, in individual
muscle training, and in multi-joint exercises. CKCEs are suitable for stabilization and
functional training.</p><p>This study had some limitations. First, as the number of subjects with degenerative
gonarthritis was limited, the interpretation of the results presented herein cannot be
generalized. Second, the right lower extremity was the dominant side all the subjects, and
only the muscle strength on that side was measured. Thus, the potential effect of the
exercises on changes in the muscle strength on the other side is not known. In later
studies, appropriate muscle strengthening exercises using elastic bands should be performed
not only by chronic degenerative gonarthritis patients, but also by acute gonarthritis
patients, and the effects of the exercises should be examined.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Jones</surname><given-names>CJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Rose</surname><given-names>DJ</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>International guidelines for training physical activity
