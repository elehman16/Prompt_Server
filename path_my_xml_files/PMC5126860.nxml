There is increasing evidence that rehabilitation interventions with exercises that goes beyond the sub-acute phase or even in a later stage of care have a positive impact on various functional abilities. The purpose of this study is to determine if exercise program training for people who have suffered a fall-related hip fracture will improve functional mobility when compared with usual care.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A randomized controlled trial with blinded assessors and intention-to-treat analysis will be undertaken. We will recruit 82 older adults, 60&#x000a0;years or over who have suffered a hip fracture due to a fall in the previous 6 to 24&#x000a0;months. Participants randomized to the Intervention Group (IG) will undertake a physical exercise program involving progressive and challenging balance training and neuromuscular and functional training of the lower limbs, conducted at home by physiotherapists, once a week, lasting about one hour, in the first, second and third month after randomization and will be taught to perform exercises at home, twice a week, using a booklet. Visits to monitor and progress the home exercise program will be conducted once a month, from the fourth to the sixth month and each 2 months until the end of the follow up at the 12<sup>th</sup> month, i.e., a total of 18 sessions. Participants will receive monthly phone calls to encourage exercise adherence. The control group will receive usual care. The primary outcome will be mobility-related disability and participants will be assessed at baseline, and at 3&#x000a0;months, 6 and 12&#x000a0;months. Participants will receive monthly phone calls to ask about falls and exercise adherence. Adverse effects will be monitored.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This study proposes a home-based exercise program, which may in part overcome some barriers for rehabilitation, such as difficulties with public transportation and lack of a caregiver to accompany older patients to&#x000a0;sessions. If a positive effect is observed this program has the potential to be incorporated into the public health system and contribute to building a pathway of care for older people with hip fracture.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02295527?term=NCT02295527&#x00026;rank=1">NCT02295527</ext-link>.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Hip fracture</kwd><kwd>Accidental falls</kwd><kwd>Rehabilitation</kwd><kwd>Exercise program</kwd><kwd>Clinical trial</kwd><kwd>Aging health</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001807</institution-id><institution>Funda&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o de Amparo &#x000e0; Pesquisa do Estado de S&#x000e3;o Paulo</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2013/25149-7</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Perracini</surname><given-names>Monica</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>Over a lifetime, about half of women and a quarter of men will suffer a fragility bone fracture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], mostly due to falling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Among the most serious and common fractures are hip fractures, which have significant risks of mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and disability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. It is estimated that in 2050 the global number of hip fractures will be between 7.3 and 21.3 million [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and the cost with the treatment will be approximately of 131.5 billion US dollars [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>Physical and psychological post-fracture limitations, such as decreased mobility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and lower limb strength [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], impaired balance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], lack of confidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], fear of falling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and increased risk of falls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] restrain about 40% of older people from returning to daily activities required to live independently and safely [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>Two years after injury more than half of older hip fracture survivors do not regain pre-injury functional abilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and experience a moderate to high risk of further falls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The restoration of mobility is crucial to enable old people to move around in and outside home, the recommended levels of physical activity, maintain social engagement and preserve autonomy. Ultimately, adequate mobility is a key component for an active and healthy ageing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>Although there is no consensus about the best intervention for improving functionality of older people after hip fracture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], exercise programs delivered in an intensive and supervised basis, have been found to improve the mobility of these patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However, few studies have explored the late period of recovery (over 6&#x000a0;months) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], when functional limitations can persist due to inadequate dose as well as the type of exercise performed. Recently a home-based exercise intervention with minimal contact from a physiotherapist (4 visits) boosted by monthly telephone calls and the provision of a DVD version resulted in clinical meaningful improvement in the physical function of the lower limbs, but not in self-reported mobility and daily activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>Over the next decades a huge increase in the older population will be experienced by low-and middle-income countries (LMICs), such as Brazil where population is ageing at one of the fastest rates in the world. The number of seniors in Brazil is predicted to double between 2002 and 2020, from 15 million to 32 million and to reach 64 million (30% of the total population) by 2050 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Furthermore, people aged 80 and over will increase exponentially the next four decades, a growing and disproportionate demand on the health system and social support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Along with an increased aged population LMICs will have to overcome barriers of care, such as difficulties in access and failure of existing health services to address older peoples&#x02019; rehabilitation needs. Yet post-fracture rehabilitation strategies are yet to be tested in low-and middle-income countries.</p><p>The primary aim of this study is evaluate the effectiveness of a physical exercise program for improving functional mobility in older people who have suffered a hip fracture due to a fall in the previous 6 to 48&#x000a0;months. Secondary aims to 1) determine the effects of the program in improving physiological risk for falls, functional and performance disability and quality of life; 2) establish predictors of adherence to the program and outcomes related to functional and mobility disability in older people after fall-related hip fracture.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Trial design</title><p>This is a randomized controlled trial with 12&#x000a0;months follow-up.

</p><p>In the first session the physiotherapist will choose two exercises that best address the participant&#x02019;s functional goals and will add more exercises each week according to the participant&#x02019;s ability, rate of improvement and motivation. The degree of balance challenge will be progressed in terms of reducing the base of support, the use of hands and the inclusion of multisegmental coordination exercises. Participants will be receive recommendations on how to perform the exercises safely, such as standing near of a table or in the corner of a room, so they can promptly use hands for protection if they start to fall.

<italic>Functional performance</italic> measured by the self-reported WHO Disability Assessment Schedule (WHODAS 2.0) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. This scale measures health and functionality in 6 domains: cognition, mobility, self-care, interpersonal relationships, daily activities and participation. It was developed by WHO based on the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF), and it is not intended for any specific health condition. This short version assesses the difficulty degree of performing 12 activities in past 30&#x000a0;days, which can be classified as none, mild, moderate, severe and extreme (cannot be performed). The degree of difficulty reported is based on the presence of increased effort, discomfort or pain, slowness or the presence of some change in the way of doing the activity.</p><p>
<italic>Quality of life</italic> measured by WHOQOL-bref [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], consists of 26 questions divided in 4 domains: physical, psychological, social relationships and environment. The questionnaire is based on the last 2&#x000a0;weeks of the participant and evaluated, for example, how safe he/she feel in her/his daily life and how satisfied is he/she with his/her ability to perform daily life activities.</p><p>
<italic>Physical activity level</italic> will be measured by the self-reported Incidental and Planned Exercise Questionnaire - IPEQ_W [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], ten questions designed to measure physical activity planned and unplanned for older people. The version estimates the intensity of physical activity during the last week will be used. The participant will be questioned for the frequency (every day, 3&#x02013;6 times per week, twice a week, once a week or less than once per week) and duration of activity (less than 15min per day, more than 15min and under 30min per day, more than 30min and less than 1h, less over 1h and 2h per day more and less than 4h per day 2h, 4h, and daily or more). The total score is derived by multiplying the frequency categories by categories of activity duration, expressed in hours per week.</p><p>
<italic>Occurrence of falls</italic> will be assessed by monthly phone calls to participants who will be encouraged to use to diary to record the number of falls each day. A structured questionnaire will be used to identify possible falls and their consequences. The intervention group will be compared to control group at 6 and 12&#x000a0;months follow-up in relation to the number of falls (primary outcome) and the proportion of fallers.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Sample characterization</title><p>
<italic>Functional Comorbidity Index</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] is an 18-item scale designed to assess comorbidities related to physical function rather than mortality. Each scale item receives 1 point if the patient reports the disease.</p><p>
<italic>Cognitive function</italic> will be assessed through the Montreal Cognitive Assessment Test (MoCA Test) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], a battery of tests to detect mild cognitive impairment. The test takes 10min and the maximum score is 30 points. The test assesses different cognitive domains: attention and concentration, memory, language, visuoconstructional skills, conceptual thinking, calculations and orientation.</p><p>
<italic>Depressive symptoms</italic> assessed by the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], an instrument designed to detect depression in the older people. The short version contains 15 items and is the most used in clinical settings due to its rapid application. Each answer has a score of 0 or 1, and a final score above 6 points is considered to be indicative of depression.</p><p>
<italic>Fall-related self-efficacy</italic>, assessed by the Falls Efficacy Scale International (FES-I) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] a scale of self-efficacy of fall avoidance during activities of everyday life, which has 16 items with scores ranging from 1 to 4 (maximum total score 64) and a cutoff score of 31 points.</p><p>
<italic>Nutritional status</italic>, assessed by the Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] a questionnaire consisting of two parts: Screening and Overall Assessment. The screening consists of 6 basic questions about weight loss, BMI, mobility and neuropsychological problems. The score in the first part of the assessment can vary from 0 to 14 points. If the score is less than 12, the researcher must continue through the second part of the questionnaire, composed of more specific questions on nutrition and physical assessment. The sum of 18 questions can provide a maximum score of 30. The person with a score greater than or equal to 24 points is considered well-nourished, a score of 17&#x02013;23.5 is considered at risk for malnutrition, and a score of less than 17 classifies the person as malnourished.</p><p>
<italic>Number of regular medications</italic>, prescribed by a doctor, in the last 3&#x000a0;months will be computed, except vitamins and other medications for sporadic use (analgesics, for example). The use of psychotropic medications will be specifically recorded.</p><p>

However no previous studies have been conducted in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a physical exercise program in a later stage of recovery after fall-related hip fracture in improving functional mobility in older people when compared with usual care. If a positive effect is observed, this study will contribute to increase the evidence about the functionality of the therapeutic exercise program to be tested, functional training focusing on the progressive balance and resistance training of lower limb.</p><p>In LMICs the impact of ageing population and the burden of non-communicable diseases and injuries will be very significant in coming years. The evaluation of the effectiveness of an exercise program in late rehabilitation after hip fracture is substantially important in health care settings in these countries where the provision of rehabilitation after hip fracture in acute and sub-acute phases is extremely variable and restricted. Although in Brazil the hip fracture has been chosen as a sentinel event for falls in the elderly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], the establishment of a pathway of care after hip fracture is still nascent and fragmented, with negative consequences for efficiency and equity access to rehabilitation. There is a need to organize a continuum of structured networks through integrated care health care, ensuring the transition from hospital to home care and outpatient.</p><p>We are proposing a home-based exercise program, which may in part overcome some barriers for rehabilitation, such as difficulties with public transportation and lack of a caregiver to accompany older patients to sessions. Although the program are supported by supervision on a regular basis, we believe that the visits distribution along the follow up will help patients to cope with the exercises, particularly those who are illiterate or less motivated. If proven to be effective this program may be incorporated into the public health system and contribute to building a pathway of care for older people with hip fracture.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors are grateful to the contributions of Sileno de Queiroz Fortes Filho MD, Luiz Eug&#x000ea;nio Garcez Leme MD, Jorge dos Santos Silva MD, Ana Paula Monteiro PT.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p>This project is supported by the S&#x000e3;o Paulo Research Foundation &#x02013; FAPESP (Protocol number: 2013/ 25149&#x02013;7).</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p>Not applicable.</p></sec><sec id="FPar3"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>CAL, CS, MRP are responsible for designed the protocol and methodology of the study.
