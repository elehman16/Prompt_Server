MISO was administered in daily dosages to sequential groups of patients at doses of 0.15 g/m2, 0.30 g/m2 or 0.45 g/m2 for 22 days over 5 weeks. Sixteen patients were assigned to each dose level. Using a double-blind randomization, they received either placebo (3/16) or MISO (13/16). The major dose-limiting toxicity was peripheral neuropathy (PN). None of the 13 patients receiving 0.15 g/m2 or the 13 receiving 0.3 g/m2 developed PN. However, 6/13 at the 0.45 g/m2 level (total dose less than or equal to 9.9 g/m2) developed PN. Additional patients were entered at this level and a total of 13/26 developed PN, which was considered of clinically significant severity in 9. Symptoms of PN have persisted from 1 week to 10 months, and have been completely reversed in 9/13 patients. Pharmacological parameters were examined for correlation with clinically evident toxicities. Although peak plasma MISO levels and half-lives did not correlate significantly with PN, there was a significant correlation between the calculated "area under the curve" (AUC) and PN. No correlation exists between PN and total urinary excretion of MISO or the O-demethylation product. A daily dose of 0.45 g/m2; MISO (total dose less than or equal to 9.9 g/m2) is considered to produce an acceptable level of toxicity for this patient population.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00441-0061.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="860" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00441-0062.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="861" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00441-0063.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="862" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00441-0064.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="863" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00441-0065.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="864" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00441-0066.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="865" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00441-0067.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="866" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00441-0068.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="867" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00441-0069.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="868" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
