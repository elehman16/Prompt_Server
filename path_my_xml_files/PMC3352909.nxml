Participants were required to use three hypothetical jars to obtain a specific amount of water. Initial problems were solvable by the same complex formula, but in later problems (&#x0201c;critical&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;trap&#x0201d; problems) solving was possible by an additional much simpler formula. A rigidity score was compiled through perseverance of the complex formula. In Experiment 1, experienced mindfulness meditators received significantly lower rigidity scores than non-meditators who had registered for their first meditation retreat. Similar results were obtained in randomized controlled Experiment 2 comparing non-meditators who underwent an eight meeting mindfulness program with a waiting list group. The authors conclude that mindfulness meditation reduces cognitive rigidity via the tendency to be &#x0201c;blinded&#x0201d; by experience. Results are discussed in light of the benefits of mindfulness practice regarding a reduced tendency to overlook novel and adaptive ways of responding due to past experience, both in and out of the clinical setting.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>Keywords:</italic> Mindfulness Meditation, Cognitive Rigidity, Einstellung, Water-Jar Task</kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Experience may blind us from recognizing obvious solutions to problems. Research shows that physicians and health care professionals are likely to overlook the correct diagnosis in cases which do not match their experience <xref rid="pone.0036206-Beljan1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Similar findings have been reported concerning difficulties in reframing clinical situations as experienced by healthcare professionals <xref rid="pone.0036206-Clark1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0036206-Nelson1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, and difficulties of managers and decision makers in replacing existing procedures with new, improved and simpler ones <xref rid="pone.0036206-Cangemi1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. This &#x0201c;blinding&#x0201d; to novel solutions may be considered a form of cognitive rigidity, which has commonly been defined as a resistance to change in beliefs, attitudes or personal habits <xref rid="pone.0036206-Rokeach1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, or the tendency to develop and perseverate in the use of mental or behavioral sets <xref rid="pone.0036206-Schultz1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p><p>Such cognitive rigidity may play a key role in psychopathlogy (for reviews see <xref rid="pone.0036206-Schultz1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0036206-Kashdan1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, see also <xref rid="pone.0036206-Meiran1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>). It has been closely linked to the inability of suicidal individuals to consider alternatives that may be accessible to another person <xref rid="pone.0036206-Ellis1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0036206-Levenson1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, as well as to rumination, a major risk factor of depression <xref rid="pone.0036206-Whitmer1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Similar forms of cognitive rigidity were also indicated in obsessions <xref rid="pone.0036206-Zohar1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0036206-GrossIsseroff1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, alcohol dependence <xref rid="pone.0036206-Sullivan1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, eating disorders <xref rid="pone.0036206-Shearin1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, and Attention Deficit Disorder <xref rid="pone.0036206-Cepeda1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0036206-Williams1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. In this paper, we propose that mindfulness meditation may provide a means of decreasing the aforementioned type of cognitive rigidity.</p><p>Mindfulness is a term which has developed from early eastern traditions and has been commonly defined as "paying attention in a particular way: on purpose, in the present moment and non-judgmentally&#x0201d; <xref rid="pone.0036206-KabatZinn1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Although some have directly linked mindfulness to a practice of meditation (e.g. <xref rid="pone.0036206-KabatZinn2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0036206-Rapgay1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>), others (e.g. <xref rid="pone.0036206-Hayes1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0036206-Wells1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>) have referred to it as rather independent from meditation practice. Mindfulness has additionally been described as a theoretical construct, a psychological process <xref rid="pone.0036206-Chambers1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, and a trait (see <xref rid="pone.0036206-Chiesa1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0036206-Grossman1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> for a recent discussion of discrepancies between various definitions of mindfulness). Nevertheless, mindfulness has been commonly claimed to involve regulation of the focus of attention towards the current experience, a willingness to come in contact with and be receptive to experience rather than avoid it or cope by means of repression, and to involve adopting a &#x0201c;beginners mind&#x0201d; and seeing things in a &#x0201c;fresh&#x0201d; way <xref rid="pone.0036206-Bishop1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. These last attributes of mindfulness in particular seem to potentially immune one from being blinded by experience.</p><p>Mindfulness has received a great deal of empirical attention over the last three decades, and various psychotherapeutic techniques based on mindfulness have been developed (e.g. <xref rid="pone.0036206-KabatZinn2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0036206-Schwartz1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0036206-Segal1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>). Mindfulness based interventions have been shown to alleviate symptoms of a variety of clinical conditions such as suicidal ideation and manic symptoms <xref rid="pone.0036206-Miklowitz1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, relapse reduction in recurrent major depression (see <xref rid="pone.0036206-Chiesa2" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0036206-Mir1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref> for recent reviews), rumination (<xref rid="pone.0036206-Kingston1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0036206-Ramel1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref> see <xref rid="pone.0036206-Heeren1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref> for differential effects of mindfulness on adaptive and maladaptive rumination), addictions and substance use disorders <xref rid="pone.0036206-Garland1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0036206-Zgierska1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, eating disorders (see <xref rid="pone.0036206-WandenBerghe1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref> for a review), generalized anxiety <xref rid="pone.0036206-Roemer1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) <xref rid="pone.0036206-Schwartz1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) <xref rid="pone.0036206-Zylowska1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. Interestingly, many of the disorders which benefit from mindfulness mediation are also characterized by some form of rigidity, suggesting that the efficacy of mindfulness may perhaps be mediated by reduced rigidity.</p><p>In addition to studying mindfulness as a form of therapeutic intervention, there has been a growing body of research over the last years examining various cognitive abilities related to mindfulness, most of which focusing on various measures of attention and memory (see <xref rid="pone.0036206-Chiesa3" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref> for a review). Only few studies have directly addressed the relation between mindfulness and cognitive flexibility or rigidity. Although some studies did not find differences between meditators and non-meditators in rigidity related tasks (e.g <xref rid="pone.0036206-Anderson1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0036206-Chambers2" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>), others have found that meditators exhibit decreased Stroop interference <xref rid="pone.0036206-Moore1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0036206-WenkSormaz1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>(in a Zen meditation sample). The Stroop task requires participants to name the ink color in which color words are written. The interference reflects automaticity with regards to the fact that participants cannot avoid reading the words. This inability to flexibly adapt to novel and non-habitual task requirements may be taken as evidence for inflexibility. Along the same line, other studies found that meditators exhibit superior visual perspective switching on a multiple perspective images task <xref rid="pone.0036206-Hodgins1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>, exhibit superior verbal fluency <xref rid="pone.0036206-Zeidan1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0036206-Heeren2" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>, and perform better than controls on a category production task <xref rid="pone.0036206-WenkSormaz2" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref> and the Hayling task, requiring participants to complete sentences with unrelated and nonsensical words <xref rid="pone.0036206-Heeren2" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. Mindfulness meditators have also been shown to exhibit reduced rumination compared to controls <xref rid="pone.0036206-Kingston1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0036206-Heeren1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, which may also be related to reduced rigidity as reflected in the adoption of repetitive thought patterns concerning distressing symptoms, their causes and implications <xref rid="pone.0036206-NolenHoeksema1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>.</p><p>Importantly, none of the aforementioned tasks tap the tendency to be &#x0201c;blinded&#x0201d; by experience, and overlook simple, obvious novel solutions to a given problem, which is what we studied in this work. To this end, we adopted the water jar paradigm developed by Luchins <xref rid="pone.0036206-Luchins1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>. We had chosen this task over other measures of rigidity since it directly captures the notion of missing obvious adaptive solutions that lie right &#x0201c;under the nose&#x0201d; due to being caught up in learned and repetitive thought patterns. Furthermore, this particular form of rigidity seems most relevant to mindfulness meditation, which is said to involve relating to the present situation with decreased reliance on former knowledge and experience <xref rid="pone.0036206-Harrer1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>. The water jar paradigm was designed to measure the <italic>Einstulling effect</italic>, a term used to describe rigid thought patterns formed through experience which prevents identifying more adaptive approaches and solutions. In this task, participants are required to use three hypothetical jars to obtain a specific amount of water. Initial problems are solvable by the same complex formula, but in later &#x0201c;critical&#x0201d; problems a much simpler formula is also appropriate. In these trials, experience is said to comprise a &#x0201c;trap&#x0201d; which may result in overlooking the simple formula. A rigidity score is compiled, reflecting the degree of perseverative use of the complex formula. Since mindfulness is said to be characterized by focusing on the present moment with a &#x0201c;beginners&#x02019; mind&#x0201d;, we hypothesize that mindfulness experience would result in lower rigidity scores. This hypothesis was examined in two studies. Experiment 1 compared a sample of experienced mindfulness meditators with a comparison group of people who had taken an active interest in mindfulness and had registered to a mindfulness retreat, yet at the time of assessment did not have any formal meditation experience. We chose this group in an attempt to match meditators inclinations and personality characteristics. In Experiment 2, we compared two, randomly assigned groups of non-meditators: a group who underwent eight sessions of structured mindfulness training and a waiting list group, before and after mindfulness training of the mindfulness group.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Experiment 1</title><sec id="s2a1"><title>Participants</title><p>The experienced meditation group was composed of 14 mindfulness (Vipassana, <xref rid="pone.0036206-Chiesa1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>) meditators (7 males, mean age&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;37.29, <italic>SD</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;8.44), having minimum meditation experience of three years (<italic>M</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;8.54 years, <italic>SD</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;4.39) and practicing regularly (<italic>M</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;3.20 hours per week, <italic>SD</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;2.26).

Participants were recruited via poster ads and telephone through a mindfulness meditation (Vipassana) association in Israel.

Self reported Psychometric Entrance Test (PET) score, the Israeli equivalent of the SAT scores, served to assess the equivalence of the groups in academic abilities. PET scores have previously been found to highly correlate (r&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.81) with scores on the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised <xref rid="pone.0036206-Nevo1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>. A PET equivalent score was calculated for two participants who had not taken the PET, via a regression model provided by Oren (Personal communication 6.11.2010) for the average high school matriculation exam score, based on a sample of 65,000 students studying in academic institutions, data of which can be found at the Israeli National Institute for Testing and Education (NITE). Six participants from the pre-meditators group and two from the meditators group were unable to report PET or matriculation exam data. Meditators (<italic>M</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;656.91, <italic>SD</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;52.79) did not significantly differ in their academic abilities as assessed by the PET score from pre-meditators [<italic>M</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;689.27, <italic>SD</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;68.37; <italic>t</italic>(23)&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1.34, ns].

Initial differences in Einstellung rigidity between groups had been assessed in the first experimental session using a task similar in structure to the water jar task, the Alphabet-Maze task, which is described in detail by Cowen <xref rid="pone.0036206-Cowen1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>. A Hebrew version of this task was administered via a computer using E-Prime software. An array of Hebrew letters appeared onscreen. Participants were told that the object of the task is to move from upper-left corner of the maze to the bottom-right corner, spelling out words as they go along (the original direction of the English task has been reversed since Hebrew is written from right to left). Once a word has been spelled, participants may move in any direction (up, down, right, left or diagonally) to spell the following word. Words must be at least 3 letters long. As with the water jar task, instructions encouraged solving rather quickly, yet strongly emphasized that the goal was to reach the end via the shortest and most direct solution, using as few letters as possible. After solving two example questions and verifying comprehension of instructions, participants were presented with six <italic>set trials</italic>, solvable by a long solution (a down-right diagonal movement, followed by a straight down movement, and finally directly to the right). Once solved, participants had written on paper the words taking them from start to end, and pressed the space bar to continue to the following trial. The next four trials were <italic>critical</italic> (also named <italic>trap</italic> or <italic>crucial trials</italic>), solvable by both the long solution and a short solution (a straight diagonal path for the upper-left to the lower-right corners). Finally, two <italic>extinction trials</italic> were presented, solvable only by using the short solution. Rigidity scoring was identical to that of the water jar task, i.e. one rigidity point given for each critical or extinction trial solved using the complex formula, and for each extinction trial exceeding a solving time of 60 seconds. A few problems were evidently solvable by more than one solution. Data were considered valid if at least 4 out of the 6 set trials were solved in the intended method, and no alternative solutions were applied in critical trials nor in the two final set trials.</p><p>Water jar task: Task was similar to that described in Experiment 1, with a few modifications. Task programming was modified to prevent the possibility of continuing to the next trial if the current one was mathematically incorrect, and order of a few set trials was modified to postpone trials more prone to be given alternative solutions. Both modifications were applied in order to maximize mental set constitution and minimize invalid or unscorable data by preventing the application of mathematically incorrect solutions and minimizing as much as possible the number of solutions other than the intended ones. Additionally, number of critical trials was increased from 3 to 4 (See <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0036206-t001">Table 1</xref>) in order to enhance the reliability and hence the statistical power.</p></sec><sec id="s2b3"><title>Mindfulness Program</title><p>The mindfulness program was developed in Be&#x02019;er-Sheva&#x02019;s Mental Health Center, based on the Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy program <xref rid="pone.0036206-Segal1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> with adaptations to include handling general stress and everyday difficulty rather than contents limited to depression. The program was conducted over a period of six weeks, and consisted of seven 2 hour group sessions, and an additional half day retreat at the end of the fifth week. During each session the instructor guided the participants through different meditations including breathing meditation, body scan, open awareness meditation, walking meditation and compassion meditation. A detailed description of the instructions provided for the different meditations is presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0036206-t003">Table 3</xref>. Each session additionally included different awareness exercises, stories and group discussions to allow a broader understanding of mindfulness principles, and provide the participants with opportunities to share their meditation experiences. Daily home practice of formal meditation of at least 20 minutes was required, as well as informal daily mindfulness practice in which participants attend to regular daily activities in a mindful manner. Audio CD&#x02019;s with meditation instructions were provided to facilitate home practice. Additionally, participants received a daily email notification directing them to an online diary for filling a report of their daily home practice. During the half day retreat participants practiced different formal meditations in silence, with no exercises or group discussions. The program was led by one of the authors (KR), a trained mindfulness based therapy instructor and psychologist, with a personal mindfulness meditation experience of over ten years.

Water jar data were excluded from two additional meditators who attended less than four program meetings. Nine participants (3 meditators) met water jar exclusion criteria (see Experiment 1). Two additional participants of each group were excluded from main water-jar analyses, one who reported being familiar with the task and its objective, and three others failed to properly comprehend jar usage instructions.

We therefore hypothesized that mindfulness may reduce cognitive rigidity and immune one from being &#x0201c;blinded&#x0201d; by past experience, as measured by the Einstellung water jar task. In Experiment 1, as hypothesized, following repetitive experience with a complex problem solving method, experienced mindfulness meditators were less blinded by experience and were better able than pre-meditators to identify the simple novel solution. In Experiment 2, similar results were obtained following mindfulness training in which participants were randomly assigned to mindfulness training vs. waiting list groups. These findings lend support to the notion that mindfulness involves cultivation of a &#x0201c;beginner&#x02019;s mind&#x0201d;, and demonstrate that mindfulness practice reduces cognitive rigidity via the tendency to overlook simple novel solutions to a situation due to rigid and repetitive thought patterns formed through experience.</p><p>The present findings coincide with previous findings in which meditators outperformed non-meditators in tasks such as verbal fluency <xref rid="pone.0036206-Zeidan1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0036206-Heeren2" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>, and visual perspective switching <xref rid="pone.0036206-Hodgins1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>, in the respect of exhibiting an improved ability to generate varied responses to the same stimuli following mindfulness practice. Findings of the current study also coincide with previous findings indicating that meditators may exhibit decreased interference in the Stroop <xref rid="pone.0036206-Moore1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0036206-WenkSormaz1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref> and Hayling <xref rid="pone.0036206-Heeren2" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref> tasks in the sense of decreased automatic and habitual responding following mindfulness practice. Our findings additionally converge with findings regarding decreased rumination <xref rid="pone.0036206-Kingston1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0036206-Heeren1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref> in the sense of a reduction in repetitive and perseverative negative thoughts (see <xref rid="pone.0036206-Watkins1" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref> for a discussion regarding such repetitive thinking). Findings of the current study bear novel contributions to the existing literature firstly by demonstrating that reductions in such rigid repetitive thinking patterns following mindfulness practice are evident regardless of thought valence or specific content and therefore reflect reduction in cognitive rigidity rather than a specific reduction in rigid ruminative content. Note that the measures of verbal fluency, visual perspective switching, Stroop, and Hayling tasks mentioned above, measure the ability to overcome over-learned habits rather than repetitive thinking patterns which have just been formed as does the Water jar task. An additional and central novel contribution of this study regards the increased ability to identify and utilize simple novel yet obvious solutions despite having experienced a successful, albeit complex approach in the recent past. Interestingly, the benefit of mindfulness was not restricted to years of experience and was found even following a six-week intervention.</p><p>Individuals suffering from depression and particularly those at suicidal risk tend to exhibit a narrowing of perceived options and difficulty in considering alternatives, a tendency which may prove fatal <xref rid="pone.0036206-Coleman1" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>. A similar narrowing of thought and difficulty in considering alternatives often occurs in instances of alcohol use and abuse. This phenomenon has been termed &#x0201c;alcohol myopia&#x0201d;, and has been found to facilitate extreme social responses <xref rid="pone.0036206-Steele1" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0036206-Steele2" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref>. Although in need of future examination, it is tentatively suggested in light of the current results that reductions in such &#x0201c;blindness&#x0201d; to alternatives due to rigid thought patterns may (partly) underlie the efficacy of mindfulness in treatment of the above conditions <xref rid="pone.0036206-Miklowitz1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0036206-Garland1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>.</p><p>Additional implications of the current findings may regard other common situations, clinical as well as non-clinical, in which individuals may be rigidly &#x0201c;blind&#x0201d; to adaptive solutions or alternative courses of action due to previous experience. As illustrated in the beginning of this paper, overlooking the correct clinical diagnosis often occurs in cases that seem familiar but do not actually match clinicians&#x02019; past experience <xref rid="pone.0036206-Beljan1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Mental health professionals often have difficulty in offering new perspectives and reframing the situation after having repeatedly heard their clients&#x02019; impressions <xref rid="pone.0036206-Clark1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0036206-Nelson1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, and that managers and decision makers in organizations often experience trouble replacing existing procedures with more adaptive ones <xref rid="pone.0036206-Cangemi1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Findings of the current study suggest that mindfulness training may be useful in these and similar cases.</p><p>A number of methodological limitations should be considered regarding the present studies. Sample size, particularly in Experiment 1, was relatively small, due to the difficulty in reaching and recruiting the relevant populations. In Experiment 2, we compared a mindfulness intervention group with a waiting list group. This comparison enables the examination of the effects of a mindfulness intervention program as a whole rather than the effects of specific components within the intervention such as experiencing intervention. A third limitation concerns the water jar task. One of the main merits of this task is its examination of the tendency to overlook novel yet obvious solutions due to experience. This merit, however, also encompasses a shortcoming of the task, which is the fact that it may only be efficiently administered once. While this prevented examination of performance on the same task pre and post intervention, the equivalent performance on a task similar in structure at baseline level and the random assignment to groups practically resolves this shortcoming.</p><p>Future research may examine rigidity related effects that are specific to mindfulness interventions. This may be done by comparing mindfulness with active control groups and other intervention programs. A second direction for future research involves investigating the relationship between the effects of mindfulness training on the Einstellung effect and salient clinical outcomes in various forms of psychopathology. This may both extend the validity of the water jar task, a rigidity measure previously examined primarily in healthy individuals <xref rid="pone.0036206-Schultz1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, to include rigidity in psychopathology, and may allow making more clearly established clinical implications than could have reached in the current study.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Competing Interests: </bold>The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding: </bold>The work was partly supported by a research grant to the third author from the Israel Science Foundation.
