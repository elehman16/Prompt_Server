When the aetiology of cervical pain is unknown, neck pain is defined as non-specific [<xref rid="pone.0118395.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. This is a very common musculoskeletal problem in developed countries [<xref rid="pone.0118395.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The prevalence of CNP in a year varies between 17% and 75% [<xref rid="pone.0118395.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0118395.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Also, the rates of recurrence and chronicity are over 35% for subjects who suffer neck pain [<xref rid="pone.0118395.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0118395.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0118395.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>The socio-economic system is seriously affected by chronic non-specific neck pain (CNSNP) due to direct costs affecting the health system (25% of visits to chiropractors, 15% to hospital physiotherapists, 2% to family physicians as well as 75% of musculoskeletal assessments by rheumatologists are related to neck pain [<xref rid="pone.0118395.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and indirect costs resulting from absences from work, lower productivity and even early retirement [<xref rid="pone.0118395.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0118395.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Due to the socio-economic burden of neck pain, it is important to maximise effective strategies to improve function, limit the progression of degenerative changes and prevent future neck pain relapses [<xref rid="pone.0118395.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0118395.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Therapeutic exercise (TE) is a common treatment for CNP sufferers [<xref rid="pone.0118395.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0118395.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0118395.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].

Intervention in water has been established as a therapeutic modality that uses the physical properties of water to produce physical and functional improvements in patients [<xref rid="pone.0118395.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. It has been demonstrated that TE in water is effective in improving functional capacity and symptoms in patients with CNP [<xref rid="pone.0118395.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0118395.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0118395.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0118395.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0118395.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Both health education and posture are important components of the overall treatment of neck pain [<xref rid="pone.0118395.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Brief advice, verbal instruction and reinforcement through guidance leaflet sheets enable a reconceptualisation of the problem by the patient [<xref rid="pone.0118395.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. It has been demonstrated that not only personal fitness but also psychological and emotional states may influence pain perception [<xref rid="pone.0118395.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and these could be integrated during a TE programme [<xref rid="pone.0118395.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0118395.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Furthermore, functional cognitive therapy has been proven as effective in overcoming the fear of movement displayed by chronic musculoskeletal disease sufferers by reshaping their attitudes and beliefs about their pain [<xref rid="pone.0118395.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0118395.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Specifically in respect to therapeutic physical exercise in water, some modalities such as adapted swimming are presented as a feasible clinical practice for patients with CNSNP, eliminating fear of movement as it is an accessible and fun activity [<xref rid="pone.0118395.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].

To measure the effect of the MPP on these patients, the Spanish version of the Neck Disability Index (NDI) was used [<xref rid="pone.0118395.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0118395.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], which has a reliability of (intraclass correlation coefficient, ICCs = 0.98 [<xref rid="pone.0118395.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The primary outcome variable (NDI), was selected to track the changes in the patient&#x02019;s disability, as a result of CNP, before and after the MPP. The absolute range value of the primary variable is from 50 (maximum disability) to 0 (no disability). The secondary outcome variables were physical and mental health states and quality of life of patients. To measure changes in these variables, the Spanish version of the SF-12 (scale 0&#x02013;100) and EuroQoL-5D (scales: 0&#x02013;1 (quality of life) and 0&#x02013;100 (quality of life visual analogue scale or VAS)) questionnaires were used. The reliability of both instruments, expressed in ICCs, are 0.86 and 0.89 (SF-12) [<xref rid="pone.0118395.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and 0.86 and 0.90 (EuroQoL-5D) [<xref rid="pone.0118395.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] respectively.

Motor control was improved by activating the local system for 10 seconds in a neutral spine position (checking the whole spine from pelvis to head) by trial and error; participants were actually doing this in their daily lives outside of the therapy sessions (such as when sitting, walking and using a computer). Manual teaching and mirrors were used for feedback [<xref rid="pone.0118395.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0118395.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The isometric muscular endurance of deep neck muscles was improved by synergistic arm exercises, such as a press or pullover using dumbbells. Exercises were applied in three sets of 15 repetitions (30 seconds of exercise with 30 seconds of rest), while keeping a cervical neutral position. Rubber band exercises were used with the same criteria, as they also activate scapular fixators, including push and pull exercises.</p><table-wrap id="pone.0118395.t001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0118395.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Scheme of the performed land-based and adapted swimming exercises and their intensity.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone.0118395.t001g" xlink:href="pone.0118395.t001"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Type of Exercises</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Muscles</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Name of Exercise</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Intensity</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="7" align="center" colspan="1">Land-Based Exercise (30 minutes)</td><td rowspan="3" align="center" colspan="1">Stretching (Mobility)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pectoralis Major Muscle</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Maximum retroflexion with external rotation and horizontal abduction of the shoulder.

The main factor that affects the neck is the propulsive force from the upper limbs. By controlling speed and the range of motion of limbs, the therapist can set an exercise where the neck is in a neutral position and deep muscles are stimulated, in addition to the aerobic exercise benefits.

The relative average improvement in disability (NDI) in patients who suffer CNSNP after 8 weeks of intervention with the MPP was 22.64% (11.32 (&#x000b1; 8.42) points on NDI scale) and these results are partially consistent with previous studies [<xref rid="pone.0118395.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0118395.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Recent studies which have used exercise as an intervention for patients who suffer CNSNP have shown improvements in disability of 1.5% [<xref rid="pone.0118395.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], 8.48% (NDI: 4.24 points) [<xref rid="pone.0118395.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], 14% (NDI: 7.0 points) [<xref rid="pone.0118395.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], 11% and 19.8% (NDI: 5.5 and 9.9 points respectively) [<xref rid="pone.0118395.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] and 19.2% and 28.6% (NDI: 14.3 points) [<xref rid="pone.0118395.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The difference in results between the present study and those previously reported may have various explanations. First, the degrees of disability that participants from different studies have are important. In the present study, all participants had a moderate disability (NDI: 28.20 (&#x000b1; 13.08) (<xref rid="pone.0118395.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>)). In some studies, the level of disability of participants was similar that of the present study. For example, participants of the study published by Bronfort et al. [<xref rid="pone.0118395.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] had levels of disability between 28.25 (&#x000b1; 6.40) and 28.45 (&#x000b1; 7.1). Similarly, levels of disability among study participants in Michalsen et al.&#x02019;s research [<xref rid="pone.0118395.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] were also moderate (25.4 &#x000b1; 5.2 to 25.8 &#x000b1; 5.5). However, in the studies published by Mallin and Murphy (35) and Evans et al. [<xref rid="pone.0118395.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], disability levels of the participants were mild, with values ranging from NDI 13.4 (&#x000b1; 4.5) [<xref rid="pone.0118395.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] to 14.00 (&#x000b1; 6.35) [<xref rid="pone.0118395.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. These initial levels of disability should force us to carefully analyse the evolution of the participants between the studies as the scope for participant improvement in this study is broader than the scopes for improvement in the studies of Evans et al. [<xref rid="pone.0118395.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] and Mallin and Murphy [<xref rid="pone.0118395.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p><p>The level of adherence of participants in each study may also be another explanation for the different results between the present study and the studies analysed. In the study by McLean et al. [<xref rid="pone.0118395.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], adherence of the study participants was very low (47%), affecting the results negatively. Moreover, both in the study of Mallin and Murphy [<xref rid="pone.0118395.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and Michalsen et al. [<xref rid="pone.0118395.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], the patients received intervention through exercise-specific methodologies. The first one employed Pilates, while the second one used yoga as the intervention method. However, when comparing studies that include TE intervention as the primary method, consistent results between the present study and previously published results were observed [<xref rid="pone.0118395.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0118395.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. One explanation for the small differences observed between the three studies can be found in the type of exercise proposed by each protocol. Evans et al. [<xref rid="pone.0118395.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] proposed exercises based on strength endurance while Bronfort et al. [<xref rid="pone.0118395.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] proposed stretching and aerobic endurance, while in this study all types of exercises (stretching, strength endurance and aerobic endurance) were integrated. On the other hand, the distribution of sessions may also have influenced the results, since in both studies 20 sessions were distributed over 12 [<xref rid="pone.0118395.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] and 11 [<xref rid="pone.0118395.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] weeks respectively (on average, less than two sessions weekly). However, in the present study, 24 sessions were distributed over 8 weeks of intervention (three sessions weekly).</p></sec><sec id="sec018"><title>Changes in physical and mental health states</title><p>The improved percentages in physical (14.36%) and mental (16.29%) health states are consistent with the study presented by Bronfort et al. [<xref rid="pone.0118395.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], where patients experienced an improvement of 12% after 11 weeks of intervention. However, the range of improvement experienced by participants in this study is higher than in the study published by Bronfort et al. [<xref rid="pone.0118395.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The present study provides baseline values of 39.96 (&#x000b1; 12.63) and 40.63 (&#x000b1;14.35) for general physical and mental health states respectively (<xref rid="pone.0118395.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>), while the participants in Bronfort et al.&#x02019;s study [<xref rid="pone.0118395.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] had values of 69.0 (&#x000b1; 13.1) on a general health state scale of 0&#x02013;100 (SF-12 and SF-36). However, consistency in results was not observed in other studies analysed because significant improvements in physical health state of 8% and 0.6% [<xref rid="pone.0118395.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and mental health state of 3.3% [<xref rid="pone.0118395.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] and &#x02212;2.4% [<xref rid="pone.0118395.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] respectively were observed, although the initial levels of general physical and mental health were similar between the present study and Michelsen et al.&#x02019;s [<xref rid="pone.0118395.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] study (physical: 38.5 (&#x000b1; 7.1) to 40.7 (&#x000b1; 6.0) and mental: 44.3 (&#x000b1; 11.7) to 43.0 (&#x000b1; 10.4)).</p><p>Moreover, for the reasons outlined above in regard to the type of exercise proposed and distribution of the sessions throughout the intervention, another possible explanation for these different results could be found in the use of health education as a tool to integrate the activities learnt during treatment sessions into the daily life of each patient [<xref rid="pone.0118395.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. This progressive learning that is acquired throughout the intervention is easily transferable to the activities of the daily lives of the patients, positively affecting their physical and mental health states [<xref rid="pone.0118395.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec019"><title>Changes in quality of life</title><p>The improvements shown by patients in quality of life (13% (0.13 points on EuroQoL-5D scale) and 15.16% (EuroQoL-VAS)) are consistent with a previous study published on patients who suffer CNSNP [<xref rid="pone.0118395.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], where the patients experienced an improvement of 10% (EuroQoL-5D: 0.10) and 5.22% (EuroQoL-VAS). It is also important to consider that the baseline values in quality of life of the participants in both studies were similar, with values on EuroQoL-5D and EuroQoL-VAS of 0.70 (&#x000b1; 0.21) and 55.59 (&#x000b1; 19.15) in the present study and 0.70 (&#x000b1; 0.26) and 60.81 (&#x000b1; 22.65) in the study published by Cuesta-Vargas et al. [<xref rid="pone.0118395.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] respectively.</p><p>In addition, the consistency in the results for quality of life between both studies could be explained by the fact that in both studies the patients performed a MPP where physical land-based TE, adapted swimming and health education were integrated, and patients were chronic musculoskeletal disease sufferers (CNSNP in this study, and CNSNP, non-specific chronic lower-back pain and osteoarthritis patients in the previous study [<xref rid="pone.0118395.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec020"><title>Strengths and weaknesses of the study</title><p>To our knowledge, this study is the first to integrate physical land-based TE, adapted swimming and health education as a treatment for patients who suffer CNSNP. Furthermore, it was observed that this procedure produced clinically relevant improvements in all the variables examined. However, it also has some limitations such as lack of a control group, which would have strengthened the results. The influence of different anchors for the NDI in minimal important change would be considered for subgroups of patientswith higher or lower baseline scores [<xref rid="pone.0118395.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The effect was only measured in the medium term (8 weeks); the analysis of the treatment effect could be extended to a longer term.

However, from the results obtained questions remain requiring new randomised studies to find the answers, i.e. whether the same results can be obtained as a function of the participant&#x02019;s age or the optimal frequency (number of weeks) to achieve the best cost-effectiveness balance.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec021"><title>Conclusion</title><p>After 8 weeks of a MPP that integrated land-based physical therapeutic exercises, health education and adapted swimming, clinically relevant improvements in disability, physical and mental health states and quality of life were observed in patients who suffer CNSNP.
