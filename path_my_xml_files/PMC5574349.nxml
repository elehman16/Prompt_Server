using EMG-biofeedback on balance and lower extremity muscle activation. [Subjects and
Methods] For this study, 30 stroke patients participated in this study and they were
divided into closed kinetic chain exercise using EMG-biofeedback group (CKCE+EB) and open
kinetic chain exercise using EMG-biofeedback group (OKCE+EB), each group consisting of 15
patients. The kinetic chain exercise using EMG-biofeedback was performed by the patients
for 20 minutes once a day, 5 days a week, for 6 weeks using an Myo-Ex. BioRescue was used
to measure balance ability, while surface EMG was used to measure the lower extremity
muscle activation. [Results] According to the results of the comparison within the groups,
after the intervention, both groups showed significant increases in the balance ability
and lower extremity muscle activation. In the comparisons between the groups, after the
intervention, balance ability and lower extremity muscle activation were significantly
higher in the CKCE+BE than in the OKCE+EB. [Conclusion] This study showed that closed
kinetic chain exercise using EMG-biofeedback is effective for improving balance ability
and lower extremity muscle activation in stroke patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Kinetic chain exercise</kwd><kwd>Balance</kwd><kwd>Muscle activation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Stroke causes damage of brain cells and neurological deficits due to cerebral thrombosis or
intra-cerebral hemorrhage. Its clinical manifestations include consciousness, sensory and
movement disorders, and it limits patients&#x02019; independent activities of daily living<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.
The impaired sensory-motor system leads to a loss of balance, which is an important factor
in predicting the success of stroke patients&#x02019; independent activities of daily living and
disorders occurring after their discharge from hospital<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Balance is the ability to maintain postural stability. The lack of postural control in
stroke patients is associated with a decrease imbalance ability and lower extremity
strength. Weakened muscles on the paralyzed side result in atrophy of selective type II
fiber and reduced recruitment of motor units<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. The decrease in lower extremity strength
has a significant correlation with the decline of balance ability, and numerous evidences
support that training to strengthen the lower extremity muscle is effective for restoring
gait and balance abilities<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Among various ways to classify muscle strengthening exercises, there are open kinetic chain
exercises (OKCE) and closed kinetic chain exercises (CKCE) based on the kinetic chain. OKCE
allow distal segments of the body to move freely in space, whereas CKCE involve movements of
proximal segments<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. CKCE provide stability
of joint through co-activation of muscle with recruitment of motor unit and increase
proprioceptive input, while OKCE improves balance and walking ability through increasing the
traction force and rotation force and providing stability to joints<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, as it is difficult for CKCE and OKCE to cause
maximum muscle contraction due to a decrease in motivation, a training method using
EMG-biofeedback (EB) has been suggested<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>EB is used in the rehabilitation training process of various diseases such as
musculoskeletal and neurological diseases by providing information on the action potential
of exercise units during movements, and is an effective method to reduce pain and improve
muscular strength and performance of functions<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Although studies on EB are actively being conducted, few studies have performed an
intervention combining CKCE and OKCE, and there has been a lack of studies comparing the
effects of training based on the kinetic chain. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to
examine the effects of kinetic chain exercise using EB on balance and lower extremity muscle
activation in stroke patients, and on this basis, suggest an effective method for
rehabilitation training.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study was approved by bioethics Committee of Sehan University Center (IRB) (Approval
number: 2016&#x02013;07) on August 1, 2016. Subjects were selected from 45 patients with a chronic
stroke that occurred not less than 6 months ago, hospitalized at J Hospital in&#x02005;M, Jeonnam
province. 30 patients gave written consent to participate in the experiment based on
sufficient understanding on this study. They were divided into CKCE using EB group (CKCE+EB)
and OKCE using EB groups (OKCE+EB), each group consisting of 15 patients. The selection
criteria for the subjects included the ability to communicate achieving 24 points or more in
the Korean mini-mental status examination, the ability to walk more than 10 meters
independently, and the lack of orthopedic disease that can affect the experiment (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>General characteristics of the subjects</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><col width="46.9027%" span="1"/><col width="26.5487%" span="1"/><col width="26.5487%" span="1"/><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CKCE+EB (n=15)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">OKCE+EB (n=15)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> Male/Female</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">9/6</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10/5</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (yrs)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">56.7 &#x000b1; 5.6</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">57.1 &#x000b1; 6.3</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Height (cm)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">165.8 &#x000b1; 7.2</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">166.3 &#x000b1; 8.1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Weight (kg)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">63.9 &#x000b1; 3.6</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">65.7 &#x000b1; 4.6</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Stroke type (Infarction/Hemorrhage)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10/5</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">9/6</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Paretic side (Left/Right)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">9/6</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">9/6</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Duration (month)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">16.1 &#x000b1; 6.4</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">17.2 &#x000b1; 8.6</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">MMSE-K</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">25.7 &#x000b1; 1.2</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">25.6 &#x000b1; 1.6</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>MMSE-K: mini mental state examination-Korean</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap>).</p><p>The E-LINK system Myo-Ex (Biometrics Inc., England) was used for EB training using the
kinetic chain. During the task-oriented training program, the activity potential generated
through muscle contraction was measured, and the subjects were provided with both visual and

the center of each muscle belly in a direction parallel to muscle fibers. The sampling rate
was set to 1,024&#x02005;Hz, the notch filer 60&#x02005;Hz, and the band pass filter 30&#x02013;450&#x02005;Hz. The

balance and lower extremity muscle activation in stroke patients. EB training is conducted
for a variety of purposes, such as enhancing cognitive and sensory-motor performance,
relaxing hyper active muscles and strengthening muscles<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Tsaih et al.<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup> divided 33 stroke
patients into an experimental group subjected to EB intervention and a control group, and
reported a significant improvement in dynamic balance in the experimental group. Likewise,
Dogan-Asla et al.<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup> conducted an
experiment on 40 stroke patients, and the experimental group with EB intervention showed a
significant increase in wrist muscle activation compared with the control group. This
present study indicated the same results as those of previous studies. Both training groups
displayed a significant increase in stability limits and muscle activation before and after
the EB intervention, which suggests that EB training is necessary for improving the lower
extremity muscle strength and balance ability.</p><p>Among muscle strengthening exercises, kinetic chain exercises are categorized into OKCE and
CKCE. In an intervention where 15 healthy adult males performed external rotation of the
shoulder joints under the condition of CKCE and OKCE, Kang et al.<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup> identified a significant difference in improvement of
muscle activation in CKCE compared with OKCE. Lee et al.<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup> divided 33 chronic stroke patients into the CKCE group, the OKCE
group and the control group. The CKCE group and the OKCE group showed a significant increase
in improvement of muscle activation and balance ability in comparison with the control
group. In particular, CKCE were effective in improving muscle activation and balance
ability.</p><p>This present study also indicates that there was a significant increase in muscle
activation and stability limits before and after the intervention in both the CKCE+EB group
and the OKCE+EB group. In comparisons between the groups, the CKCE+EB group showed a
significant difference in improvements of muscle activation. The fact that muscle activation
and stability limits significantly increased in both groups before and after the
intervention suggests that feedback through EB improved motor control ability. CKCE are
considered to be more effective in improving balance and muscle activation than OKCE because
they provide stability of joint through co-activation of muscle and increase proprioceptive
input by pressing the articular capsule. However, the limitation of this study is that the
results may not be generalized to all stroke patients due to the limited regional extent and
the small number of subjects.</p><p>This study confirmed that CKCE using biofeedback are more effective in improving balance
and lower extremity muscle activation in stroke patients. Further research is needed to
examine the effects of kinetic chain exercise on their walking ability and quality of
life.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This research has been conducted by the research grant of Sehan University in 2017.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>CM</given-names></name><name><surname>Eng</surname><given-names>JJ</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>The relationship of lower-extremity muscle torque to
