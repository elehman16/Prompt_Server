Introduction</title><p>Drug dependency is a major problem in our country and in international level, since on one hand, it threatens the health of society and on the other hand, it is associated with many crimes and diseases such as AIDS (<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">Madani &#x00026; Emadi, 2003</xref>). Drug misuse and addiction is a serious illness which ruin the economy improvement, communications and the individual&#x02019;s occupation (<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">Carlo et al., 2004</xref>). Thus, there are multiple medical treatments and various psychological treatment methods in this field (<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">Carlo et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">Katibaee et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">Ahmadi &#x00026; motamed, 2002</xref>). Reality therapy is an internal control system which clarifies how and why to choose options which determine the direction of our lives (<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">Wubbolding, 2006</xref>; Aghaee, 2002). This theory is widely used for the treatment of addictive disorders (such as drugs, sex, food, work) (<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2008</xref>). Reality therapy method, which later altered to selection theory, emphasizes encountering accepting responsibility and moral judgment about right and wrong of ethics (<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">Mottern &#x00026; Mottern, 2006</xref>). Reality therapists believe that the drug addicts choose their behavior as a way to solve the failure caused by unpleasant relations (<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">Carey, 2007)</xref>.</p><p>Reality therapy is a method based on common sense and emotional engagement. This theory is based on identity quality, its formation and change since human has unaccountable behavior when encountering anxiety and discomfort (<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">Glaser, 2009)</xref>. Gaining control over the choices and accepting the responsibility in this field should be the subject of the treatment. Modifying different psychological aspects of individual, reality therapy helps them to deeply face the realities of their behavior and choices and recognizes that they are responsible for their miseries and misfortunes (<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">Carlo et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Therefore, reality therapy provides the context for mental and psychological health promotion by direct impact on various mental, psychological, and personality aspects (<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">Kim, 2008</xref>). Metacognition is a personal knowledge about self cognitive processes which consist of processing, organizing, and coordinating of all of them. Metacognition is a multidimensional concept. This concept consists of knowledge, processes, and strategies which evaluate, supervise, or control cognition. Metacognition skill is a modern scholar area which is closely related to anxiety (<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">Wells, 2002</xref>). Awareness of human cognitive processes and finding ways to enhance and improve these abilities, metacognition has gained the attention of educational experts (King, 1994). Schraw and moshman (1995) believe that three cultural, public interaction and self-constructing factors involve in creating and founding individual&#x02019;s metacognitive theories (Schraw &#x00026; Moshman, 1995). Metacognition is one of the variables which is disrupted through drug misuse and may be particularly related to the analysis of drugs dependent cognition. From the metacognitive perspective, drug abuse creates significant rapid changes in cognitive events such as feelings, thoughts or memories.</p><p>Drugs and psychotropic drugs may affect cognitive events directly for instance, relaxation, avoidance, running away from painful cognitions, and awareness and attention or indirectly for example, feelings of attachment, suppressed astonishment and assessment by changes in beliefs and attitudes toward avoiding cognitive events. These cognitive changes may result in powerful negative and positive reinforcements of drugs use (<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">Casey &#x00026; Jones, 2010</xref>). In addition, the use of drugs not only creates beliefs and positive expectations about the effects of drugs and psychotropic drugs, but also helps to gain knowledge and awareness about the cognitive consequences. Lack of using drugs when the person is willing to use it, may be related to specific beliefs and attitudes toward the effectiveness of related cognitive events (<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">Toneatto, 1999</xref>). Stress is one of the problems and disorders which is revealed by the human improvement in various life aspects. When the person cannot deal with the situation and this situation somehow makes discomfort, it leads to stress. An important feature of addiction which is the psychological dependence on the effects of addictive drugs, takes away favorable conditions for the development of the individual abilities. Apathy, inefficiency, lack of accountability and the negative attitude of society to the addicted person all are the features that endanger the addicted person from the mental perspective. Thus, the addicted people are often involved in a variety of emotional symptom including stress (<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">Sohrabi, 2007</xref>). Since the addicted person has no efficiency, the feeling of helpfulness and efficiency is formed less. Therefore, stress attacks him more and this negatively affects the capability, efficiency of the addicted person and declines his creativity and self-esteem (<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">Sohrabi, 2007</xref>). Hope is one of the basic principles of balance and mental strength gains which determines the life achievements. Hope is the ability to believe a better feeling of future. Hope with its penetrating power stimulates activity system to help the system to gain new experiences and creates new forces to the organism (<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">Gullo &#x00026; Dawe, 2008</xref>). Thus, hope makes human to attempt and approaches them to higher levels of psychological and behavioral performances and is a sign of mental health (<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">Islami, 1998</xref>). Considering the destructive effects of drug on metacognition, making stress and declining hope and the direct effect of these cases on prognosis of addiction treatment and lack of enough study in this field, the current study was carried out to investigate the effect of reality therapy on these three factors in people referring to one of the NA centers.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-2"><title>2. Material and Methods</title><p>This study was before and after quasi-experimental study with control group. Sampling was carried out simply by picking up 60 addicts who referred to Shafa NA Center in Jahrom in the fall and the winter of 2012. Samples had no history of psychological-mental disorders, alcohol and psychotropic drug use and it was their first attempts to quit. All samples were male and aged between 20 to 35 years.</p><p>Samples were randomly assigned into two groups of intervention and control (each group 30).</p><p>Checklist associated with metacognition evaluation, stress and hope were completed through interview by the first psychologist in both experimental and control groups. To evaluate metacognition, a 20-question standard questionnaire of Anil and Abedi (1996) was applied which investigates metacognition in 4 elements of awareness, cognitive strategy, planning, and self reviewing. Measuring scale was educational however; the range varies from 1 to 4. This questionnaire has been applied in several studies and the reliability has been reported 0.70 to 0.83 using Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha. To evaluate stress index, the standard questionnaire of Cohen et al. (1983) was used. This scale has 14 items and responses are based on Likert scale. Consistency of reliability coefficient of internal scale was achieved through two-range Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha coefficients from 0.84 to. 0.86 in the two groups of students and a group of smokers in the quitting plan.</p><p>The Scale of Hope Adult Schneider (SAHS) also measured through (Schneider et al., 1991) questionnaire that was designed by (<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">Snyder &#x00026; Lopez, 2007</xref>) to measure hope, contains 14 expressions and is run as a self-assessment. From among these, four expressions measure agent thought, four expressions measure strategic thought, and four expressions are distractors. So, the questionnaire measures two subscales: agent and strategy. The coefficient of validity and reliability of the test was reported 91%. Internal consistency reported 0.74-0.84 also Test-retest reliability was 0.80. This number during the periods of more than 8-10 weeks was higher than this value (<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">Snyder et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>In Iran this scale has been standardized and has achieved a good reliability. For example, in the study of Alavi (2006) <italic>Cronbach&#x02019;s Alpha</italic> Reliability Coefficient was obtained 0.75 and it was achieved 0.62 in the study of Nasiri and Jokar (2008).</p><p>Then control group received usual care of psychological center and experimental group received reality therapy during nine sessions by the psychologists. The first session include familiarity with the concept of reality therapy and emotional engagement with members of the group, the second session was recognition of their identity and various kinds of identities and characteristics of achievement and failure identities, the third session was investigating how to accept their responsible behavior and getting to know other members and the importance and necessity of accountability in life, the fourth session was familiarity with anxiety from the viewpoint of reality therapy and relaxation training for anxiety control, the 5th session was expressing the vital and effective requirements in life and their capabilities to choose the best method to achieve basic needs, the 6th session was familiarity with how to plan problem solving and plan for their present lives, the seventh session was understanding the commitment to performing completed plans, the eighth session was familiarity with how to decline excuses related to plans and selected programs, and the ninth session was familiarity of members with the effect of punishment in absence of creating a good relationship. The sessions meet once a week for 45-60 minutes and after completion of the course, the checklists related to metacognition, stress, and were completed through interview by the first psychologist in both groups.</p><p>This study confirmed by Ethical Committee in Jahrom University of Medical sciences.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-3"><title>3.

But in the long term it is considered maladaptive, since it can cause dependence and produce negative excitement (<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">Spade, 2008</xref>).

The different results of the present study are probably because stress and the involving factors such as physical and psychological dependence of addicts are different from others (<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">Curry et al., 2006</xref>), and the second is that mere reality therapy cannot be substituted by education of communication skills or supportive psychotherapy, particularly in drug addicts. Thus, more studies must be conducted in this field.</p><p>Considering the effect of reality therapy on life expectancy, no studies have been carried out, but the conducted studies in other groups indicated the effect of it on reducing stress which is in line with the present study. The study of <xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">Pasha and Amini (2008)</xref> demonstrated that reality therapy increased and reduced anxiety among wives of martyrs. The studies of <xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">Klug (2006)</xref>, Barens and <xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">Parish (2006)</xref>, and <xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">Davidson et al. (2007)</xref> showed that reality therapy has increased life expectancy.</p><p>In our study, there is not any significant difference in stress level between two groups, also in experiment group slightly raised. This change may be from short term effects of intervention, but it should be evaluate long term effects of intervention in these patients.</p><p>Limitations of this study were non-random selection of the samples due to the limited number of administrative problems. Another restriction was lack of consideration of other factors involved in measured variables such as sociocultural conditions and other effective factors that caused addiction. It is suggested that the role and contribution of reality therapy are investigated alone or in combination with other supportive and psychotherapy interventions in metacognitive beliefs, negative excitements, and thought suppression in drug abuse disorder much broadly and more confidently.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-5"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>Reality therapy is a method which focuses on accountability and present behavior of individuals. Hope is optional and depends on human behavior. so, it provides opportunities that individual learn proper behavior to meet their needs, also this approach may be leading to the increase of life expectancy in addicted patients. We suggest group psychological approach as hope therapy in side medical treatments.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>I appreciate all participants who participated in the study and also the Deputy of Research in Jahrom University of Medical Sciences for their financial supports.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest</bold></p><p>None.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="ref1"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Aghaee</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Investigating the effects of reality therapy on increasing hopes and mental health and the fertility rate of women with and oocyte donation</article-title><source>Doctoral dissertation of Counseling, Khurasgan Branch</source><year>2009</year></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ahmadi</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Motamed</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Treatment success re among Iranian opioid dependents</article-title><source>Addict Disord Their Treat 2002</source><year>2002</year><volume>13</volume><fpage>99</fpage><lpage>103</lpage><comment><uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/00132576-200209000-00004">http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/00132576-200209000-00004</uri></comment></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Baeness</surname><given-names>A.
