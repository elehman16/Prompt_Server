phase after stroke is the optimal time window to promote the recovery of
upper limb function. The dose and content of training provided
conventionally during this phase is however, unlikely to be adequate to
drive functional recovery, especially in the presence of severe motor
disability. The current study concerns an approach to address this
shortcoming, through evaluation of the SMART Arm, a non-robotic device that
enables intensive and repetitive practice of reaching by stroke survivors
with severe upper limb disability, with the aim of improving upper limb
function. The outcomes of SMART Arm training with or without
outcome-triggered electrical stimulation (OT-stim) to augment movement and
usual therapy will be compared to usual therapy alone.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>A prospective, assessor-blinded parallel, three-group randomised controlled
trial is being conducted. Seventy-five participants with a first-ever
unilateral stroke less than 4 months previously, who present with severe arm
disability (three or fewer out of a possible six points on the Motor
Assessment Scale [MAS] Item 6), will be recruited from inpatient
rehabilitation facilities. Participants will be randomly allocated to one of
three dose-matched groups: SMART Arm training <italic>with</italic> OT-stim and
usual therapy; SMART Arm training <italic>without</italic> OT-stim and usual
therapy; or usual therapy alone. All participants will receive 20 hours of
upper limb training over four weeks. Blinded assessors will conduct four
assessments: pre intervention (0-weeks), post intervention (4-weeks), 26
weeks and 52 weeks follow-up. The primary outcome measure is MAS item 6. All
analyses will be based on an intention-to-treat principle.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>By enabling intensive and repetitive practice of a functional upper limb task
during inpatient rehabilitation, SMART Arm training with or without OT-stim
in combination with usual therapy, has the potential to improve recovery of
upper limb function in those with severe motor disability. The immediate and
long-term effects of SMART Arm training on upper limb impairment, activity
and participation will be explored, in addition to the benefit of training
with or without OT-stim to augment movement when compared to usual therapy
alone.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.anzctr.org.au/Trial/Registration/TrialReview.aspx?id=83061">ACTRN12608000457347</ext-link></p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Stroke</kwd><kwd>Upper limb</kwd><kwd>Function</kwd><kwd>Training</kwd><kwd>Rehabilitation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Recovery of the upper limb after stroke is poor. Up to 80% of stroke survivors have
some upper limb disability during the acute to subacute phase after stroke. By
various estimates, only 5% to 20% demonstrate complete functional recovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Thus, stroke survivors with upper limb disability appear to be a
rehabilitation challenge. There is therefore, a pressing need to increase the
potential for functional recovery of the upper limb after stroke.</p><p>To drive recovery of function, it is recommended that training commence early and be
intensive, repetitive and task-oriented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. However, stroke survivors with severe motor disability are often unable
to participate in task-oriented training as they are incapable of generating levels
of volitional motor activity or control that are sufficient to engage in training
tasks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Further compounding their situation is a lack of access to interventions
that make task-oriented practice possible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. It is therefore not surprising that priority is rarely given to upper
limb training by stroke survivors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] or rehabilitation services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] during inpatient rehabilitation. Yet, with stroke survivors spending up
to 25% of a physiotherapy session inactive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], there appears to be considerable scope within current therapeutic
regimes to increase the delivery of task-oriented upper limb training.</p><p>To capitalise upon this opportunity, a non-robotic training device, the SMART Arm
(Sensori-Motor Active Rehabilitation Training of the Arm) (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), was developed to enable stroke survivors with severe upper
limb disability to undertake intensive and repetitive task-oriented training. The
device was specifically designed so that stroke survivors with little to no muscle
activity could practice reaching, a fundamental upper limb function, along a
straight-line path consistent with a normal reaching pattern. The device can be used
with or without electrical stimulation to the lateral head of triceps brachii to
augment elbow extension and enhance completion of the reaching task. To optimise the
potential for motor learning, this device incorporates elements critical to skill
acquisition, including active problem solving, augmented real-time feedback of
performance, task progression that is tailored to each individual, motivation and
encouragement.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>SMART Arm.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2377-13-71-1"/></fig><p>To date, a 12-hour SMART Arm training program with or without electromyographic
(EMG)-triggered electrical stimulation to triceps has been investigated in chronic
stroke survivors with severe upper limb disability. Compared with the control group,
those who underwent SMART Arm training with or without stimulation showed a
significant improvement in upper limb function (improvement in MAS6 item 6 score)
that was sustained at 2 months follow-up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], an improved ratio of triceps to biceps EMG activity during reaching [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], and greater corticospinal reactivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. There were however, variations in the expression of additional benefits
derived from the use of EMG-triggered electrical stimulation. As this may have been
due to the use, by some individuals, of maladaptive patterns of EMG activity such as
co-contraction of biceps and triceps, that could nonetheless trigger stimulation, a
new method of outcome-triggered electrical stimulation (OT-stim) was developed.
Here, electrical stimulation is triggered when initial goal directed motion
surpasses an individualised threshold. Thus, assistance by means of electrical
stimulation (and reinforcement) occurs when the movement generated voluntarily is
commensurate with the desired outcome. In a pilot trial of SMART Arm with OT-stim
during inpatient rehabilitation, SMART Arm training (with or without OT-stim), led
to a significantly greater improvement in upper limb function as compared to usual
therapy alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In that these improvements were evident early after stroke, further
investigation within the context of a larger trial is warranted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>Thus, the primary aim of the current randomised controlled trial (RCT) is to
determine the ability of SMART Arm training with or without OT-stim compared to
usual therapy to improve upper limb function in stroke survivors with severe upper
limb disability undergoing inpatient rehabilitation. In addition, we will determine
the impact of the different training programs on upper limb impairment, activity and
participation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><sec><title>Design</title><p>A prospective, assessor-blinded, three group parallel RCT will be conducted with
75 stroke survivors with severe upper limb disability who are undertaking
inpatient rehabilitation (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Trial design.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2377-13-71-2"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Location and setting</title><p>We plan to recruit stroke survivors from two inpatient rehabilitation services
located in Brisbane, Australia: the Princess Alexandra Hospital, with a six-bed
Acute Stroke Unit, located separately to a 78-bed Geriatric and Rehabilitation
Unit; and the Queen Elizabeth II Jubilee Hospital, which has a four bed Acute
Stroke Unit, co-located within a 24-bed Geriatric and Rehabilitation Unit.
Assessment and training will be undertaken in different areas of the same
site.</p></sec><sec><title>Population</title><p>All stroke survivors admitted to the Acute Stroke Unit at each hospital will be
screened for eligibility. Participants will be eligible if they are adult stroke
survivors (&#x0003e;17 years) with a primary diagnosis of first-ever unilateral
stroke (ischaemic or haemorrhagic, including subarachnoid haemorrhage) less than
four months previously, which has been confirmed either radiographically (CT or
MRI) or clinically by the consulting physician; demonstrate severe upper limb
disability equivalent to a score of three or fewer out of a possible six points
(inability to hold the upper limb in position when placed at 90&#x000b0; shoulder
flexion in sitting) on the MAS item six; and are able to follow single-stage
commands, either with verbal instructions, demonstration or other non-verbal
cues.</p><p>Participants will be excluded if they are medically unstable as defined by the
medical registrar or by location in an acute medical ward; have upper limb
comorbidities that could limit their functional recovery (e.g., arthritis, pain,
other neurological disorders); have a contraindication to the use of (e.g.,
pacemaker insitu), or inability to tolerate, electrical stimulation (e.g.,
hypersensitivity or skin condition); have an infectious disease requiring the
use of personal protective equipment (e.g., methicillin resistant staphylococcus
aureus or vancomycin resistant enterococcus) or are unable to sit without
support.</p></sec><sec><title>Randomisation and blinding</title><p>All participants will provide written informed consent. In the event that a
participant is unable to provide informed consent, consent will be sought from
their legal guardian. After completion of the initial assessment, participants
will be randomised to one of three dose-matched groups (two intervention and one
control). The intervention groups are SMART Arm training <italic>with</italic> OT-stim
(SMART Arm OT-stim) and usual therapy; SMART Arm training <italic>without</italic>
OT-stim (SMART Arm alone) and usual therapy. The control group will receive
usual therapy only. Concealed randomisation will be prepared by an offsite
investigator, not involved in recruitment, intervention or data collection,
using a computer generated random number sequence. Consecutively numbered,
randomly ordered opaque envelopes containing group allocation in permuted blocks
of four or six in a 1:1 ratio will be opened consecutively after baseline
assessment in the presence of the participant. Usual therapists will be informed
of group allocation.</p><p>Research assistants who enrol participants, and conduct pre, post and follow-up
assessments will be blinded to group allocation throughout the study.
Participant coding will not refer to group allocation and participants will be
instructed not to divulge information regarding their intervention to the
assessors during assessment. Participants, SMART Arm trainers and usual
therapists (physiotherapy and occupational therapy) will not be blinded to group
allocation. To control expectancy effects for participants and usual therapists,
it will be explained that it is not yet determined which therapy is more
effective.</p></sec><sec><title>Intervention</title><p>All participants will receive 20 hours of upper limb therapy, comprising 60
minutes duration five days per week for four weeks. The proposed volume of
training was guided by discussions with each site and reports from these [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and other facilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], along with previous SMART Arm research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. All SMART Arm training and usual therapy will be recorded in
individual participant logbooks. If a participant misses a SMART Arm or usual
therapy session due to illness, medical procedure, or extended leave (e.g.,
returned to acute medical ward as became unstable), additional days will be
added to ensure all participants are given the opportunity to complete a total
of 20-days of therapy.</p><sec><title>SMART Arm training</title><p>SMART Arm training will be administered for 30 minutes per day by a
physiotherapist or occupational therapist, trained in the delivery of the
intervention. The participant&#x02019;s treating therapy team will administer
30 minutes of usual therapy per day. Training will be typically undertaken
five times per week for four weeks.</p><p>On commencement of a SMART Arm training session, the participant will be
seated on a (armless) chair beside the device. A harness will be applied to
restrict trunk movements to less than 15 degrees and therefore, minimise
compensatory trunk movements and encourage recovery of a pre-morbid pattern
of reaching [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The affected upper limb will be positioned in a customised
thermoplastic splint in mid pronation-supination and wrist extension (0
degrees to 45 degrees) to mimic a functional reach-to-grasp hand position [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. To accommodate for any muscle contracture or pain, the splint
can be positioned through the full range of pronation and supination. The
splint is connected to a manipulandum, which is mounted on a linear slide
and encoder belt. The linear slide serves to constrain movement to one plane
and to reduce friction and resistance to movement. The elbow is positioned
in a standardized start position of 90 degrees of elbow flexion.</p><p>Trainers will be provided with guidelines for the administration of SMART Arm
training. To ensure participants perform a consistent minimum number of
repetitions during the training time period (30 minutes), a goal of a
minimum of 60 repetitions in week one and 80 repetitions in weeks two
through four will be set. This dose was guided by previous research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Progression in training difficulty will occur when consistency
in task practice is evident. Training elements that can be progressed
include the number of repetitions, track elevation, degree of shoulder
external rotation, hand position, load, visual and auditory feedback,
instruction and level of supervision. The decision-making process with
regards to when and how to progress training will be at the discretion of
the SMART Arm trainer and will be based on the stroke survivor&#x02019;s
performance during training. To ensure consistency between trainers,
monitoring (e.g., benchmarking evaluations of completed training logs for
consistent dose, progressions of practice used) and mentoring (e.g.,
peer-supervision, feedback during sessions, and debriefing) will regularly
occur. All SMART Arm training will be documented in a log, which will
capture dose and training element use.</p><sec><title>Outcome-triggered electrical stimulation</title><p>The lateral head of triceps brachii is the target muscle of electrical
stimulation as it is the prime mover for achievement of full elbow
extension. Stimulation to triceps brachii will be delivered via an Empi
300PV unit (St Paul, MN, USA). Two surface electrodes (diameter 50 mm)
will be applied, one above the area of the triceps brachii motor point
(lateral head) and one at the muscle insertion. Stimulation parameters
will consist of a 1 second ascending ramp, and a 4 to 20 second duration
of 200-sec pulse width biphasic stimulation at 35 Hz. When training is
commenced, the participant will attempt to initiate the reaching task.
As the participants&#x02019; reach attempt surpasses their individually
determined threshold distance, electrical stimulation to triceps brachii
will be automatically triggered. The duration of stimulation provided
will be set manually to match the time required by each participant to
perform the movement. The stimulus intensity will be set to the maximum
that can be tolerated by the participant.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Usual therapy</title><p>Participants allocated to usual therapy alone will participate in 20 therapy
sessions of 60 minutes duration, typically undertaken five days per week for
four weeks. Usual therapy refers to the combined duration of occupational
therapy and physiotherapy. It will not be standardized and will likely
consist of a mix of individual and group sessions administering both passive
(e.g. stretching, cyclic electrical stimulation) and active (e.g. range of
movement, strengthening, modified task practice with electrical stimulation)
interventions where possible. All usual therapy will be documented in an
upper limb therapy log, which will capture dose (minutes), frequency
(sessions) and content of upper limb therapy.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Outcome measures</title><p>Arm function (impairment, activity and participation) will be assessed in
accordance with the ICF Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. All participants will be assessed at four time points: three days
prior to commencement of the intervention (baseline, 0 weeks), within one week
of completion of the intervention (post-intervention, 4 weeks), and following
completion of the intervention at 26 and 52 weeks. Assessors will be provided
with guidelines for administering the measures.</p><p>Demographic information about participants will be collected from their medical
record and will include age, gender, date of stroke onset, type (ischaemic or
haemorrhagic) and location (cortical, subcortical, cortical and subcortical or
brainstem) of stroke, stroke medical intervention (e.g. thrombolysis),
co-morbidities and medications.</p><sec><title>Primary outcome measure</title><p>The primary outcome measure will be performance on the MAS item 6 at the post
intervention time period (4 weeks). The MAS is designed to measure recovery
of the affected limb over 3 task-related subscales (upper arm function, hand
and advanced hand movements) that are scored from 0&#x02013;6. It is the
stroke recovery scale most commonly used in clinical practice in Australia
and takes less than 10 minutes to complete. The reliability and validity of
this measure with the stroke population has been previously documented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. It has been shown to be sensitive to change in performance in
people with severe upper limb disability after training with SMART Arm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Secondary laboratory outcome measures</title><p>The functional force generating capacity of the impaired limb will be
assessed using a dynamic and an isometric reaching task similar to previous
protocols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In both tasks, surface EMG activity will be collected from
triceps brachii lateral head, biceps brachii, anterior deltoid, upper
trapezius, external rotators, lower trapezius and serratus anterior. EMG
will be obtained using single differential pre-amplified (gain 1000)
parallel bar electrodes (Bagnoli, DELSYS, 8-channel System, Boston, MA, USA)
with a fixed inter-electrode distance of 10 mm and positioned according to
SENIAM guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. A reference electrode will be attached over the bony prominence
of the seventh cervical spinous process. Signals will be sampled (1000Hz)
using a Power 1401 Data Acquisition System (Cambridge Electronics Design,
Cambridge, UK) and Spike2 software (version 6.02). Time series data will be
collected and stored using Spike2 and processed using custom routines in
Matlab (Mathworks Inc., Nattick, MA).</p><p>Participants will be seated at a custom-built apparatus with the upper limb
in a pendant position, the elbow flexed and the forearm and hand restrained
in pronation via a custom built brace. For all measures a computer monitor
positioned directly in front of the participant will provide visual feedback
on a vertical bar scale. In the dynamic task, the brace will be secured to a
manipulandum mounted on a linear slide restricting motion of the upper limb
to flexion/ extension of the shoulder and elbow. A potentiometer attached to
the slide will measure transducer, reaching, linear displacement. The upper
limb will be placed at a standardised starting position with the elbow at 90
degrees of flexion. Upon presentation of a tone, participants will be
required to &#x02018;reach forward as far as possible&#x02019; in five separate
trials. In the isometric task, the participant will be required to push
forwards (elbow extension) in a position of 150 degrees of elbow flexion
against a manipulandum instrumented to measure force. In five separate
trials, following a tone, participants will be instructed to &#x02018;push as
hard as possible&#x02019; and to keep pushing for five seconds. In both tasks
continuous visual feedback of the applied force will be provided along with
verbal encouragement. During each contraction, force or reach distance and
EMG recordings will be obtained. On the basis of these recordings, peak
force, distance, time to peak and the muscle onset times, amplitude
(root-mean-square (RMS)) and triceps to biceps ratio of EMG RMS amplitude
will be calculated.</p><p>In a subset of the participants, the collection of EMG signals will be
triggered and synchronized using an OptiTrack&#x02122; 6 camera 120 Hz system,
with Tracking Tools&#x02122; computer software (NaturalPoint, Inc, OR, USA)
which will collect kinematic data. Upper limb movement will be tracked via
the recording of reflective marker clusters placed on the
participants&#x02019; upper arm, distal forearm, sternum, and acromion and
acromioclavicular joints. Kinematic data for analysis will include
displacement, velocity and changes in angles of upper arm segments and
markers.</p></sec><sec><title>Secondary outcome measures: clinical</title><p>A range of clinical measures will be collected to measure the presence of
impairments post stroke. To measure strength, lateral head of triceps
brachii muscle power will be assessed using manual muscle testing according
to MRC ratings from 0&#x02013;5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. To measure the active range of movement of finger flexion and
extension, thumb extension and abduction, elbow flexion and extension and
shoulder abduction and adduction, assessment according to the protocol
described by Uswatte et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] will be performed. To measure the presence of spasticity of
biceps brachii and resistance to passive elbow extension, the modified
Ashworth Scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] and Tardieu Scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] will be administered. To evaluate joint tenderness on passive
movement of the hemiplegic shoulder, the Ritchie Articular Index will be
administered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. To describe participants at baseline only, the Cognitive
Linguistic Quick Test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] and Nottingham Sensory Assessment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] will be administered. Motor Assessment Scale items 7 (hand
movements) and 8 (advanced hand activities) will be performed to monitor for
any carryover improvement in hand function. To examine upper limb function
at the participation level, two self-report measures will be used. The
Stroke Impact Scale will be used to measure the impact of the intervention
on the stroke survivor&#x02019;s recovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. The Motor Activity Log will be administered to all subjects to
rate how well and how much they use the paretic limb spontaneously in
everyday tasks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Data analysis</title><p>Data analysis will be performed on an intention-to-treat basis using an alpha
level of 0.05. Descriptive statistics will be used to ensure comparability of
scores between groups at baseline, to describe performance at each phase and to
test whether the assumptions for use of parametric statistics have been met. If
the assumptions for F or t-tests are violated, equivalent non-parametric
statistics will be utilized. The main hypothesis will be tested using mixed
effects models, in a 3 group (SMART Arm + OT stim, SMART Arm alone, usual
therapy) &#x000d7; 4 phase (0, 4, 26, 52 weeks) model. This will be followed by
between-groups planned comparisons. All secondary outcomes will be analysed in a
similar manner.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample size</title><p>The principle endpoint is post intervention (4 weeks). Our previous RCT
demonstrated that stroke survivors using the SMART Arm alone or with electrical
stimulation demonstrated significant improvements in MAS-6 scores compared to
the control group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. On this basis, we estimate a mean improvement of 1.8 (SD 2) in the
usual therapy group, 2.91 (SD 2) in the SMART Arm alone group and 3.91 (SD 2) in
the SMART Arm with OT-stim group. To achieve 80% power and a significance of
0.05 with pairwise comparisons, 22 subjects are required per group, to total 66
subjects. A 15% dropout rate will be allowed to account for withdrawals, thus 25
subjects will be recruited per group, totalling 75.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics approval</title><p>The study protocol has been approved by the University of Queensland Medical
Research Ethics Committee (MREC ID: 2007001628), and the Princess Alexandra
Hospital Ethics Committee (ID: 2008&#x02013;046). This study will be conducted in
accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This will be the first prospective trial to compare the effect of dose-matched
volumes of SMART Arm with OT-stim and usual therapy, versus SMART Arm alone with
usual therapy versus usual therapy alone during inpatient rehabilitation following

critical to drive motor recovery after stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], those with severe impairment and &#x02018;not enough movement to work
with&#x02019; require assistance to complete a functional movement pattern. Currently,
the most commonly used method is manual assistance by a therapist. The minimal time
spent on the upper limb during physiotherapy indicates however, that this
time-inefficient strategy is not prioritised. It is likely that gait training
requirements, which are paramount to determining discharge destination, are
prioritised. Another option is robotic therapy, however availability is currently
limited and functional outcomes remain inconclusive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>].</p><p>In the event that SMART Arm training, with or without electrical stimulation, leads
to demonstratable significant improvements in upper limb function, reduced
impairments or increased participation, an alternative option for retraining would
be presented. Improvements in impairments and activity using the SMART Arm have been
obtained in chronic stroke survivors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], and the indications from our pilot work are that similar outcomes may be
achieved in those undertaking inpatient rehabilitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. If positive changes may be induced during inpatient rehabilitation, this
may allow some stroke survivors to regain levels of function that are sufficient to
enable progression to interventions such as constraint induced movement therapy.</p><p>This study will also allow the impact of augmenting training with electrical
stimulation to be assessed in the context of severe motor disability. This will be
the first large study to determine the effect of outcome-triggered stimulation, in
circumstances in which the stroke survivor is <italic>rewarded</italic> for performing the
desired movement, rather than for simply generating sufficient levels of EMG i.e.
regardless of the functional consequences.</p><p>Findings from this study will provide insights into the effects of practice on
regaining motor skill in those with severe upper limb disability following stroke.
The collection of detailed training data will generate new knowledge regarding the
importance of specific training elements, such as load and feedback on performance
in the early phase of rehabilitation. These will have implications that extend
beyond the current modes of training investigated and possibly to other populations
such as those with other forms of brain injury.</p></sec><sec><title>Consent</title><p>Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of the image
