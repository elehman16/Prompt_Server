Current physiotherapy treatment is moderately effective. Combining theory-based psychological methods with physiotherapy could improve outcomes for people with CLBP. The primary aim of this randomised controlled trial (RCT) is to evaluate the efficacy of Physiotherapy informed by Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (PACT) on functioning in patients with CLBP.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>The PACT trial is a two-armed, parallel-group, multicentre RCT to assess the efficacy of PACT in comparison with usual physiotherapy care (UC). 240 patients referred to physiotherapy with CLBP will be recruited from three National Health Service (NHS) hospitals trusts. Inclusion criteria are: age &#x02265;18&#x02005;years, CLBP &#x02265;12-week duration, scoring &#x02265;3 points on the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ) and adequate understanding of spoken and written English to participate. Patients will be randomised to PACT or UC (120 per arm stratified by centre) by an independent randomisation service and followed up at 3 and 12&#x02005;months post randomisation. The sample size of 240 will provide adequate power to detect a standardised mean difference of 0.40 in the primary outcome (RMDQ; 5% significance, 80% power) assuming attrition of 20%. Analysis will be by intention to treat conducted by the trial statistician, blind to treatment group, following a prespecified analysis plan. Estimates of treatment effect at the follow-up assessments will use an intention-to-treat framework, implemented using a linear mixed-effects model.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>This trial has full ethical approval (14/SC/0277). It will be disseminated via peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations. The results will enable clinicians, patients and health service managers to make informed decisions regarding the efficacy of PACT for patients with CLBP.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number</title><p>ISRCTN95392287; Pre-results.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>PAIN MANAGEMENT</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group specific-use="FundRef"><award-group id="funding-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institute for Health Research</institution><institution-id>http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000272</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PB-PG-1112-29055</award-id></award-group></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Strengths and limitations of this study</title></caption><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The Physiotherapy informed by Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (PACT) trial will be the first randomised controlled trial to test the efficacy of a physiotherapist-led ACT-informed intervention for chronic low back pain (CLBP) against standard physiotherapy.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The PACT trial will assess the feasibility of training physiotherapists to deliver a novel psychologically informed physiotherapy intervention.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Theory-based processes of change consistent with the psychological flexibility model will be evaluated, providing evidence for the mechanisms underpinning observed outcomes.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Restriction to participants referred to physiotherapy services and speaking English may limit generalisability of findings.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Patients who have had prior treatment from multidisciplinary or cognitive&#x02013;behavioural therapy (CBT) pain management at any time and other physiotherapy treatment in the previous 6&#x02005;months will be excluded due to possible contamination effects.</p></list-item></list></boxed-text><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Low back pain has a lifetime prevalence ranging from 60% to 70% in industrialised countries, causes more years of disability than any other health condition and is the second most frequent reason for absence from work.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is pain that has lasted for more than 12&#x02005;weeks. It causes considerable suffering to the individual and is a major financial burden on the National Health Service (NHS) and wider society. UK healthcare costs are &#x000a3;1.6 billion annually,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> and CLBP is responsible for 80% of this cost.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p><p>Physiotherapy is a common treatment for CLBP, with 1.26 million patients referred to NHS physiotherapists at a cost of &#x000a3;150 million per annum.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Several forms of physiotherapy are recommended for CLBP, including exercises, manual therapy and back classes.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> The type of physiotherapy delivered varies considerably in duration and content, and there is little consensus about the most appropriate and cost-effective treatment.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Many trials show no clear superiority for any treatment, with the majority leading to no more than modest improvement in pain and disability outcomes.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> As a result, patients are often overtreated, placing high demands on physiotherapy services and delaying active self-management. This highlights the need to develop and test novel treatments for patients with CLBP.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p><p>CLBP is best suited to a biopsychosocial model of care<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> and a cognitive behavioural approach to treatment.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Cognitive&#x02013;behavioural therapy (CBT) has a good evidence base for the treatment of chronic pain.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13&#x02013;15</xref> A Cochrane review concluded that further general randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of CBT for chronic pain were not required.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Instead, studies identifying the specific components of CBT and attempting to understand which underlying processes were successful were recommended. The Chartered Society of Physiotherapy recognises that CBT can fall within a physiotherapist's scope of practice.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> However, CBT-based treatments delivered by physiotherapists have only produced moderate improvements in CLBP-related disability,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>
<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> and many physiotherapists do not feel adequately trained to use psychological techniques effectively.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> There is potential for enhancing effectiveness through greater focus on competency, but it remains unclear how to best implement cognitive and behavioural approaches during physiotherapy interventions.</p><p>One promising theory-based approach to chronic pain is a form of CBT called Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT).<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>
<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> ACT has been shown to have positive effects in chronic pain,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>
<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> and meta-analyses of ACT for chronic pain showed improvements in depression, anxiety, pain intensity, physical functioning and quality of life (QoL).<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>
<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> ACT aims to increase psychological flexibility and focuses on improving function rather than reducing pain. It has good maintenance of treatment effects up to 3&#x02005;years post treatment,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> important in a chronic relapsing and remitting condition such as CLBP. In all published studies to date, ACT has been delivered by psychologists or within multidisciplinary teams; however, psychology is a limited resource and most patients with CLBP are seen by physiotherapists. A recent trial of ACT for CLBP delivered by psychologists found that patients referred for physiotherapy were somewhat resistant to seeing a psychologist and consequently has recommended combining ACT with physiotherapy.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> A qualitative study investigated potential barriers and facilitators to embedding ACT within a physiotherapist-led pain rehabilitation programme. Findings suggested this presented challenges and opportunities but was a positive experience overall if extra support was provided.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></p><p>We have developed a brief physiotherapist-delivered treatment, guided by principles of ACT, Physiotherapy informed by Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (PACT), consisting of two face-to-face sessions plus a follow-up telephone call. A small proof-of-concept feasibility study demonstrated the acceptability of the intervention for patients, and recruitment to a larger trial was achievable.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> This protocol describes a phase II efficacy RCT using a two-armed, parallel-group design to assess the efficacy of PACT for improving function at 3&#x02005;months in individuals with CLBP, in comparison with usual physiotherapy treatment. Across three NHS trusts (including six hospital centres), 240 people with CLBP will be individually randomised to PACT or usual physiotherapy care (UC). We hypothesise that the group receiving PACT will have improved self-reported functioning at the primary end point of 3-month follow-up compared with UC. The PACT trial is funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Research for Patient Benefit programme, reference number PB-PG-1112-29055.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods and analysis</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Main research question</title><p>What is the efficacy of PACT for improving functioning in patients with CLBP?</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Research objectives</title><sec id="s2b1"><title>Primary objectives</title><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of PACT on the primary end point of functioning at 3-month follow-up.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec id="s2b2"><title>Secondary objectives</title><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>To assess whether PACT has a positive impact on secondary outcomes: QoL and function in various domains, process variables such as acceptance and committed action, mood, self-efficacy and pain compared with UC at 3-month and 12-month follow-up.</p></list-item><list-item><p>To investigate optimal ways of training physiotherapists to work in extended roles and develop a PACT training package for use in a definitive multicentre trial.</p></list-item><list-item><p>To pilot methods and instruments needed to estimate cost-effectiveness in a future phase III trial from a health service and societal perspective.</p></list-item><list-item><p>To assess the acceptability of the intervention and training for patients and clinicians via nested qualitative studies.</p></list-item><list-item><p>To investigate hypothesised processes of clinical improvement following PACT, including predictors and moderators of outcome, and treatment fidelity.</p></list-item></list></sec></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Design</title><p>A phase II, assessor-blind, multicentre, two-armed, parallel-group RCT.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Method</title><p>A total of 240 patients with CLBP will be individually randomised to PACT or UC.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Setting</title><p>Participants will be recruited from secondary care physiotherapy clinics in two NHS Foundation Hospital trusts in London (Guy's and St Thomas' and King&#x02019;s College Hospital) and one in the South East of England (Ashford and St Peter's), UK.

PACT alters the content of physiotherapy treatment and reconfigures it so that it is delivered in fewer but longer sessions, although the total contact time is similar to the average amount of time patients with CLBP receive as part of usual physiotherapy treatment as reported in two UK RCTs for CLBP, where usual physiotherapy was used as the control arm.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>
<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Two 60-min sessions are designed to allow adequate time to do an initial physical assessment and provide feedback, create value-based goals, provide individualised physical exercises and teach simple psychological skills to promote psychological flexibility, and to address facilitators and barriers to self-management. The booster phone call promotes self-management by giving patients a chance to feedback progress and gain support with any ongoing issues they may have. PACT thus aims to directly reduce avoidance and promote openness, to build present-focused awareness, and coordinate greater engagement in goal-oriented and value-based activity (see <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="bx1">box 1</xref> below). The face-to-face intervention will be supported by a patient manual individualised to patient needs. Patients randomised to PACT will be given their patient manual during their first session.

Physiotherapists will be identified by their managers and invited to volunteer to take part in the study. The physiotherapist will then be sent information about the PACT study and be invited to meet the study team to discuss their participation. Training will be provided by LM, a clinical psychologist and expert in ACT, with the assistance of EG, a health psychologist, and DC, a physiotherapist, before the start of recruitment. Group face-to-face training including experiential exercises and role play will last 2&#x02005;days and will be supported by a manual. The manual consists of an introduction to ACT and promoting behaviour change; information about the trial; strategies, metaphors and skills to enable PACT delivery; detailed session plans (see <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="bx1">box 1</xref>); explanation of competency and fidelity, including the use of supervision and a reflexive diary. Obstacles to therapist and patient engagement and progress will be discussed, as well as strategies for dealing with these eventualities. The trial protocol will be reviewed, including recording the timing and length of sessions, any deviations from protocol including missed sessions or dropout, and confidential storage of audio recordings. A training package will be further developed through feedback forms filled in at the end of the group face-to-face training and via interviews with all trained physiotherapists as part of this study, to enable its use in a larger phase III trial if PACT is successful. Each physiotherapist will practise delivering PACT and receive at least two sessions of individual supervision to ensure adequate competency to commence treatment. As PACT is a novel treatment, we will assess competency qualitatively through the training and initial supervision process, which will include listening to audiotaped sessions and observing role play. Physiotherapists will also be asked to report back on experiences with practice patients before they start the trial. If a physiotherapist is not deemed competent to begin delivery after two individual sessions of supervision, they will be offered more sessions until a satisfactory level of competency is observed. We will continue to assess competency throughout the trial on a monthly basis. It is assumed competency will improve during the course of delivery as skills are enhanced through practice and supervision. Trial physiotherapists will attend monthly supervision meetings with supervisors (LM, EG and DC), to maintain skills and receive support. Regular supervision will ensure that the physiotherapists adhere to the trial protocol and that the quality of the intervention is maintained. Fidelity to the treatment protocol will also be enhanced by the use of session checklists and ratings of audio tapes from the trial with feedback provided to clinicians.</p></sec><sec id="s2i"><title>Treatment fidelity</title><p>All PACT sessions will be audio-recorded for the purpose of assessing treatment fidelity. These will be used for supervision during the study and to check fidelity throughout the trial. Supervisors will listen to one tape per physiotherapist per month. Once the trial has ended, a subset of the audio recordings will be analysed for overall fidelity. These fidelity checks will be undertaken via assessment of a sample of audio recordings of PACT sessions, across sites and physiotherapists, undertaken by two independent researchers. A modified fidelity measure will be developed based on the Plumb and Vilardaga<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> paper&#x000a0;and the ACT for Chronic Pain Adherence Rating Scale used in the Optimised Behavioural Intervention trial.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> At least two sessions from every physiotherapist will be rated in terms of adherence to the manual and checklist. The therapeutic alliance between physiotherapists and participants will also be rated using a therapy process scale<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> employed in previous RCTs of treatments for chronic fatigue and a weight loss intervention in primary care.</p><sec id="s2i1"><title>Usual care</title><p>Participants randomised to UC will receive any treatment considered suitable by their treating physiotherapist. Treatment may include any type of individual physiotherapy and/or back classes, for example, exercises, manual therapy, hydrotherapy and back schools. Consistent with the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines for complex interventions,<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> we will collect data on volume (duration and frequency of sessions) and components (eg, one-to-one treatment vs group exercise class) of treatment received by participants in the UC arm, and we plan to report and publish these essential details of the control condition with trial results.</p><p>Separate groups of clinicians will deliver PACT and UC to avoid contamination. We will explicitly inform PACT physiotherapists about the risks and consequences of contamination during training and supervision and will ask that they do not share material or ideas with their colleagues during the treatment delivery period. In addition, we will ensure that all PACT sessions are conducted in private rooms to eliminate the possibility of UC physiotherapists overhearing what is being provided in the novel treatment arm.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2j"><title>Participant identification and recruitment</title><p>In total, 240 patients will be recruited, 120 per treatment arm, over an 18-month period. Patients will be recruited from six secondary care physiotherapy clinics in London and the South East of England. Posters advertising the study will be placed in relevant physiotherapy clinics in order to inform patients and clinicians about the study. Potential participants referred to outpatient physiotherapy by their general practitioner (GP) or consultant will be identified by clinical physiotherapists from each hospital centre at their initial triage sessions, provided with written and verbal information about the PACT trial, and invited to participate. Participants who consent to be contacted will be referred to the research associates (RAs) for full eligibility screening, conducted by telephone. All patients who undergo screening will be recorded anonymously on a screening database associated with the study by the RAs. If the patient is suitable, the RA will then invite them to complete consent forms and baseline measures either at home online, via postal questionnaires or in person at the clinic (<xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2016011548TB1">table 1</xref>). GPs will be notified in writing of their patient's participation. Patients will be informed that they can withdraw from the study at any time without giving a reason and that this will not affect the treatment they receive in any way.

All outcomes are patient reported and collected via the internet following automated email reminders, reducing the risk of unblinding the assessors. Locked codes will be used for treatment allocation, and the trial statistician will analyse the data blind.</p></sec><sec id="s2n"><title>Data collection</title><p>Participant screening data will be collected by telephone and entered into the database by the RAs. Baseline, 3-month and 12-month follow-up data will be collected through self-report questionnaires. The RAs, blind to treatment allocation, will administer questionnaires and conduct data entry. Treatment allocation will not be included on the questionnaires. Research data will be entered onto the MedSciNet database system, a regulatory compliant database that has been enabled for online collection of patient-reported outcome measures (PROMS). Participants will be given a unique username and password to log into the online database and complete consent and measures at each time point. Their data will be identified by a unique identification number and will be kept separate from any personal identifying data to maintain confidentiality. Baseline and outcome data will be patient self-completed at home (either online or via postal questionnaires), thus avoiding any influence of the study team on the responses and reducing bias. PACT physiotherapists will have access to a unique database on the MedSciNet system to record details of who provided PACT and UC sessions, the number of sessions attended and any dropouts, as well as the number and type of UC treatment sessions attended.</p></sec><sec id="s2o"><title>Outcome measures</title><p><italic>Time points:</italic> Assessments will be completed at baseline (immediately pre-randomisation), and 3&#x02005;months and 12&#x02005;months post randomisation by all participants. All time points will be taken into account during analysis, but the primary efficacy end point is 3-month follow-up. In order to justify treatment costs, clinically significant treatment effects need to be maintained over time, and this is particularly important in a chronic relapsing and remitting condition such as CLBP, so maintenance of any treatment effects will be assessed at 12&#x02005;months. The RAs will be employed to coordinate the trial and collect baseline and follow-up data. All participants will be sent (emailed and posted) follow-up questionnaires by the RAs at 3 and 12&#x02005;months. Participants not returning questionnaires within 1&#x02005;week will receive a reminder email, telephone call and text in 3-day intervals. One week after that, if no data have been returned, the RAs will ring the participant to ask if they can collect primary outcome data over the telephone.</p></sec><sec id="s2p"><title>Baseline measures</title><p>Participants will complete a baseline assessment questionnaire which includes the validated scales detailed below, plus demographic data to establish sociodemographic characteristics of participants as follows: age, sex, height, weight, self-reported ethnicity, education level, employment and benefit status, diagnosis and history of any medical condition if available.</p><sec id="s2p1"><title>Primary outcome: the RMDQ</title><p>Patient-reported disability is recommended as a core outcome measure in low back pain<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> and chronic pain trials.<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref> The Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ)<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> is a 24-item questionnaire assessing self-reported functioning and disability due to CLBP, ranging from 0 (no disability) to 24 (maximum disability).

The economic burden of CLBP is considerable from an NHS and patient perspective. A resource use questionnaire which identifies key cost drivers (NHS and non-NHS) will be developed based on previous studies. This will then be piloted to ensure completion rates, avoid redundant questions and to identify any additional resource use items sensitive to change in a CLBP population.<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref> This pilot study will compare the validity and sensitivity of the EQ-5D-5L (the most recent version of the EQ-5D) and the SF-6D for use in economic evaluations of cognitively enhanced physiotherapy for CLBP.</p></sec><sec id="s2p6"><title>Adherence to PACT treatment</title><p>Patients' adherence to PACT treatment will be recorded by trial physiotherapists on a database.

The aim of these methods will be to assess patients' views of the acceptability of PACT, to provide insight into the quantitative results and to explore processes of change. Semistructured face-to-face interviews will be conducted with up to 25 participants (sampled purposively to encompass a mix of gender, age, recruitment site and baseline RMDQ scores) following their 3-month follow-up assessment (RCT outcome primary end point). Interviews will be transcribed verbatim and analysed using thematic analysis<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref> to generate the key themes. Analysis will commence after the first interview in an iterative process, allowing early insights to be explored more fully in later interviews and topic guides to be amended as necessary.

Between-group differences (treatment efficacy) will be estimated for the primary outcome RMDQ at the postintervention 3-month and 12-month follow-up assessments using linear mixed-effects models. Random effects for the intercept and time will be included in the model. Treatment group, time and a treatment by time interaction term will be included as covariates to allow estimates of treatment effect at each time point to be calculated. In addition, a random effect for physiotherapist will be included to account for the partial clustering within physiotherapists in the intervention arm. Estimation of the treatment effects on the secondary and process outcomes will employ the same method as the primary efficacy analysis. All outcome variables are continuous.</p><p>Planned secondary analysis will be performed to determine whether the treatment effect occurs via changes in the process variables as hypothesised (pain acceptance and committed action). Specifically, the proportion of the treatment effect for disability (RMDQ), QoL (WSAS) and mood (PHQ-9 and GAD-7) at each follow-up that is mediated by the treatment effect on the process variables at 3&#x02005;months will be determined. This will be estimated by the product of coefficients method using bootstrapped SEs.<xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref> This analysis will be undertaken irrespective of achieving the statistical significance. Where the treatment effect is non-significant, additional further analysis will be conducted to determine the role of post-randomisation effect modifiers in the negative result (adherence, treatment fidelity and therapeutic alliance). For example, should there be considerable non-adherence to the treatment, the efficacy of the treatment for those who adhere to treatment will also be estimated in terms of the complier average causal effect (CACE).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Ethical issues</title><p>The trial will be conducted in accordance with current guidelines for ethical research conduct and subject to full Research Ethics Committee (REC) approval (National Research Ethics Committee South Central&#x02014;Berkshire; 14/SC/0277), including any provisions of site-specific assessment, and local research and development approval. It will comply with the International Conference for Harmonisation of Good Clinical Practice (ICH GCP) guidelines and the Research Governance Framework for Health and Social Care. The trial is registered on a trial registry (ISRCTN95392287) and the lead site (Guy's &#x00026; St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust; GSTT) will audit this project annually to ensure compliance with the necessary legislation.</p><p>All patients in the trial will benefit from receiving physiotherapy for their CLBP. This is a very low-risk study as both treatments are non-invasive and delivered by appropriately qualified physiotherapists. Patients attending PACT sessions should visit hospital less often and will receive additional resources to aid self-management of their condition, possibly reducing its impact on participants' lives. This may lead to benefits for society and the NHS, such as reduced healthcare usage and less time off work, which is important in such a widespread and costly condition. The disadvantage of taking part is the additional time spent completing the questionnaires and for some patients an interview. These should not take more than 60&#x02005;min in total to complete. Potential participants will be fully informed of the trial procedures before entering the study via a patient information sheet.</p><sec id="s3a1"><title>Informed consent</title><p>Potential participants will be identified by clinical physiotherapists from each hospital centre, informed about the RCT in writing and invited to participate. The physiotherapist will explain that participation is completely voluntary and that they are free to refuse involvement. They will be given at least 24&#x02005;hours to consider whether they would like to participate. The RAs will then contact them to see if they are interested in participating and answer any questions about the study, prior to conducting the screening process and signing the consent form.</p></sec><sec id="s3a2"><title>Fair access</title><p>Any adult patient referred to physiotherapy with low back pain lasting over 12&#x02005;weeks and good English will be eligible for the trial. Participants will be able to complete measures online, by post or in person, so they should not be disadvantaged if they do not have access to the internet.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Dissemination</title><p>The results of this study will be communicated to participants at the end of the study and disseminated via peer-reviewed publications, patient interest groups and conference presentations. The results will enable clinicians, patients and health service managers to make informed decisions regarding the efficacy of PACT for patients with CLBP. However, further studies will be necessary to demonstrate the generalisability of the findings beyond physiotherapy services in London and the South East, as well its effectiveness and cost-effectiveness.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Service user involvement</title><p>CLBP patients have been involved in the design of the PACT trial and service users have contributed to the development of the patient guide. Participants from the feasibility study have also provided input and feedback on the proposals for this RCT. One of them is now the patient and public involvement (PPI) representative for this study, providing ongoing input (informal feedback and participating in TSC meetings) to ensure it addresses issues relevant to users.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Research governance</title><p>This study will be conducted in accordance with the ICH GCP guidelines and the Research Governance Framework for Health and Social Care. King's College London is the sponsor of the RCT.</p><p>The TSC will meet every 6&#x02005;months to oversee the trial procedures and ensure good conduct of the study. The TSC has an independent chair and two independent members plus a PPI representative. The trial management team (EG, DC, LM and the RAs) will hold monthly meetings to ensure the smooth running of the trial. The RAs will circulate a monthly newsletter to stakeholders to review progress relative to the project plan and highlight any issues that need to be addressed. Members of the team will consult each other immediately by email and/or phone about any issues that arise between meetings.</p></sec><sec id="s3e"><title>Monitoring and auditing</title><p>The study will be monitored and audited in accordance with King's College London procedures. All trial-related documents will be made available on request for monitoring and audit by King's College London, trial NHS partners, the REC and other licencing bodies.</p></sec><sec id="s3f"><title>Assessment of safety</title><p>All patients will be assessed and treated by an experienced grade 6 or 7 physiotherapist.</p><sec id="s3f1"><title>Adverse events</title><p>Any adverse events will be recorded by the treating physiotherapist in the clinical notes and reported to the RA and chief investigator immediately via email. Patients will also be offered the opportunity to report any adverse events on the follow-up questionnaires. If a patient becomes distressed during treatment, then the PACT physiotherapists will be adequately trained to deal with this or to identify a need for more input/support and refer them for an appropriate assessment. There will be clinical supervisors available at each research site if needed, and experienced psychologists will supervise physiotherapists delivering PACT on a monthly basis.</p></sec><sec id="s3f2"><title>Serious adverse events</title><p>An adverse event is defined as serious if it results in an outcome which is life-changing/threatening, disabling or incapacitating. Any serious adverse events that are recorded will be immediately referred to the chief investigator, who will assess whether it is an adverse reaction that is classed as serious, whether it could have been caused by the intervention and whether it is unexpected. Any serious adverse reactions will be reported to the TSC for monitoring and advice. They will advise whether the participant should be withdrawn from either their randomised treatment or from the trial. Arrangements will be made by the trial team for further assessment and management as agreed with the relevant authorities, GP and participant. A report of the outcome will be provided to the TSC within 1&#x02005;month.</p></sec><sec id="s3f3"><title>Stopping rules</title><p>The trial may be stopped prematurely by the sponsor or chief investigator on the basis of new safety information or for other reasons given by the TSC, regulatory authority or ethics committee concerned. The trial may be halted on the advice of the TSC if recruitment rates are substantially below expected levels with no possibility of remedial action or if there are serious adverse reactions attributable to the trial which mean it is unsafe to continue. If the study is terminated prematurely, active participants will be informed and no further participant data will be collected.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3g"><title>Data storage</title><p>Data will be collected and retained in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998. The Data Protection Policy of King's College London will be complied with. The responses to questionnaires will be stored in an anonymised form on a password-protected university computer. The anonymised paper questionnaires will be stored in a locked filing cabinet at Guy's Campus, King's College London.

The PACT study RCT will assess the feasibility and acceptability of delivering a novel psychologically informed physiotherapy intervention with staff and patients. It is the first trial to test the efficacy of an ACT-informed, physiotherapist-delivered intervention for CLBP. It is noted that further studies will be necessary to demonstrate the generalisability of the findings beyond physiotherapy services in London and the South East, as well its effectiveness and cost-effectiveness.</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> EG, LM, SN, RM-M, DS, MB, JP and DC were involved in the design of the study and were coapplicants for funding.
