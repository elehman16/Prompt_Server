This spike in incidence coincides with a life stage characterised by psychological vulnerability as young people strive to attain numerous, critical developmental milestones. The distress young people experience after cancer treatment seriously jeopardises their ability to move into well-functioning adulthood.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>This article presents the protocol of the Recapture Life study, a phase II three-arm randomised controlled trial designed to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of a new intervention in reducing distress and improving quality of life for adolescent and young adult cancer survivors. The novel intervention, &#x0201c;ReCaPTure LiFe&#x0201d; will be compared to a both a wait-list, and a peer-support group control. Ninety young people aged 15&#x02013;25 years who have completed cancer treatment in the past 1&#x02013;6 months will be recruited from hospitals around Australia. Those randomised to receive Recapture Life will participate in six, weekly, 90-minute online group sessions led by a psychologist, involving peer-discussion around cognitive-behavioural coping skills (including: behavioural activation, thought challenging, communication and assertiveness skills training, problem-solving and goal-setting). Participants randomised to the peer-support group control will receive non-directive peer support delivered in an identical manner. Participants will complete psychosocial measures at baseline, post-intervention, and 12-months post-intervention. The primary outcome will be quality of life. Secondary outcomes will include depression, anxiety, stress, family functioning, coping, and cancer-related identity.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This article reviews the empirical rationale for using group-based, online cognitive-behavioural therapy in young people after cancer treatment. The potential challenges of delivering skills-based programs in an online modality are highlighted, and the role of both peer and caregiver support in enhancing the effectiveness of this skills-based intervention is also discussed. The innovative videoconferencing delivery method Recapture Life uses has the potential to address the geographic and psychological isolation of adolescents and young adults as they move toward cancer survivorship. It is expected that teaching AYAs coping skills as they resume their normal lives after cancer may have long-term implications for their quality of life.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>ACTRN12610000717055</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Adolescent and young adult</kwd><kwd>AYA</kwd><kwd>Cancer</kwd><kwd>Survivorship</kwd><kwd>Intervention study</kwd><kwd>Randomised-controlled trial</kwd><kwd>Psychological adaptation</kwd><kwd>Quality of life</kwd><kwd>Cognitive-behavioural therapy</kwd><kwd>Internet</kwd><kwd>Online</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><sec><title>The mental health burden of cancer in adolescents and young adults</title><p>Cancer is 2.9 times more likely to be diagnosed in people aged 15&#x02013;29 years than during the first 15 years of life 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Improvements in medical treatments mean that there is now a growing population of survivors in the adolescent and young adult (AYA) age range 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. As the peak period for the onset of mental health problems coincides with the AYA period 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], a cancer diagnosis during these years can have a far-reaching impact. Well beyond treatment completion, cancer may disrupt AYAs&#x02019; ability to attain the individual and interpersonal skills that are necessary to function well as they mature 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Failing to achieve these critical milestones places young people at a significant risk for poor adaptation within their future adult roles 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>Although most AYAs will adapt well into long-term cancer survivorship 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], as a group they experience more complex, more severe, and longer-lasting distress than do children or adults with similar diagnoses 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. This distress tends to be worse after cancer treatment completion than at any other stage of their cancer trajectory 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Among long-term survivors of adolescent cancer, the prevalence of clinical disorders such as anxiety, depression, or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has been shown to be as high as 24.3%, with subclinical distress also prevalent (22.4%) 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Adolescent cancer survivors also report having a worse quality of life (QoL) than both survivors of childhood cancer 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], or their age-matched healthy peers 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Without intervention, these mental health issues pose a significant threat to survivors&#x02019; longer term psychological adjustment.</p><p>Evidence-based, age-appropriate psychosocial support for surviving AYA cancer patients is therefore strongly indicated 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Despite this, recent reports indicate that young people living with cancer receive little post-treatment support from the hospital environment, and find supportive care resources in community settings difficult to locate and access 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Consequently, AYAs report experiencing high levels of unmet needs, and subsequently, higher levels of distress 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. This is despite the existence of evidence-based psychological therapies that could be used to assist AYAs&#x02019; positive transition to survivorship.</p></sec><sec><title>Efficacy of cognitive-behavioural therapy for adolescents and young adults</title><p>Cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) is a &#x02018;talking therapy&#x02019; that involves training the client to recognise, and change, maladaptive thinking styles 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Extensive evidence supports the efficacy of CBT in treating both anxiety 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] and depression 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] in non-cancer affected adolescents. CBT is also efficacious in preventing the development of anxiety and depression among young people who show sub-clinical distress; one meta-analysis of 130 studies showed that such programs typically achieve at least moderate sized effects 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><p>As yet, no studies have examined the efficacy of group-based CBT in a population of AYAs with cancer. Pilot data suggests, however, that AYAs with cancer respond positively to CBT skills and are enthusiastic to incorporate these skills into their daily life 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Consistent with this, one recent review of interventions for AYAs with chronic illnesses (including cancer) found that multi-session, skills-based interventions can be highly effective in treating emotional or behavioural problems in this age group, yielding medium to large effect sizes 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Together, these data recommend CBT as a promising, yet untested, form of psychological intervention in AYAs living with cancer.</p></sec><sec><title>The importance of therapy modality: group-based peer support and &#x02018;e-therapy&#x02019; in adolescents and young adults</title><p>Peer support groups (PSGs) for cancer patients and survivors remain the most prevalent form of psychological support available 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. However, as a form of psychological support, their effects are largely unquantified; the few that have been formally evaluated tend to show small/mixed effects among AYAs 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Despite this, PSGs may address the sense of isolation and developmental disconnection with same-aged peers created by their small, dispersed numbers while on treatment 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Indeed, AYAs are highly receptive to PSGs as a form of intervention 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. The extent to which peer discussion drives positive adaptation among AYAs is therefore important to assess.</p><p>AYAs&#x02019; geographic and demographic isolation demands innovative solutions to facilitate supportive, peer-based interactions. Healthy AYAs and those living with cancer are heavy users of the internet (reporting 1&#x02013;3 hours daily use), and already seek and receive many of their peer interactions online 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Computer-based &#x02018;e-therapies&#x02019; delivered online have been hailed as a new way to overcome issues of equity in accessibility and the stigma associated with seeking help from mental health professionals for young people 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Computer-based CBT has demonstrated moderate to very large effects in treating anxiety and mood disorders among adults 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] and also appears efficacious among children and adolescents 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. It follows, then, that CBT delivered online to AYAs recovering from cancer may be effective.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>The Recapture Life-AYA study is a multi-site, phase II randomised controlled trial (RCT) to assess the feasibility and efficacy of a new, online, CBT-based intervention for AYAs after cancer treatment. AYAs aged 15&#x02013;25 years at treatment completion will be recruited and randomised to one of three treatment arms: Recapture Life-AYA, a peer-support group (PSG) control, and a six week waitlist control group. The novel intervention, named <bold>&#x02018;ReCaPTure LiFe-AYA&#x02019;</bold> (<bold><underline>R</underline></bold>esilience and <bold><underline>C</underline></bold>oping skills for young <bold><underline>P</underline></bold>eople and their families <bold><underline>T</underline></bold>o <bold><underline>L</underline></bold>ive well <bold><underline>F</underline></bold>ollowing cancer-<bold><underline>A</underline></bold>dolescent and <bold><underline>Y</underline></bold>oung <bold><underline>A</underline></bold>dult version), is delivered to groups of 3&#x02013;5 AYAs by a psychologist in six, weekly online sessions, shortly after cancer treatment completion. The Recapture Life-AYA program is part of the larger Recapture Life program, which includes a Recapture Life-Parents/Carers program for caregivers of recently off-treatment paediatric cancer patients.</p><p>This study employs a 3 (treatment condition) x 3 (assessment point) factorial design. All participants will be assessed using a battery of measures at baseline (T1: recruitment), post-treatment (T2: seven weeks after T1) and 12 months following participation in Recapture Life-AYA or the PSG control (T3). These measures will include a measure of QoL, as well as measures assessing AYAs&#x02019; anxiety, depression, and family functioning.</p><sec><title>Study aims and hypotheses</title><p>This phase II randomised controlled trial (RCT) aims to assess:</p><p>1. The efficacy of Recapture Life-AYA in improving QoL in AYA cancer survivors. In addition to assessing QoL (the primary study outcome), secondary outcomes assessed will include depression, anxiety and family functioning.</p><p>2. The feasibility of implementing Recapture Life-AYA Australia-wide, including the recruitment procedure, response/attrition rates and cost.</p><p>We hypothesise that shortly after intervention, and at the 12 month follow up:</p><p>1. Both the PSG control and Recapture Life-AYA groups will show improved QoL and other secondary psychological outcomes compared with the waitlist control.</p><p>2. Recapture Life-AYA will improve participants&#x02019; QoL, depression, anxiety, and family functioning to a greater extent than will the PSG control group.</p><p>3. Participation in Recapture Life-AYA will prove feasible and economical.</p></sec><sec><title>Participants</title><p>This study will recruit 90 AYA participants from hospitals across Australia in the first 1&#x02013;6 months after treatment completion. AYAs will also have the option of inviting a support person to receive information and updates through the Recapture Life-AYA study, however as this is optional no &#x02018;target&#x02019; sample size of support persons has been set. The AYA sample size will allow differences of a medium to large effect size (<italic>d</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.65, the difference in change from T1 to T2 for any pair of groups, standardised on the pooled within-group standard deviation) on the primary outcome variable (QoL) to be detected with a power of 80% at a significance level of 0.05 (two-tailed). This effect size is clinically significant 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>] and is based on other RCTs of similar interventions for AYAs with chronic illness 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. It is anticipated that approximately 220 patients will need to be approached to achieve a final sample of 90 participants (assuming a response rate of 50% and attrition rate of 20%, based on previous interventions with AYA) 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>].</p><sec><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p>Eligible AYAs will: i) have finished cancer treatment for a primary or secondary/relapsed cancer with curative intent in the preceding 1&#x02013;6 months; ii) be aged between 15&#x02013;25 years (inclusive); iii) be able to read English; iv) be able to provide the name and contact details of a trusted health professional (e.g., local general practitioner, family doctor or hospital social worker); and v) be able to access the Internet in a private location (see also <italic>Access Considerations</italic> section below).</p><p>AYAs may also choose to invite a support person (a parent/caregiver, or spouse/partner) to take part in the study, although this is not a requirement of participation.</p></sec><sec><title>Exclusion criteria</title><p>AYAs will be excluded if during the initial intake interview they: i) have insufficient English language skills to complete the interview; ii) demonstrate extremely severe scores of depression (i.e., score&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;28 on the Depression subscale of the Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scales-Short Form) 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>] and/or endorse serious suicidal intent; or iii) endorse symptoms of psychosis or substance abuse.</p><p>If a participant relapses during the study period, they will be referred back to their treatment center for individual support, as their needs are likely to be difficult to manage in a group setting and can negatively affect others 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. All excluded individuals will be referred to their treating centre for support.</p></sec><sec><title>Access considerations</title><p>Internet access and a suitable computer set-up is a requirement to participate in Recapture Life-AYA. This includes access to a computer/laptop which has a microphone and web-camera, and is located such that the participant will be able to participate in the sessions comfortably and in a private and uninterrupted capacity once per week for six weeks. AYAs without access to these resources will be able to borrow a laptop, web-camera, microphone and/or wireless internet connection device for the duration of the study (the costs of which are covered by a project grant). The equipment and internet needs of all AYA participants will be assessed at the initial telephone intake interview, and access issues managed on a case-by-case basis.</p></sec><sec><title>Participant recruitment</title><p>Potential participants aged &#x02265;16 years will be mailed a personalised invitation letter, consent form and opt-in card by their oncologist. Parental consent to approach participants &#x0003c;16 years will be sought. Nominated support persons given the study information by their AYA child/partner may also choose to opt in by returning the consent form. The research assistant will contact all AYA participants who opt in to the study to request that participants sign and return a written contract agreeing to use the provided equipment solely for study purposes and to address internet access issues.</p><p>Recruitment will occur in 3x12 week blocks, such that ~80 patients who have completed treatment in the preceding 1&#x02013;6 months will be invited 4 weeks prior to Week 1 of each block. This recruitment window was chosen to maximise the benefit to participants, by delivering the coping skills intervention early in survivorship. Given the assumed response and attrition rates (see above), it is envisaged that 3 iterations (i.e. 3x12 week blocks), each attracting ~40 AYA opt-ins, will be required to achieve the target sample. This means that 3 mail outs (approaching ~80 patients at a time) will occur for the study during 2012. This design ensures the standardisation of time since treatment completion across arms. All fully consented participants will be telephoned by the study co-ordinator one week prior to Week 1 to administer the Psychosocial Adjustment to Illness Scale (PAIS; T1 assessment). Participants will also complete the first online questionnaire at this time. (See Figure

A flexible biased urn method of randomization, will be used, which adapts to the degree of imbalance between groups in a dynamic manner over the trial 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. This method is superior to standard stratification in balancing groups across multiple covariates 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>] whilst also being a suitable method when groups remain small 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. This minimization will be based on four factors: (i) gender (male/female), (ii) severity of distress as measured by the Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale-Short Form (DASS-21) intake interview (see below), (iii) time since treatment, classified into two groups, and (iv) degree of rural/remoteness as assessed by the Accessibility/Remoteness Index of Australia 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>].

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. Based on extensive research in AYAs with cancer, the ARM conceptualises resilience in young people as a multifaceted process, involving the interaction of individual, family and social-level risk and protective factors to determine AYAs level of resilience, and ultimately their quality of life. Additional file 
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Table S1 identifies the key components of this model and the way in which these processes are targeted in Recapture Life. Several adaptive processes are implicated by this model including AYAs&#x02019; ability to: enact positive coping behaviours, negotiate uncertainty in illness and cancer-related distress, reappraise the experience in order to derive adaptive meaning from it, and seek and maintain support from family and friends. To our knowledge, only one other published intervention has utilised this framework in AYAs 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>], however this music therapy intervention is delivered individually to AYAs receiving stem-cell transplants whilst on treatment. As such, this program may not offer the skill-building and peer support that we hypothesise are crucial to promote adaptation into survivorship. In addressing these component processes of resilience after cancer, our manualised program derives its core mechanisms of change from CBT techniques.</p><p>The primary goals of the Recapture Life-AYA intervention are to improve QoL, reduce distress and facilitate healthy coping in young cancer survivors. Participants randomised to Recapture Life-AYA will participate in six, weekly, 90-minute sessions facilitated by a psychologist. Each group will comprise the psychologist plus a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 5 AYAs with mixed diagnoses and genders, separated into two age groups: 15&#x02013;17 and 18&#x02013;25 years. Each Recapture Life-AYA module applies CBT techniques to the key domains of concern identified by our team&#x02019;s previous work 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>] (See Additional file 
<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>: Table S2).</p><p>Sessions will be delivered through video-conferencing software on the Internet (WebEx, by Cisco). WebEx videoconferencing requires a computer with standard browser, a high-speed internet connection, and a webcam. WebEx is a secure, password-protected video-conferencing program that allows &#x02264;6 participants to be seen on the screen simultaneously, much like Skype<sup>TM</sup>. Participants will also receive a reminder SMS on their cellular phone 24 hours before their session, which will also serve as their reminder to complete the emotion thermometers tool and homework compliance scale (see <italic>Assessments</italic> section).</p><p>Nominated support-person participants receive a workbook describing the program and one group-based 2-hour online session which includes family communication training. Support persons associated with AYAs randomly allocated to receive the Recapture Life-AYA intervention will additionally receive a weekly psycho-educational email, which includes a general overview of some of the skills learnt by the AYAs. These updates are not specific to the individual participant and include examples of (i) ways the support person can support the AYA, and (ii) suggestions for communicating about the weekly topic.</p></sec><sec><title>Peer-support group (active control)</title><p>The PSG control is delivered in an identical manner to Recapture Life-AYA (via WebEx, 3&#x02013;5 participants/group, with the same facilitator, divided into 2 age groups), frequency of contact (six weekly 90-minute sessions), and the availability of peer-based group discussion. Like Recapture Life-AYA, it also involves age-appropriate supportive counseling to normalise the range of AYA experiences

During each session, AYAs are encouraged to exchange information about a nominated topic (closely match those addressed in Recapture Life-AYA, e.g. &#x02018;relationships&#x02019;). The key distinction between Recapture Life-AYA and the PSG control is that the PSG does not include directive, structured teaching of specific, CBT-based coping skills. The PSG also does not include the support-person element where they receive psychoeducation and weekly emails alongside the AYA online sessions.

The intake interview will also serve to build rapport with the psychologist, by providing AYAs the opportunity to discuss their cancer experiences, current needs, and personal goals in participating in the study.</p><p>Participants will then be randomly allocated to one of the three study arms. The research assistant will send a hired (insured) laptop to any participants who do not have computer access two weeks before the commencement of each online group. This process will ensure equity (all participants will have access to identical equipment), minimise technical challenges (required software/hardware will be pre-installed) and will maximise security (security settings will be pre-set by the technical support person). All equipment will be returned after study participation. Participants randomised to the Recapture Life-AYA condition will also receive a written manual summarising the weekly home practice activities.</p><p>During Weeks 1&#x02013;6 of each 12 week block, those allocated to Recapture Life-AYA and the PSG will participate in their allocated intervention. In Week 7, all participants will complete their second assessment (T2). For waitlist controls, this assessment will also serve as their T1 (pre-intervention) assessment. In Week 7, waitlist participants will be randomly allocated to either Recapture Life-AYA or PSG (completed during weeks 7&#x02013;12). Waitlist participants will then complete a second T2 assessment, one week after their intervention.</p><sec><title>Study integrity</title><p>This study is listed on the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12610000717055), and has undergone rigorous multidisciplinary peer-review.

Disease-specific measures often appeal to researchers due to the difficulty ascertaining &#x02018;clinical&#x02019; change in populations that may only be distressed at sub-clinical levels 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>]. However, generic psychological measures facilitate comparison to healthy norms, which is clinically and empirically advantageous 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. As recent reviews have not shown disease-specific measures to provide a systematic advantage in detecting intervention effects 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], the Recapture Life-AYA trial uses both generic and disease-specific indicators of psychosocial functioning.</p><p>Quality of life (QoL) was selected to be the primary psychosocial outcome variable, as this enabled the measurement of specific functional issues specific to early cancer survivorship. The Impact of Cancer Scale (IOCS) 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>] was chosen to measure QoL, and measures aspects of cancer survivorship such as: Life Challenges, Body/Health, Talking With Parents, Personal Growth, Thinking/Memory Problems, Health Literacy, Socializing and Financial Problems. Although this measure has been validated in 18&#x02013;39 year old AYA cancer survivors, its readability and content relevance for the younger AYAs in the Recapture Life-AYA trial was confirmed through assessments pilot testing with consumer representatives aged 15&#x02013;18 years.

AYAs have been acknowledged as the &#x02018;lost tribe&#x02019; or &#x02018;forgotten generation&#x02019; in supportive cancer care 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B83">83</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B84">84</xref>]. Given their documented psychological vulnerabilities, Recapture Life-AYA addresses a critical gap for AYAs living with cancer. The innovative online technology used to deliver Recapture Life-AYA is an important advance, as it enables the provision of evidence-based psychological support to AYAs dispersed across both pediatric and adult hospitals, in metropolitan, rural and remote regions. This is crucial to overcoming both AYAs&#x02019; lack of &#x02018;critical mass&#x02019; as a population 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], as well as the &#x02018;tyranny of distance&#x02019; that impedes adequate post-cancer support more generally in countries with a low population density, such as Australia 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B85">85</xref>].</p><p>A further strength of this study is the inclusion of both an active and a waitlist control group. The waitlist group controls for the possibilities that AYA distress may dissipate in the first weeks after treatment completion and/or that clinical services may change or improve over the recruitment period. However, the additional use of a non-specific treatment arm (the PSG) is now considered gold standard, as this arm holds constant the attention received by participants, amount of treatment contact and human interaction variables (such as clinician warmth and interaction between participants), and controls for participants&#x02019; expectations of receiving some form of treatment 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B86">86</xref>]. This trial therefore allows an assessment of whether an intensive, structured, skills-based intervention such as Recapture Life-AYA confers any benefit in long-term psychological functioning relative to peer support alone. This question has important clinical, as well as economic considerations, as the two strategies have different implications for resources, training and time commitments required.</p><p>In addition, the strict treatment fidelity assessments involved in this trial will enable an examination the relative benefits of a structured, CBT-based intervention when compared with a non-directive, peer support group model. It is possible and likely that although the psychologist facilitator does not teach the same structured, CBT-based coping skills in the PSG, peer-discussion may nevertheless facilitate spontaneous discussion around adaptive coping skills, maladaptive/unhelpful thinking styles, or stress reduction strategies for example. The treatment fidelity assessments, including the coding of a random sample of 15% of sessions for cognitive content, will ensure an examination of the extent to which such skills-based discussion is facilitated, or directed, by the Recapture Life-AYA facilitator, and the proportion of session time spent on discussing adaptive coping strategies. Consequently, although there may be a reasonable degree of content overlap between the PSG and the Recapture Life-AYA groups, the rigorous treatment fidelity processes in this trial will mean that it is still possible to distinguish between the two arms in terms of mechanisms of change. This is critical in order to make recommendations for future intervention design.</p><p>The innovative videoconferencing delivery method used in Recapture life involves inherent challenges. There is growing evidence supporting the promise of this method in treating a number of disorders (e.g., Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder) 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B87">87</xref>]. Evidence suggests that several core aspects of CBT such as cognitive challenging, role-playing and modeling, setting up behavioural experiments and homework assignments, will translate well over videoconferencing methods 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B88">88</xref>]. Further, videoconferencing methods do not appear to diminish therapist competence, adherence, or patient perceptions of rapport or empathy conveyed by the therapist 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B89">89</xref>]. However, as most &#x02018;online therapies&#x02019; are self-guided by the user with either telephone/email-based clinician support 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B90">90</xref>], few manualised treatment programs or best-practice guidelines exist to support the therapist in aspects relating to therapy process and online interaction. This may mean that therapist practice effects occur across the study period, as the therapist gains competency in anticipating, and managing, challenges in the videoconferencing environment.</p><p>One challenge inherent in the design of this study will be to quantify the effect of support person (e.g., parent/caregiver) participation on AYA psychological outcomes. Parents/caregivers may have an important role in assisting AYAs to negotiate the disruption cancer causes in their normal trajectory toward independence 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B91">91</xref>]. Parent inclusion in skills-based programs also appears to increase their likelihood of improving AYA psychological outcomes 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. However, in this trial the decision was made to make parent/support person participation optional, to facilitate and support the autonomy and independence of the AYA participants. This design may result in greater statistical complexity when attempting to delineate the impact of parental/support person involvement in AYA interventions.</p><p>Despite its strengths, the study design also has methodological vulnerabilities. The three-armed design of this trial, while a strength on the one hand, is also likely to increase the time it takes to recruit sufficient participant numbers. In addition, our decision to divide AYA participants into two defined age groups (15&#x02013;18 and 19&#x02013;25 years) may increase the time between recruitment and actual group participation.</p><p>The long-term, 12-month follow-up is another aspect of the study design that, although methodologically important, may add complexities to final data analyses. Participants may differ markedly in terms of the psychosocial support services they receive in this time, and the number of other AYA cancer survivors they come into contact with. Individual differences in terms of additional support services and peer support is a factor that is likely to be important throughout the trial as a whole. All of these factors will require careful monitoring and documentation, and will need to be taken into account in data analyses and interpretation.</p><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Adolescent and young adult cancer survivors are a vulnerable population. Poor adaptation in this group threatens adaptive functioning in adulthood, for years after surviving cancer. Recapture Life-AYA is a preventative program with the potential to avoid many years of mental health problems by equipping AYAs with coping skills to successfully manage the challenges of survivorship. This study trials a new model of healthcare delivery that can extend the reach of support to isolated populations world-wide. If this study demonstrates significant improvements in quality of life, Recapture Life-AYA will be made available for clinical use with AYA cancer survivors across Australia.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>ARM: Adolescent Resilience Model; AYA: Adolescent and young adult; CBT: Cognitive behavioural therapy; DASS21: Depression anxiety and stress scale-short form; PAIS: Psychosocial adjustment to illness scale; PSG: Peer support group; QoL: Quality of life; RCT: Randomised controlled trial; ReCaPTure LiFe: Resilience and Coping Skills for young People to Live well Following cancer; RL: ReCaPTure LiFe; SPSS: Statistical package for the social sciences; USD: Ursula Sansom-Daly psychologist; YSQ: Youth satisfaction questionnaire.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>USD, CW, RB, PB and RC developed the study concept, aims and initiated the project. <bold>SS,</bold> PP, AA, and KT assisted in the further in depth development of the protocol.
