At the beginning of the study, the physical therapists visited one patient for the first as well as the follow-up visits together to ensure that similar and consistent information was conveyed to all participants with respect to instructions during assessment on outcome measures and also during implementation of the intervention. The two physical therapists who participated in the study had 3&#x02013;4&#x02009;years experience in working with patients with THA and TKA and had routinely used the self-reported outcome measures and physical measures for assessments.

Individuals who met the inclusion/exclusion criteria were advised of the study. The inclusion criteria for the study participants were that they had unilateral THA or TKA as a result of hip or knee joint OA and were advised by their surgeon to weight bear as tolerated following surgery. Individuals with revision of THA or TKA or those who had been advised to remain non-weight bearing or partial weight bearing on the operated leg were excluded. Individuals with neurological conditions such as hemiplegia, peripheral neuropathy, vestibular disorders and Parkinson&#x02019;s disease that might affect their balance and those who were considered unable to communicate or follow instructions were also excluded from the study. As advised by the surgeons, all participants were taking blood thinners for prevention of blood clots and pain medication as needed following surgery.

All statistical tests were completed using STATISTICA,<sup><xref rid="bibr29-2050312116675097" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> and as five separate ANOVAs were done for the five test conditions, the &#x003b1;-level was corrected to 0.01 to denote statistical significance.</p><p>A priori power analysis using data from the previous study with subjects with TKA indicated that a sample of 20 participants in each group would have a power of 0.80 to detect a difference of five standard deviations between groups on the BBS at a significance level of 0.05.<sup><xref rid="bibr30-2050312116675097" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> Patients with THA and TKA were pooled together to provide an adequate sample size in this study.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="section12-2050312116675097"><title>Results</title><p>A total of 63 participants (22 males and 41 females) with a mean age of 66&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;10&#x02009;years were included in the study.

Improvement in balance ability was found on two test conditions that involved standing on both limbs, the anterior lean and posterior lean standing conditions. The balance exercises used in this study perhaps improved the balance requirement to perform these two test conditions and did not address the balance requirement to perform single-limb stance or the static bilateral stance. Previous studies that assessed balance in individuals with TKA using force plates have also used two-limb standing tests and have showed them to be valid and reliable for assessing balance.<sup><xref rid="bibr17-2050312116675097" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="bibr18-2050312116675097" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="bibr31-2050312116675097" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> Previous studies have also reported improvement in physical function as a result of joint ROM and muscle-strengthening exercises.<sup><xref rid="bibr32-2050312116675097" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="bibr33-2050312116675097" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> In this study, balance exercises were added to the typical joint ROM and muscle-strengthening exercise program rather than replacing some of the typical exercises. This was done to determine whether balance exercises had any effect on balance in individuals following THA or TKA. Also, 5&#x02009;weeks is typically the average duration for in-home rehabilitation program following THA or TKA after which patients go to the outpatient rehabilitation program in the hospital or clinical settings.</p><p>The seven typical joint ROM and muscle-strengthening exercises and the three balance exercises were selected by two physical therapists who routinely treated patients with THA and/or TKA. The exercises were described in various exercise protocols used in previous studies.<sup><xref rid="bibr32-2050312116675097" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><xref rid="bibr33-2050312116675097" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr34-2050312116675097" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr35-2050312116675097" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> In this study, the three added balance exercises were simple but they did challenge the balance of participants with THA or TKA. None of the participants in the balance group reported any problems from performing the balance exercises. Compliance was considered excellent, with 95% of participants reporting completion of all exercises as per the recommended frequency and number of repetitions. One participant in the balance group and two participants in the typical group did not perform exercises for a day due to a prior engagement.</p><p>This study also tested balance using one-limb standing conditions to examine balance directly as a result of either THA or TKA and minimize the contribution of the other limb in maintaining balance. On these tests, no significant difference was observed between participants in the balance group and typical group. Standing on either the operated limb or the non-operated limb was found to be a challenging task for the participants. Also, our balance intervention did not address the balance requirement necessary for one-limb stance. Of the 50 participants, only 30 were able to stand for 10&#x02009;s on their operated limb and 33 participants on non-operated limb. As a result, sample sizes for the surgical group&#x02013;exercise group combinations in the ANOVAs were relatively small, ranging from 6 to 11 per group. Furthermore, the observed standard deviations were relatively large for the means, which could have led to the non-significant results between the balance group and typical group for the one-limb standing tests. A study by Trudelle-Jackson et al.<sup><xref rid="bibr16-2050312116675097" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> assessing balance in individuals with THA using one-limb standing positions on a force plate did so at about 1&#x02009;year post-surgery and reported lower balance ability on the operated limb as compared to the non-operated limb. To our knowledge, this study is the first to assess balance in individuals with THA or TKA using one-limb standing position at an immediate post-surgery period.</p><p>The first 2&#x02009;months after THA and TKA surgery are considered clinically important time periods during which patients must adapt to changes in their health status and techniques of performing physical function and mobility. In this post-surgery period, physical therapy is employed for rehabilitation purposes although patients are expected to continue their home exercise programs indefinitely. Results of this study suggest that balance exercises added to routine joint ROM and muscle-strengthening exercises for individuals following THA or TKA have a potential to improve balance ability as measured by CoP area. Improvement in balance could promote independence in mobility and function such as walking, stair climbing, getting in and out of vehicles and negotiating uneven terrain. Better balance could help individuals improve their balance confidence and help them understand their balance limits, enabling them to differentiate between functional activities that they can and cannot safely perform.</p><p>In this study, force-plate assessments on participants were performed in the acute post-operative period following their THA and TKA surgery. THA and TKA being major surgeries, patients have very limited physical abilities immediately after surgery due to consequent pain, swelling and stiffness in the operated limb. Presence of any other co-morbid condition also compromises the patients&#x02019; physical abilities along with their coping ability. Activity tolerance, as well as sanding tolerance, in these patients immediately after surgery is very low. Force-plate assessments are extensive and physically challenging to patients and require certain degree of physical ability and endurance. The protocol used for the force-plate analyses in this study included five test conditions that had one-limb standing task. Immediately after THA or TKA surgery, it is difficult for patients to perform not only one-limb standing task but also anterior and posterior lean standing tasks. Even if attempts were made to assess participants on force plate immediately after THA or TKA, it would not have been possible to gather enough data from these participants on all force-plate test conditions and would also have compromised the safety of participants. As a result, it was decided that participants in this study would be assessed on the force plate only after a period of few weeks following their THA or TKA surgery and after completion of the study intervention. Also, the outpatient home physical therapy provider and the physical therapists had no information of participants&#x02019; surgical status (date of surgery) or access to participants&#x02019; charts before surgery. Participants&#x02019; information could only be accessed upon their discharge to home following surgery when they were referred to the home physical therapy provider for physical therapy. As a result, pre-surgical force-plate assessments on participants were not completed.</p><p>Although this study did not had baseline (pretest) scores on the force-plate tests and only post-intervention (posttest) scores, the study design involved randomization and comparison groups (typical and balance). Portney and Watkins<sup><xref rid="bibr36-2050312116675097" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> suggest that such &#x0201c;posttest-only design&#x0201d; also controls standard threats to internal validity and we can assume that the groups in the study are equivalent prior to intervention even without the pretest score and that its internal validity is strong. In addition, if pretest score on participants were obtained on force-plate tests, the participants may be sensitized to the force-plate test in a way that would influence their scores on a subsequent posttest.<sup><xref rid="bibr36-2050312116675097" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> As a result, the external validity of the study design is also strong.<sup><xref rid="bibr36-2050312116675097" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> Although researchers should not undermine the importance of the &#x0201c;pretest&#x02013;posttest design,&#x0201d; the &#x0201c;posttest-only design&#x0201d; is identical to the &#x0201c;pretest&#x02013;posttest design&#x0201d; except that a pretest is not administered to either group.<sup><xref rid="bibr36-2050312116675097" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> The &#x0201c;posttest-only design&#x0201d; has been successfully used in a previous study to determine and compare lower limb force production during a single-leg horizontal press in operated and unoperated limbs in participants with TKA and the limb of age- and gender-matched control group.<sup><xref rid="bibr37-2050312116675097" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> Another study by Bertocci et al.<sup><xref rid="bibr38-2050312116675097" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> also used &#x0201c;posttest-only design&#x0201d; to evaluate differences in isokinetic hip flexion, extension and abduction muscle performance of limbs in participants with THA who completed outpatient or home-based physical therapy intervention compared to healthy participants.</p><p>Participants in this study represented a sample of convenience composed of patients referred to home-based outpatient physical therapy within a limited geographical area, and thus the generalizability of the results may be limited. All participants were discharged from the hospital after they fulfilled the basic criteria required by the surgeon of the operated hip and knee joint ROM being 0&#x02009;&#x02013;90, and participants being independent in basic transfers, mobility and stair climbing. Also, all participants had been advised by their surgeon to weight bear as tolerated on the operated limb. Consequently, the results of the study may not be generalized to individuals with THA and TKA who are advised to partial weight bear or non-weight bear on the operated limb, individuals with hip and knee joint ROM limited within 0&#x02009;&#x02013;90&#x02009; or residual deformities such as genu varum and individuals dependent for basic transfers, mobility and stair climbing. This study examined the effectiveness of typical and added balance exercises used during a relatively short period following THA or TKA surgery, and other types of exercises were not evaluated. Long-term, 12&#x02013;24&#x02009;weeks, post-surgery assessments were not completed, and so the long-term effects of the exercises are not known. In addition, the therapists were not blinded to the participants&#x02019; group allocation.</p><p>In conclusion, the addition of three balance exercises to typical joint ROM and muscle-strengthening exercises has potential to improve two-limb standing balance in individuals following THA or TKA as demonstrated by a significant reduction in the 95% ellipse area of the CoP amplitude in participants who performed balance exercises in addition to a typical exercise protocol. Whether these balance improvements can be preserved longer than 5&#x02009;weeks after THA or TKA surgery requires further study. Future studies could also possibly investigate the effects of balance exercises on functional assessment of balance in individuals with THA or TKA. The patients had no difficulties performing the balance exercises and they were highly compliant in doing so.
