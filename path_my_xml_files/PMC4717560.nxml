However, research is lacking to understand intervention effectiveness, especially in complex, multi-component mHealth programs. This paper investigates participant perceptions of and engagement with the mHealth program components in the TXT2BFiT to understand program effects.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Process evaluation data were collected continuously for the study duration. The TXT2BFiT program was a multi-component lifestyle program delivered intensively for 3-month followed by a 6-month maintenance phase. Program components included personalised coaching calls, text messages, emails, smartphone apps and website access. Process evaluation measures included frequency of use of components and frequency for number of components used (online survey data); dose delivered and engagement with program components (researcher logs and web platform reports); frequency, timing and difficulties experienced with program components (online survey data) and overall perceptions of program components (online survey data and semi-structured telephone interviews). Qualitative data analysis was performed using NVivo10.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Over 80&#x000a0;% of participants completed post-intervention (3-months, intervention, <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;110, control <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;104) and follow-up surveys (9-months, intervention, <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;96, control <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;104). Thirty intervention participants completed semi-structured telephone interviews. Participants reported high use of coaching calls, text messages and emails and no issues in content delivery from these components. These components were described as helping them to achieve their goals. Website and app use and engagement was low for the duration of the program. Participants would prefer incorporation of the self-monitoring apps and website resources into one smartphone application that can be individualised by entry of their personal data.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our process evaluation has allowed a comprehensive understanding of use and preference for different program components. The high value placed on the coaching calls is consistent with a desire for personalisation of the mHealth program and even further tailoring of text messages and emails. The findings of this study will be used to revise TXT2BFiT for future users.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>The trial is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.anzctr.org.au/Trial/Registration/TrialReview.aspx?id=362872">ACTRN12612000924853</ext-link>).</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Young adults</kwd><kwd>Obesity prevention</kwd><kwd>Nutrition</kwd><kwd>Lifestyle</kwd><kwd>mHealth</kwd><kwd>Process evaluation</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Hospitals Contribution Fund (HCF) Medical Research Foundation</institution></funding-source><award-id>MAUsyd1008201111</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Allman-Farinelli</surname><given-names>Margaret</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Australian Postgraduate Award Scholarship</institution></funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) Scholarship</institution></funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council (AU)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Young adults aged 18&#x02013;35&#x000a0;years are highly susceptible to weight gain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], with the highest incidence of overweight and obesity compared to other age groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. This is believed to be driven by their interactions with the obesogenic environment leading to unhealthy lifestyle behaviours such as poor dietary behaviours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and sedentary lifestyles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], often associated with influence of digital technology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>While there may be negative impacts from the explosion of technology, this also provides opportunities for innovative and real-time delivery of health-related information. Smartphone ownership has increased substantially in recent years, with 65&#x000a0;% of Australians [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and 64&#x000a0;% of Americans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] owning a smartphone. Young adults record highest ownership at 85&#x000a0;% in the USA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. About three-quarters of 18&#x02013;29 year old smartphone owners have used their phone in the last year to seek information about a health condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Smartphone intervention delivery, or mobile-health (mHealth) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], could potentially provide a cost-effective intervention channel that allows real-time delivery of health information and serves as an effective tool for behaviour change to a wide ranging population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>mHealth or electronic-health (eHealth) programs have demonstrated success in the promotion of a range of healthy behaviours, including weight management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. However, our recent systematic review showed only six of 22 interventions for weight gain prevention in young adults used new technology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Of these six, only three studies reported the reasons why technology achieved or failed to achieve the desired outcomes of the interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p>Process evaluation is an important step for understanding intervention effectiveness, especially in complex, multi-component mHealth programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Identifying and understanding how participants engage with and use the different components with respect to both the form of technology e.g. social media platforms, text messaging and smartphone apps and the content delivered can inform program improvement and ultimately, its effectiveness. Process evaluation can give insights to possible underlying factors for why a program fails or succeeds in effecting change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Assuring that there is maximum participant engagement and satisfaction with program components can also enhance program retention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>Two recent process evaluations of technology-focused interventions in young adults have been published, beginning an evidence base to inform most effective program delivery to young adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Both studies quantitatively reported how engagement with social networking intervention components was highly variable and declined over time. However, qualitative insights from Merchant et al., found many participants passively engage with social networking, not captured in quantitative engagement data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p>TXT2BFiT was a multi-component mHealth lifestyle program custom designed for young adults (18&#x02013;35 years) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The program was delivered intensively for 3-months with personalised coaching calls, text messages, emails, smartphone apps and website access, followed by a 6-month maintenance phase. Program efficacy was tested in a randomised controlled trial (RCT) design, with weight reduction and improvements in lifestyle behaviours seen at 3-months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] and maintained at 9-months (data unpublished). TXT2BFiT was one of the first few innovative mHealth programs. We also conducted a process evaluation of TXT2BFiT to gain understanding of program engagement, program fidelity and program component contribution to observed effects. Specifically, this paper investigates participant perceptions of and engagement with the mHealth program components in the TXT2BFiT to understand program effects.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>TXT2BFiT participants</title><p>The TXT2BFiT study was conducted with healthy, non-pregnant 18&#x02013;35&#x000a0;year-olds living in an urban environment in Australia recruited via primary care and print and electronic media [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Eligible participants had a BMI between 23.0 and 31.9&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup> with dietary and physical activity behaviours that failed to meet national recommendations. Participants were required to have a mobile phone capable of receiving text messages and access to the internet at least weekly. Inclusion and exclusion criteria have been described in detail elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Materials and methods of the TXT2BFiT 9-month trial were approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee in September 2012 (Approval number 15226).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>TXT2BFiT design</title><p>Details about the TXT2BFiT study protocol and recruitment are reported in separate publications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. In brief, the two-arm parallel RCT tested efficacy of our m-health lifestyle program for weight maintenance in young adults. The 9-month study consisted of a 3-month intervention period and 6-month maintenance period and it was conducted between November 2012 and April 2015. The 3-month TXT2BFiT intervention program comprised eight gender-specific weekly motivational text messages personalised according to stage-of-change for nutrition and physical activity strategies aimed to facilitate behaviour change around weight maintenance; weekly emails, five personalized coaching calls over 3-months; continuous access to purpose-designed smartphone applications; and community blog and support resources available on the study website. Two Accredited Practising Dietitians (APD) conducted the personalised coaching calls incorporating intervention participants&#x02019; stage-of-change and motivational interviewing techniques to set personal goals, discuss barriers and enablers, feedback on participant progress and set new goals. Participants set one goal to prevent weight gain and maintain their body weight within the normal BMI range (18.5&#x02013;24.9&#x000a0;kg&#x000a0;m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>) or to move towards a normal range. Participants also set between one and three goals relating to their diet or physical activity. All goals set over the five coaching calls and two booster calls were participant directed with dietitian input if required. Intervention participants were also mailed an 18-page printed booklet that included dietary information and sample meal plans as well as a two-page handout summarizing the Australian National Dietary and Physical Activity Guidelines given to controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. During maintenance phase, month four to nine, one monthly text message, one monthly email and two booster coaching calls at 5-months and 8-months were provided to intervention participants.</p><p>Control participants received the mailed two-page handout only, one introductory call (week 0) to introduce the program (no coaching given), four text messages i.e. one every three weeks and access to a website with only electronic versions of the two-page handout, consent form, study information statement and contact information.</p><p>All participants enrolled in the TXT2BFiT study were sent a link to online surveys at 3-months and at 9-months that included questions on use, frequency, timing, difficulties and overall experience with all program components. Control participants were asked similar questions for the minimal components of the program they were exposed to (text messaging and website use) for consistency of survey method.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Frequency of use of components and frequency for number of components used</title><p>All participants completing the online surveys were asked &#x0201c;what parts of the program did you use?&#x0201d; This included use of the components i.e. coaching calls, text messages, emails, smartphone applications, printed booklet, community blog and each of the seven resources available on the website. Resources included &#x0201c;easy, healthy eating on a budget&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;emergency meal tool kit&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;meal planning worksheet&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;commit yourself: physical activity planner&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;tips for take-out meals&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;seasonal guide to fruit and vegetables&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;staying healthy over the holidays&#x0201d;.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Dose delivered and engagement with program components</title><p>Data on dose delivered and engagement with program components were continuously collected for monitoring purposes for the duration of the study and stored in a database. Data included completed coaching calls, text messages delivered and replied to, emails delivered, download and logins to smartphone applications, and posts on the community blog.</p><p>Coaching calls were considered completed and engaged with, if all main aspects of the coaching call guide had been delivered to the participant (previous behavioural goals assessed and new behavioural goals set if appropriate). Delivery reports were downloaded from the text message web platform (MessageMedia&#x000ae;) and data synthesized on number of text messages delivered and on the number failed to be delivered per participant (dose delivered). Intervention participants were asked to reply &#x02018;OK&#x02019; to 16 text messages during the intensive phase (months 1&#x02013;3) and to each of the six text messages sent during the maintenance phase (months 4&#x02013;9), while control participants were asked to reply &#x02018;OK&#x02019; to all four text messages sent during the intensive phase. Engagement was determined by the number of replies per participant. Emails were considered delivered if no undelivered email was returned (dose delivered). Smartphone application downloads (dose delivered) and logins (engagement) were retrieved, as were details of the posts by researchers and participants on the community blog section of the website (engagement).</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Frequency, timing and difficulties experienced with program components</title><p>The delivery frequency of the text messages and emails were assessed by asking &#x0201c;were text messages/emails sent often enough?&#x0201d; with an option to report the number of text messages or emails per day they would have preferred to receive. Preference for the delivery time of text messages and emails were assessed by asking &#x0201c;was the time of day that text messages/emails were sent appropriate?&#x0201d; Participants were also asked to report any difficulty experienced using the text messages, emails, smartphone applications or website.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Overall perceptions of program components</title><p>The online surveys asked participants if they had any other comments about the TXT2BFiT program. In addition, between March 2014 and April 2015 all individuals, who participated in the TXT2BFiT intervention arm were invited via email at the completion of the intervention to participate in the semi-structured telephone interview qualitative sub-study. The process evaluation sub study was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee in February 2014 (Approval number 2014/091). The aim of the semi-structured interviews was to explore participant's experiences with and use of program components to corroborate the quantitative effects observed. Participants were asked questions about which aspects of the program they found useful in helping them achieved their goals and which aspects of program could be improved for future study implementation.</p><p>Both participants who completed or did not complete the 9-month TXT2BFiT intervention arm were contacted by email, but participants who had officially withdrawn were excluded. Participants responded via email and gave informed consent. Those who did not respond were followed up by a telephone call within two weeks of the email. If they did not respond to the telephone call, no further contact was made. The semi-structured interviews were administered by telephone, lasting approximately 15&#x02013;20&#x000a0;min and participants were reimbursed for their time with a small AU$10 gift voucher. The interviews were audio recorded for the purpose of transcription and data analysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Data sources, analysis and statistics</title><p>A summary of all process evaluation data and their definitions is provided in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. Descriptive statistics were reported for quantitative data. De-identified qualitative data were coded using the NVivo Software program (QSR International Pty Ltd. Version 10, 2012, Victoria, Melbourne). One researcher (SP) trained in qualitative research methods conducted, transcribed and coded all participant comments and interviews, allowing for data immersion and obtaining an overall sense of the data. Content inductive analysis was used for each mHealth component, and categories ranked per mHealth component [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. An open coding approach was adopted, forming a general description of the research topic through generating categories and subcategories as they emerged [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. This systematic approach is appropriate for semi-structured interviews to determine trends and patterns. Discussion with a second researcher (MA-F) familiar with the data finalised and confirmed emerging categories. Verbatim quotes from interviews that best represented the key findings for each category were highlighted for subsequent reporting purposes.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Summary of data sources and definitions</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td>Quantitative data</td></tr><tr><td>Use of components and frequency for number of components used:<break/>&#x02003;&#x02022; Post-intervention and follow-up survey data</td></tr><tr><td>Frequency, timing and difficulties experienced with program components:<break/>&#x02003;&#x02022; Post-intervention and follow-up survey data</td></tr><tr><td>Dose delivered and engagement with program components:<break/>&#x02003;&#x02022; Coaching calls completed (dose delivered and engagement&#x02009;=&#x02009;number of coaching calls completed) from researcher call log database<break/>&#x02003;&#x02022; Text messages delivered (dose delivered&#x02009;=&#x02009;number of text messages delivered) and replied to (engagement&#x02009;=&#x02009;number of text messages replied to) from MessageMedia&#x000ae; web platform<break/>&#x02003;&#x02022; Emails delivered (dose delivered&#x02009;=&#x02009;number of emails delivered) from researcher email log database<break/>&#x02003;&#x02022; Smartphone application downloads (dose delivered&#x02009;=&#x02009;number of downloads per app) and logins (engagement&#x02009;=&#x02009;number of logins per app) from app developers database<break/>&#x02003;&#x02022; Website community blog posts participants (engagement&#x02009;=&#x02009;number of participant posts on the community blog) from TXT2BFiT website</td></tr><tr><td>Qualitative data</td></tr><tr><td>Explore participant&#x02019;s experiences with and use of all program components and their usefulness in helping them achieved their goals and future improvements:<break/>&#x02003;&#x02022; Semi-structured telephone interviews conducted at end of the maintenance phase with intervention participants<break/>&#x02003;&#x02022; Post-intervention and follow-up survey data</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Participants&#x02019; profile</title><p>The total randomized sample were aged 27.7&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;4.9 (SD) years, female (61&#x000a0;%, 152/248), English speaking only (69&#x000a0;%, 172/248), university educated (62&#x000a0;%, 153/248) and living in a socio-economically advantaged area (75&#x000a0;%, 187/248).

Improving physical activity and eating habits to improve health were commonly mentioned mostly in combination.

Participants thought the calls were professional and personalised, acting as an external motivator. They described how the information was &#x0201c;all really cool, sensible stuff&#x0201d; and it was important for them to be consulting with a trained professional (APD). Accountability was a common theme. Participants mentioned a positive sense of accountability to the APD, and how someone &#x0201c;checking in&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;to bounce ideas off&#x0201d; helped them towards achieving their goal(s). Participants felt they could direct the coaching calls to meet their requirements, but they also mentioned how the calls were a collaboration and if an approach or goal wasn&#x02019;t working for them, they could re-work their goal with the APD and it was within a non-judgmental environment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Text messages</title><p>Participants liked the text messages as they provided &#x0201c;sound bite information&#x0201d; (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Tip and hint based text messages were preferred by participants as they were practical. Fact based messages were less preferred because most participants acknowledged that their nutrition and physical activity issues were not from a knowledge deficit. The easier the text messages were to implement into daily life, the more achievable and sensible they were perceived. The four behaviours targeted in the text messages were not relevant to all participants, and greater personalisation was suggested. However, despite some text messages being irrelevant to the participant&#x02019;s goal, they still regarded them as a reminder. Participants were reminded of targeted behaviours at appropriate times (i.e. energy dense take-away consumption on a Friday and Saturday evening at 5&#x000a0;PM), which they described as contributing to positive habits forming. Text messages were viewed as easy to read, brief information that was not burdensome to participants.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Emails</title><p>Participants associated emails with work and spam (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Most weekly emails were viewed as impersonal and only scanned over, but the email sent as a summary of the individual coaching call was well received. This email was personalised with the agreed upon goals for the next coaching call and contained personally relevant links to study materials (website resources and/or smartphone applications). As this email was anticipated, it was reported as always read, regardless of length and would often be printed out for display.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Website and smartphone applications</title><p>The least helpful component mentioned was the smartphone applications for reasons such as logging in difficulties and navigation issues (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Participants did not engage with the smartphone applications, as they did not compare to other commercially available smartphone applications. They expected greater self-monitoring capabilities linked to the goals that they were working on with the APD in the coaching calls. Similarly, the website was not frequently used and issues were raised around access and difficulty logging in. Participants said the resources were easily accessible on the website. However, most participants prefer to use their smartphone to access the website and a new mobile version was requested.</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>External motivators and improvements</title><p>Participants reported using commonly available smartphone applications and self-monitoring devices such as My Fitness Pal and Fitbit (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Furthermore, most had some social support, including that of family, partners or memberships to gyms or sporting groups. Participants reported preferring an individualised program, with coaching calls the central feature and text messages, emails and website components tailored to their personal goals. A need for a more gradual decline in contact between the 3-month program and the maintenance phase was commonly mentioned.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Discussion</title><p>To our knowledge this is the first study to elucidate young adults&#x02019; perceptions of and engagement with a mHealth program. Not surprisingly we discovered the desire for personalised intervention, evident by the high value placed on the behavioural coaching calls with a dietitian and text messages and summarising emails tailored to their personal nutrition and physical activity goals. Participants would prefer that the four apps for self-monitoring and website resources all be incorporated into one smartphone application that can be individualised by entry of their personal data. The findings of this study will be used to revise TXT2BFiT for future users.</p><p>Findings from this process evaluation suggested the phone coaching calls were most valued and other mHealth components acted to supplement the coaching calls. Coaching calls were added to the program and the frequency of text messaging increased in response to feedback from our first pilot study. There is already well established evidence supporting the eff&#x00131;cacy of telephone delivered interventions to promote physical activity and dietary change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Participants had clear goals of what they hoped to achieve during the program, which aligned with the aims of the TXT2BFiT study. Personally tailored eHealth programs with health professional input and use of a structured program has been shown to enhance weight loss results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Studies have suggested that successful interventions for the prevention of weight gain instil skills in goal setting, planning and self-monitoring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] which were a key component of the coaching calls. The seven mHealth components of the program contained 18 (data unpublished) behaviour change techniques (BCT), of the 26 recommended for positive behaviour change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Over 75&#x000a0;% of participants reported using a combination of three to five components in the intervention period, and therefore would have been exposed to a large proportion of these BCTs known to elicit change.</p><p>Text messages and emails were the other main aspect of the program participants found helpful to achieve their goals. While actually not a mobile component, the nutrition booklet was also engaged with and used by participants. Interventions with text messages components have been shown to be beneficial in relation to weight loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Participants preferred behaviour-based messages as opposed to knowledge-based messages. Practical behaviour-based messages were reported to be implemented frequently when received, and even more likely when the message was related to a goal discussed in the coaching call. This is in line with current evidence suggesting self-monitoring, goal checking, prompting behavioural cues and goal reset are important for behavioural maintenance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Benefits of text messages and emails are that they can be tailored by the health professional to meet the needs of the participant and supplement the human interaction of the coaching call and enhance effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. A recent eHealth mini-online education lessons intervention for young adults used stage-of-change targeted emails (&#x02018;nudges&#x02019;) to reinforce the fruit and vegetable, physical activity and stress management behaviours targeted in the lessons. The process evaluation revealed most adhering participants were moderately motivated by the lessons, however, no process evaluation data was presented on the email nudges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. For the TXT2BFiT study, the text messages addressed only the four key lifestyle interventions: sugary beverages, take-away foods, fruit and vegetables and physical activity. The database of goals set during the five coaching calls will be analysed along with other avenues such as crowd sourcing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] with an on-line community of young adults, to inform future additional message development and facilitate further personalisation.</p><p>Barrier and facilitators discussed in the coaching calls and identified in other young adult populations such as budget constraints, peer pressure and time management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] can be incorporated in future message content. Participants asked for a more gradual decline in contact frequency between the intervention and maintenance phase. Whether longer duration of delivery of program components could enhance the changes already made and could result in maintenance beyond 9&#x000a0;months of this study is yet to be discerned.</p><p>Several recent studies used process evaluations to determine factors related to mHealth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] and eHealth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] implementation in young adults and other populations. The community blog in this study was not engaged with by participants, however, recent research has suggested many participants may passively engage with social networking i.e. read blog posts, but not respond or contribute [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. If the community blog posts by research staff had continued, a greater dose of the intervention component, or more participants reporting use may have resulted. Morrison et al., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] showed that goal-tracking smartphones applications have the potential to improve individuals&#x02019; engagement with their personal health goals when used as a supplement to existing web-based intervention components consisting of weekly feedback on personalised healthy eating and physical activity plans. The smartphone applications offered self-monitoring features [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>], but one app had been developed for each behaviour in isolation in the belief participants might work on only one or two behaviours at a time. As it was clear weight loss was a primary goal for many, energy balance was important so linkage between diet and physical activity data was desired. This was the reason they reverted to commercially available smartphone applications. Researchers in the UK have developed an acceptable and feasible smartphone application incorporating goal setting, self-monitoring of diet and activity, and feedback via one weekly text message [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. This integrated smartphone application approach alone was effective in pilot testing for weight loss in 50 women over a 6&#x000a0;month period. As researchers it is difficult to offer comparable quality and features as in commercial smartphone applications. Creating partnerships with commercial providers could provide participants an evidence based program, designed using up-to-date technology, however, ethical issues arise in relation to data ownership. It should also be noted that the most popular app in Australia that was reported as being used in this study failed to produce weight loss over a 6-month period when trialled in the primary care setting in the US [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Self-monitoring smartphone apps designed by researchers, however, have demonstrated weight-loss efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. The qualitative research does indicate that participants prefer smartphones for delivery of their intervention, including the phone feature in particular, so that moving all resources from the website into an app format would meet with approval.</p><sec id="Sec29"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>This study provides insights not yet reported in mHealth literature. Qualitative studies using process evaluation to inform recruitment strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>], and understand motivators and barriers to behaviour change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>] for weight management in young adults is emerging. However, qualitative process evaluation research has been lacking in weight gain prevention interventions for young adults. A strength of this process evaluation is its comprehensiveness. It incorporates of multiple sources of data, measuring a range of process evaluation dimensions and indicators such as dose delivered and engagement. It also measures the different program components, which is very important considering the multicomponent characteristics of the TXT2BFiT program. Retention was high in this study with more than 80&#x000a0;% of participants completing the online surveys at 9-months. Despite our efforts, we were unable to contact participants lost to follow-up (i.e. not completing survey but did not officially dropout) if it was due to the delivery of the mHealth program. Research from an older rural population suggests unrealistic program expectations may inhibit initiation and continuation of behaviour change for weight management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. For the qualitative interviews, 42 participants were not contacted for telephone interviews due to delay in ethical approval. Lastly, the population in this intervention were mostly well-educated and from higher socio-economic backgrounds. Young adults less educated and from lower socio-economic backgrounds may require education-based health messages to improve nutrition knowledge.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Obesity is a multifaceted public health issue; young adults are at increased risk, and prevention requires personalised solutions. mHealth programs have the benefit of offering the participating individual multiple components, thus being able to cater for a wide-range of needs. The TXT2BFiT has demonstrated efficacy in reducing and/or maintaining weight and improved dietary and physical activity behaviours. Our process evaluation has allowed a comprehensive understanding of use and preference for different program components. Future work will be required to translate the array of TXT2bFiT components to meet the needs of most young adults, to support them to stay healthy and active.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>APD</term><def><p>Accredited practising dietitian</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BCT</term><def><p>Behaviour change techniques</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>eHealth</term><def><p>Electronic health</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>mHealth</term><def><p>mobile health</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RCT</term><def><p>Randomised controlled trial</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>USA</term><def><p>United States of America</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>SRP, LH, AW, KB and MA-F carried out the TXT2BFiT nine month (9-month) parallel-group RCT.
