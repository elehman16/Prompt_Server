Inclusion criteria are: self-reported hand eczema and informed consent. Exclusion criteria are: age &#x0003c;18&#x000a0;years or &#x0003e;65&#x000a0;years; permanent exclusion from the workforce; inability to understand the Danish language; any serious medical condition; and lack of written informed consent. We plan to randomise 742 participants. <italic>Interventions:</italic> The experimental intervention is an educational course in skin-protective behaviour and written information about skin care related to the participants' specific occupation. Also, a telephone hotline is available and a subgroup will be offered a work-place visit. The experimental and the control group have access to usual care and treatment.

The incidence is approximately 0.32 per 1,000 persons in the total population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], and the numbers are comparable in most of the industrialised world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>In 2011, the Danish National Board of Industrial Injuries recognised a total of 1,395 individuals with occupational skin diseases, and the large majority of these patients (&#x0003e; 90%) had occupational hand eczema.</p><p>Hand eczema affects mainly young people as 1/3 has onset of disease before the age of 20&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The lifetime prevalence is almost twice as high in women as it is in men [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. This is mainly due to women&#x02019;s higher exposure to wet work, occupationally as well as privately, which are well known risk factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Other aggravating factors are atopic dermatitis and contact allergy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>Hand eczema often takes a chronic course. A Swedish follow-up study reported active eczema 12&#x000a0;years after onset of disease in 72% of the sample of patients and found that 15% had been excluded from the work force [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In a Danish study, similar data were reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. During a one-year period, 20% of patients with notified hand eczema had sick leave for more than five weeks due to skin disease, and 20% to 25% had loss of job (examined in the time span between notification and recognition). 57% had sick leave because of skin disease during the first year after notification. These data show that the burden of the disease is high in a personal as well as in a socio-economic context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The number of persons with occupational hand eczema has remained unchanged despite public initiatives to reduce exposures to harmful allergens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><sec><title>Current treatment and prevention</title><p>In Denmark, there is no standard for secondary prevention of occupational hand eczema. However, operational guidelines for the diagnostic evaluation and treatment of hand eczema exist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The guidelines recommend that advice should be given about personal protective equipment (e.g., gloves), and skin care with moisturisers.</p><p>In Germany, a course is offered to all health-care workers with occupational skin disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Persons with notified skin diseases are immediately after the notification invited to attend a two-day skin-protection course. The course is organised in cooperation with dermatologists, allergologists, occupational medicine specialists, hygiene specialists, and other staff members. The course includes a medical examination by a dermatologist, topics on medical history, atopic disposition, further diagnostics, therapy, skin protection, and an assessment of the patient&#x02019;s ability to remain in her/his job. All findings by the physician are forwarded to the authorities, and they are the basis for the further treatment possibilities offered to the patient. This includes, in the most severe cases, initiation of a 3-weeks inpatient treatment programme. An observational study found that the course improved skin care and skin-protection behaviour, hand eczema, and quality of life one year after the course compared to before the course [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical data</title><p>A systematic review of randomised trials and controlled trials from 2010 assessed prevention programmes compared to no intervention or treatment as usual in participants with hand dermatitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The reviewers included seven trials. No meta-analyses were conducted, as the reviewers assessed the trials to be too heterogeneous with regard to populations, interventions, control groups, and outcome measures. Overall, the reviewers concluded that there was moderate evidence for the effect of preventive programmes on occurrence of hand dermatitis and adherence to preventive measures, and low evidence for improving clinical outcomes and self-reported outcomes. Furthermore, none of the included trials had &#x02018;low risk of bias&#x02019; in all assessed domains, and the review was restricted to publications in English, with a high risk of publication bias. Also, the review did not distinguish between primary and secondary prevention trials.</p><p>We therefore conducted an updated search for randomised and controlled trials in hand eczema patients in December 2012 in the PubMed database. From this search, we identified two randomised trials with focus on secondary prevention by educational programmes in hand eczema patients. Both of these trials applied individual randomisation. One trial found that an individual intervention among health-care workers with self-reported hand eczema increases the participants&#x02019; use of preventive measures and improves hand eczema and quality of life compared with no intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The other trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] found that patients with HE responded positively to integrated care carried out by a multidisciplinary team with respect to clinical severity, but the intervention did not significantly influence quality of life (QoL) or sick leave.</p><p>We identified nine other trials with focus on secondary prevention of hand eczema by educational programmes in various working groups. Overall, they have found a positive effect of <italic>secondary</italic> skin protection programmes on occupational hand eczema in patients from different professions such as health care workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], gut cleaners [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], and workers in the cheese-dairy industry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. However, since these studies did not focus on hand eczema patients, but on a mixture of healthy workers and workers with hand eczema, the results are not directly comparable. Also, most of these studies were cluster-randomised with a high risk of systematic errors (that is risk of overestimation of benefits and underestimation of harms) and random errors (that is play of chance), and two studies focused mostly on use of emollients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. In addition to the published trials we found one design article on a randomised trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. This trial aims to investigate a guidance programme in self-management chronic hand eczema. The trial is ongoing and results are thus yet unknown.</p><p>Overall, randomised clinical trials and a systematic review of the randomised clinical trials indicate a positive effect of prevention programmes for patients with occupational hand eczema. However, we still lack information from large randomised clinical trials with a low risk of bias on the effect of a low-cost group-based education. The PREVEX trial will be the first individually randomised trial to investigate the benefits and harms of group-based education in patients with newly notified occupational hand eczema.</p></sec><sec><title>Objectives</title><p>The objectives of the PREVEX trial are to investigate the benefits and harms of a complex intervention consisting of:</p><p>A.

These files include information on all notified industrial injuries in Denmark. All individuals from Region Zealand and the Capital Region of Denmark (except the island of Bornholm) with a suspected skin-related industrial injury notified between July 2012 and December 2013 will be invited to participate in the trial. The trial invitation will be sent along with the postal questionnaire, participant information sheet, an informed consent form, and a pre-paid return envelope. All individuals will be encouraged in the invitation to contact the investigators for further information or if they wish for an individual meeting with verbal information. Individuals who return the questionnaire will be eligible for the PREVEX trial, if they comply with the following inclusion and exclusion criteria.</p></sec><sec><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p>&#x02022;&#x02003;Living in Denmark.</p><p>&#x02022;&#x02003;Self-reported hand eczema, i.e., individuals answering &#x02018;yes&#x02019; in the questionnaire to the question &#x02018;have you or have you had hand eczema?&#x02019;</p><p>&#x02022;&#x02003;The questionnaire is sufficiently filled in with respect to &#x02018;severity of hand eczema&#x02019; and &#x02018;profession&#x02019;.</p><p>&#x02022;&#x02003;Written informed consent.</p></sec><sec><title>Exclusion criteria</title><p>&#x02022;&#x02003;Age below 18&#x000a0;years or above 65&#x000a0;years.</p><p>&#x02022;&#x02003;Permanently excluded from the workforce.</p><p>&#x02022;&#x02003;Inability to understand the Danish language sufficiently to benefit from the course.</p><p>&#x02022;&#x02003;Any serious medical condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, may interfere with the evaluation of the results.</p><p>&#x02022;&#x02003;Lack of written informed consent.</p></sec><sec><title>Participant withdrawal and discontinuation of participants</title><p>The participants are free to withdraw their informed consent from the trial at any time without effecting future treatment or their case processing in the National Board of Industrial Injuries. If a participant wishes to withdraw his or hers consent, they will be contacted and asked to specify which aspects of the trial they wish to withdraw from: participation in the experimental intervention, participation in follow-up interviews and answering the questionnaires, use of follow-up data collected from national databases, or complete withdrawal from trial, i.e., use of already collected data the analyses.</p><p>All participants who enter the trial will be accounted for in the publication of the results. Participants who fail in attending a course on a planned date will be contacted and offered a new course. Participants who cannot be reached during the follow-up period will be contacted and encouraged to resume contact.

The investigator contacts the Copenhagen Trial Unit (CTU) by telephone, and the CTU staff will perform the allocation according to data entered in a computer system. Participants will be randomised individually 1:1 to the experimental group versus the control group centrally according to a computer-generated allocation sequence with a varying block size concealed to investigators. Randomisation will be stratified according to age (up to 39&#x000a0;years, or older than 40&#x000a0;years); self-reported hand eczema severity (&#x02018;none and light&#x02019; or &#x02018;moderate, severe, and very severe&#x02019;); and profession (&#x02018;healthcare&#x02019;, &#x02018;kitchen or cleaning staff&#x02019;, &#x02018;hairdresser or construction worker&#x02019;, or &#x02018;all other professions&#x02019;). After the allocation, the investigators will inform the participants about the allocation by telephone.</p></sec><sec><title>Blinding</title><p>It is not possible to blind the participants or investigators with respect to treatment allocation. However, data entry from the questionnaires, outcome assessment regarding absence from the work force (the eight week follow-up telephone calls, data from the DREAM register, and data from other national registers), statistical analyses, and conclusions will all be blinded.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial duration</title><p>The inclusion period is estimated to be 18&#x000a0;months. The first participant was included in 13 July 2012, and we expect inclusion of the last participant in December 2013. Self-reported data on absence from work will be continuously collected (every eighth week). Follow-up for the individual participants will be 12&#x000a0;months after inclusion and is expected to be completed in December 2014.</p></sec><sec><title>Experimental group</title><p>The experimental intervention consists of four components, A to D, as well as usual care, E:</p><p>A. <italic>Group education on general skin-protective behaviour</italic></p><p>Participants in the experimental group will participate in a two-hour course. One or two courses per week will be available. A secretary or nurse will arrange booking with the participants allocated to the experimental group. A maximum of 12 participants per course is expected. The courses will be conducted by two investigators. Participants can choose between an evening and a daytime course.</p><p>The group education will comprise basic knowledge about the skin, the development of eczema, and recommendations for skin protection and care. The recommended skin protection programme has been summarized into ten recommendations in Denmark (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). These ten recommendations will be the basis of the education [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>There will be practical demonstrations in hand washing and use of disinfectants, use of moisturiser, and use of different types of gloves (cotton, rubber, nitrile, vinyl gloves, and gloves with and without fingers).</p><p>B. <italic>Job-specific counselling on work-related skin-protective behaviour, which might extend to a work-place visit</italic></p><p>The job-specific counselling will comprise specific recommendations for skin care in different occupations. For ten occupations with some of the highest numbers of recognised occupational hand eczema patients in 2010 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], the information will be standardised and written information will be available (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). In case of other occupations, or with specific problems, a work visit will be offered and arranged. A doctor or a nurse will undertake the visit, and counselling will be based on this.</p><p>C. <italic>Social guidance related to occupational hand eczema</italic></p><p>The social guidance related to the occupational hand eczema will include information on rules and rights during an occupational injury. This will also include information about the options for help from workers compensation or social welfare in case of job-loss or change.</p><p>D. <italic>Telephone hotline</italic></p><p>An occupational nurse will provide assistance via telephone about questions and social problems. The telephone hotline will mainly include information already given at the course, but may be more specifically given to the particular individual. The purpose of the hotline is to repeat information from the course, which may have been forgotten or misunderstood, and to guide the participant in case of questions related to the social situation related to the occupational skin disease.

The protocol has been submitted for review to the Regional Ethics Committee for the Capital Region (journal number: H-1-2012-053), who replied that the PREVEX trial is not a &#x02018;biomedical trial&#x02019;, as no medicinal interventions take place, and accordingly a formal review by the Ethics Committee is not necessary. The trial has been approved be the Danish Data Protection Agency (journal number BBH-2011-33), and it has been registered on www.clinicaltrial.gov (identifier: NCT01899287).</p></sec><sec><title>Sample size estimation</title><p>Calculations were made using &#x02018;PS: Power and Sample Size Calculation&#x02019; version 3.0.14 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. A sample size was calculated for each of the three co-primary outcomes and the largest of the three sample sizes was chosen as the target sample size. To adjust for multiple testing, we divided the risk of type I error, 5%, by three, and we thus used a risk type I error of 1.67% and a risk of type II error of 20% (80% power). This calculation is based on the assumption that Holm&#x02019;s procedure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] will be used to adjust alpha (5%) to ensure that the family wise type I error will not exceed 5%. Holm&#x02019;s procedure works as follows: let p(1), p(2) and p(3) be the observed P values where p(1)&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;p(2)&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;p(3) and H(1), H(2) and H(3) are the corresponding hypotheses. The hypotheses are tested in that order. At the J&#x02019;th step H(J) is rejected if P(J)&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05/(3 &#x02013; J +1). Otherwise H(J) and all other untested hypotheses are accepted and the procedure stops. Since we cannot know in advance which of the three outcomes will be associated with the smallest P value, the largest of the three sample sizes is chosen to secure that the power will be at least 80%.</p><p>For the continuous variable &#x02018;total sick days&#x02019;, we used unpublished data from the Working Environment Cohort (Arbejdsmilj&#x000f8;kohorten) from the National Research Centre for the Working Environment (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.arbejdsmiljoforskning.dk">http://www.arbejdsmiljoforskning.dk</ext-link>) to estimate the sample size. In this cohort of 9,786 healthy individuals, the mean number of sick days in year 2010 was 6.74 (95% confidence interval (CI) 6.32 to 7.15). We expect a higher degree of sick days in the PREVEX population, and we estimate that the mean number of total sick days in the PREVEX trial will be higher, probably about 20 sick days per year.</p><p>From the data above, we calculated the standard deviation (SD) using this formula:</p><p><disp-formula><mml:math id="M1" name="1471-5945-13-16-i1" overflow="scroll"><mml:mtable columnalign="center"><mml:mtr columnalign="center"><mml:mtd columnalign="center"><mml:mi>SD</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msqrt><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">N</mml:mi></mml:msqrt><mml:mo>&#x000d7;</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mn>95</mml:mn><mml:mo>%</mml:mo><mml:mi>CI</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="0.25em"/><mml:mi>upper</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="0.5em"/><mml:mi>limit</mml:mi><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mn>95</mml:mn><mml:mo>%</mml:mo><mml:mi>CI</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="0.25em"/><mml:mi>lower</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="0.25em"/><mml:mi>limit</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mn>3.92</mml:mn></mml:mfrac></mml:mtd></mml:mtr><mml:mtr columnalign="center"><mml:mtd columnalign="center"><mml:mo>&#x021d3;</mml:mo></mml:mtd></mml:mtr><mml:mtr columnalign="center"><mml:mtd columnalign="center"><mml:mi>SD</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msqrt><mml:mrow><mml:mn>9</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mn>786</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msqrt><mml:mo>&#x000d7;</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mn>7.15</mml:mn><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mn>6.32</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mn>3.92</mml:mn></mml:mfrac></mml:mtd></mml:mtr><mml:mtr columnalign="center"><mml:mtd columnalign="center"><mml:mo>&#x021d5;</mml:mo></mml:mtd></mml:mtr><mml:mtr columnalign="center"><mml:mtd columnalign="center"><mml:mi>SD</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>21.0</mml:mn></mml:mtd></mml:mtr></mml:mtable></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>To detect a difference in total sick days of 5&#x000a0;days (25% risk reduction), we need 742 participants (371 participants in each intervention group) (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>).</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T3"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Sample size estimations</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" border="1"><colgroup><col align="left"/><col align="left"/><col align="center"/><col align="center"/><col align="center"/></colgroup><thead valign="top"><tr><th align="left"><bold>Outcome</bold></th><th align="left"><bold>Minimum relevant difference</bold></th><th align="center"><bold>Risk of type I error</bold></th><th align="center"><bold>Risk of type II error</bold></th><th align="center"><bold>Total number of participants needed</bold></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Total sick days<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">5&#x000a0;days (SD* 21&#x000a0;days)<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">1.67%<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">20%<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">742<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">DLQI<sup>&#x02020;</sup><hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">1.2 points (SD 4.8 points)<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">1.67%<hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">20%<sup>&#x02021;</sup><hr/></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">672<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Subjective assessment of hand eczema severity</td><td align="left">20% risk reduction from 60% event rate in the control group</td><td align="center">1.67%</td><td align="center">20%<sup>&#x000a7;</sup></td><td align="center">720</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>*Standard deviation of the mean.</p><p><sup>&#x02020;</sup>Dermatology Life Quality Index.</p><p><sup>&#x02021;</sup>Will be reduced to 15.7% when 742 participants are included.</p><p><sup>&#x000a7;</sup>Will be reduced to 18.6% when 742 participants are included.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>For the DLQI, we used a standard deviation of 4.8 points [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].

The best model will be used to analyse data.</p><p>&#x02022;&#x02003;<italic>Type 2</italic> includes a continuous outcome measure. The general linear univariate model will be used.</p><p>&#x02022;&#x02003;<italic>Type 3</italic> The ordinal outcomes will be analysed using the proportional odds model where the intervention group indicator is included as a co-variate provided the P value of the score test of the proportional odds assumption is&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;0.05.</p><p>All of the above analyses will include the three protocol specified stratification variables (age groups, self-reported hand eczema severity, and profession) as covariates in addition to the intervention indicator and baseline value if available.

Hommel&#x02019;s procedure could not be assumed in the sample size calculation since the level of significance to be used cannot be known in advance and therefore the adjustment of alpha could not be specified. However, Hommel&#x02019;s procedure is uniformly more powerful than Holm&#x02019;s procedure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>].

In addition, every 8&#x000a0;weeks during the first 40&#x000a0;weeks and then at week 52 following the randomisation the rate of sick leave is calculated.

Using the generalised linear mixed model with repeated measures we want to study rate as a function of time T, the intervention indicator, and the covariates where T varies from 1 corresponding to period 1 (first 8&#x000a0;weeks) to 6 (last 12&#x000a0;weeks) and rate&#x02009;=&#x02009;rate-I for T&#x02009;=&#x02009;I.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Trial organisation</title><p>The trial will take place at Bispebjerg Hospital in the Capital region of Denmark and at local hospitals where suitable in Region Zealand.

The ultimate aim of the PREVEX trial is to contribute to the development of new strategies for secondary prevention in patients with occupational hand eczema.</p><p>The timing in this trial is unique. Notification of an occupational injury often brings the individual in an insecure situation concerning the affiliation with the workforce. The intervention is delivered immediately after notification, which gives the best conditions to minimise these elements. The intervention in PREVEX is general as well as simplistic. This will heighten the possibility to determine the actual effectors, if any, in the intervention. Furthermore, the intervention is low-cost and thus more implementable in society.</p><p>The PREVEX trial will be a pragmatic trial, as the trial population will be heterogeneous regarding the severity of hand eczema, participants&#x02019; occupation, and previous treatment ranging from none to care in a dermatological setting. Accordingly, findings of the trial should have generalisability.</p><p>The trial has been designed in order to minimise the risks of systematic errors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] and the risks of random errors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Systematic errors have been sought reduced by central randomisation stratified for prognostic factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Blinding is used whenever possible and data will be analysed according to the intention-to-treat principle. We are aware that some outcomes are at risk of being assessed with some bias, as they are not possible to blind [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>].</p><p>The risk of random error has been reduced by choosing the largest of three possible sample size estimations.
