Effects on cognitive function were assessed using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and several domain-specific neuropsychological tests. Changes in behavior were evaluated using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory, caregiver burden using the Zarit Caregiver Burden Interview, and global function using the Clinician&#x02019;s Interview-Based Impression of Change-plus Caregiver Input (CIBIC-plus).

The motor and autonomic features further impair activities of daily living and lead to poorer quality of life.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3"><sup>3</sup></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4"><sup>4</sup></xref> However, pharmacological management of DLB remains challenging, because it is complicated by the risk of adverse reactions to medication.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5"><sup>5</sup></xref> Treatments for one aspect of the disease may exacerbate other symptoms. It is well recognized that DLB patients can be exquisitely sensitive to antipsychotic agents and can develop life-threatening sensitivity reactions.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6"><sup>6</sup></xref> Antiparkinson medication given to improve motor symptoms can exacerbate neuropsychiatric symptoms such as hallucinations. There are no approved treatments for DLB.</p><p>Cholinergic loss in DLB is associated with deficits in attention and cognition, and also with neuropsychiatric symptoms.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7"><sup>7</sup></xref> Neuropathological and neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that cholinergic neurotransmission is more defective in DLB than in AD.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8"><sup>8</sup></xref> Although cholinergic losses in DLB affect both brainstem and basal forebrain presynaptic nuclei, in contrast to AD, postsynaptic cortical muscarinic and nicotinic receptors are more functionally intact,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9"><sup>9</sup></xref> suggesting that cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) may be potent for DLB.

The aim of this phase 2 study was to exploratively investigate the efficacy and safety of donepezil hydrochloride, in 3 different doses compared to placebo, in patients with DLB.

Treatment lasted 14 weeks, including a 2-week prerandomization period followed by a 12-week randomization period. All participants were given placebo tablets during the prerandomization period, after which the patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to placebo, 3, 5, or 10mg of donepezil. The randomization list was computer-generated using a randomized block design to allocate several blocks (size 4) to each center. Patients were sequentially assigned to the lowest randomization number available at the time of each enrollment at each center. The randomization list was securely managed by an allocation officer, who was independent of all parties concerned with the study, at Bellsystem24, Tokyo, Japan, until study completion. Access to the list was not allowed except in emergency. Study personnel and participants were unaware of the treatment assignment. During the study period, the code was broken for 2 patients: 1 each in the placebo and 3mg arms because of serious adverse events (pelvic fracture and subarachnoid hemorrhage, respectively).</p><p>Patients received 2 study drug tablets, which were composed of a combination of 3mg, 5mg, or matched placebo tablets with the same physical appearance, once daily in the morning. Dosage was titrated at the beginning of the randomization period in the 5 and 10mg groups. In the 5mg group, treatment began with 3mg for 2 weeks, and then the dose was increased to 5mg. The 10mg group started with 3mg for 2 weeks, followed by 5mg for 4 weeks, after which the 10mg dose was provided for 6 weeks. The dose was escalated after patient safety was confirmed by telephone interview.</p></sec><sec id="ss2-3"><title>Procedures</title><p>This study had no formal predefined primary endpoint.

In addition, the MMSE and CIBIC-plus were analyzed by number of responders, defined as a &#x02265;3 point improvement on the MMSE and as -minimal improvement- or better on the CIBIC-plus. Fisher exact probability test was used to compare each active group to placebo. The dose-response relationship (linear or 5mg saturation) across the 3 doses was also analyzed, as a secondary analysis, by ANOVA with contrasts for the MMSE and NPI, and by Cochran-Armitage test with contrasts for the CIBIC-plus.

Patients given 5 or 10mg donepezil showed greater improvement in the majority of the cognitive and behavioral measures, including the MMSE and NPI. Donepezil treatment also led to improved global function and reduced caregiver burden in this population. Because consistent improvements in many different measures across broad domains were observed, despite the exploratory nature of this study due to several limitations as discussed below, we believe that our findings demonstrated encouraging effects of donepezil for patients with DLB.</p><p>The majority of cognitive measures showed significant between-group differences. In particular, there was an apparent improvement in overall cognitive function, especially with the higher 2 doses; the mean changes in MMSE score favored donepezil by 2.0 to 3.8 points. This difference was larger than that reported in other studies of ChEIs in DLB, AD, and Parkinson disease with dementia (PDD).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15"><sup>15</sup></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32"><sup>32</sup></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33"><sup>33</sup></xref> Improvement was also noted in the attentive-executive domains. We presume that a ceiling effect caused the nonsignificant outcome in the visuoperceptual domain.</p><p>Also noteworthy was the improvement of neuropsychiatric features and reduction of caregiver burden in the donepezil groups. The beneficial effect of donepezil was evident on each symptom domain characteristic of DLB (delusion, hallucination, and cognitive fluctuation), as generally consistent with the previous rivastigmine study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15"><sup>15</sup></xref> except for apathy. For NPI-2, a linear dose-response relationship was demonstrated. Caregiver burden also was reduced significantly at the highest dose, 10mg/day.</p><p>Patients who received donepezil also demonstrated improved global function, as measured by CIBIC-plus. A higher percentage of patients showed improvement, and fewer patients worsened in each donepezil group than in placebo. The beneficial effect seemed greater than those of ChEIs reported for patients with AD and PDD.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33 b34 b35"><sup>33-35</sup></xref> In a trial of rivastigmine for PDD, improvement of activities of daily living, which would reflect treatment-induced changes in cognitive, behavioral, and motor symptoms, was reported.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33"><sup>33</sup></xref> Such an outcome may also be useful to compare the clinically meaningful impacts of the treatment among trials.</p><p>AEs were not rare; however, only approximately 8% of the study population withdrew due to AEs, and the prevalence of withdrawal or AEs, including typical cholinergic side effects, did not differ among treatment groups. Although symptoms of parkinsonism were reported as AEs somewhat more frequently in the 3 and 5mg groups than in the placebo group, the difference was not reflected in the mean UPDRS part III score. Indeed, the score demonstrated numerical, although nonsignificant, improvement in the highest dose group. Cholinergic treatment theoretically exacerbates parkinsonism. However, the possible beneficial effects of donepezil observed in this study suggest that the use of ChEIs should not necessarily be avoided in the treatment of DLB due to concern of possible parkinsonism. These unexpected effects, despite not being confirmed, might be explained by a complicated neuronal network for motor control.</p><p>As the discontinuation rate was relatively low, and there was no significant difference among groups, it is unlikely that exclusion bias caused by early termination affected the efficacy results. Both the LOCF analysis and the mixed-effect model analysis consistently showed favorable results.</p><p>As an aim of this study was to explore targetable clinical presentations of DLB, we did not set a specific primary endpoint despite assigning multiple efficacy outcome measures, which could be a major limitation. In addition, cognitive fluctuation was measured by an unestablished tool, which is well equipped but not yet validated. Another limitation is that nearly half of the centers enrolled only 1 or 2 patients, which may have caused an inter-rater discordance of the clinical ratings, although a training and certification course was mandatory for the investigators. Also, the small sample, short duration of treatment, and lack of formal dose-response comparison are evident limitations. Nevertheless, the results of this study strongly suggest that donepezil is safe in patients with DLB, and provide a preliminary indication of its clinical effectiveness in terms of cognitive function, behavioral symptoms, and global function of DLB, and consequently in effecting a reduction of caregiver burden. The findings of the present study with donepezil should be verified in a confirmatory clinical trial. In addition, long-term effects should be examined. Although both 5mg/day and 10mg/day seemed to be beneficial, 10mg/day was somewhat more beneficial in terms of behavioral symptoms. The optimum dose should be determined in a follow-up trial, in which dose titration with patients unable to tolerate 10mg/day being allowed to take 5mg/day would be a sensible design.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The study was sponsored by Eisai Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan.</p><p>We thank all patients and caregivers for their participation in the study; all investigators and their site staff for their contributions; and the Eisai study team (M.
