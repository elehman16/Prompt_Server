Advantages of both spinal and epidural techniques are combined in CSE technique without much increase in the incidence of complications.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Various local anesthetics can be used either alone or combination with opioids in this technique. Bupivacaine was most commonly used but concerns about its cardiac toxicity and intensity of its motor block have led to the development of newer drugs such as levobupivacaine and ropivacaine.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Addition of opioids has synergistic effects as they act directly on opioid receptors in the spinal cord and help reduce the dose of local anesthetic required thus reducing their toxicity.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Various opioids that have been used for labor analgesia include morphine, meperidine, sufentanil, and fentanyl.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Fentanyl has the advantage of low cost, rapid onset, and relatively long duration of analgesia without significant motor blockade. However, it is also true that addition of opioids can be associated with pruritus, nausea and vomiting, fetal bradycardia, urinary retention, and maternal respiratory depression.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>Our primary aim of this study was to compare levobupivacaine and ropivacaine with fentanyl in terms of onset and duration of sensory and motor block after intrathecal dose, maternal and fetal outcome, side effects and complications, and maternal satisfaction score. In our study, we assumed that levobupivacaine is 1.31 times more potent than ropivacaine based on the study done by Sia <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>After approval from the Hospital Ethics Committee and obtaining written informed consent, 60 full-term primigravida of the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) health status Class I and II with singleton pregnancy and vertex presentation in the active stage of labor (cervical dilatation of &#x0003e;3 cm) were randomly allocated into two groups of 30 each.</p><p>Group A received 3 mg of isobaric levobupivacaine with 25 &#x000b5;g fentanyl intrathecally followed by epidural top-ups of 14 ml 0.125% isobaric levobupivacaine and 30 &#x000b5;g fentanyl making total volume of 15 ml.</p><p>Group B received 4 mg isobaric ropivacaine with 25 &#x000b5;g fentanyl intrathecally followed by epidural top-ups of 14 ml 0.2% isobaric ropivacaine and 30 &#x000b5;g fentanyl making total volume of 15 ml.</p><p>After confirming cervical dilatation of more than 3 cm, baseline heart rate (HR), noninvasive blood pressure, oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, electrocardiogram, and fetal HR were recorded. Baseline pain was also assessed using visual analog scale (VAS) (0 = No pain and 10 = Severe pain). An intravenous line was secured with 18-gauge intracath and parturients were preloaded with ringer lactate 10 ml/kg body weight in 20&#x02013;30 min. Parturients were placed in left lateral decubitus position and after skin infiltration at the L2-3 or L3-4 interspace, 18-gauge Tuohy needle was advanced slowly into the epidural space using the loss of resistance to air technique. Intrathecal drugs were given using 27-gauge Whitacre spinal needle and then epidural catheter was inserted 3&#x02013;5 cm into the epidural space. Epidural bolus dose was given when the patient reported two consecutive contractions as being painful or VAS &#x0003e;3.</p><p>Sensory block was assessed by loss of sensation to pinprick using 22-gauge blunt hypodermic needle. The onset of analgesia was taken as the onset of sensory block to T10 level and time taken to reach the same was noted. The highest level of sensory block achieved was also noted. Duration of analgesia was taken from intrathecal injection to the time of request of additional analgesia (VAS &#x0003e;3). Grade of motor block was checked using modified Bromage scale (0: full flexion of foot and knee, 1: just able to flex knees and free movement of foot, 2: able to move foot only, and 3: unable to move foot or knee). Onset and duration of motor block were noted.</p><p>Continuous hemodynamic monitoring of HR, respiratory rate, noninvasive blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and fetal HR was done. Readings were recorded every 2 min for the first 10 min, thereafter every 5 min until 30 min and then every 15 min until the end of delivery in both groups. Maternal hypotension was defined as a fall in systolic blood pressure of more than 20% from the baseline and was treated by giving additional ringer lactate and if necessary, injection ephedrine was given intravenously.</p><p>In case, instrumental delivery was required epidural dose was repeated 15 min before the procedure in both the groups. In those cases where there was evidence of fetal distress or failure to progress due to some obstetrical factors, cesarean section was performed by extending the block with 0.5% levobupivacaine in Group A and 0.5% ropivacaine in Group B.</p><p>Side effects and complications were assessed and documented. Obstetric outcome and Apgar scores at 1, 5, and 10 min were recorded. Patient satisfaction score was noted at follow-up visit after 24 h of delivery with a scale; 5 - Excellent, 4 - Very good, 3 - Good, 2 - Fair, and 1 - Poor.</p><p>Statistical analysis was performed using &#x0201c;unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test&#x0201d; for parametric data whereas for nonparametric data &#x0201c;Chi-square test&#x0201d; was used. <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c;0.05 was considered statistically significant and <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001 was considered statistically highly significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Both the groups were comparable with respect to demographic characteristics and baseline hemodynamic parameters [Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>].

It is increasingly being used these days for labor analgesia. Nowadays, low-dose local anesthetics are being used which selectively blocks the painful stimulus while preserving the motor function.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>Till date, there are relatively few studies examining the role of levobupivacaine and ropivacaine for labor analgesia. Both of these drugs were developed in response to reports of cardiotoxicity associated with accidental intravenous bupivacaine administration.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] In this study, we assumed that levobupivacaine is 1.31 times more potent than ropivacaine based on the study done by Sia <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>Mean onset of analgesia in Group A was 4.72 &#x000b1; 0.54 min and in Group B was 5.58 &#x000b1; 0.49 min. The onset of sensory block in Group A was found to be earlier than in Group B. Mehta <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] in their study comparing levobupivacaine and ropivacaine 15 mg intrathecally, showed mean onset of sensory block to be 4.38 &#x000b1; 1.53 min in levobupivacaine group and 5.45 &#x000b1; 1.00 min in ropivacaine group. Results of our study in terms of mean onset of analgesia are in accordance with the above study.</p><p>Duration of analgesia in group A and B is 117.00 + 11.86 and 90.17 + 8.85 mins respectively. Kim <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] in their study on 60 parturients, comparing 3 mg of ropivacaine and levobupivacaine mixed with 20 &#x000b5;g of fentanyl as a part of CSE technique, showed that intrathecal ropivacaine offered shorter analgesia (87 &#x000b1; 41 min) as compared to intrathecal levobupivacaine (122 &#x000b1; 56 min).</p><p>Neuraxial analgesia in addition to providing pain relief can cause motor blockade which can lead to inability to bear down by the mother. Use of low-dose local anesthetics these days for labor analgesia has significantly reduced the incidence of motor blockade.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] None of the parturients had motor impairment before the anesthetic procedure. Motor blockade was measured using modified Bromage scale.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] 24 (80.00%) parturients in Group A and 25 (83.33%) parturients in Group B had no motor blockade. Six (20.00%) parturients in Group A and 5 (16.67%) parturients in Group B developed Grade 1 motor block only. Motor block grade of 2 or 3 was not observed in either group. The difference between the two groups was statistically nonsignificant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05).</p><p>Differences in the incidence of side effects and complication between the two groups did not reach statistical significance (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05). Two (6.67%) parturients in Group A and 1 (3.33%) parturient in Group B developed hypotension. Hypotension responded to intravenous fluid administration. Intravenous ephedrine was not required in any patient. Nausea and vomiting occurred in 4 (13.3%) parturients in both groups. These parturients were given injection ondansetron 4 mg intravenously.</p><p>In our study, Apgar score was noted at 1, 5, and 10 min.

The babies who had Apgar score of 7 at 1 min in both groups were resuscitated by suction and oxygenation. In a study done by Purdie and McGrady[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] to compare epidural bolus administration of 0.1% ropivacaine and 0.1% levobupivacaine with 0.0002% fentanyl for analgesia during labor, it has been found that mean Apgar score at 1 min was 9 in both groups.</p><p>There are some limitations in this study. First, cord blood pH is an objective retrospective measure of the fetal exposure and response to hypoxia during labor. It could not be done in our set up due to some technical issues. Second, the result of our study could have been more precise if the sample size of study group would have been large, but the patient willing for labor analgesia were limited in our institution.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Hence, we conclude that labor analgesia was effective in both the groups but levobupivacaine group is better with respect to rapid onset and longer duration of analgesia compared to ropivacaine group.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Melzack</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The myth of painless childbirth (the John J.
