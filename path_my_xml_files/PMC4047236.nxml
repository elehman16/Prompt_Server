pulmonary function of patients with spinal cord injury. [Subjects] The subjects were
randomly allocated to an aqua group (n=10) and a land group (n=10). [Methods] Both groups
trained for 60 minutes, 3 times a week for 8 weeks. Pulmonary function was assessed by
measuring the forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory flow rate (FER), force
expiratory volume at one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) and force expiratory volume at one
second/forced vital capacity (FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC). [Results] Following the intervention,
the aqua group showed significant changes in FVC, FER, FEV<sub>1</sub>, and
FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC. The land group showed only significant differences FER.
[Conclusion] The results of this study suggest the effects on the aqua group were
significantly higher than those on the land group in patients with spinal cord injury.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Spinal cord injury</kwd><kwd>Aqua</kwd><kwd>Pulmonary function</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Spinal cord injuries (SCIs) are most often traumatic and caused by lateral bending,
dislocation, rotation, axial loading, and hyperflexion or hyperextension of the cord or
cauda equine. Motor vehicle accidents are the most common cause of SCIs, while other causes
include falls, work-related accidents, sports injuries, and penetrations such as stab or
gunshot wounds<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Persons with SCIs have a
high lifetime risk of serious debilitating and costly medical conditions such as pressure
ulcers, urinary tract infections, pain, spasticity, and respiratory<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In normal subjects, breathing occurs primarily through the use of the intercostal muscles
and the diaphragm<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, when this
condition is disrupted by an SCI, control of respiratory muscles (intercostal muscles)
innervated below the injury level is compromised, leading to respiratory muscle dysfunction
and pulmonary complications<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
weakening of the expiratory muscles may also cause a restrictive lung disease, which is
accompanied by lung volume reduction, including lung capacity. At the same time, the
weakening of inspiratory muscle strength reduces ventilation<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. These conditions are among the leading causes of death in patients
with SCIs<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>From the perspectives of physics and physiology, aquatic environments are beneficial in the
management of a variety of musculoskeletal, neurological, and cardiopulmonary
pathologies<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup> due to the advantages of
hydrostatic forces (buoyancy) and drag resistances unique to the water medium<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Aquatic exercises have advantages when full
weight bearing ambulation is not possible or contraindicated, such as for those who are
severely obese, arthritic, have balance limitations, or are in the early stages of
rehabilitation when joint range of motion should be actively progressed<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Masumoto et al.<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that walking
in water elicits higher muscles activities, higher cardiorespiratory responses, and
increased perceived exertion levels in older adults than walking on dry land at the same
speed. Jung et al.<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup> studied the
application of additional weights to the affected leg to reduce the limb circumduction
during aquatic treadmill walking in people poststroke. Baena-Beato et al.<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) reported that an aquatic therapy program decreased
levels of back pain and disability, increased quality of life, and improved health-related
fitness in adults with chronic low back pain. Alberton et al.<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that in water, cardiorespiratory responses to stationary
running exercise are higher on land in healthy women.</p><p>Although there have been many recent studies in aquatic environments, few studies on
pulmonary function in patients with spinal cord injury have been reported. Therefore, the
purpose of this study was to examine the effects of aquatic exercise on pulmonary function
in patients with spinal cord injury.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects of this study were 20 patients with spinal cord injury. The subjects were
provided with a full explanation of the experimental procedure, and all provided their
written consent signifying voluntary participation. This study was approved by the Sahmyook
University Human Studies Committee (SYUIRB2013-037). The subjects were inpatients at O
hospital in Pohang city which is located in the north Kyungsangbuk-do in Korea, diagnosed
with an American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) grade B, C, or D spinal cord injury at the
levels of C8 to L5. There were no significant differences in the injury levels and ASIA
grades between the groups in this study. The subjects were randomly divided into an aqua
group (10 subjects) and a land group (10 subjects); exercise programs were performed in
60-minute sessions three times per week, over a period of 8 weeks. The general

range of motion exercises and breathing exercises (10 minutes). (2) The main exercises were
upper extremity exercises for function including weight bearing to the left and right with
the arms spread out (90 degree angle) while sitting, moving forward and backward with the
hands clasped together while sitting, and moving a heavy ball (sensory-therapy ball) forward
and backward and left or right (40 minutes). (3) Cooling down included range of motion
exercise for flexibility and breathing exercises (10 minutes).</p><p>Pulmonary function was measured using a CardioTouch 3000s (BIONET, Tustin, CA, USA) in a
sitting position. The forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory flow rate (FER), force
expiratory volume at one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) and forced expiratory volume at one
second/forced vital capacity (FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC) were measured. The subjects received
sufficient education regarding the instrument&#x02019;s use before measurement.</p><p>SPSS version 12.0 was used for all statistical analyses. The dependent variables were the
pulmonary function parameters. The general characteristics of the subjects and variables
followed a normal distribution. The paired t-test was used to determine whether there were
changes in pulmonary function between before and after the training. The independent t-test
was used for analysis of changes in dependent variables between groups. Results were

pulmonary function in SCI patients. Respiratory complications are the most common cause of
morbidity and mortality in SCI<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>, and
Lisa<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that lung disease can
contribute to cardiac dysfunction in several ways. Lung disease invariably threatens oxygen
transport by its effects on respiratory mechanics and ventilation-perfusion matching. To
compensate, the heart attempts to increase cardiac work. Overall, ventilation and oxygen
transport are less efficient. Hypoxemia secondary to inadequate ventilation-perfusion
matching may predispose the patient to cardiac dysrhythmias. Possessing an understanding of
these topics is assumed to be of great importance for clinicians involved in the care
rehabilitation of patients with a spinal cord injury, as well as for researchers in the
field, especially when armed with knowledge that pulmonary complications remain a major
cause of morbidity and mortality in this population<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. The present study shows that FVC, FEV<sub>1</sub>,
FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC, and FEF improved in both groups (p&#x0003c;0.05). However, FER improved in
the land group (p&#x0003c;0.05), and there was also a significant between-group difference in FVC
and FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC (p&#x0003c;0.05).</p><p>Estenne et al.<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that
progressive resistance training improves expiration of ventilator function in people with
SCI. Roth et al.<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup> reported implications
for breathing exercise in treatment of patients with an SCI that may reduce respiratory
morbidity and improve outcome. Walker et al.<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup> reported a combination of incentive spirometry and arm ergometry
improves vital capacity (VC) and increases the maximum volume of expired air during
exercise. Mclachaian et al.<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup> reported an
increase in FVC and FEV<sub>1</sub> throughout the training period and that the absence of a
change before or after training suggests that passive abdominal FES training can be used for
respiratory rehabilitation in SCI. Soyupek et al.<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that body weight supported treadmill training
significantly improves cardiopulmonary functions in patients with an incomplete SCI. It is
also that such advanced research coincides with the results of this study showing that the
functional training applied both in water and on land has a significant effect on
improvement of FVC, FEV<sub>1</sub>, FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC, and FEF, which is considered to
support the reliability and suitability of the intervention program. It is also considered
that future intervention programs for patients need to include training that can cope with
daily danger and complex environments like functional training. Stevens and Morgan<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that while an underwater
treadmill training program meaningfully improved motor function by improving stability
during transfers to walking, Leal et al. reported that water immersion training
significantly improved VC in SCI. Also Gass et al.<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that aquatic training improved VO<sub>2</sub>. Such an
advanced research coincides with the results of this study finding that referred to
hydrostatic pressure and is the second property of water. The degree of hydrostatic pressure
that is exerted upon the tissue depends on two factors, the density of the fluid and the
depth of immersion. When the fluid density increases, so does the hydrostatic pressure. When
an individual who is standing or sitting is immersed in water to the shoulder level, the
hydrostatic pressure exerted will assist the VC while at the same time resisting inspiratory
capacity. This effect will result in strengthening of the diaphragm and intercostal muscles.
Training in water can be largely applied to many patients, as it can be easily applied to
patients with various illnesses in every age group, and the impact on the joints can be
largely reduced by the buoyancy of water in the case of functional training in water. In our
study, although measurements of pulmonary function showed that FVC, FEV<sub>1</sub>,
FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC, and FEF were improved in both the groups, the error decreased more in
the aquatic exercise group than in the land exercise group. Therefore, we assume that
aquatic exercise therapy is more effective than land exercise therapy, even though land
exercise therapy is also effective.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><person-group><name><surname>Bogdanov</surname><given-names>EI</given-names></name></person-group>: Spinal Injury.
