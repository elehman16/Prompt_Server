in a given environment. Decreased ability to control balance may increase the fear of
falling, which may decrease mobility. Body balance is believed to be controlled by the
visual, vestibular and proprioceptive systems, which have been shown to be stimulated by
spiritual meditation, religious prayers and yoga<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Body balance can be
improved by a variety of tasks that require movement of the center of gravity, a narrowed
base of support and high velocity movements<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. More generally, the therapeutic significance of movement-based
interventions including Yoga, Tai Chi etc. was recently emphasized on neuro-cognitive
aspects<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. As a result of the growing
popularity of movement-based interventions, many researchers focus on clinical research in
this area.</p><p>Islamic &#x02018;salat&#x02019; prayers include both spiritual meditation and physical movements of various
parts of the body and they are believed to improve equilibrium, balance, and joint
flexibility as well as maintain lower limb performance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Each regular prayer includes a series of postures, movements and
Quran recitations, along with other specific supplications. The prayer starts in a standing
posture. Subsequently, the individual bends at the waist placing the hands on the knees
while keeping the back straight (bowing). The worshipper then returns to the standing
position before adopting a prostrate position with the forehead, nose, hands, knees, and
balls of the toes touching the ground for several seconds. The forearms and elbows should be
raised off the floor during prostration (Sujud). The worshipper sits on the legs for a few
seconds before rising to stand. This sequence of motion is called &#x02018;rakah&#x02019;. Rakah is repeated
2&#x02013;4 times depending on the statutory number of &#x02018;rakah&#x02019; in each specific prayer. There are
five mandatory (regular) prayers performed between morning and night each day. Clinically,
it is not appropriate to recommend Islamic prayer as an exercise to facilitate the visual,
vestibular and proprioceptive systems until its efficacy is proven. Therefore, the changes
in the dynamic balance of people practicing Islamic prayers need to be tested and compared
with non-practicing individuals. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect
of Islamic prayers on dynamic balance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>A convenience sample of 72 healthy males from King Saud University, Riyadh, was recruited
for the present study. However, only 60 subjects were included in the present study as per
the inclusion-exclusion criteria. All the protocols were approved by the research ethical
committee of College of Applied Medical Sciences, King Saud University, Riyadh. The aims of
the present study, the procedures involved and the potential risks of the study were
explained to each subject, and their written consent to participation was obtained prior to
the study. Subjects were aged between 25 and 35&#x02005;years with a mean age of 31 &#x000b1; 5&#x02005;years And a
mean BMI of 27 &#x000b1; 2&#x02005;kg/cm<sup>2</sup>. The subjects were divided into two equal groups
(n=30): one group of subjects who regularly practiced Islamic prayer, and another group of
non-practicing subjects. The inclusion criteria for the Islamic prayer group were those who
regularly performed Islamic prayer as scheduled (5 times per day) during the last 5&#x02005;years
and those who did not regularly practice any particular established religious customs were
included in the non-practicing group. Potential subjects were excluded from the study based
on the following considerations: obesity, neurological disorders including peripheral
neuropathy, oculovestibular disorders and major musculoskeletal conditions, such as
complicated back, hip and knee pain. Subjects taking medications such as sedatives,
hypnotics, anxiolytics, and antidepressants were also excluded. Both subject groups
performed normal sedentary life activities and were not involved in any other exercise
regimes or sports.</p><p>The standing dynamic balance of both groups was measured using the Balance Master (NeuroCom
International, Inc., Clackamas, USA). The balance testing procedure measured the limits of
stability (LoS) with subcomponents of reaction time (RT) (sec), movement velocity (MVL)
(deg/sec), end point excursion (EPE) (%), maximum excursion (MXE) (%) and directional
control (DC).</p><p>The dynamic balance assessment was performed by observing the LoS, as described by Garc&#x000ed;a
et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. The subjects were asked to stand
barefoot on the force platform standing upright with their eyes open and to adopt the
position of greatest stability on the dual force plates while looking at a computer monitor
located to the front and at eye level. The arms were relaxed and remained parallel to the
sides of the body. The toes were positioned approximately 25&#x02005;cm apart. The foot position was
determined by positioning a standard plastic triangle between the feet and removing it
before data acquisition. The distance between the heels and the angle between the feet were
8&#x02005;cm and 30&#x000b0;, respectively. During the test, the participants were instructed to maintain
their COG position relative to a central target and to move to eight different target
positions without altering their base of support. The subjects were asked to move a cursor
on the monitor and follow the rhythmic motion of a moving target while projecting their
center of gravity toward 8 targets located on the computer screen at intervals of 45&#x000b0;. The
subjects were given 10 sec to move their center of gravity to each target and remain in that
position for as long as possible. The anterior and posterior targets were located
vertically, and the antero-lateral, lateral, and postero-lateral targets were placed
symmetrically on the left and right sides. The data collected for all eight locations were
RT (sec), MVL (deg/sec), EPE (%), MXE (%) and DC.</p><p>RT represents the time in seconds between the command to move and the patient&#x02019;s first
movement. MVL is the average speed of COG movement in degrees per second. EPE is the
distance of the first movement toward the designated target, expressed as a percentage of
the maximum LoS distance. MXE is the maximum distance achieved during the trial. DC is a
comparison of the amount of movement in the intended direction (toward the target) to the
amount of extraneous movement (away from the target).</p><p>The independent t-test was performed to analyze the data using SPSS for Windows, Version
17.0.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The healthy adult subjects practicing Islamic prayer recorded statistically significant

Islamic prayer was significantly better than that of the non-practicing individuals. The
results could be related to the physical and mental activities associated with Islamic
prayer. Religious meditation and prayers have been found to promote relaxation and a
healthier, more balanced condition of the human mind and body<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Studies on the benefits of &#x02018;salat&#x02019; have revealed that it improves not only spiritual
well-being, but also mental and physical health, improving muscle strength, joint mobility
and blood circulation, when performed correctly and with the right postures<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. A study reported that the motion of the
joints and concentric and eccentric muscle actions during prayer play an important role in
postural stability and balance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
choice of this sensorimotor task was justified in that it involves only low-amplitude body
movements and that control of the latter requires only low-intensity forces. More precisely,
maintaining body sway requires body movement control via activation of muscular reaction
forces through the points of contact with the ground. This means postural stability depends
on muscle components and visual, proprioceptive, tactile and vestibular sensory inputs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Other studies of humans during weight
bearing have also reported thresholds of joint receptors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref><sup>)</sup> vision, joint, and vestibular receptors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The central nervous system (CNS) has to integrate information received from several sensory
inputs in order to regulate upright control of the center of mass (COM). These inputs come
from vestibular, visual, and somatosensory sources and originate from within a number of
different body segments. Depending on the balance task the proportion of these inputs used
to balance control may vary<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>During the preparation for &#x02018;salat&#x02019;, worshippers clean and gently massage their feet for
several seconds with water five times daily. This action is believed to facilitate the
plantar sensory organs thereby improving dynamic balance. An intuitive relationship is known
to exist between increasing loss of foot sensibility and loss of balance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. The maintenance of standing dynamic
balance depends on a range of somatosensory inputs. Tactile sensitivity within the foot
strongly influences the maintenance of standing balance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. Massage therapy has also been shown to positively affect balance
control<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Lower-limb sensory information may originate from mechanoreceptors in the feet, joint
receptors in the capsule of the ankle, cutaneous receptors adjacent to the ankles and
proprioceptors within the leg muscles. Small postural movements produce relatively large
pressure changes under the feet because of the large mass of the body; therefore, receptors
in the feet may provide significant information about body sway. There is some evidence that
receptors in the feet may provide significant sensory input to control standing<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. The act of regularly cleaning and
massaging the feet during ablution in preparation for the prayer ritual may be a source of
sensory stimulation increasing the sensory input and improving the balance of subjects
practicing the Islamic prayer regime.</p><p>After standing and reciting verses from the Quran, worshippers bow with an 80&#x02013;90&#x000b0; forward
movement of the vertebral column at the lumbar joint over the hip joints with both arms
straight and the hands grasping the two extended knees. After a few seconds, the worshipper
gradually returns to the standing position until the vertebral column is vertical<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. Stretching of the spinal extensor,
hamstring, and calf muscles occurs in the bowing position. Holding the stretches for several
seconds would increase the flexibility of the stretched muscles. A previous study showed
that hamstring flexibility is a core component in the maintenance of postural stability and
balance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. Increased hold times during
stretching of the hamstring muscles resulted in increased &#x0fb02;exibility<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. A stretching program performed regularly for several
weeks resulted in meaningful improvements in a range of motions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. Hamstring activation has also been observed with respect
to reach in the posterior direction<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref><sup>)</sup>.
These cited studies provide an explanation for the better standing dynamic balance observed
in the Islamic prayer-practicing group compared to that of the non-practicing group.</p><p>Movement from standing to bowing to standing during prayer may function as an exercising
help the worshipper adjust the center of gravity over the feet and to control balance when
the center of gravity falls out of the base support. Poor adjustment of the center of
gravity is known to impair balance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The postural and tonic labyrinthine reflexes are initiated by the force of gravity on the
receptors of the otolithic organs in the utricle of the inner ear. The vestibular system is
integral to balance control. The paired vestibular organs include three orthogonal
semicircular canals and two otolith organs, which provide continuous input to the brain
about rotational and translational head motion and the head&#x02019;s orientation relative to
gravity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref><sup>)</sup>. The movements performed
during salat from the vertical natural position to prostration at different speeds may
improve the sensitivity of the vestibular system, which maintains the steadiness of postural
equilibrium.</p><p>During &#x02018;salat&#x02019;, frequent changes in body posture, joint angles, muscle length and speed of
movement generate complex positional senses in the brain stem and cerebellum<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref><sup>)</sup>. The concentric and eccentric actions of
all the postural antigravity muscles help strengthen the flexors and extensors of the neck,
spine and knee, and improve flexibility, especially the dorsiflexor, hamstring and erector
spinae muscles. The physiological and biomechanical changes occurring in the Islamic prayer
regime may explain the better dynamic standing balance observed in the subjects practicing
Islamic prayer.</p><p>The results of the present study show that movement velocity and maximum excursion were
lower in the non-practicing group. Decreased movement velocity may indicate impaired muscle
fiber recruitment and adaptive behavior to minimize risk<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, postural control during a functional activity, such as
leaning toward a target, can be improved by daily Islamic prayer in the same manner as
passive coping strategies such as external locus control and chance locus control.
Directional control and maximum excursion, which are indicative of body position in space
and movement coordination, were low in the non-practicing group. The non-practicing subjects
appeared to exhibit less postural control and perception owing to infrequent activation of
the trunk and lower extremity flexor and extensor muscles and limited facilitation of the
somatosensory and vestibular systems compared with subjects practicing Islamic prayers five
times daily.</p><p>In summary, the result of the present study support the assumption that religious
meditation and prayers (such as Islamic prayers) beneficially influence human performance,
particularly balance. Islamic prayer routines may present beneficial training protocols for
improving dynamic standing balance. Therefore, any exercise protocol proven to be beneficial
to humans should be consider beyond its religious aspect. As it is known that dynamic
balance is better in subjects practicing a particular religious regime, future research
should investigate the fall rate of the elderly in relation to this concept.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to extend their appreciation to the Research Centers, College of
