Four years after stroke, 67% of stroke patients perceive the non-use of their affected arm-hand as a major problem <xref rid="pone.0096414-Broeks1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Loss of arm-hand function and, consequently, loss of arm-hand performance limits the execution of activities of daily living, leading to greater dependency, restricted social participation and decreased quality of life <xref rid="pone.0096414-NicholsLarsen1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0096414-Wolfe1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Patients receive rehabilitation to improve arm-hand function, and even in the chronic stage after stroke, arm-hand performance may further improve with training <xref rid="pone.0096414-Prange1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0096414-Page1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Robot-supported therapy is a rehabilitation method allowing patients to train their arm-hand with high intensity, a large amount of practice and minimal use of therapists' time. Several studies concluded that robot-supported arm-hand training may be a valuable rehabilitation method <xref rid="pone.0096414-Conroy1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0096414-Kwakkel1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0096414-Lo1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0096414-Mehrholz1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0096414-Mehrholz2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p><p>The ultimate goal of arm-hand rehabilitation is to improve the use of the affected arm-hand in the home situation of the patient during the execution of activities of daily living, i.e. improvement on ICF activity level <xref rid="pone.0096414-World1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Initially, many studies using robot-supported therapy focused on training and improvements at ICF function level <xref rid="pone.0096414-Prange1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0096414-Kwakkel1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0096414-Mehrholz2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. However, literature has shown that a task-oriented training approach (ICF activity level) may be more effective in improving arm-hand skilled performance (AHSP) of stroke patients <xref rid="pone.0096414-VanPeppen1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Some studies combined robot-supported arm-hand training with task-oriented training <xref rid="pone.0096414-Hsieh1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0096414-Liao1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, i.e. robot-supported training at ICF function level, followed by short periods of functional activity training (ICF activity level) without robotic support. Therapy in the control groups consisted of similar training at ICF function level without robot-support, followed by training of functional activities. In general, both groups improved on arm-hand performance as assessed by, among others, the FMMA (Fugl-Meyer Motor Assessment), MAL (Motor Activity Log) and ABILHAND <xref rid="pone.0096414-Hsieh1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0096414-Liao1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. However, the robot-supported groups improved more than the control groups. Other studies investigated the effectiveness task-oriented robot-supported training (i.e. robot-assisted training on activity level). For example Houseman et al. investigated the effectiveness of task-oriented training with the robotic exoskeleton T-WREX in chronic stroke patients and found improvements in arm-hand use at ICF function level as well as ICF activity level <xref rid="pone.0096414-Housman1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. In addition, several other studies showed improvements at ICF activity level <xref rid="pone.0096414-Lo1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0096414-Hsieh1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.</p><p>Next to the training method, the assessment of arm-hand performance is also very important when determining intervention effects. Multiple instruments are available to assess arm-hand performance at ICF activity level, i.e. tests to measure a person's capacity, perceived performance or actual performance <xref rid="pone.0096414-Lemmens1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Large differences exist between measurements in a standardized lab situation (capacity), perceived performance and actual performance in daily life <xref rid="pone.0096414-Uswatte1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0096414-Lang1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Although the ultimate goal of rehabilitation is to improve performance in the home situation, hardly any studies assess actual arm-hand performance, - i.e. improvements in arm-hand use in the home situation -, after robot-supported training. Only the study of Liao et al. <xref rid="pone.0096414-Liao1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> combined arm accelerometry, measuring arm activity ratio, with robotic training. Arm accelerometry can be used to determine actual performance and has been proven to be valid and reliable in measuring upper extremity activity in stroke patients <xref rid="pone.0096414-Lang1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0096414-Uswatte2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0096414-vanderPas1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Accelerometers have the advantage of being able to measure unobtrusively and continuously in daily life. Both duration of arm use and intensity of arm activity can be determined with accelerometers. Duration of arm use is defined as the time the arm and hand is active, expressed in minutes or expressed relative to the total time someone is awake.</p><p>Intensity of use is defined as the magnitude of arm activity, i.e. the total amount of activity expressed in counts <xref rid="pone.0096414-CambridgeNeurotechnologyLtd1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>.</p><p>The aim of the present study was to assess the extent to which accelerometers can be used to determine the effect of robot-supported task-oriented arm-hand training - relative to task-oriented arm-hand training alone - on the actual amount of arm-hand use of chronic stroke patients in their home situation</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Methods and Materials</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Participants and study protocol</title><p>In the current study, which is a sub-study of a larger single-blind randomized controlled trial called TEST-TRACS (Technology-Supported Task-oriented Training of Arm-hand function in persons with Chronic Stroke, ISRCTN 82787126) <xref rid="pone.0096414-Timmermans1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, 16 chronic stroke patients, who all received their rehabilitation treatment at Adelante Rehabilitation Centre (Hoensbroek, The Netherlands), agreed to participate. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0096414-g001">Figure 1</xref> shows the CONSORT flowchart representing the number of patients throughout the trial.

Assuming a clinical relevant improvement of 10%, an estimated standard deviation of 8% and, a two-sided alpha of 0.05 and a power of 0.80, twenty-two subjects should be included in the study.

The only difference between these methods is the use of the robotic system Haptic Master in T-TOAT. The (T-)TOAT method is based on part practice, i.e. the trained skills were divided into parts, which were first practiced in isolation and gradually combined into the complete task (chaining method <xref rid="pone.0096414-Magill1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>). The difficulty of the task parts was gradually increased and shaping principles were applied <xref rid="pone.0096414-Uswatte3" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Variability of practice was, next to within-task exercise variety, also achieved by using multiple real life materials differing in size, structure, texture and fabric. The use of objects and the high number of repetitions facilitated coordination in task-related movements of the arm and hand <xref rid="pone.0096414-Hubbard1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0096414-Wu1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Specificity of practice was implemented by including tasks of daily living in a realistic environmental context to provide correct sensory information that elicited relevant problem solving strategies. The tasks were repeated frequently to accomplish a high intensity and a large amount of practice. Random practice (i.e. performing multiple tasks from different skills, in a random order) was implemented to enhance retention <xref rid="pone.0096414-Schmidt1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. In addition, distributed practice was applied to avoid fatigue, optimize cognitive effort and support memory consolidation <xref rid="pone.0096414-Schmidt2" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. The motivation of the participants was increased by including real-world tasks which were meaningful and engaging to the participants <xref rid="pone.0096414-Timmermans3" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Furthermore, an active role of the participant in the rehabilitation process was obtained through personal goal setting and control in the training program (exercise and material choice) to encourage motivation and treatment compliance.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Robotic system</title><p>The robotic system Haptic Master (MOOG, Nieuw-Vennep, NL) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0096414-g002">figure 2</xref>) was used for the arm-hand training in the RR-group. Haptic Master is an end-effector based robotic device with three active degrees of freedom (DoF). A gimbal was attached to the Haptic Master connecting the forearm of the patient with the Haptic Master, thereby adding 3 extra (non-actuated) degrees of freedom. This gimbal was specifically designed for the task-oriented training, allowing the hand to be free to grasp and manipulate real objects in the three dimensional space. The Haptic Master is suitable for medium sized workspaces <xref rid="pone.0096414-LindeVander1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref> and tasks in both sitting and standing position can be performed. Training with Haptic Master was possible in both passive mode and active mode.

From the accelerometer signal, maximal signal intensity per second (I<sub>max/sec</sub> i.e. the highest peak within each consecutive second) was identified. Next, for every 2 consecutive I<sub>max/sec</sub>, signal amplitudes of these two peaks were summed. The resultant is expressed in units of &#x02018;counts&#x02019; <xref rid="pone.0096414-CambridgeNeurotechnologyLtd1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. In essence, the &#x02018;raw&#x02019; accelerometer signal was transformed into an &#x02018;activity count signal&#x02019;. The data was imported using the software Sleep-&#x00026;-Activity-Analysis 11.7 (CamNtech Ltd, Cambridge, UK) and were further analysed using Matlab version 2006a (The MathWorks Inc., Natick, MA).</p><p>Patients wore the wrist accelerometers for 72 consecutive hours (an incomplete day, followed by two complete days and an incomplete day). During the arm-hand training, the accelerometers were taken off, as arm-hand use during training did not reflect the actual arm-hand use at home. Only data from the two complete days were used for analysis. As accelerometers were waterproof, there was no need to take them off during, for instance, bathing. Uptime (T<sub>up</sub>) was defined as the time span between first arm activity detected in the morning and last arm activity detected in the evening/night. To determine the uptime, the activity count signals of both arms were filtered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0096414-g003">figure 3a and b</xref>) using a 4<sup>th</sup> order zero time-lag low-pass Butterworth filter. Cut-off frequency was 0.0025 Hz. However, in a few cases where signal variability was still too high, a cut-off frequency 0.00125 Hz was applied to correctly identify the uptime. Next, the filtered signals of the 2 arms were summed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0096414-g003">figure 3c</xref>). Using the resultant signal, first and last arm activity during each day was detected by setting the minimal signal amplitude (&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;threshold), indicating genuine arm activity, at 10 counts/min. This threshold was computed, based on signal variance recorded during rest periods. The first data point crossing this threshold, which was followed by prolonged activity levels well above the threshold (thus disregarding short epochs of e.g. rest), was identified as the start of the uptime. Similarly, end of uptime was identified as the last data point before the signal crossed the threshold, followed by a prolonged period of sub-threshold signal intensity. Night time data was discarded. The raw activity signals of both arms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0096414-g003">figure 3d</xref>) were used for all further calculations.</p><fig id="pone-0096414-g003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0096414.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Data processing.</title><p>A) Raw activity count data (solid) and filtered data (dashed) of the left hand; B) Raw activity count data (solid) and filtered data (dashed) of the right hand; C) Filtered data of both hands and summation of filtered data, including start points (+) and endpoints (O) of uptime; D) Raw activity count data of both hands including start points (+) and endpoints (O) of uptime.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0096414.g003"/></fig><p>Actual amount of arm-hand use was calculated in several ways, focusing on the duration of use and the intensity of use of the affected arm-hand. In order to be able to investigate the use of the affected arm-hand alone, or in combination with the unaffected arm-hand, a distinction was made between unimanual use and bimanual use. Duration of use is expressed as &#x02018;hours of arm-hand use relative to the uptime&#x02019;, since skills are generally performed during waking hours. Duration of use of the affected arm-hand was subdivided into a) duration of use during unimanual activity of the affected arm-hand and b) duration of use during bimanual arm-hand activity. Intensity of use was defined as the sum of counts (signal intensity per data point) within a given time epoch, thus producing the &#x02018;area under the curve&#x02019;. For both the affected arm-hand and the unaffected arm-hand, intensity of use was calculated as total intensity. For the affected arm-hand, intensity of use was further subdivided into a) intensity of use during unimanual activity of the affected arm-hand and b) intensity of use during bimanual arm-hand activity. In addition, the ratio between total intensity of the affected arm-hand and total intensity of the unaffected arm-hand was calculated. <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0096414-t001">Table 1</xref> gives an overview of the variables regarding actual amount of arm-hand use and how they were calculated.</p><table-wrap id="pone-0096414-t001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0096414.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Variables used to calculate the actual amount of arm-hand use.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone-0096414-t001-1" xlink:href="pone.0096414.t001"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Abbreviation (unit)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Definition</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">T<sub>up</sub> (hour)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Time span between first arm activity detected in the morning and last arm activity detected in the evening/night, displayed in hours</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">D<sub>aff-uni</sub> (%)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">(Hours with only activity of the affected arm-hand)/(T<sub>up</sub>) * 100%</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">D<sub>bi</sub> (%)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">(Hours with bimanual arm-hand use)/(T<sub>up</sub>) * 100%</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">I<sub>tot-aff</sub> (activity/hour)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">(Sum of acceleration counts of the affected arm-hand during unimanual activity of the affected arm-hand and during bimanual activity)/(hours with only activity of the affected arm-hand + hours with only bimanual activity)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">I<sub>tot-unaff</sub> (activity/hour)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">(Sum of acceleration counts of the unaffected arm-hand during unimanual activity of the unaffected arm-hand and during bimanual activity)/(hours with only activity of the unaffected arm-hand + hours with only bimanual activity)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">I<sub>aff-uni</sub> (activity/hour)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">(Sum of acceleration counts of the affected arm-hand during unimanual activity of the affected arm-hand)/(hours with only activity of the affected arm-hand)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">I<sub>aff-bi</sub> (activity/hour)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">(Sum of acceleration counts of the affected arm-hand during bimanual activity)/(hours with only bimanual activity)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">R<sub>tot-aff/tot-unaff</sub>

This is in contrast with results from a clinical trial performed by Liao et al. who found an improved arm activity ratio after robot-supported training <xref rid="pone.0096414-Liao1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. However, their patients had a more severely affected arm-hand function, probably resulting in a larger effect size regarding training <xref rid="pone.0096414-Timmermans4" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Furthermore, their training was more intensive (though shorter) and featured another robotic system (Bi-Manu-Track). The overall time spent on therapeutic activity in Liao's study was similar to that in the present study. Furthermore, the patients of Liao et al. received robot-supported training at ICF function level, followed by 15 minutes training at ICF activity level without robot-support. In contrast, the RR-group patients in our study received only task-oriented robot-supported training, and no additional training without the robotic system. Moreover, there were some differences between the two studies in how actual arm-hand use was measured. For instance, Liao et al. used triaxial accelerometers compared to uniaxial accelerometers in the present study. In addition to the arm activity ratio calculated in both studies, the present study also investigated the activity of the affected arm and the unaffected arm separately, and distinguished between unimanual and bimanual use of the arm-hand.</p><p>The fact that the present study found no additional effects of the robot-supported training is in line with a study of Kahn et al, where similar effects were found for the robot-supported reaching group and the unassisted reaching group <xref rid="pone.0096414-Kahn1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Patients included in the present study had a high level of arm-hand function. This might be a reason why no effects of the robot-supported training were found. Patients with a lower level of arm hand function might benefit more from the robot-supported training because the robotic support might reduce problems associated with e.g. muscle weakness <xref rid="pone.0096414-Hesse1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>.

However, despite an improvement in arm-hand capacity (measured with the ARAT) and perceived performance (measured with the MAL), no improvements on actual arm-hand use as measured by accelerometry were found. Several explanations may be given regarding for why patients perceive themselves to be using their arm-hand more at home, in contrast to the data on their actual use of arm-hand, as measured objectively with accelerometers in the present study. First of all, patients' perception of performance is apparently not only guided by amount of use, but also by other, more quality-related reflections regarding their arm-hand performance. Amount of use provides information about the duration and intensity of arm-hand use. It must be considered that a greater amount of use may not necessarily reflect a better quality of performance. Secondly, the activity, registered during 2 entire days, will not only include task-related activities, but also non-functional movements, unintentional activity, and arm activity as a result of general body movement (e.g. during walking). Accelerometry as used in the present study is not capable of discriminating between activities or specific activity-related arm-hand movements and general or unintentional arm-hand movements. Discrimination between such activities would, however, be very interesting in order to detect what kind of activities the patients perform, and whether or not patients changed or improved their activities or started to perform new activities (i.e. activities they were not able to perform before the intervention) with their affected arm-hand as a result of the training. If a patient can perform an activity he could not perform before intervention, this is a positive effect of the training. But if this new activity is performed instead of another activity, the total activity count measured with accelerometers might not change, thus obscuring any positive effects. Fortune and co-workers combined accelerometry with gyroscopes and energy-expenditure to categorise activities, based on their activity level <xref rid="pone.0096414-Fortune1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. A combination of accelerometers, gyroscopes and magnetometers has been shown to be useful in recognising activities involving the lower limb, such as walking, jumping and cycling <xref rid="pone.0096414-Altun1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. The use of multiple sensors may also be useful for recognising activities involving the arm-hand <xref rid="pone.0096414-Barman1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0096414-Lemmens2" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>.</p><p>Next to the amount of use, quality of use is also an important variable in assessing arm-hand performance. Quality of use may cover different constructs, for instance, the physical effort needed to perform a skill, the efficiency, safety or independence with which a skill is performed or parameters describing the execution of the movement such as velocity or smoothness <xref rid="pone.0096414-Rohrer1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Study Limitations</title><p>Several methodological considerations related to the present study exist. Firstly, despite the randomisation procedure, participants in the RR-group demonstrated less arm-hand activity at baseline in terms of duration of use of the affected arm-hand during bimanual activity (D<sub>bi</sub>) and the intensity of use of the affected arm hand (I<sub>tot-aff</sub>). It is yet unknown to what extent this might have influenced our results. However, no significant between-group differences exist at baseline regarding demographics and arm-hand function as measured with clinical tests. Furthermore, for the between-group analysis the difference in I<sub>tot-aff</sub> at baseline is taken into account by calculating difference scores between measurements.</p><p>Secondly, 5 patients were included with a post-stroke time &#x0003c;12 months. However, since all patients were in the chronic phase after stroke, i.e. &#x0003e;6 months post-stroke <xref rid="pone.0096414-Kwakkel2" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0096414-Peter1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>, it is unlikely that this has influenced the results.</p><p>Thirdly, the low sample size combined with high variance could have caused the lack of statistical significance in improvements in actual amount of arm-hand use. The high variance is probably caused by the fact that the actual arm-hand use was measured during daily life and not in a standardized environment. Low sample size can be explained by the intensity of the training program (i.e. 4 times a week, for 8 weeks in total). This high intensity resulted in a rather small number of patients willing to participate.</p><p>Lastly, there was a between-group difference in the number of patients whose dominant hand was affected. It would have been plausible to expect patients whose dominant hand is affected, to use their affected arm-hand more than patients whose non-dominant hand is affected. However, at baseline the contrary was observed.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Conclusion and future research</title><p>Accelerometers, as used in the present study, did not reveal significant within-group changes for either duration or intensity of actual arm-hand use following task-oriented arm-hand training, with or without robot-support. In addition to the amount of use, additional information to discriminate between specific activities and information about the quality of use of the affected arm-hand is essential to further elucidate (the quality of) actual arm-hand performance. Future research on actual arm-hand performance should assess these quality-related phenomena. However, the instruments to do so are still lacking <xref rid="pone.0096414-Lemmens1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Research should therefore focus on the use of other sensors, additional to accelerometers, and advanced data analyses methods, in order to provide information about the performance of specific activities and the quality of use.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0096414.s001"><label>Protocol S1</label><caption><p>
