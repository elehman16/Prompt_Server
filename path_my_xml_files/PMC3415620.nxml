Participants who completed the FREEDOM trial were eligible to enter an extension to continue the evaluation of denosumab efficacy and safety for up to 10 years. For the extension results presented here, women from the FREEDOM denosumab group had 2 more years of denosumab treatment (long-term group) and those from the FREEDOM placebo group had 2 years of denosumab exposure (cross-over group). We report results for bone turnover markers (BTMs), bone mineral density (BMD), fracture rates, and safety. A total of 4550 women enrolled in the extension (2343 long-term; 2207 cross-over). Reductions in BTMs were maintained (long-term group) or occurred rapidly (cross-over group) following denosumab administration. In the long-term group, lumbar spine and total hip BMD increased further, resulting in 5-year gains of 13.7% and 7.0%, respectively. In the cross-over group, BMD increased at the lumbar spine (7.7%) and total hip (4.0%) during the 2-year denosumab treatment. Yearly fracture incidences for both groups were below rates observed in the FREEDOM placebo group and below rates projected for a &#x0201c;virtual untreated twin&#x0201d; cohort. Adverse events did not increase with long-term denosumab administration. Two adverse events in the cross-over group were adjudicated as consistent with osteonecrosis of the jaw. Five-year denosumab treatment of women with postmenopausal osteoporosis maintained BTM reduction and increased BMD, and was associated with low fracture rates and a favorable risk/benefit profile. &#x000a9; 2012 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>BONE MINERAL DENSITY</kwd><kwd>BONE TURNOVER MARKERS</kwd><kwd>DENOSUMAB</kwd><kwd>FRACTURE</kwd><kwd>PIVOTAL FRACTURE TRIAL EXTENSION</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Increased bone resorption after menopause leads to loss of bone mass and microstructural deterioration which significantly increase fracture risk. Receptor activator of NF-&#x003ba;B (RANK) ligand plays an essential role in mediating resorption through osteoclast formation, function, and survival.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>) Denosumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits RANK ligand.</p><p>In the pivotal, 3-year, placebo-controlled FREEDOM trial,(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>) administration of 60 mg denosumab subcutaneously every 6 months to postmenopausal women with osteoporosis significantly reduced bone turnover markers (BTMs), increased bone mineral density (BMD), and reduced new vertebral, hip, and nonvertebral fractures by 68%, 40%, and 20%, respectively.</p><p>Osteoporosis is a chronic disease requiring long-term treatment. Therefore, characterization of the long-term efficacy and safety of denosumab is essential for clinical practice. Accordingly, FREEDOM has been extended, in an open-label design, for an additional 7 years, during which all participants receive denosumab. The extension includes two populations: those who had received denosumab for 3 years during the core trial (long-term group) and those who had received placebo for 3 years during the core trial (cross-over group). We report the effects of denosumab on BTMs, BMD, fracture rates, and safety for the first 2 years of the extension.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Patients and Methods</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>The FREEDOM core trial design and results have been published.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>) In short, FREEDOM was a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 3-year, global study. Enrolled women were aged 60 to 90 years with a lumbar spine or total hip BMD T-score between &#x02212;2.5 and &#x02212;4.0 at either site. Participants were randomized to receive 60 mg denosumab (Prolia&#x000ae;; Amgen Inc., Thousand Oaks, CA) or placebo subcutaneously every 6 months for 3 years, in addition to daily calcium (&#x02265;1 g) and vitamin D (&#x02265;400 IU). All women who completed the core trial (ie, completed their 3-year visit, did not discontinue investigational product, and did not miss &#x0003e;1 dose) were eligible to enter the extension. During the extension, all participants are scheduled to receive 60 mg denosumab subcutaneously every 6 months for 7 years with daily calcium and vitamin D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>). The study is ongoing and the preplanned data analyses reported here include the first 2 years of the extension, representing up to 5 years of continued denosumab exposure.</p><fig id="fig01" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Study design showing the 3-year FREEDOM study and the 7-year extension.

Participants are scheduled to receive 60 mg denosumab subcutaneously every 6 months (&#x000b1;1 month) for 7 years beginning on day 1. For this report, all efficacy and safety assessments continued with the same methodology used during FREEDOM.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>) Measurements of serum C-terminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen (CTX) and procollagen type I N-terminal propeptide (P1NP) were obtained from a subset of women who participated in the FREEDOM BTM substudy and continued in the extension (CTX: baseline, day 10, and months 3, 4, 6, 12, and 24; P1NP: baseline, day 10, and months 6, 12, and 24). Undetectable values were imputed using the corresponding assay's established lower limit of detection value (CTX, 0.049 ng/mL; P1NP, 10 &#x000b5;g/L) as previously reported.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>) BMD measurements were performed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) at the lumbar spine and proximal femur (all women) and at the 1/3 radius (subset of women). Vertebral fractures were identified by a central facility (Synarc, Inc.) using the Genant semiquantitative grading scale using thoracic and lumbar lateral radiographs obtained at extension baseline and year 2.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>) A prevalent fracture at baseline was defined as a vertebral body with a semiquantitative grade of &#x02265;1. As was prespecified in the original protocol, a new vertebral fracture was identified when there was &#x02265;1 grade increase from a previous grade of 0 in any vertebra between T4 and L4, excluding fractures associated with high trauma severity or a pathologic fracture. Nonvertebral fractures included low-trauma fragility fractures only, as defined previously.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>) Clinical fractures required confirmation by diagnostic imaging or a radiologist's report. At all study visits, adverse events (AEs), clinical fracture information, and concomitant medications were recorded. Each potential case of osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) was reviewed by an independent, masked, external, expert adjudication committee, as described previously.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>)</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>The primary objective of the extension is to describe the safety and tolerability of denosumab. Secondary objectives include evaluation of the changes in BTMs and BMD, and the incidence of vertebral and nonvertebral fractures.</p><p>Safety analyses included participants who received &#x02265;1 dose of investigational product. New adverse events occurring during the extension were coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Authorities (MedDRA v13.0). For consistency, MedDRA v13.0 will be used for coding and reporting adverse events for the duration of the extension study. The analyses of AEs were descriptive and included exposure-adjusted subject incidence rates. Analyses of BTM percent change from baseline required observed values at baseline and the time points of interest. Results are presented as medians and interquartile ranges. Analyses of BMD percent change from baseline required observed values at baseline and the time points of interest. Percent changes in BMD were analyzed using the likelihood-based repeated measures model(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>) including treatment, age stratification variable, visit, baseline value, densitometer type, treatment-by-visit interaction, and baseline value-by-densitometer type interaction as fixed effects using an unstructured variance-covariance structure. Visit was treated as a categorical variable. Kenward and Roger's approach(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>) was followed for estimating the denominator degrees of freedom for the hypothesis test. Results are presented as least squares means with 95% confidence intervals. Finally, we calculated crude subject incidence rates for new vertebral fracture (multiple fracture occurrences were counted once per subject) and Kaplan-Meier estimates of the cumulative incidence of nonvertebral fracture.</p><p>Because all subjects in the extension received denosumab, we used a simulation method developed for such an extension study design(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>) to estimate expected fracture rates in a hypothetical cohort of long-term placebo controls (so-called &#x0201c;virtual twins&#x0201d;), with the baseline characteristics of the long-term denosumab subjects. First, linear, Poisson, and logistic prediction models were developed using actual FREEDOM data on BMD, fracture history, body mass index, age, and smoking status for subjects who received placebo during the 3 years of FREEDOM and enrolled in the extension study. These models were then used to predict fracture outcomes for the denosumab-treated women who entered the extension had they received placebo for 5 years (virtual twins).</p><p>Final FREEDOM data were reported previously,(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>) and are summarized in this manuscript to illustrate the extension results. For BTMs and BMD, only data from women enrolled in the extension are presented.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Of the 7808 participants enrolled in the core trial, 5928 (76%) were eligible for enrollment in the extension (ie, completed their 3-year visit, did not discontinue investigational product [IP], and did not miss &#x0003e;1 dose) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2</xref>). Of these, 4550 (2343 long-term, 2207 cross-over) enrolled in the extension, corresponding to 77% of those eligible to enroll and 58% of those enrolled in the original FREEDOM study. By year 2, 3782 (83% of those enrolled) remained on study. The long-term and cross-over groups address two distinct considerations: (1) the impact of continued denosumab administration past 3 years, and (2) the reproducibility of the FREEDOM results.

The data from the cross-over group confirmed the findings from the FREEDOM trial.</p><p>Phase three trials for anti-osteoporotic agents generally have placebo control arms, but the placebo assignment cannot be continued indefinitely in consideration of the well-being of those participants.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>) However, long-term exposure is important for assessment of both safety and efficacy of this chronic condition. The efficacy assessments are limited by the lack of an ongoing control group. Projections based on the fracture rate of the placebo group, adjusted for age, have been used as a referent in an effort to address this problem.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>) Subsequently, a more sophisticated model has been developed and validated.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>) In the FREEDOM study, the use of the placebo group to generate data for such a model was planned, and for the present report, this independently-validated model was used to project fracture rates for a virtual group of placebo-treated &#x0201c;twins&#x0201d; of the participants. This model takes into account several risk factors. While this method provides a useful tool for assessing treatment efficacy, it rests on the unverifiable assumption that outcomes for the virtual twins can be predicted without bias from the available data. Simulations suggest that the method is reasonably robust against selection bias, but vulnerable to secular trends in the underlying fracture risk.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>) Although there are inherent limitations to the inferences drawn from such models, fracture rates for the extension and cross-over groups were consistently below these estimates.</p><p>A main objective of the extension is to describe the safety of denosumab. The subject incidences of all, serious, and fatal AEs during the first 2 years of the extension were similar to or lower than those reported by the FREEDOM placebo and denosumab groups. Incidences of malignancy and infection (such as cellulitis or erysipelas) were low and showed no trend toward increases over time, and there was only a single serious skin infection in the cross-over group. There were no atypical femoral fractures in either group. Although cases of ONJ have now been observed in patients receiving denosumab, the incidence remains low.</p><p>Thus, our findings demonstrate a progressive increase in bone density and sustained but not progressive decrease in bone turnover, and are consistent with maintenance of anti-fracture efficacy. There was no apparent increase in the risk of AEs with extended exposure. The cross-over group sustained a single serious skin infection and two events adjudicated as ONJ, while confirming the previous efficacy observations. Denosumab remained a useful medication for osteoporosis over 5 years of exposure.</p></sec><sec><title>Disclosures</title><p>This study was funded by Amgen Inc.
