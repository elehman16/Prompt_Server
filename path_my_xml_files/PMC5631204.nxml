Here we investigate the frequency of viral blips in virologically-suppressed subjects switching to rilpivirine/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (R/F/TAF) vs. maintaining R/F/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and the association of viral blips with clinical outcome through Week 48 of study GS-US-366-1216.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>GS-US-366-1216 is a randomized, double-blind, phase 3b study evaluating the safety and efficacy of switching to R/F/TAF from R/F/TDF in HIV-1-infected virologically-suppressed subjects. For the viral blip analysis, treated subjects with &#x02265;1 post-baseline HIV-1 RNA value were included. All on-drug HIV-1 RNA data points and FDA snapshot outcome data through Week 48 were utilized. Plasma HIV-1 RNA was measured using the Roche Taqman 2.0 assay. A viral blip was defined as any post-baseline HIV-1 RNA value &#x02265;50 c/mL preceded and followed by HIV-1 RNA &#x0003c;50 c/mL.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><p>Of the 627 subjects included in the analysis, 23 (3.7%) experienced &#x02265;1 blip through Week 48 and were distributed similarly between treatment groups (10/315, 3.2% R/F/TAF; 13/312, 4.2% R/F/TDF; <italic>P =</italic> 0.53; median 6 viral load measurements per subject). Twenty subjects had single blips (8 R/F/TAF, 12 R/F/TDF) and 3 subjects experienced 2 blips each (2 R/F/TAF, 1 R/F/TDF). Of 26 total blip events, 19 (73%) were low-level at 50&#x02013;199 c/mL. Among subjects with blips, 22/23 (96%) were virologic successes at Week 48 (9/10, 90% R/F/TAF; 13/13, 100% R/F/TDF), similar to those subjects without blips (568/604, 94% overall; 287/305, 94% R/F/TAF; 281/299, 94% R/F/TDF). One subject in the R/F/TAF group had 2 blips prior to experiencing virologic rebound with mutations also detected at baseline (determined by retrospective proviral DNA sequencing).</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Viral blips were infrequent among subjects switching to R/F/TAF or maintaining R/F/TDF through Week 48 of study GS-US-366-1216. No differences in blip frequency or virologic failure post-blip were observed between treatment groups. Most blips were low-level (&#x0003c;200 c/mL) and most subjects with blips remained suppressed through Week 48.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Disclosures</title><p>
