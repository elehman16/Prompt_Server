dynamic visual acuity in healthy young participants. [Subjects and Methods] This study was
a double-blinded, prospective, randomized, controlled trial. Thirty healthy young subjects
(ages 21 to 30&#x02005;years) participated in the study. Participants were randomly divided into
an experimental group (n=15) and a control group (n=15). The experimental group performed
an exercise designed to induce neck muscle fatigue and the control group preformed
non-fatiguing sham exercises. [Results] There were significant differences in mean dynamic
visual acuity between the two groups (0.26&#x000b1;0.11 LogMar versus 0.003&#x000b1;0.02 LogMar). Subjects
in the experimental group showed a significant decline in their dynamic visual acuity
compared with the control group. Dynamic visual acuity strongly correlated with neck
muscle fatigue (r = 0.79). No significant differences in joint position error were
observed between the two groups and no significant correlations between joint position
error and neck muscle fatigue were observed (r = 0.23). [Conclusion] The results of this
study suggest that neck muscle fatigue negatively impacts dynamic visual acuity. Although
not statistically significant, cervical spine proprioception as measured by the joint
position error in the experimental group was diminished after fatigue.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Dizziness</kwd><kwd>Cervical vertigo</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Postural and visual stability are dependent upon efficient and accurate central processing
of visual, vestibular, and somatosensory afferent input<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. This afferent input undergoes multimodal sensory integration in
several areas of the brain and brainstem in order to provide efferent output to maintain
postural equilibrium and oculomotor control<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Inaccurate sensory information from dysfunctional sensory end
organs leads to a sensory mismatch, causing postural and/or visual instability<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Sensory mismatch can result from several
causes including, but not limited to, vestibular disorders, neurological disease,
pharmacology, and cervical spine trauma<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Somatosensory information from the cervical
spine can be altered as a result of direct trauma<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Cervical spine trauma can lead to
cervical spine muscle fatigue and modify the discharge firing rate of upper cervical sensory
receptors<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Somatosensory information from the
upper cervical spine is transmitted through nerve cells originating mainly from the C2
dorsal root ganglion<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Mechanoreceptors in the upper cervical spine converge in the
central cervical nucleus (CCN)<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. The CCN serves as a pathway to the cerebellum, which
integrates and organizes vestibular, ocular, and proprioceptive information<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Disturbances in the neural connections
between the three sensory systems can lead to mismatched sensory input, causing conflicts
among all inputs from the different sensory systems which cause dizziness, unsteadiness, and
visual disturbance<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. For example, altered somatosensory input, particularly from the
upper cervical spine structures, can disturb the vestibular system<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Clinical research
has shown that when experiencing such disturbances, patients become less able to utilize
vestibular information to resolve inaccurate and irregular information from the
somatosensory and visual systems<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Moreover, evidence suggests that upper
cervical muscle fatigue may be an important contributing factor to altered postural
stability in people with neck pain because neck muscle fatigue has been shown to modify the
discharge of sensory receptors in neck muscles and affect proprioception<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Pinsault and Vuillerme<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup> investigated the
relationship between neck muscle fatigue and cervical spine proprioception using the joint
position error (JPE) test. Subjects were asked to relocate their head back to center as
accurately as possible after full active cervical rotation to the left and right sides<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Subjects were randomly allocated to
cervical spine muscle fatigue and control groups<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Less accurate and less consistent cervical joint repositioning was
observed in the fatigue group which were correlated with abnormal afferent input from the
neck joint and muscle receptors<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Revel et al.<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup> assessed cervicocephalic
kinesthetic sensibility in patients with cervical pain. Their results demonstrated that
patients with cervical pain had significantly less accurate head repositioning performance
compared with their control group<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Heikkila and Astrom<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup> investigated the
effects of neck somatosensory disturbance in patients with cervical whiplash trauma. They
found that patients with chronic dysfunction after whiplash trauma were significantly less
accurate than a control group in their ability to relocate their heads in space after
actively rotating them away from the reference position<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Nicolas et al.<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup> investigated the
effects of cervical muscular fatigue on postural control under multiple sensory conditions
and determined that cervical muscle fatigue increased the center of foot pressure
displacement in the absence of vision<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Their results indicated that there is a correlation between neck muscle fatigue and impaired
postural stability<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Stapley et al. examined whether patients with cervical spine whiplash injuries had an
increase in postural body sway after contractions of their dorsal neck muscles<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Sway was measured during stance in 13
patients before and after performing 5 minutes of isometric dorsal neck muscle
contractions<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. They found that after
performing the contractions, seven subjects had signs of fatigue via electromyography and
increased sway<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. This study demonstrated
the link between neck muscle fatigue and impaired postural stability<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. It also suggested that balance and postural control could
be altered in healthy subjects by inducing fatigue in the neck muscles<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Deficits in oculomotor control have also been reported in
patients with cervical trauma<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Tjell and Rosenhall<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup> observed that
altered smooth-pursuit eye movement occurred in subjects with neck trauma when their neck
were rotated. These findings suggest that normal eye movement is partially dependent upon
accurate sensory input from the cervical spine<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. There is also evidence to suggest that the cervical spine
influences eye movements via the vestibular system<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Stimulation of the deep cervical spine mechanoreceptors has a
measurable impact on the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR)<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Pardoan et al.<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup> investigated the
interaction between neck proprioception and the VOR<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. They used a rotary chair to passively rotate 16 healthy subjects
facing forward and with their heads passively turned 70 degrees to either side<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. The VOR gain tended to be lower when the
subjects were rotated with their heads turned in the direction opposite to the direction of
rotation compared with when they were rotated in the same direction but with their head
facing forward<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. The results of this
study suggest that there is a measurable interaction between neck proprioception and the VOR
in subjects with normal vestibular function<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Also, abnormal neck muscle proprioceptive signals may give rise to
asymmetric functioning of the VOR and contribute to postural and visual instability<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Interaction between cervical spine proprioception and the VOR has been observed in a very
limited number of studies and its impact on the human VOR is not fully understood<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. The purpose of this investigation was to
determine the effects of cervical muscle fatigue on dynamic visual acuity (DVA) and JPE.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study was conducted in the Department of Physical Therapy, King Abdulaziz University,
Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Thirty adults participated in the study. Fifteen participants (8 males
and 7 females) were randomly allocated to the experimental group and 15 participants (7
males and 8 females) were randomly allocated to the control group. Informed consent was
acquired prior to the beginning of the study from participants. The study protocol was
approved by the Institutional Review Board at King Abdulaziz University. Potential
participants were recruited based on the following criteria: healthy young adults between
the ages of 21 to 30&#x02005;years without current cervical spine pain or history of cervical spine
whiplash injury. Participants were required to pass all comprehensive screening tests to
ensure normal function of the somatosensory, visual, and vestibular systems. Screening tests
included all of the following: cervical stability (alar ligament test, Sharp-Purser test,
and lateral shear test), cervical vascular screening using the modified vertebral artery
test, vestibular system screening (Hallpike-Dix test, roll test, head thrust test, head
shaking-induced nystagmus test, and condition 5 of the NeuroCom SMART Balance
Master<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>system<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>, static and
dynamic visual acuity and cervical spine somatosensory integrity (JPE). To be included in
the study, all screening test results had to be negative. The study recruited a cohort of 30
participants and informed consent was obtained from each subject. A post power analysis with
an effect size of 1.1 according to the change in DVA between the cervical spine muscle
fatigue and control groups, an alpha level of 0.05 and a sample size of 30 indicated that
the power was 0.89.</p><p>Randomization of group assignments was accomplished using a computer-generated random
sequence. The two main outcome variables were the VOR as measured by the computerized
dynamic visual acuity (cDVA) and cervical joint position sense as measured by the JPE test.
The VOR and JPE measurements were taken before and after the intervention. Data were
collected for all participants between 8 am and 12 pm to minimize the effects of normal
fatigue<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Consort flow diagram for the study</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jpts-27-259-g001"/></fig>).</p><p>We used the computerized DVA (cDVA) InVision<sup>TM</sup> system to determine the ability
of participants accurately perceive objects while actively moving their heads. The cDVA is
commonly used when evaluating patients with possible VOR dysfunction and other vestibular
deficits<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. Static visual acuity was
determined followed by dynamic visual acuity<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. The difference between the two test scores was calculated and the
result was converted into LogMar, which is a measure of visual acuity loss. According to
Herdman et al.<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>, changes of one line
(0.1 LogMAR) or less (&#x02264; 0.1) are considered normal and changes of two or more lines (&#x0003e;
0.2) are abnormal<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. The cDVA is a
reliable and sensitive tool for identifying patients with vestibular dysfunction resulting
from an impaired VOR<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. The sensitivity of the cDVA is reported to be 94.5% and
the specificity is reported to be 95.2%<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. The positive predictive value is 96.3% and the negative predictive
value is 93%<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. We used the JPE test to
measure the cervical spine somatosensory system<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Participants sat on a chair 90&#x02005;cm away from a fixed target on a
wall while wearing a head strap with a top-mounted laser pointer<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. They were instructed to focus on the target then close
their eyes and remember the starting position of the head, specifically the &#x0201c;zero target&#x0201d;.
Keeping their eyes closed, the participants maximally rotated their heads to one side, and
then returned their heads to the starting position as accurately as possible<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. No instructions concerning speed were given<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. The new position of the laser light was noted and the
distance from the starting point was measured (reposition error distance)<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. The test was repeated 10 time for each
rotation direction in random order<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. The head repositioning absolute value
(AE) in centimeters was calculated<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. A normal JP is less than or equal to 4.5
degrees<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. We used the&#x02005;mVAS to subjectively measure
the participant&#x02019;s upper posterior neck muscle fatigue level<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Participants in both groups rated their level of fatigue before and
after the intervention. The&#x02005;mVAS was a number scale from 0 to 10<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. A score of 0 was
defined as no fatigue at all and 10 was defined as the most fatigue imaginable<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. Participants in the experimental group
sat on a customized neck exercise machine. With their head and neck in a neutral position,
participants isometrically resisted a weight stack load for of the 5 minutes<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. The load used in the weight stack was equal
to 30% of the participant&#x02019;s maximum voluntary contraction (MVC)<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup> which was
determined for each subject using a dynamometer. Participants performed 3 MVC and the
average reading obtained from the dynamometer (in pounds) was used for represented the MVC
for each participant<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. In order to limit trunk muscles from contributing during the
contraction, a normal gait belt was used during MVC and 5 minutes isometric exercise to
stabilize their trunk to the back support of the neck exercise machine<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. The neck fatigue level of the participants was measured
immediately following the 5 minutes of isometric exercise<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Participants sat on a chair facing a wall while wearing a head strap with a top-mounted
laser pointer attached. Four targets of the same shape and width (center, down, left, and
right) were fixed to the wall at the subject&#x02019;s eye level. The sham exercise began with the
participant&#x02019;s head in a neutral position (eyes straight ahead). Participants pointed the
laser inside the large circle of the center target. From this starting position,
participants were instructed to point the laser inside the second target by moving their
head slightly and then returning the laser to the center target. Participants repeated the
same activity for all targets as follows: center-down, center-right, and center-left for a
total of 5 minutes (including two1-minute breaks). This sham exercise was designed to not
fatigue the cervical muscles. The eyes of the participants were open during this exercise
and no instructions concerning speed were given. Data was collected by researchers blinded
to group assignment. Participants were instructed not to reveal their intervention
allocation to the researchers during data collection.</p><p>Data were analyzed using the SPSS for Windows version 19.0 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
Frequencies and relative frequencies were computed for gender, and means and standard
deviations (SD) were calculated for the continuous variables age, DVA, and JPE. The
&#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test of independence was used to assess the relationship between gender and
type of group at baseline, and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was applied to test for the
normality of continuous variables. The Mann-Whitney U-test was performed to compare the&#x02005;mVAS
scores between the two groups at baseline. The difference between&#x02005;mVAS, DVA, and JPE values
at baseline and at the end of the study were calculated and these the differences were
compared between the two groups using the independent sample t-test. Spearman&#x02019;s correlation
and regression analysis were used to examine the relationship among DVA, JPE, and&#x02005;mVAS at
the end of the study. The level of statistical significance was set at p &#x0003c; 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Fifteen participants were randomly allocated to the experimental group and fifteen were

score. The results indicated that&#x02005;mVAS was a significant predictor of DVA (R<sup>2</sup> =
0.59). Approximately sixty percent of the variability in the DVA was explained by its
relationship with the fatigue score.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The purpose of the present investigation was to determine the effect of neck muscle fatigue
on dynamic visual acuity in healthy young adults. Thirty young healthy participants were
randomly assigned into either a neck muscle fatigue group or a sham group. Dynamic visual
acuity test scores were used to measure the gaze stability, and JPE test scores were used to
measure cervical joint repositioning accuracy. Our results determined that neck muscle
fatigue negatively impacts DVA. Although not statistically significant, a trend was observed
suggesting that neck muscle fatigue negatively impacts JPE, as determined by less accurate
and less consistent repositioning performances in the fatigue group versus the sham group.
Our findings are consistent with previous studies, which reported, that reduced
proprioceptive acuity contributes to sensory mismatches and possibly an asymmetry of the
VOR<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. This phenomenon is probably due to disturbances in the neural
connections between the three sensory systems (somatosenory, vestibular, and vision) that
can lead to mismatched sensory input, causing conflicts among all inputs from the different
sensory systems<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup>. Moreover, our results demonstrated a strong positive linear
relationship between DVA and neck muscle fatigue<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><sup>)</sup>. This is likely because neck muscle
fatigue has been shown in previous studies to modify the discharge of sensory receptors in
neck muscles and affect proprioception<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Consequently, neck muscle fatigue may
affect the neural connections between the three sensory systems, which may be the main cause
of the gain increase in VOR<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Dorsal neck muscle fatigue induces postural instability,
but not visual vertical misperception<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><sup>)</sup>.
One study found no significant difference between with and without aframe in the road and
frame test (RFT) when testing participants in a sitting position<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus, when assessing vestibular function in patients
complaining of dizziness and/or visual disturbance with a history of neck trauma, one may
speculate that VOR dysfunction could have a cervical origin due to somatosenory disturbance,
which may lead to visual disturbances and dizziness. Recently, the rod and frame test (RFT)
or tests measuring the perception of the subjective visual vertical (SVV) and subjective
visual horizontal (SVH) have been used to study the functional effects of either neck pain
or whiplash<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><sup>)</sup>. Furthermore, thoracic
spine thrust manipulation proved effective in the treatment of individuals with neck pain,
leading to a reduction in both pain and disability<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref><sup>)</sup>. Another study reported that patients with mechanical neck pain who
were treated with thoracic spine manipulation and exercise exhibited significantly greater
improvements in disability in both short- and long-term follow-up periods<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, we identified several
limitations in the present study. Our study was conducted on healthy normal young adults.
Future research should include healthy adults of various ages. Also, future studies should
include patients with whiplash associated disorder (WAD) in order to measure the effects of
neck trauma and pain on dynamic visual acuity. Finally, the effects of neck muscle fatigue
on DVA should be compared in subjects in standing versus sitting. The results of this study
suggest that neck muscle fatigue negatively impacts dynamic visual acuity. Although not
statistically significant, cervical spine proprioception in the experimental group was
diminished after fatigue as measured by the JPE. Clinical application of these findings
suggests that patients with CGD may experience improved DVA and cervical proprioception
through rehabilitation efforts directed at reducing cervical muscle fatigue.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This project was funded by the Deanship of Scientific Research (DSR), King Abdulaziz
