The experimental group received eight sessions (total 360 minutes) of the teaching intervention for four consecutive weeks, while the control group did not engage in any related courses. The self-compiled questionnaire for the student&#x02019;s knowledge, attitudes, and intentions toward cyber bullying prevention was adopted. Data were analysed through generalized estimating equations to understand the immediate results on the student&#x02019;s knowledge, attitudes, and intentions after the intervention.

The victim belongs to a physically or psychologically weaker minority group than the aggressor (bully). Bullying is a set of repeated actions of bully against the bullied (victim) <xref rid="pone.0064031-Ma1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.</p><p>Depending on the means and ways, bullying can generally be divided into six types: verbal-bullying, physical-bullying, sexual-bullying, social-bullying, defensive-bullying, and cyber bullying. Cyber bullying takes place in cyber space. Cyber bullying is arising from the popularization of the computer network and communication technology in recent years is also known as electronic bullying, SMS bullying, digital bullying, or online bullying.</p><p>Bullying has several social, emotional, mental health and academic effects <xref rid="pone.0064031-Merrell1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0064031-Bacchini1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.

However, cyber victims demonstrated a higher level of depression than other forms of bullying <xref rid="pone.0064031-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.</p><p>Cyber bullying has been increasing rapidly for the last few decades with the intense use of internet, sms, mms and other electronic media. It has been emerged as a major concern for the teachers, academicians and school authorities. Hence, the growing prevalence of cyber-bullying demands adequate research for prevention including mainly teachers and academicians. Teaching young students the correct knowledge and attitude toward cyber bullying control has become an important issue.</p><p>WebQuest is a theme-based teaching activity that has been widely accepted by scholars and teachers <xref rid="pone.0064031-WebQuest1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. This teaching strategy aims to assist students engaging in exploratory learning activities through network resources. Teachers design the targets of tasks to help learners concentrate more effectively on information use rather than the search for information and assist them to engage in higher levels of analysis, integration, and assessment-based thinking activities.</p><p>Cyber bullying media varies with the different habits of the technology-use in different regions, including use of email, blogs, websites, chat rooms, mobile phones, instant messaging, web pages, text messages, online voting websites, and online games. Cyber bullying comes in quite diverse forms such as online debates of mutual accusations, harassment, slander, imitation, disclosure, fraud, exclusion, and network tracking <xref rid="pone.0064031-Kowalski1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. In Taiwan, cyber bullying is one of the major school health problems <xref rid="pone.0064031-Ministry1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. WebQuest is a teaching activity that assists students, engaging in online (cyber) exploratory-oriented teaching activities. Cyber bullying problems encompass within cyber world. In the current study, an effort was mead in Taiwan school to use the WebQuest course, designed to determine if the course does indeed contribute to the student&#x02019;s correct knowledge and attitude toward cyber bullying, as well as their intentions to reduce cyber bullying.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>The Concept and Framework of WebQuest</title><p>WebQuest is a set of student-centered and exploration-oriented learning activities presented in a webpage layout.

Cyber-bulling prevention WebQuest course can immediately enhance the knowledge and reduce the intention of cyber-bulling and is successful for retaining learning effects. To the best authors knowledge, first time an effort was made to utilize WebQuest course to educate school students for cyber-bulling prevention. However considering the small-scale study the current effort can be seen as a pilot study, warranting large-scale studies for further generalization.</p><p>The results have indicated that the course can immediately and effectively enhance the knowledge of cyber-bulling and has after learning retention effects. These findings are same as the results of the research by Hsing-Fang <xref rid="pone.0064031-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, but different from that by Hsing-Kuo <xref rid="pone.0064031-Kang1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Study by Hsing-Kuo found that the core values of the WebQuest were to improve students&#x02019; capacities for analysis, synthesis, and evaluation, but schools&#x02019; mid-term tests could not measure these capacities <xref rid="pone.0064031-Kang1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. According to our observations on teaching, the WebQuest course designed for our research is mainly task-oriented learning, in which students can develop a peer support system in the processes of problem solving or completing learning tasks. The level of cooperation among peers combined with the WebQuest design framework has a great influence on the effectiveness of learning knowledge.</p><p>The results of our research have failed to find evidence of the effectiveness of the intervention on improving the attitude towards cyber-bulling. These findings are same as the results of Yen-Yu&#x02019;s study <xref rid="pone.0064031-Lin1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, but different from the results of Wen-Cheh&#x02019;s study <xref rid="pone.0064031-Hsueh1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Yen-Yu&#x02019;s study found that the course content had less emphasis on developing a concept but had emphases on the learning of knowledge and behavior change <xref rid="pone.0064031-Lin1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. The researcher believes that the small sample size and short experimental sessions are the reasons why our experiment does not have a significant effect. It takes a long time to change the attitude towards cyber-bulling; therefore, it is not easy to change students&#x02019; attitudes toward cyber-bullying after only a four-week course. Considering the study as a pilot one, further long experimental sessions with large number of students are warranted which may have different results.</p><p>The course for the present study can immediately and effectively reduce the cyber-bullying intention and has after learning retention effects. These results are in line of Kuo-Chin&#x02019;s study <xref rid="pone.0064031-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. This is because the course content makes students be aware of the formal rules of the internet usage, enhances the self-protection prevention measures from an internet security viewpoint, and finally guides students to learn responsibilities and justice through the internet law. These have a great influence on the cyber-bulling intention.</p><p>Experience of the current study indicates that the teaching methods of the WebQuest course can be vivid and vigorous. The course content can primarily be on a daily-life basis. It is better to give a number of examples to increase students&#x02019; awareness and sympathy. Other teachers in the teaching team may be invited to join a discussion and work together on the resources provided by the resource web pages. Students of similar age to the subjects of the research can be invited to provide their views of WebQuest web pages. Other teachers in the team can be invited to come to the classroom to help the researcher keep a record of observations on the classroom. In addition to keeping a record of what happens in the classroom, peer teachers can also give objective advices about the teaching and can support and encourage one another. Information literacy and internet ethics can be added to the course. Other course contents in information field can also be explored. It is warranted that for the related research in the future, the sample sizes of the experimental and the control groups can be increased.</p><p>The current study has tested a new intervention with a newly designed scale. The study is a pilot designed as a preliminary test of the measure and the intervention. Based on pilot study purposes and results following conclusions can be drawn. The cyber-bulling prevention WebQuest course can immediately enhance the knowledge of cyber-bulling and has after learning retention effects. The cyber-bulling prevention WebQuest course does not have significant effects upon improving the attitude towards cyber-bulling. The cyber-bulling prevention WebQuest course can immediately and effectively reduce the cyber-bulling intention and has after learning retention effects. However, we need a large-scale study before it&#x02019;s universal implementation.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0064031-Smith1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Smith PK, Sharp S (2006) The problem of school bullying.
