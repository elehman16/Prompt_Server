In Iran like many other developing countries, companionship during childbirth is not routine practice, also given the wide range of cultural and societal differences in childbirth practice in Iran and there is no study to assess effects of the presence of support person during labor in Iranian women. Therefore, the present study was designed to examine the effects of the presence of continuous support person (mother, sister, female close relative or female friends) with or without routine interventions during labor and delivery in Isfahan, Iran.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>Between Jul, 2011, and Apr, 2012, in a double-blind randomized controlled trial, 100 pregnant women in spontaneous labor who referred and hospitalized in Shahid Beheshti hospital, Isfahan, Iran, enrolled and studied. The main objective of this study was to assess the effect of the presence of a companion as a support person during labor. Patients aged between 18 and 35 years were eligible, if they had a singleton normal full-term pregnancy and patient desire to have natural vaginal delivery, 38 to 42 weeks of gestation, spontaneous onset of labor and normal birth with no special procedures or consultation who had delivered a singleton infant with no history of obstetric, medical or psychological problems. Also, women were eligible if their family or a female friend was available to stay in the hospital throughout the birth process. Exclusion criteria included women, who had chosen to have a caesarean section, and had cervical dilatation of more than four centimeters at the time of admission or were having induction and augmentation. The study was approved in Isfahan University of Medical Sciences for quality of design and ethical integrity and was reviewed annually. All women voluntarily consented to take part in the study and written informed consent was obtained from all of them.</p><p>Patients meeting the eligibility criteria were selected in a simple non-random manner and randomly divided into four 25-member groups. Group 1 included women who received routine intervention with a support person. Group 2 included women who received routine intervention without support person. Group 3 included women who received support person without routine intervention. Group 4 included women who did not receive routine intervention or a support person. Additionally, all patients in four study groups received routine care, included: Monitoring of uterine contractions, bleeding, fetal medicals care and other usual hospitals&#x02019; medical cares. Also, patients entered to the study were held in reserve in private room to keep the privacy of patient and her support.</p><p>At the beginning of the study, patients and support persons were informed about labor process. And the support persons were guided, to support the laboring woman and were careful to take their role. A support person was defined as a &#x0201c;non-member of the health team in care of the patient in labor, who is close to the person, such as mother, sister, or friend, who the patient wants present with her in the delivery room. The role of the support person in labor includes provision of continuous presence, reassurance and praise, comforting touch, massage, warm baths/showers, and overall continuous labor support from their birth partner until the end of the first stage, and continued to receive help throughout the second stages of labor.</p><p>Each woman after the birth of her baby was contacted in the postnatal unit and interviewed by the research assistant to collect the data. Data collection included the sociodemographic, and antenatal characteristics of the women plus length (min) of first and second stage of labor, Instrumental delivery, the cervical laceration (yes/no), perineal tear (into four categories), pain before and after labor using the numeric rating scale, between 0 (no pain) and 10 (worst pain). Satisfied with labor experience using the numeric rating scale (between 0 and 100) and Apgar score less than seven at 1 and 5 min score.</p><p>Perineal tears are classified into four categories: First degree tear: Laceration is limited to the fourchette and superficial perineal skin or vaginal mucosa, second degree tear: Laceration extends beyond fourchette, perineal skin and vaginal mucosa to perineal muscles and fascia, but not the anal sphincter, third degree tear: Fourchette, perineal skin, vaginal mucosa, muscles, and anal sphincter are torn, and fourth degree tear: Fourchette, perineal skin, vaginal mucosa, muscles, anal sphincter, and rectal mucosa are torn.</p><p>Data were analyzed using SPSS-20 software. Variables were presented as mean &#x000b1; SD, number (percent) and median [IQR]. Age, BMI, length of first and second stage of labor and satisfaction compared among study groups by ANOVA. Pain score compared among study groups by Kruskal walls test and groups were compared two by two using Mann-Whitney test. In addition, Chi-square test was used to assess the maternal education, working statues, Apgar less than seven, perineal tear, presence of cervical laceration and Instrumental delivery among study groups. Statistical significance was accepted at <italic>P</italic>-value lower than 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> shows the flowchart of study.

In most countries, midwife or physician as a specialized medical attendant is present at every birth. In many countries, a support person may also be present. Husbands, partners, and close relatives are the main external support participants during labor and delivery in developed countries.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] In Iran, presence of support person during labor and delivery is not routine, whereas, benefits of comparing continuous support during labor for women and infants are showed in proviruses studies.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Also, because of Iranian women's custom, that they prefer to be supported by other women rather than their husbands, the results of the present study, with the aim of investigating the effects of the presence of mother, sister, female close relative or female friends as a support person during labor in Iranian women was done and revealed that in women with support person incidence of cervical lacerations and instrumental delivery and Apgar &#x0003c;7 was similar to other women. The length of first and second stage of labor in women with support person and routine intervention was lower than women on other groups. Also, women with support person without routine intervention reported low pain before and after labor compare to others and they were more satisfied. Women who received routine intervention with or without support person showed higher pain score before and after labor, higher incidence of perineal tear and were more dissatisfied compare to women who did not received routine intervention with or without support person. In totally, our results showed that presence of support person during labor have good effect on outcomes in pregnant women during labor and delivery.</p><p>Our results regarding the decrease in duration of the first stage of labor are similar to data reported from studies in which support was provided by midwives,[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] or other support persons[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] where it was reduced. These results are contradictory to data from Bruggemann <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] that reported no significant differences between women with support person compare to women without support person.</p><p>In agreement with Sapkota <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] study (among Nepalese women), Green <italic>et al</italic>. study[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] (among English women) and Christianes <italic>et al</italic>. study[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] (among Dutch women) which reported lower labor pain in women with support compare to controls group, present study (among Iranian women) found that women with support person without routine intervention had low labor pain compare to other women. Also, Hodnett <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] reviewed randomized controlled trials in 2011 and displayed the effect of the presence of support person during labor on labor pain relief. These results support the presence of support person during labor, as the authors of a systematic review[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] emphasize that; women can feel good about her behavior during labor when the companion provide physical support to help the woman tolerate the intensity of the contractions. Therefore, through birth preparation classes, there should be an emphasis on the acquisition of skills for anyone who supports a woman in labor.</p><p>Satisfaction may have been influenced by social ability and/or fear of reprisals, or because of a sensation of relief at having gone through a safe experience and having a healthy baby.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] Though, this effect would possibly be the equal for groups and could not explain the difference between them. In agreement with other studies,[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] in present study, presence of support person during labor increase satisfies in studied women. However, in our study women with support person without any routine intervention were high satisfaction whereas, women with support person who received routine intervention were more dissatisfied compare to other women and it showed that routine intervention makes women more dissatisfied.</p><p>Although, results of this study showed advantage of the presence of support person during labor in Iranian women, there were some limitations to the study. Firstly, results of this study gained from women giving birth to their first child, and we should be careful about generalizing these findings to women who experienced giving birth to a second, or more child. Another limitation of the study is that we did not assess qualitatively the attitudes and opinions of Iranian women regarding the presence of support person during labor also because of the wide range of cultural and societal differences in Iran; large multicenter studies is required to be done to investigate opinions, traditional beliefs, attitudes, practices among Iranian women and also the attitudes of support person need to be explored.</p><p>In conclusion, the results of this study showed that presence of a support person and routine intervention during labor among studied women did not effect on incidence of cervical lacerations, instrumental delivery and Apgar &#x0003c; 7 and was similar to other women who did not received routine intervention or support person. Labor pain and women's dissatisfaction among women who received routine intervention were increased compare to women without routine intervention, but these interventions makes decreased the length of first and second stage of labor. Also, the number women with third and fourth degree of perineal tear increased in women who received routine intervention, whereas, most of women without routine intervention have shown first and second degree of perineal tear. Overall, the presence of a support person during labor and delivery in Iranian women decrease length of labor and improved labor outcomes however, further studies are need to be done.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Royan Institute and Iranian Council of Stem Cell Technology</p></fn><fn
