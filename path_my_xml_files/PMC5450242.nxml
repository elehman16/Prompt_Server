Usually made of nylon and elastane (i.e. Lycra<bold>&#x000ae;</bold>), these arthritis gloves apply pressure with the aims of relieving hand pain, stiffness and improving hand function. However, a systematic review identified little evidence supporting their use. We therefore designed a trial to compare the effectiveness of the commonest type of arthritis glove provided in the United Kingdom (Isotoner gloves) (intervention) with placebo (control) gloves (i.e. larger arthritis gloves providing similar warmth to the intervention gloves but minimal pressure only) in people with these conditions.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Participants aged 18&#x000a0;years and over with RA or IA and persistent hand pain will be recruited from National Health Service Trusts in the United Kingdom. Following consent, participants will complete a questionnaire booklet, then be randomly allocated to receive intervention or placebo arthritis gloves. Within three weeks, they will be fitted with the allocated gloves by clinical specialist rheumatology occupational therapists. Twelve weeks (i.e. the primary endpoint) after completing the baseline questionnaire, participants will complete a second questionnaire, including the same measures plus additional questions to explore adherence, benefits and problems with glove-wear. A sub-sample of participants from each group will be interviewed at the end of their participation to explore their views of the gloves received. The clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the intervention, compared to placebo gloves, will be evaluated over 12&#x000a0;weeks. The primary outcome measure is hand pain during activity. Qualitative interviews will be thematically analysed.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This study will evaluate the commonest type of arthritis glove (Isotoner) provided in the NHS (i.e. the intervention) compared to a placebo glove. The results will help occupational therapists, occupational therapy services and people with arthritis make informed choices as to the value of arthritis gloves. If effective, arthritis gloves should become more widely available in the NHS to help people with RA and IA manage hand symptoms and improve performance of daily activities, work and leisure. If not, services can determine whether to cease supplying these to reduce service costs.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ISRCTN Registry: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN25892131">ISRCTN25892131</ext-link> Registered 05/09/2016</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12891-017-1583-4) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Arthritis gloves</kwd><kwd>Rheumatoid arthritis</kwd><kwd>Inflammatory arthritis</kwd><kwd>Occupational therapy</kwd><kwd>Hand pain</kwd><kwd>Hand stiffness</kwd><kwd>Hand swelling</kwd><kwd>Compression gloves</kwd><kwd>Splints</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>National Institute of Health Research (RfPB))</institution></funding-source><award-id>PB-PG-0214-33010</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hammond</surname><given-names>Alison</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory condition causing joint pain, swelling (synovitis), stiffness and muscle loss around affected joints [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. It affects 1% of the population, and twice as many women as men. Peak onset is in the 40-60 age group, it is incurable and causes significant disability if untreated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. RA is managed with disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), rehabilitation and self-management education. People with persistent synovitis, where other pathologies are ruled out (i.e. undifferentiated inflammatory arthritis (IA), who do not yet meet the criteria for RA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]), also require specialist care and DMARDs, and are thus treated as if they have RA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Most people with IA and RA have symptoms in both hands, resulting in problems with everyday activities, work and leisure. Many experience frustration and distress because of hand pain, stiffness and disability. A third are work disabled within 5&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p>Arthritis gloves are commonly provided by Rheumatology occupational therapists to people with IA or RA. These are worn for pain relief during the day or night and to improve hand function during the day. We surveyed Rheumatology occupational therapists,&#x0feff;&#x0feff;identifying that most provide arthritis gloves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Provision varies considerably between occupational therapists but averages a third of the patients they see. The most common make of glove provided is the mid-finger Isotoner glove (i.e. finger tips exposed to aid hand function) and the next commonest are Jobskin and Norco oedema gloves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Provision of gloves appears to have risen following a randomised controlled trial (RCT) demonstrating an alternative treatment (resting splints) was ineffective in early RA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. (Glove photographs are in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: study information).</p><p>Arthritis gloves are usually made of nylon and elastane (i.e. Lycra&#x000ae;). They are thought to impact on hand symptoms through providing compression (pressure) and/or warmth. Some models apply both and others warmth only. Isotoner gloves, containing 20% elastane, exert the highest pressure of those makes available, at 23-32&#x000a0;mmHg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Other makes exert less as these contain less elastane (e.g. the Jobskin classic oedema gloves exert 15-25&#x000a0;mm Hg and contain 11% elastane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]). When properly fitted (to be a &#x0201c;snug fit&#x0201d;), the gloves apply controlled pressure to the hand [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The pressure is thought to: (a) remove extracellular fluid, thus reducing pain, stiffness and improving finger motion; and (b) increase blood flow and consequently warmth, reducing pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The glove material also provides warmth, contributing to pain relief. Makes of arthritis gloves, which specifically apply pressure, are termed compression or oedema gloves. It is unclear what a therapeutic level of pressure is, as this has not been identified through physiological studies. However, based on pressure information from manufacturers, therapists consider this is between 15-32&#x000a0;mmHg. We also hypothesize that arthritis gloves provide tactile feedback to the glove wearer reminding them to take more care of their hand joints. Potentially, all models of glove (however much pressure and/or warmth they apply) may be acting through this mechanism. This effect was hypothesized in a pilot clinical effectiveness and efficacy trial of thumb splints [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>Despite their widespread use, evidence for the effectiveness of arthritis gloves is inconclusive. In a recent systematic review, we identified only four trials evaluating arthritis gloves. Trials were small and results inconclusive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. We therefore developed this randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the most commonly used arthritis glove (i.e. Isotoner) in people with RA or IA.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Feasibility study</title><p>We conducted a feasibility study among patients with IA or RA (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;39) in 10 Occupational Therapy departments in Northwest England evaluating mid-finger Isotoner gloves (as these are the commonest type provided and apply the highest pressure). During this study we standardised arthritis glove eligibility criteria, glove treatment protocols (including the arthritis glove patient information sheet) with participating therapists (North-West College of Occupational Therapy Specialist Section in Rheumatology: NWCOTSS-R arthritis glove protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The results of the study are reported elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Objectives</title><p>The primary objective is to assess whether there is a clinically important difference in self-reported dominant hand pain during daytime activity between participants with RA or IA receiving intervention gloves (Isotoner gloves) in addition to usual care compared to participants receiving placebo gloves (Jobskin classic oedema gloves fitted at least one size too big to ensure similar warmth is provided but minimal pressure only is applied), plus usual care.</p><p>The secondary objectives are to:<list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>i.</label><p>assess the effectiveness of intervention gloves, relative to placebo gloves on self-reported: non-dominant hand pain during activity; dominant and non-dominant nocturnal hand pain; hand pain during the day at rest; hand stiffness; hand joint swelling; and hand function.</p></list-item><list-item><label>ii.</label><p>evaluate the cost-effectiveness of arthritis gloves compared with placebo gloves, taking into account the cost of the gloves and other healthcare resources used by participants.</p></list-item><list-item><label>iii.</label><p>explore participants&#x02019; views of: the effects of arthritis (intervention) and placebo gloves on hand symptoms, function, and their daily lives; acceptability of glove wear; and how and when they prefer to use these.</p></list-item></list>

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Interventions</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Occupational therapist training in glove provision</title><p>Interventions will be delivered by 27 National Health Service (NHS) Rheumatology occupational therapists (&#x02265;Band 6 i.e. clinical specialists). Participating therapists must attend a one-day clinical trial training programme delivered by expert Rheumatology occupational therapists and the research team. This will include: trial background; key study procedures; and practice in providing the intervention and placebo gloves in a standardised manner. The A-GLOVES Occupational Therapy Glove Provision Manual, developed by the research team with the NW-COTSS-R, will be followed when fitting these gloves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>In addition to the training day, the Trial manager will conduct site visits to ensure all Principal Investigators, research facilitator/s (i.e. nurses/other staff employed in the NHS to assist with recruitment into trials) and occupational therapists involved in the study understand how to explain the study and arthritis gloves appropriately, to ensure participants are not unblinded to the intervention.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Glove fitting</title><p>The intervention group will receive correctly fitted mid-finger length Isotoner arthritis gloves. The placebo group will receive mid-finger length Jobskin classic oedema gloves fitted at least one size too large, to ensure they do not apply therapeutic levels of compression. When fitting gloves, the occupational therapist will measure participants&#x02019; MCP circumference to determine the glove size required. Therapists will also use their clinical judgement to determine appropriate fit. Usually, patients requiring gloves receive these for both hands as their hand pain and/or swelling is bilateral. However, if patients have unilateral pain and/or swelling, they are provided with a glove only for the affected hand.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Additional Interventions</title><p>All participants (in both intervention and placebo groups) will receive a booklet about hand self-management: &#x0201c;Looking After Your Joints when you have arthritis&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. This booklet is widely provided in clinical practice. They will also receive an information sheet about hand exercises, based on the Strengthening And Stretching For Rheumatoid Arthritis of the Hand (SARAH) trial hand exercise programme for RA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. During the 12&#x000a0;weeks, participants will only receive brief training in joint protection and hand exercises, and this will not use cognitive-behavioural approaches. Most departments do not normally offer behaviourally based joint protection and/or hand exercise programmes (or where these exist, such programmes usually have waiting lists), thus participants are not being disadvantaged.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Modifications</title><p>In some instances, a glove may not be fitted if enlarged PIP joints or finger deformity prevent this. For those participants with an MCP circumference greater than 23.5&#x000a0;cm (or fingers/hands too large in other respects), no gloves will be fitted, as an appropriately large size is not available from manufacturers. If the participant cannot be fitted with gloves, they still remain in the trial, in line with &#x0201c;intention-to-treat.&#x0201d;</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Adherence</title><p>Recommendations for when to wear gloves will be based on individual needs; most, but not all, patients will be provided with gloves for both hands. Most people experience hand pain during the day and are recommended to wear gloves during activity. Those experiencing hand pain at night, which interferes with sleep, will also be recommended to wear gloves at night. Gloves are not recommended to be worn continually. All participants will receive written information about glove wear and care, using the sample information sheet in the A-Gloves Occupational Therapy Glove Provision Manual [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>To check for correct glove fit and any problems, occupational therapists will either: within two to four weeks of glove provision offer a review appointment (in person or by telephone); or ask the participant to get in contact if experiencing problems, if this is their normal departmental policy. At the review appointment, participants will be reminded about their glove wear regimen and the need to continue to wear the gloves until the 12-week follow-up questionnaire is completed. At the end of their trial participation, they will be contacted with further instructions about future glove wear.</p><p>Adherence to glove wear will be assessed in the 12-week follow-up questionnaires, by asking participants to describe their glove wear for right and left hand gloves. This will include, over the last four weeks, the: average time worn during the day and/or at night; and the average number of days per week gloves were worn. The participant will also be asked to state whether they have obtained arthritis gloves from elsewhere (if they did so, as it is possible for patients to purchase gloves in shops and on-line) and glove wear related to these (if applicable).</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Concomitant care</title><p>Occupational therapists are asked not to provide resting, wrist, finger or thumb splints or any other occupational therapy interventions (apart from joint protection and hand exercises) to participants whilst they are in the trial (i.e. during their 12&#x000a0;weeks participation). However, participants are permitted to attend Physiotherapy for lower limb interventions if required. Data on participants&#x02019; use of concomitant care is collected via the 12-week questionnaire.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Outcomes</title><p>The primary outcome measure is &#x02018;hand pain during moderate activity&#x02019; which was considered the most important outcome by glove-users in our feasibility study. This is measured as hand pain in the dominant hand during the day, on a typical day, when doing moderate hand activities, e.g. housework, cooking, Do-It-Yourself, gardening. In our feasibility study, 2% of participants received one glove for their non-dominant hand only.

Steroids can reduce hand pain and thus would be a confounding factor in evaluating glove effectiveness. If at six weeks they are still eligible, they will be re-approached for consent.</p><p>Participants may receive a steroid injection or start oral steroids following consent. If this occurs between consent and glove fitting, the occupational therapist will identify this at the glove fitting appointment and defer glove fitting for six weeks from the date of injection/steroid start. It is not anticipated that this will be a common event. If the participant starts steroids following glove provision and their hands are still symptomatic, they will be advised to continue glove wear as prescribed, as this is a pragmatic trial. If the patient reports that their hands are no longer causing them pain or discomfort they will be advised not to wear the gloves. However, they will remain in the trial and complete the 12-week questionnaire, as we will be conducting an intention to treat analysis.</p><p>Following consent, by the research facilitator or occupational therapist, participants will be provided with a baseline (i.e. 0&#x000a0;weeks) questionnaire to complete and return in a Freepost envelope to the trial manager.

The unit costs will be derived from published national average unit cost data, the price year will be 2016. Total direct costs will also include the cost of the gloves. Regression analysis will be used to estimate the net total costs and economic benefits of the arthritis gloves compared to the placebo gloves, adjusting for baseline values and the stratification variable (recent DMARD changes).</p><p>Cost-effectiveness will be measured as an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for the arthritis gloves versus the placebo gloves. As recommended by NICE for health technology appraisals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], cost-effectiveness acceptability analysis will be conducted. Non-parametric bootstrapping of the incremental costs and outcomes (estimated from the regression analysis) will be used to estimate the probability that arthritis gloves are cost-effective compared to placebo gloves.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec34"><title>Data monitoring</title><p>The trial will not have a separate Data Monitoring Committee (DMC), as the safety risks associated with this study are very low. Consequently, there are no stopping rules for safety. The project will be overseen by a Trial Steering Committee (TSC), which will perform this function.</p></sec><sec id="Sec35"><title>Harms</title><p>There is minimal risk or discomfort associated with the intervention (Isotoner) gloves. If a participant has increased hand swelling due to an exacerbation of their condition after glove provision, this can affect fit and potentially cause tingling or numbness. The verbal and written instructions provided during glove provision emphasise that the participant should: regularly check their hands; not wear the gloves continually; stop wearing the gloves if they experience any discomfort or pain or there is any redness or skin reaction; and contact the occupational therapist if they experience any problems.</p><p>Glove use will be modified or discontinued by the treating occupational therapist only if an adverse event related to glove wear causes concern. This may occur at the review appointment or if the participant contacts the occupational therapist with concerns. Adverse events caused by arthritis gloves have been identified in clinical practice and therapists modify the wear regimen as applicable. Adverse events and modifications include:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Numbness; pins and needles; and/or fingertips becoming discoloured (i.e. they go red, white or blue) during glove wear. This may be due to gloves being too tight. A larger glove may be fitted if this occurs.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Allergic reaction or skin irritation can occasionally occur. Gloves are either left off for a time and re-tried or discontinued.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Sleep disturbance at night. This can occur because the gloves feel hot or itchy. Participants are recommended to wear the gloves for part of the night or leave them off when necessary.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>It is unlikely any harm will arise from participants wearing placebo gloves as most adverse events occur due to pressure effects.</p><p>Any adverse event considered by the occupational therapist to be resulting from glove wear, or any other minor problems related to glove wear, will be recorded by the occupational therapist on the A-Gloves Occupational Therapy Treatment Record Form at the review appointment and a copy returned to the CTU Data Manager.</p></sec><sec id="Sec36"><title>Auditing</title><p>The trial manager will conduct at least one on-site monitoring visit per year over the course of the study to all clinical sites to educate, support and solve problems. The trial manager will provide the research facilitator/principal investigator with a site file checklist prior to the visit and ask them to ensure the site file is up-to-date. The trial manager will check the completed checklist and site file at the visit. There will also be central monitoring, by the CTU and trial manager, of quality of source documentation, including consent form completion and adverse event reporting.</p><p>The Chief Investigator will permit study-related monitoring, audits and inspections by the Ethics Committee, lead R&#x00026;D department, the University and any NHS Trust Research Governance Managers requiring this. The study will be monitored in accordance with NHS and University Research Governance procedures. The Chief Investigator will ensure that any regulatory authority is given access to all study related documents and study related facilities. Principal investigators will be asked to audit their site files at the beginning and end of the study using a checklist provided by the University Research Centre and to allow study related monitoring, audits and inspections as above.</p></sec><sec id="Sec37"><title>Composition roles and responsibilities of: the co-ordinating centres, TMG and TSC and data analysis team</title><p>Management of the trial is joint between the Centre for Health Sciences Research, University of Salford (Hammond, Prior) and Lancashire Clinical Trials Unit (Sutton). Prof Hammond (Chief Investigator), Dr Prior (Trial Manager) at the University of Salford, in conjunction with advice and support from Dr Sutton (Lead, Lancashire CTU) and other CTU staff, as appropriate, and Dr Cotterell (Statistician) will be responsible for: (i) writing the study protocol and any revisions, obtaining all study approvals and any amendments, preparation of study documentation, study planning, contributing to Trial Management Group and Trial Steering Committee meetings, producing interim and final reports to the funder and approving agencies (ethics committees, Trust R&#x00026;D departments) (ii) Serious Adverse Event reporting (iii) Trial master file management and ensuring sites have site files, and content is monitored periodically (iv) Budget administration in conjunction with Salford Royal NHSFT (Research &#x00026; Development) and University of Salford (Contracts Officer, Research and Innovation) (v) Advice for Principal Investigators, Research Facilitators and occupational therapists s (vi) Site initiation visits with Research Facilitators/occupational therapists/Principal Investigators (vii) Organising occupational therapy training in glove provision and study procedures and day-to-day management of the project. The Trial Management Group (TMG) consists of AH (Chair) and the protocol contributors (listed in author contributions), and YP as the trial manager). The TMG will approve documentation, study protocol procedures, advise on ethics application, monitor trial progress by reviewing the trial progress reports, any problems arising, be advised of any Serious Adverse Events, review findings and plan dissemination. The TMG will meet at 6 monthly intervals and receive reports of trial progress. Teleconferences and ad-hoc meetings will be held during the study if issues arise requiring discussion. The Trial Steering Committee (TSC) consists of: Dr Peter Klimiuk, Consultant Rheumatologist, Pennine Musculoskeletal Partnership Ltd, Oldham (Chair); Cathy Ball, Research Clinical Specialist Hand Therapist, Kennedy Institute for Rheumatology, Oxford; Dr Michael Callaghan, Research Fellow, University of Manchester and Clinical Specialist Physiotherapist, Manchester Royal Infirmary; Mike Bradburn, Senior Medical Statistician, Sheffield Clinical Trials Unit, SCHARR, University of Sheffield. The TSC will meet three times and also act as the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) and provide trial oversight and data monitoring. The TSC will meet to approve the protocol, advise on procedures and progress, data monitoring and review findings and monitor trial progress by reviewing trial progress reports. The project does not have a DMC, as the safety risks associated with this study are very low. The TSC will have access to the unblinded data on completion of the analysis. No interim analyses are planned.</p></sec><sec id="Sec38"><title>Protocol amendments</title><p>Any subsequent modifications to the protocol which may impact on the conduct of the study, potential benefit to the patient or may affect patient safety (including changes of study objectives, study design, patient population, sample sizes, study procedures, or significant administrative aspects) will require a formal amendment to the protocol. Such amendment will be agreed by TMG and TSC members and approved by the approving NRES Ethics Committee prior to implementation and notified to the participating Trust R&#x00026;D departments in accordance with local regulations.</p><p>Administrative changes of the protocol are minor corrections and/or clarifications that have no effect on the way the study is to be conducted. These administrative changes will be agreed upon by TMG members and documented in a Memorandum filed in the trial master file. The approving NRES Ethics Committee may be notified of administrative changes at the discretion of the TMG. Protocols and documents will be version controlled.</p></sec><sec id="Sec39"><title>Dissemination</title><p>Findings will be submitted to rheumatology and health professional conferences and journals. A summary of findings will be provided to relevant health professional and arthritis patient organizations, requesting these are included in websites and newsletters. We will also produce guidelines, for both therapists and patients, on how to correctly fit and wear arthritis gloves, based on the A-GLOVES Trial Occupational Therapy Glove Provision Manual [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and disseminate these as above.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec40"><title>Discussion</title><p>This protocol describes a definitive, pragmatic, patient-blinded, and multi-centre superiority randomised parallel group trial, which aims to determine the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the use of arthritis gloves for people with RA or IA with persistent hand pain. The results of this trial will inform the evidence base to support the prescription of arthritis gloves for people with RA or IA and hand pain. The results of this study will be published as soon as they become available.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec41"><title>Additional file</title><p>
