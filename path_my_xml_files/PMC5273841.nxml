There is evidence that non-pharmacological interventions such as graded exercise therapy (GET) or cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) reduce cancer-related fatigue in disease-free cancer patients and in patients receiving treatment with curative intent. These interventions may also result in a reduction of fatigue in patients receiving treatment with palliative intent, by improving physical fitness (GET) or changing fatigue-related cognitions and behaviour (CBT). The primary aim of our study is to assess the efficacy of GET or CBT compared to usual care (UC) in reducing fatigue in patients with incurable cancer.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The TIRED study is a multicentre three-armed randomised controlled trial (RCT) for incurable cancer patients receiving systemic treatment with palliative intent. Participants will be randomised to GET, CBT, or UC. In addition to UC, the GET group will participate in a 12-week supervised exercise programme. The CBT group will receive a 12-week CBT intervention in addition to UC. Primary and secondary outcome measures will be assessed at baseline, post-intervention (14&#x000a0;weeks), and at follow-up assessments (18 and 26&#x000a0;weeks post-randomisation). The primary outcome measure is fatigue severity (Checklist Individual Strength <italic>subscale fatigue severity</italic>). Secondary outcome measures are fatigue (EORTC-QLQ-C30 <italic>subscale fatigue</italic>), functional impairments (Sickness Impact Profile <italic>total score</italic>, EORTC-QLQ-C30 <italic>subscale emotional functioning, subscale physical functioning</italic>) and quality of life (EORTC-QLQ-C30 <italic>subscale QoL</italic>). Outcomes at 14&#x000a0;weeks (primary endpoint) of either treatment arm will be compared to those of UC participants. In addition, outcomes at 18 and 26&#x000a0;weeks (follow-up assessments) of either treatment arm will be compared to those of UC participants.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>To our knowledge, the TIRED study is the first RCT investigating the efficacy of GET and CBT on reducing fatigue during treatment with palliative intent in incurable cancer patients. The results of this study will provide information about the possibility and efficacy of GET and CBT for severely fatigued incurable cancer patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>

As a result of improvements in treatment options for certain cancers, substantial progress has been made in curative treatment of cancer. Despite these positive developments, a substantial subgroup of cancer patients will (eventually) be diagnosed with incurable cancer. The medical treatment of incurable cancer has a palliative intention, with prolonging life as one of its main aims [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. For some cancer types, advances in cancer treatment with palliative intent have resulted in an extended period of life, resulting in more long-term or chronic cancer treatment. Next to prolonging life, treatment of incurable cancer should also be aimed at maintaining quality of life for as long as possible and relieving physical and psychological symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. As a result of the longer-term treatment of incurable cancer patients, aspects regarding quality of life and symptom management become even more important.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Fatigue in patients with incurable cancer</title><p>Fatigue is one of the most commonly reported symptoms during systemic treatment for incurable cancer, being reported by up to 99% of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. There are various ways to define fatigue, but cancer-related fatigue (CRF) is a term that is most widely used to address this symptom. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) defines CRF as <italic>&#x0201c;a distressing, persistent, subjective sense of physical, emotional and/or cognitive tiredness or exhaustion related to cancer or cancer treatment that is not proportional to recent activity and interferes with usual functioning&#x0201d; </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Studies show that CRF is among the most distressing symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and is associated with reduced quality of life, poor performance status, and difficulty performing daily activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Many factors are likely to contribute to CRF in patients with incurable cancer. The multiple causes of CRF can result from the underlying disease, from secondary factors such as anaemia, infection, dehydration, and treatment side effects, or from loss of muscle mass. Apart from these physical factors, depression and anxiety can also contribute to CRF. There is also evidence suggesting that cognitive and behavioural factors, such as sleeping problems, fatigue catastrophising, and inappropriate coping are related to fatigue in patients with incurable cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>Management of CRF in incurable cancer patients should first focus on identifying and treating somatic causes, for example anaemia or hypothyroidism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Yet, often no somatic cause for CRF can be found. When no somatic cause can be identified, the management of CRF can involve pharmacological treatment or non-pharmacological interventions. Thus far, no recommendation for a specific drug treatment for fatigue in palliative care patients could be given [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. There is also no evidence-based non-pharmacological intervention for CRF in incurable cancer patients. Two non-pharmacological approaches, Graded Exercise Therapy (GET) and Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT), seem promising interventions based on findings from studies addressing CRF in other cancer patients that will be discussed below.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Exercise interventions for CRF in cancer patients</title><p>In contrast to the old advice to &#x02018;get plenty of rest&#x02019; during cancer treatment, patients are now encouraged to optimise levels of physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. A low level of physical activity during cancer treatment can lead to decreased physical functioning by a substantial loss of cardiopulmonary fitness and muscle mass [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. On the other hand, increasing physical activity has been suggested as helpful in reducing CRF by improving physical capacity, resulting in a reduced effort to perform everyday activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Cramp &#x00026; Byron-Daniel (2012) suggested that exercise interventions can help to reduce CRF both during and after adjuvant treatment for cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Efficacy of exercise interventions for the subgroup of patients receiving cancer treatment with palliative intent was not examined in this Cochrane systematic review. Nonetheless, a systematic review by Lowe et al. (2009) did provide evidence that exercise interventions are feasible in patients with incurable cancer as the majority of participants were able to tolerate various physical activity interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Three of the six reviewed studies had fatigue as one of the outcome measures and all three reported a reduction in fatigue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. However, the methodological quality of these pilot studies was evaluated as poor and only one study had a control condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>Following the NCCN recommendations for exercise programs, our research group developed a 6-week GET intervention that was tailored to the physical fitness level of each participant and began at a low level of intensity and duration, progressed slowly, and was modified when the participant&#x02019;s condition changed. This intervention was tested for feasibility and efficacy was explored in an uncontrolled pilot study of 26 incurable cancer patients. GET was not only feasible in terms of participants&#x02019; adherence and evaluation, but also efficacious with significant improvements in self-reported fatigue and quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. A large-scale randomised controlled trial (RCT) is needed to confirm these promising results.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Cognitive behaviour therapy for CRF in cancer patients</title><p>Most research on the efficacy of CBT for CRF has been done in cancer survivors or cancer patients receiving cancer treatment with curative intent. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses have indicated that CBT can reduce fatigue in cancer survivors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Two RCTs performed by our research group have demonstrated that fatigue and functional impairments in severely fatigued cancer survivors can be significantly reduced by CBT for CRF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. This fatigue-specific intervention targets several cognitive-behavioural perpetuating factors of CRF. The intervention is based on the underlying assumption that cancer treatment and/or the cancer itself may trigger fatigue (precipitating factors), but that other factors such as sleep disturbance, physical inactivity, and dysfunctional thoughts about fatigue might be responsible for the persistence of fatigue (perpetuating factors) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Positive intervention effects of CBT for CRF were sustained at 2-years follow-up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The efficacy of CBT for CRF compared to usual care was also assessed in an RCT aimed at cancer patients during cancer treatment with curative intent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Despite a significant reduction in fatigue immediately after the intervention for patients in the CBT arm, no differences were observed between these two conditions at follow-up with effects diminishing after seven months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. It should be noted though, that being severely fatigued was not an entry criterion for this RCT, and thus a floor effect may be present in this trial.</p><p>While there are no RCTs to date that investigated the efficacy of CBT specifically aimed at reducing fatigue in incurable cancer patients receiving cancer treatment with palliative intent, two previous RCTs provide indirect support for the positive effects of CBT on fatigue outcomes in a sample of cancer patients of whom a subgroup had incurable cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Although these RCTs did show an overall effect on fatigue, it is not clear whether this can be generalised to the group of cancer patients receiving treatment with palliative intent since subgroup analyses were not performed. Based on our previous experience with CBT for CRF in both cancer survivors and patients receiving cancer treatment with curative intent, and results of a recent study which suggested that the same perpetuating psychosocial factors are associated with fatigue in patients receiving cancer treatment with palliative intent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], we think it is important to examine the efficacy of CBT for CRF in an RCT for this new target population.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>The role of physical activity and fitness versus fatigue-related cognitions as mediators of the reduction in CRF</title><p>Exercise interventions aiming to reduce CRF in cancer patients are based on the assumption that a lack of physical activity and deconditioning during cancer treatment can worsen fatigue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. It is assumed that with exercise interventions physical activity and fitness can be increased, resulting in a reduction in CRF. CBT aimed at reducing CRF in cancer patients is based on the assumption that several fatigue-related cognitions (i.e., low self-efficacy and catastrophising thoughts) and behaviours are related to the persistence of fatigue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Targeting cognitions with CBT is assumed to result in less dysfunctional thoughts about fatigue, which contributes to the reduction in CRF. Although these assumptions are widespread, the role of an increase in physical activity and fitness versus a change in fatigue-related cognitions in reducing CRF has not yet been investigated in interventions for patients with incurable cancer. To investigate which factors contribute to a reduction in CRF, mediation analysis can be helpful. This technique provides insight into which factors mediate the expected reduction in CRF brought on by GET on CRF. Mediation analysis can thereby help us to better understand how interventions work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Aims of the TIRED study</title><p>We designed a multicentre RCT to test the efficacy of either GET or CBT compared to Usual Care (UC) in reducing fatigue (primary outcome) in incurable cancer patients receiving systemic treatment with palliative intent. In addition, the efficacy on improving quality of life and functional impairment will be studied. All outcomes will be assessed at baseline, and at 14, 18 and 26-weeks post-randomisation. We will assess the efficacy of GET or CBT compared to UC directly post-intervention at 14-weeks post-randomisation, which is the primary endpoint of this study. In addition, we will determine whether the expected intervention effects are sustained at follow-up assessments (18-weeks and 26-weeks post-randomisation). Furthermore, if GET and/or CBT are efficacious in reducing CRF, we will perform a mediation analysis to test if the changes in four variables (i.e., physical activity, physical fitness, self-efficacy with respect to fatigue, and/or fatigue catastrophising) mediate the reduction in fatigue.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Design</title><p>A non-blinded multicentre RCT (the TIRED study) will be conducted to evaluate the efficacy of GET and CBT compared to UC for severely fatigued incurable cancer patients receiving cancer treatment with palliative intent.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Participants</title><p>Inclusion and exclusion criteria are listed in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>.

Patients will be screened for the presence of severe fatigue as part of clinical care by administering the CIS-fatigue prior to the start or during systemic treatment with palliative intent when patients visit the outpatient clinic. When eligible patients are severely fatigued, the nurse or oncologist will present the TIRED study by giving patients written information and solicit permission to have a researcher contact them. Those patients who agree to be contacted will be called by the coordinating researcher (HP), who will further inform them about the details and purpose of the study and invite them to participate. A follow-up phone call will be scheduled one week after the first phone call to address questions and determine if patients are willing to participate.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Procedure</title><p>Eligible patients willing to participate in the study will be asked to sign informed consent upon which they will be invited by a research assistant to complete the baseline assessment (T0) at their own hospital. Upon completion of T0, the research assistant will use a central web-based randomisation service to randomly allocate a participant to one of the three study arms: (1) GET in addition to UC; (2) CBT in addition to UC; or (3) control group receiving UC (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Participants assigned to GET or CBT will start the intervention approximately two weeks after T0. Both interventions will be delivered at or near their own hospital over a period of 12&#x000a0;weeks. Participants assigned to CBT will complete a set of additional questionnaires to determine relevant intervention modules prior to the first intervention session. Participants assigned to GET will complete an additional submaximal test to determine physical fitness during the first intervention session. At 14&#x000a0;weeks, participants are invited by the research assistant to complete the post-intervention assessment (T1) at the hospital. Follow-up assessments at 18&#x000a0;weeks (T2) and 26&#x000a0;weeks (T3) are entirely web-based and will be completed at home. For participants that do not have Internet access, a paper version of the follow-up questionnaires will be send to their home address, which can be returned in a self-addressed, pre-stamped envelope.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Flowchart of the TIRED study</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12885_2017_3076_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>

The treatment protocol <italic>&#x02018;GET for fatigue in incurable cancer patients&#x02019;</italic> was developed by the study investigators in cooperation with a physiologist (MH) and physical therapist (MN) experienced in exercise programmes for cancer patients. The treatment protocol was based on the protocol for a previous pilot-study in patients with incurable cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Physical therapists affiliated with the participating hospitals or from local physical therapy centres will deliver the GET. All therapists will be instructed about the treatment protocol and use of registration forms before enrolment of participants. Throughout the study, supervision will be provided upon request by a physical therapist (MN).</p><p>GET will be given by physical therapists individually or in small groups with a maximum of 5 participants, depending on the accrual rate. During the intake session, the physical therapist will collect information about a participant&#x02019;s physical fitness level (by means of a submaximal test) and physical limitations. Participants will formulate treatment goals in activities of daily living together with the physical therapist, such as performing activities or leisure interests in the foreseeable future that are currently difficult to perform because of a lack of muscle strength or cardiopulmonary fitness. After the intake session, participants will receive weekly two-hour sessions of individually graded training supported by a physical therapist and adjusted to their abilities. In order to adjust the training to an individual participant, their heart rate reserve (HRR) and muscle strength (by means of one-repetition maximum [1RM] tests) will be determined during first session and after every three sessions. The two-hour GET sessions will include a warming up (10&#x000a0;min), high intensity aerobic interval training (35&#x000a0;min), a break (15&#x000a0;min), resistance training (35&#x000a0;min), and a cooling down (10&#x000a0;min). Additionally, there are 15&#x000a0;min available for evaluation of the GET session. In addition to this supervised session, participants are offered to practise in a second weekly session. After every three sessions, training progress will be evaluated and the programme will be adjusted by means of the newly determined HRR and 1RM and discussion of formulated treatment goals.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Aerobic training</title><p>The aerobic training will consist of cycling on an interval basis prior to the resistance training.

Heart rate will be monitored during the aerobic training using a Polar&#x000ae; breast band (Polar T31 Breast Band, 2008, Polar Electro, Finland).

Adaptations were done for application with our new target population. This adapted CBT will consist of a maximum of ten sessions over a period of 12&#x000a0;weeks (i.e., one assessment session and maximum nine individual one-hour face-to-face treatment sessions). Qualified and trained psychologists will deliver CBT for fatigue. Prior to intervention delivery, all therapists will receive a three-day training provided by two experienced clinical psychologists (HK and TB). This training will provide background and rationale for each of the intervention modules and involves role-playing to practise the intervention components. An experienced clinical psychologist (HK) will provide on-going supervision to CBT therapists throughout the study.</p><p>CBT for fatigue in incurable cancer patients includes several modules aimed at fatigue-perpetuating cognitions and behaviours. Participants randomised to CBT will complete a set of additional questionnaires prior to the first intervention session to assess potential perpetuating factors (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). During the first intervention session it will be determined by the therapist which factors are applicable for the particular patient, which leads to a tailored-made intervention as only the relevant treatment modules will be selected. The goal of CBT is reduction of severe fatigue and fatigue-related disability. All participants will start with setting their treatment goals. Participants will be helped to formulate concrete goals in behavioural terms, such as resuming activities or leisure interests in the foreseeable future that are discontinued because of being severely fatigued. Then, therapists and participants will work on adjusting the fatigue-perpetuating factors that are applicable to the individual participant: (1) sleep problems and deregulated sleep-wake cycle; (2) dysfunctional cognitions regarding cancer (prognosis) and cancer treatment; (3) dysfunctional fatigue-related cognitions; (4) deregulated activity pattern; (5) negative social interactions and low perceived social support.

A clinically relevant difference between the intervention arms and the UC arm of at least 6 points is expected for the primary outcome (CIS-fatigue). Per arm, a minimum number of 51 evaluable participants at T1 would be needed for a <italic>t</italic>-test with a power of 0.80 and a two-sided alpha of 0.025 (corrected to account for the two comparisons: GET versus UC and CBT versus UC). According to Borm et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>], using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) instead of a <italic>t</italic>-test to analyse treatment effects on a continuous outcome measure (CIS-fatigue) increases the power and reduces the needed sample size in RCTs.

Anticipating an attrition rate of 30%, we aim to recruit a target sample size of 219 participants at T0 (73 participants per arm).</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>The statistician who will perform data analyses will be blinded for intervention allocation. To test the efficacy of both interventions compared to UC, an ANCOVA will be performed for each intervention with <italic>fatigue severity</italic> (CIS-fatigue) at T1 as dependent measure, condition as fixed factor and CIS-fatigue screening score as covariate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Missing data is a common problem in palliative care research and is also anticipated in our study as a result of deteriorating health or because the patient has died. Data will be primarily analysed on complete case basis, i.e. only data from evaluable participants with a T1 assessment will be used. The <italic>p</italic>-level is adjusted to 0.025 to account for the two primary analyses, i.e., GET versus UC and CBT versus UC. When statistically significant differences between GET versus UC and/or CBT versus UC are found, additional sensitivity analysis accounting for all randomised participants will be done to explore the impact of missing data. Several methods of imputation are available and the choice will depend on the actual circumstances of missing data. We will record the causes of missing data and careful considerations will be given to which imputation procedure should be used.</p><p>In addition, ANCOVA will be performed for the secondary outcomes (<italic>fatigue, quality of life, and functional impairments</italic>), with baseline score (T0) on the dependent measure as covariate. In these exploratory analyses a <italic>p</italic>-level of 0.05 will be used. Longer-term follow-up effects at T2 and T3 will also be tested using ANCOVA, with baseline score (T0) on the dependent measure as covariate. Again, in these explorative analyses a <italic>p</italic>-level of 0.05 will be used. No sensitivity analysis will be done, as the power for follow-up analyses will be limited due to the expected significant amount of attrition.</p><p>Mediation analysis will be conducted to explore the possible underlying mechanisms of the expected reduction in fatigue severity (CIS-fatigue) brought on by GET and CBT at T1. Following recommendations of Preacher and Hayes (2008) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>], we will perform multiple mediation analysis using bootstrapping to test the mediating effect of four potential mediators (i.e., changes in <italic>physical activity, physical fitness, self-efficacy with respect to fatigue, and catastrophising in response to fatigue</italic>).

Graded exercise and cognitive behavioural interventions seem promising in reducing fatigue severity based on their effectiveness in disease-free cancer patients and patients receiving cancer treatment with curative intent. To our knowledge, the TIRED study will be the first RCT determining the efficacy of GET and CBT compared to UC in reducing severe fatigue in incurable cancer patients receiving systemic treatment with palliative intent.</p><p>Recruitment of participants started in January 2013. Thus far, identifying potential study participants via nurses and oncologists for this palliative care RCT has been challenging. One common barrier for recruitment in palliative care research known from the literature is professional gatekeeping [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. A recent systematic review by Kars et al. (2015) explored reasons for gatekeeping in palliative care research, the professionals&#x02019; perception that study participation would be too burdensome for the patients was the most reported reason [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Yet, we recently demonstrated that 93% of incurable cancer patients that completed a fatigue-screening questionnaire during cancer treatment with palliative intent wanted to be informed by a researcher about available interventional studies for fatigue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Other important reasons for gatekeeping reported by Kars et al. (2015) included health carers&#x02019; lack of time, complicated study procedures, or study procedures that interrupt usual care processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. These issues have also been observed in our study and as a result we have simplified our study procedures. For example, we originally aimed to screen for the presence of severe fatigue during a nursing consultation before the first line of systemic treatment with palliative intent began. However, nurses indicated that patients often raise several important time-consuming treatment-related questions, which hampered nurses from administering the fatigue screening. Therefore, we amended the study protocol by also allowing patients to be screened for fatigue at consultations further on during treatment. Moreover, we initially aimed to include a homogeneous sample of patients with incurable breast or colorectal cancer. Then again, poor recruitment rates during the first year, made us broaden our inclusion criterion regarding cancer type. Finally, we have extended our research collaboration with three hospitals to nine hospitals in total. All study protocol amendments have been reviewed and approved by the Research Ethics Committee of our University-affiliated hospital and the local Ethics Committees of the participating hospitals.</p><p>In conclusion, the TIRED study will provide information on the efficacy of GET and CBT compared to UC in reducing severe fatigue in incurable cancer patients, as well as on the mediators of any observed intervention effects. Other important outcome measures will include quality of life and functional impairments. If proven efficacious, one or both interventions might be offered as part of UC for this often overlooked and understudied patient group.</p><sec id="Sec28"><title>Status of the trial</title><p>The TIRED-study started in January 2013 and patient recruitment is ongoing.</p></sec></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>1RM</term><def><p>One-Repetition Maximum</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>6-MWT</term><def><p>Six-Minute Walking Test</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CBT</term><def><p>Cognitive Behaviour Therapy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CIS</term><def><p>Checklist Individual Strength</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EORTC-QLQ-C30</term><def><p>European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer-Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FCS</term><def><p>Fatigue Catastrophising Scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GET</term><def><p>Graded Exercise Therapy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HRR</term><def><p>Heart Rate Reserve</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RCT</term><def><p>Randomised Controlled Trial</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SES</term><def><p>Self Efficacy Scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SIP</term><def><p>Sickness Impact Profile</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>UC</term><def><p>Usual Care</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The participating hospitals are: Radboud University Medical Center (Nijmegen), Hospital Gelderse Vallei (Ede), M&#x000e1;xima Medical Center (Eindhoven/Veldhoven), Isala Hospital (Zwolle), Canisius-Wilhelmina Hospital (Nijmegen), Hospital Pantein (Boxmeer), Jeroen Bosch Hospital (Den Bosch), VieCuri Medical Center (Venlo/Venray), and Academic Medical Center (Amsterdam), The Netherlands.</p><p>The design and rationale of this study have been presented at the 15<sup>th</sup> World Congress of Psycho-Oncology (IPOS), Rotterdam, The Netherlands, Oct 2013 and the 13<sup>th</sup> International Congress of Behavioural Medicine (ICBM), Groningen, The Netherlands, Aug 2014.</p><sec id="FPar12"><title>Funding</title><p>The TIRED-study is supported by Grant No. KUN2011-5259 from the Dutch Cancer Society.</p></sec><sec id="FPar13"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p>Not applicable.</p></sec><sec id="FPar14"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>HP is the coordinating researcher and responsible for recruitment, data collection and drafting the manuscript.
