The proportion giving birth over the age of 35 rose from 12% in 1996 to 20% in 2006. Women over this age are at a higher risk of perinatal death, and antepartum stillbirth accounts for 61% of all such deaths. Women over 40 years old have a similar stillbirth risk at 39 weeks as women who are between 25 and 29 years old have at 41 weeks.</p><p>Many obstetricians respond to this by suggesting labour induction at term to forestall some of the risk. In a national survey of obstetricians 37% already induce women aged 40&#x02013;44 years. A substantial minority of parents support such a policy, but others do not on the grounds that it might increase the risk of Caesarean section. However trials of induction in other high-risk scenarios have not shown any increase in Caesarean sections, rather the reverse. If induction for women over 35 did not increase Caesareans, or even reduced them, it would plausibly improve perinatal outcome and be an acceptable intervention. We therefore plan to perform a trial to test the effect of such an induction policy on Caesarean section rates.</p><p>This trial is funded by the NHS Research for Patient Benefit (RfPB) Programme.</p></sec><sec><title>Design</title><p>The 35/39 trial is a multi-centre, prospective, randomised controlled trial. It is being run in twenty UK centres and we aim to recruit 630 nulliparous women (315 per group) aged over 35 years of age, over two years. Women will be randomly allocated to one of two groups: </p><p>Induction of labour between 39<sup>0/7</sup> and 39<sup>6/7</sup> weeks gestation. </p><p>Expectant management i.e. awaiting spontaneous onset of labour unless a situation develops necessitating either induction of labour or Caesarean Section.</p><p>The primary purpose of this trial is to establish what effect a policy of induction of labour at 39 weeks for nulliparous women of advanced maternal age has on the rate of Caesarean section deliveries. The secondary aim is to act as a pilot study for a trial to answer the question, does induction of labour in this group of women improve perinatal outcomes? Randomisation will occur at 36<sup>0/7</sup> &#x02013; 39<sup>6/7</sup> weeks gestation via a computerised randomisation programme at the Clinical Trials Unit, University of Nottingham. There will be no blinding to treatment allocation.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The 35/39 trial is powered to detect an effect of induction of labour on the risk of caesarean section, it is underpowered to determine whether it improves perinatal outcome. The current study will also act as a pilot for a larger study to address this question.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ISRCTN11517275</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Induction of labour</kwd><kwd>Advanced maternal age</kwd><kwd>Perinatal outcome</kwd><kwd>Caesarean delivery</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The average age at childbirth in the UK is increasing, and more women are giving birth over the age of 35 years 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. In 1996, 12% of live births were to women over the age of 35 years. By 2006 that figure had risen to 20%. The Office of National Statistics estimate that in 2006, 5.6% of live births were to nulliparous women over the age of 35 years. In Scotland, the figure in 2005 was approximately 10% 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>Women over 35 years are at higher risk of antepartum and intrapartum stillbirths and neonatal deaths, of hypertensive disorders, gestational diabetes, placenta praevia and placental abruption 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. They are at increased risk of preterm labour and of bearing macrosomic (&#x0003e;3999 g) or low birth weight infants (&#x0003c;2500 g). The women themselves typically believe that their age puts their infant at increased risk 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Unsurprisingly they have higher rates of obstetric intervention.</p><p>The Caesarean section rate for nulliparous women over 35 years is 38% and 50% in women over 40 years 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In nulliparous women, the relationship between maternal age and delivery by emergency Caesarean is linear which suggests a biological effect of advancing maternal age on labour performance, rather than simply obstetrician or maternal preference 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>Antepartum stillbirth is particularly important in this group of women, because they are relatively unlikely to have future pregnancies. Induction at or before term is logical because, although the perinatal mortality rate is lowest at 41 weeks, the gestational age associated with the lowest cumulative risk of perinatal death is 38 weeks 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. This is because there is a cumulative risk of stillbirth in all of the weeks of gestation leading up to the eventual week of delivery. The largest increase in risk of stillbirth for women over 35 years of age starts at 39 weeks and peaks at 41 weeks. Women over 40 years old have a similar stillbirth risk at 39 weeks as women aged 25&#x02013;29 years old have at 41 weeks. Once they pass 40 weeks gestation their risk of stillbirth exceeds that of all women &#x0003c;40 years old at term 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Nulliparous women have a higher risk of stillbirth than multiparous women for all maternal age groups. Obstetricians and parents generally understand this, but may avoid routine induction because of its association with Caesarean section.</p><p>Emergency Caesarean sections carry an increased maternal morbidity and mortality compared to vaginal delivery and have consequences for future pregnancies (uterine rupture and placenta praevia). Caesarean sections cost &#x000a3;760 more than a vaginal delivery 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. A recent trial of induction of labour at term for women identified as high risk for emergency CS (higher the risk score, earlier the induction), found in the treatment group a similar CS rate, a higher vaginal birth rate and a reduced NICU admission and adverse perinatal outcome rate 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Perinatal deaths affect 0.8% of all pregnancies to women over the age of 35 years, and 1% of all pregnancies to women over the age of 40 years 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The distribution of maternal age among the mothers having perinatal deaths is skewed towards advanced maternal age compared with the general maternity population. Mothers having stillbirths and neonatal deaths are more likely to be older (40+). When an adverse event is rare, a large sample size is needed for a trial to prove that an intervention reduces the risk of that adverse event occurring.</p><p>Many obstetricians already induce older pregnant women at term (39% women aged 40&#x02013;44, 58% women aged over 45), and many others believe that induction would improve perinatal outcomes but are reluctant to offer it for fear of increasing Caesarean rates 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. However, it is equally plausible that induction might reduce Caesarean section in which case an effective intervention is being under implemented.</p><p>There is a growing body of evidence that induction of labour at term does not increase emergency Caesarean section rates and does not increase intrapartum deaths. In two other large multi-centre RCTs where induction of labour was compared with expectant management for term prelabour rupture of membranes and for post-term pregnancies, a policy of induction did not increase the Caesarean section rate 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. More recently a large randomised controlled trial comparing induction of labour (between 36 and 41 weeks) versus expectant management for women with gestational hypertension or mild pre-eclampsia found that the rate of Caesarean delivery was the same in both groups 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Induction versus expectant monitoring for intrauterine growth restriction at term, a multi-centre RCT of 650 women found no difference in CS rates between the two groups 
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>Unfortunately there is no hard evidence to guide policy on induction of labour for advanced maternal age.</p></sec><sec><title>Design</title><sec><title>Type of study</title><p>A multi-centre prospective randomised controlled trial.</p><p>Duration: 24 months</p></sec><sec><title>Number and type of participants</title><p>630 nulliparous pregnant women over 35 years of age (315 per group).</p></sec><sec><title>Recruitment and consent</title><p>Women will be identified in the antenatal period by their obstetrician or midwife. They will be offered an information sheet. They will be offered trial entry, and if they agree will sign a written consent. Women who are aged between 35&#x02013;39 years at some of the participating centres will be community led care. Those women will be sent an invitation flyer or leaflet with their dating scan appointment to inform them of the trial and approached in person at their 20/40 anomaly scan at the hospital. The research midwives/principal investigator will see those women who express an interest in joining the trial at 36/40 for randomisation.</p></sec><sec><title>Randomisation</title><p>Participants will be assigned to one of two treatment groups via a computerised randomisation programme at the Clinical Trials Unit, Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust. Randomisation will occur at 36<sup>0/7</sup> &#x02013; 39<sup>6/7</sup> weeks gestation.</p></sec><sec><title>Interventions</title><p>Women will be randomly allocated to one of two groups</p><p>&#x02022; Treatment group: Women over the age of 35 years with a singleton live fetus in a cephalic presentation will be assigned to induction of labour between 39<sup>0/7</sup> and 39<sup>6/7</sup> weeks gestation.</p><p>&#x02022; Control group: Women over the age of 35 years with a singleton live fetus in a cephalic presentation will be assigned to expectant management i.e. awaiting spontaneous onset of labour unless a situation develops necessitating either induction of labour or Caesarean Section. Those without any medical indication for induction will be offered induction of labour anywhere between T<sup>+7</sup> and T<sup>+14</sup>, the exact time to be determined by consultant&#x02019;s usual practice. No additional monitoring in the expectant management group prior to T<sup>+14</sup> should be offered unless it is the consultant&#x02019;s usual practice. If the patient declines induction of labour at T<sup>+14</sup> the patient will be offered a scan for growth and liquor volume and offered alternate day or daily CTG monitoring depending on the consultants usual practice.</p><p>This is a pragmatic clinical trial where individual units will be able to follow their own policies for induction of labour. Each unit will record their local prostaglandin and oxytocin regime and Bishop score cut-off for amniotomy, prior to entry to the trial. Once this is recorded staff should as far as possible use the same induction protocol for all participants and also for those women who for whatever reason require induction in the &#x0201c;await spontaneous labour&#x0201d; group.</p></sec><sec><title>Outcome measures</title><p>The primary end point is Caesarean section.</p><p>Secondary end points will include:</p><p>a) <bold>Maternal outcomes</bold></p><p>Mode of delivery</p><p>Vaginal delivery</p><p>Assisted vaginal delivery (forceps or ventouse)</p><p>Caesarean section</p><p>Onset of labour</p><p>Spontaneous</p><p>Induction</p><p>Planned Caesarean section</p><p>Not in labour - emergency Caesarean section</p><p>Indication for induction of labour</p><p>Randomised to treatment</p><p>Gestational age&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;41 weeks</p><p>Preterm (&#x0003c; 37 weeks) prelabour rupture of membranes</p><p>Term (&#x0003e; 37 weeks) prelabour rupture of membranes&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;24 hours</p><p>Fetal growth restriction</p><p>Reduced fetal movements</p><p>Intrauterine fetal death</p><p>Pregnancy induced hypertension</p><p>Pre-eclampsia</p><p>Eclampsia</p><p>Obstetric cholestasis</p><p>Gestational diabetes</p><p>Suspected fetal distress</p><p>Maternal request</p><p>Other (free text)</p><p><italic>Method of induction of labour</italic> (<italic>as many as apply</italic>)</p><p>Prostaglandin tablet regime</p><p>Prostaglandin gel regime</p><p>Prostaglandin slow-release pessary</p><p>Artificial rupture of amniotic membranes</p><p>Oxytocin (please do not tick if used to accelerate normal labour)</p><p>Indication for Caesarean section</p><p>Arrest of first stage of labour</p><p>Arrest of second stage of labour</p><p>Failed instrumental delivery</p><p>Fetal distress</p><p>Maternal complication</p><p>Elective</p><p>Other (free text)</p><p>Intrapartum complications</p><p>Placental abruption</p><p>Cord prolapse</p><p>Postpartum haemorrhage</p><p>Shoulder dystocia</p><p>Postpartum morbidity</p><p>Requiring blood transfusion</p><p>Systemic infection &#x02013; temp&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;38&#x000b0;C</p><p>b) <bold>Neonatal outcomes</bold></p><p>Live birth</p><p>Stillbirth (a baby delivered with no signs of life after 24 completed weeks of pregnancy)</p><p>Birth weight</p><p>Sex</p><p>Death before discharge from hospital</p><p>Apgar at 1 min</p><p>Apgar at 5 min</p><p>Apgar at 10 minutes &#x02013; allow missing data</p><p>Cord blood artery pH and BD &#x02013; allow missing data</p><p>Cord blood vein pH and BD &#x02013; allow missing data</p><p>NICU admission &#x02013; duration (days)</p><p>If no cord blood and NICU admission required &#x02013; first fetal pH obtained</p><p>Birth trauma</p><p>Subdural haematoma</p><p>Intracerebral or intraventricular haemorrhage</p><p>Spinal-cord injury</p><p>Basal skull fracture</p><p>Peripheral-nerve injury present at discharge from hospital</p><p>Long bone fracture</p><p>Seizures (occurring at less than 24 hr of age or requiring two or more drugs to control them)</p><p>Hypotonia (for at least 2 hrs)</p><p>Abnormal level of consciousness (hyperalert, drowsy or lethargic; stupor/decreased response to pain; coma)</p><p>Tube feeding for&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;4 days</p><p>Intubation and ventilation for&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;24 hrs</p><p>Cooling required</p><p>Oxygen required</p><p>CPAP required</p><p>c) <bold>Outcomes for pilot study</bold></p><p>The recruitment rate per hospital.</p><p>The age distribution of participating women.</p><p>Compliance with the treatment arms of the trial.</p><p>The overall gestational age distribution of the two groups.</p><p>Completeness of outcome data.</p><p>d) <bold>Maternal delivery expectation</bold>/<bold>experience</bold> measured by the Childbirth Experience Questionnaire
