When compared with other commonly utilized rotator cuff repair techniques, transosseous-equivalent rotator cuff constructs have been shown to significantly improve footprint contact characteristics,<sup><xref rid="bibr16-2325967114529257" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> exhibit superior biomechanical properties,<sup><xref rid="bibr17-2325967114529257" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> and prevent extravasation of synovial fluid that inhibits tendon-bone healing.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-2325967114529257" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Although studies have not conclusively shown the superiority of this technique based on clinical results,<sup><xref rid="bibr14-2325967114529257" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> multiple authors argue that this method should be the technique of choice.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-2325967114529257" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>
</p><p>Despite the inherent advantages of this technique, the transosseous-equivalent rotator cuff repair also possesses some frequently encountered shortcomings, notably redundancies in the rotator cuff tissue, which are commonly referred to as &#x0201c;dog ear&#x0201d; deformities. Various suture patterns<sup><xref rid="bibr10-2325967114529257" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="bibr11-2325967114529257" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr12-2325967114529257" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr13-2325967114529257" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> have been created to minimize the occurrence of these deformities or manage them once they are formed, as consequences may include inadequate footprint restoration and impaired healing of the cuff to the greater tuberosity. Commonly encountered in other surgical wounds as well, dog ear deformities are the result of an asymmetric puckering or accumulation of tissue, typically in the center or at the apices of an incision. The etiology and management of these deformities are well described in the plastic and dermatologic surgery literature<sup><xref rid="bibr2-2325967114529257" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bibr6-2325967114529257" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bibr7-2325967114529257" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="bibr19-2325967114529257" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="bibr21-2325967114529257" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="bibr22-2325967114529257" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>; however, there is a relative paucity of literature regarding the causes and implications of dog ear deformities in rotator cuff repairs. This study was performed to quantify the effects of dog ear formation on rotator cuff footprint restoration after repair as well as to assess the association between rotator cuff repair method and the formation and management of dog ear deformities in a human cadaveric model. We hypothesized that the 3 tear sizes would be equally as likely to produce a dog ear deformity and that the 3 repair methods would manage dog ear deformities equivalently.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="section1-2325967114529257"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>The study used 10 fresh-frozen human cadaveric shoulders (6 male, 4 female) with a mean age of 61.2 &#x000b1; 1.7 years at time of death (range, 58-70 years). Specimens were stored at &#x02013;20&#x000b0;C and thawed completely before dissection. Each specimen was visually inspected to rule out any evidence of prior surgery or fracture. On dissection, 3 specimens were found to have massive rotator cuff tears retracted to the glenoid and were thus excluded. The remaining 7 shoulders were randomized and included in the study protocol.</p><sec id="section2-2325967114529257"><title>Specimen Preparation</title><p>Specimens were mounted upright in standard fashion via a vice clamp to the scapula. Skin, superficial fat, and the deltoid were dissected from the scapula, clavicle, and proximal humerus to reveal the rotator cuff musculature and its tendon insertions. The acromion was removed at its base, and the clavicle was excised for improved visualization of the rotator cuff tendons. A nonabsorbable suture was placed in running, locking fashion into the muscle belly of the supraspinatus for approximately 6 cm, beginning just medial to the musculotendinous junction. The free ends of the suture were tied and draped over a pulley, and a 200-g weight was applied to provide constant tension on the rotator cuff repairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2325967114529257">Figure 1</xref>, A and B).

Serial ellipses of tissue were resected, creating elliptical-shaped tears of 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 cm at the apex in the medial to lateral direction, thereby modeling the spectrum from crescent to U-shaped tears and simulating tear retraction. Two 4.5-mm PEEK Corkscrew FT suture anchors (Arthrex, Naples, Florida, USA) were placed at the articular margin evenly spaced from anterior to posterior (1 cm apart in the 3-cm tear space) at 45&#x000b0; relative to the footprint surface (the deadman angle<sup><xref rid="bibr20-2325967114529257" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>). After each tear was created, a microsuture lasso was used to pass the medial row sutures in a horizontal mattress fashion from deep to superficial 1 cm medial to the lateral edge of the rotator cuff tear, centered over each corresponding suture anchor. Rather than tying these sutures, they were tensioned, passed through the 7-mm drill hole in the midshaft of the humerus, and clamped on the medial aspect of the humerus to maintain reduction of the lateral edge of the rotator cuff to the greater tuberosity. Resulting dog ear deformities were injected with an acrylic resin mixture, and the rotator cuff was digitized from its lateral insertion to 1.6 cm medial<sup><xref rid="bibr5-2325967114529257" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> using the MicroScribe 3D Digitizer (Solution Technologies, Oella, Maryland, USA). Calibrated photographs were taken perpendicular to the footprint by photographing the rotator cuff and a 2-cm ruler. The sutures were then removed from the rotator cuff tissue, and an additional ellipse of rotator cuff measuring 5 mm medial to lateral at its apex was resected. Sutures were replaced 1 cm from the newly formed edge of the cuff, and the sequence of injection, photographs, and digitization was repeated. This same sequence was again repeated on a tear size of 1.5 cm in the medial-lateral direction.</p></sec><sec id="section4-2325967114529257"><title>Injection Technique</title><p>A mixture of 2 mL poly-methylmethacrylate (Acraweld Repair Powder; Henry Schein, Melville, NY, USA) and 1 mL acrylic liquid was placed into a 1-mL syringe. An 18-gauge intravenous catheter tip was used on the end of the syringe for the injection. The edge of the tissue forceps was used to compress the rotator cuff to the humerus 1.6 cm medial to the lateral edge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-2325967114529257">Figure 3</xref>). This dam prevented the acrylic resin mixture from passing medially into the patulous intra-articular space medial to the rotator cuff footprint. The mixture was then injected into the dog ears in similar fashion to cementing techniques, retracting the syringe as the potential space was filled with the compound. The volume of acrylic resin mixture required to fill the dog ear deformity was recorded to quantify the size of the dog ear deformity. After injection, 30 seconds were allotted to allow the mixture to cure and harden, providing a firm surface to digitize using the MicroScribe 3D Digitizer. The resin was then completely removed from the specimen after each repair technique was performed.</p><fig id="fig3-2325967114529257" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Creating a dam.

Two-way ANOVAs (SAS) were run for each volume, with the condition of the cuff (0.5-cm tear, 1-cm tear, 1.5-cm tear, SutureBridge repair, SpeedBridge repair, and FiberLink repair) as one factor and measurement (first trial, second trial, third trial) as the second factor. Both factors were repeated on the 5 subjects that were studied.

The additional peripheral looped suture further compresses the rotator cuff tendon against the bone and can be placed at the apex of a dog ear deformity, maximizing tendon-bone contact. With this increased contact area at the greater tuberosity footprint, we would expect better healing, in part because of less fluid extravasation and thus less interference with healing.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-2325967114529257" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> While we were unable to determine a threshold tear size at which the surgeon should expect marginal dog ear deformities, with larger tears, the surgeon should be prepared to address these deformities with either the modified suture bridge<sup><xref rid="bibr11-2325967114529257" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> or peripheral FiberLink sutures, as described here.</p><p>The goals of a rotator cuff repair include restoration of the anatomic footprint without excessive tension, minimizing gap formation, and stable initial fixation that can be sustained until healing.<sup><xref rid="bibr18-2325967114529257" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> The transosseous-equivalent technique of rotator cuff repair achieves these goals in the majority of cases. However, the formation of peripheral dog ear deformities is not uncommon with this method.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-2325967114529257" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> A marginal dog ear deformity after repair may be considered similar to a bursal-sided partial-thickness rotator cuff tear as it can result in the lack of contact between a substantial portion of the rotator cuff and the greater tuberosity. Beyond the understanding that dog ear deformities are more frequent in large tears than in medium tears,<sup><xref rid="bibr10-2325967114529257" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> knowledge of how these deformities are created and their impact on rotator cuff footprint restoration is limited. The ability to characterize, quantify, and manage these imperfections will prove useful to all who perform arthroscopic rotator cuff repairs. To our knowledge, this is the first quantitative study assessing the creation and management of dog ear deformities in rotator cuff repairs in a human cadaveric model.</p><p>Dog ear deformities are well documented in the plastic and dermatologic surgical literature. Jaibaji et al<sup><xref rid="bibr8-2325967114529257" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> define a dog ear as a characteristic puckering of the skin occurring after wound closure. Dzubow<sup><xref rid="bibr6-2325967114529257" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> defined dog ears as tissue redundancies secondary to length inequalities, rotation, or contour changes. Weisberg et al<sup><xref rid="bibr21-2325967114529257" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> further describe that wounds closed under excessive tension will cause a depression of the central portion and vertical displacement of the apices, thus creating the appearance of dog ears. Wounds on convex surfaces, similar to the rotator cuff footprint at the greater tuberosity, are more susceptible to this deformity.<sup><xref rid="bibr21-2325967114529257" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Techniques used in plastic and dermatologic surgery to manage dog ear deformities, including fusiform excision, S-plasty, M-plasty, and V-excision,<sup><xref rid="bibr2-2325967114529257" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bibr6-2325967114529257" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="bibr7-2325967114529257" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr8-2325967114529257" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="bibr19-2325967114529257" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="bibr21-2325967114529257" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="bibr22-2325967114529257" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> are not applicable to dog ear deformities in rotator cuff repairs.</p><p>For large, retracted, U-shaped tears, margin convergence can be used to minimize formation of dog ear deformities.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-2325967114529257" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Kandemir et al<sup><xref rid="bibr9-2325967114529257" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> introduced the concept of a repair ratio as a guide for application of margin convergence. The authors defined a repair ratio as the ratio of the length of the torn tendon edge and the length of the avulsed insertion site. For a repair ratio of 1, the entire avulsed tendon edge can be repaired to the greater tuberosity footprint. However, for a repair ratio of 2, only 50% of the tendon edge can be repaired to bone. The authors state that the remainder of the torn edge that cannot be repaired to bone should be repaired in a side-to-side fashion. Some tears, however, are not amenable to side-to-side repair and are destined to form dog ears at the periphery. While our data show that larger tears were more likely to result in larger dog ears, it lacked the power to show this relationship to be statistically significant. Alternatively, Kim et al<sup><xref rid="bibr11-2325967114529257" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> reported on a technique of using the suture tails from the lateral row anchors to create an additional site of compression in the marginal dog ear deformity, the so-called modified suture bridge. Other authors have purported using additional anchors<sup><xref rid="bibr11-2325967114529257" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> or a triple-mattress repair with a single row of triple-loaded suture anchors<sup><xref rid="bibr12-2325967114529257" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="bibr13-2325967114529257" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> to manage these deformities. However, there is no literature to quantify the size of these dog ear deformities before and after these various repair techniques.</p><p>This is the first study to quantify the height, width, and volume of dog ear deformities after various rotator cuff repair methods. It was performed on human cadavers with ages consistent with the pathology of rotator cuff tears. Several limitations regarding this study should be considered. First, many variations in rotator cuff repair methods exist for the transosseous-equivalent repair. This study does not attempt to determine the dog ear deformity characteristics for all possible configurations, including the multitude of tear configurations, suture anchor designs, and suture material, but rather provides a simple comparison between suture bridge, transosseous-equivalent repair with 2-mm fiber tape, and transosseous-equivalent repair with 2-mm fiber tape and peripheral No. 2 nonabsorbable looped sutures incorporated in the lateral row anchors. We felt that these repair methods were representative of rotator cuff repair methods that are in clinical use.</p><p>The dog ear volume determined by injection of the acrylic resin mixture may have been influenced by leakage into the glenohumeral joint space medially. An attempt was made to obstruct the escape of the mixture into the glenohumeral joint using tissue forceps compressing the cuff 1.6 cm medial to the repair edge (the mean medial to lateral width of the supraspinatus footprint).<sup><xref rid="bibr5-2325967114529257" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> The influence of this factor is negligible based on the fact that there was no statistical difference between the injection- and MicroScribe-derived volumes.</p><p>One goal of our study was to determine a threshold of tear retraction at which a sizeable dog ear deformity can be expected. We did not show a significant difference in the dog ear sizes between tears with simulated retraction of 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 cm. Tears of these sizes may behave differently in an in vivo model as they are likely to retract over time, a phenomenon that we did not observe in our cadavers. Our study only looked at 1 tear configuration, a 3-cm ellipse with a maximum 1.5-cm retraction. Further knowledge could be gained if this study were to be repeated on more cadavers with differing tear geometries, including large U-shaped tears. This is a potential limitation since massive tears with further retraction to the glenoid were not assessed. Perhaps with larger medial to lateral tear sizes we would be able to determine a threshold tear that leads to sizeable dog ear deformities. This information would prove useful for preoperative planning purposes. While this study quantifies dog ears and demonstrates a reproducible method for their management, further studies are needed to assess the biomechanical and clinical impact such deformities have on healing and postoperative function.</p></sec><sec id="section18-2325967114529257"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In characterizing dog ear deformities and assessing the factors impacting their creation, this study helps the surgeon better understand how to avoid and manage these irregularities in rotator cuff repair.
