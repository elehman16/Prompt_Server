Whilst group-based parenting programmes are recommended for treating and preventing conduct disorder in older children, there is, as yet, little evidence as to whether they have a positive effect on very young children and their carers&#x02019;. Recent UK Government initiatives to support families and improve parenting skills in the first 2&#x000a0;years of children&#x02019;s lives have increased the demand for the delivery and evaluation of community-based programmes. Eighty mother&#x02013;child dyads were recruited from nine areas to intervention (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;54) and control condition (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;26). Baseline measures were collected in the children&#x02019;s home when the infants were on average 3-months-old, and follow-up measures were collected 6&#x000a0;months post-baseline (N&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;63). Mothers&#x02019; positive play behaviours were independently coded from video recordings taken in the home. Other measures included self-reported maternal confidence and mental well-being, assessed infant development and home environment. Socio-demographic data was collected once at baseline. After controlling for baseline scores, control mothers were observed to be significantly less sensitive during play with their baby at the 6&#x000a0;months follow-up with a significant increase in confidence. No differences were found between the groups on the other measures. This paper provides limited evidence for the effectiveness of the Incredible Years Parents and Babies group-based programme delivered in the first year of life. Further evaluation, particularly with parents at increased risk of poorer outcomes is needed to confirm and extend these results.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Positive parenting</kwd><kwd>Mother</kwd><kwd>Sensitivity</kwd><kwd>Infant</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>ERDF Knowledge Economy Skills Scholarship studentship in partnership with the Children&#x02019;s Early Intervention Trust </institution></funding-source><award-id>BU Maxi 017</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jones</surname><given-names>Catrin Hedd</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer Science+Business Media New York 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Parents are the main source of influence on their children&#x02019;s development. The quality of interactions and continuity of response by a significant caregiver establishes a pattern of expectation in the infant. This supports the development of an &#x02018;internal working model&#x02019; which can affect attachment security and future relationships (Ainsworth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1985</xref>; Bowlby <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">1969/1997</xref>; Guajardo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2009</xref>; Meins et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">1998</xref>; Rutter et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">1998</xref>). Children who develop a secure attachment are more likely to be rated by teachers as independent explorers, demonstrate a strong sense of selfhood, adopt a flexible approach in peer interactions at pre-school and achieve better academic outcomes (Meins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">1997</xref>; Pearson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2011</xref>; Sroufre et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">1983</xref>; Turner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">1991</xref>).</p><p>Positive Parenting is defined as &#x0201c;the continual relationship of a parent(s) and a child or children that includes caring, teaching, leading, communicating, and providing for the needs of a child consistently and unconditionally&#x0201d;(Seay et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2014</xref>, p. 207). This definition reflects the diversity of skills required from parents. A positive relationship between parents and their children and the quality of children&#x02019;s early environment can have long-term effects on their cognitive and behavioural development (Shonkoff <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2011</xref>). Positive parenting can also support the development of infants&#x02019; coping mechanisms and decrease the risk of the externalising behaviour problems developing in later childhood (Boeldt et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2011</xref>).</p><p>Mothers who commented more on their 6-month-old infant&#x02019;s internal mental states were observed to have infants who were classified as securely attached at 12-months of age. Increased parental awareness of their child&#x02019;s internal mental state encourages the infant&#x02019;s sense of security and fosters early social and emotional development (De Wolff and Van IJzendoorn <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">1997</xref>; Meins et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">1998</xref>, Meins et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2001</xref>). Lack of appropriate communication has been shown to affect infants as young as 2-months of age. Experiments by Tronick and Cohn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">1989</xref>) demonstrated that mother&#x02019;s presenting a &#x02018;still&#x02019; expressionless face to their infant initially provoked attempts by the infants to attract their mother&#x02019;s attention; however, infants of depressed mothers, accustomed to lower levels of visual interaction, did not protest at the lack of interaction (Tronick and Gianino <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">1986</xref>). Infants who experience negative parenting or lack of stimulation become withdrawn and the resulting cyclical process of less rewarding interaction between infant and parent can be difficult to resolve, with increased risks of children developing conduct disorders (Lorber and Egeland <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2011</xref>). Lower levels of adult speech and activity during interactions with 1-year-old infants significantly predict a diagnosis of child psychiatric disorder at 7&#x000a0;years of age (Marwick et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2013</xref>). The style of parenting can also impact on children with negative, controlling mothers more likely to have children who show increased problem behaviours in preschool (Spieker et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">1999</xref>).</p><p>A study comparing the cognitive development (the Millennium Cohort Survey, N&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;12,644) of children assessed from birth to 5&#x000a0;years of age reported an 11.1-month gap between low and middle-income children&#x02019;s vocabulary test scores at 5&#x000a0;years of age (Waldfogel and Washbrook <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">2010</xref>). Multivariate analysis of the factors contributing to the gap showed parenting and the quality of the home environment to be the most important factors affecting the children&#x02019;s scores. Parenting programmes have been shown to be effective in supporting parents&#x02019; mental well-being and confidence and this can have a long-term beneficial influence on the children&#x02019;s social, economic and health outcomes (Bywater et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2009</xref>; Olds et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">1998</xref>). Mothers identified at increased risk of poor parenting skills who received home visiting and group support for their child&#x02019;s first year were more responsive to their infant&#x02019;s communication and their children were more securely attached, more task-orientated and autonomous than the children of mothers who did not receive the support (Heinicke et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">1999</xref>).</p><p>The well-being of parents and children are naturally intertwined and the transition into caring for their new infant could be an effective window of opportunity to support parents and influence positive parenting practice. O&#x02019;Connell et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2015</xref>) described positive parenting as an &#x0201c;effective, yet underused, lever of paediatric outcomes&#x0201d; (p. 286). The World Health Organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">2016</xref>) defines mental health as a state of well-being in &#x0201c;which every individual realizes his or her own potential, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and fruitfully, and is able to make a contribution to her or his community&#x0201d;. The WHO&#x02019;s report on Early Child Development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">2007</xref>) stated that &#x0201c;What children experience during the early years sets a critical foundation for their entire lifecourse&#x0201d;. Recent cross-party UK political support for families in the first 2&#x000a0;years of life (Allen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2011</xref>; Commons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2015</xref>) resulted in debates in both the House of Commons and Lords supporting the &#x02018;1001 Critical days&#x02019; manifesto and its vision that parents need to feel confident to raise their children in a loving and supportive environment. This manifesto represents a cultural shift towards early intervention to prevent problems from developing. Offering early support to parents is now viewed as a cost-effective investment to ensure all children, irrespective of their environment, get the best possible start in life (Allen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2011</xref>; Hall and Elliman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2006</xref>). A recent cost-benefit analysis estimated that by identifying 5-year-old children with conduct disorder and offering support through an evidence-based parenting programme, the invested support would yield savings of &#x000a3;16,400 per family over the following 25&#x000a0;years compared to the cost incurred if no treatment were provided (Bonin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2011</xref>).</p><p>Numerous RCT&#x02019;s with parents of school-aged children have shown that parenting groups are effective in improving children&#x02019;s mental health and reducing their behavioural problems (Barlow et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2014</xref>; Hutchings et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2007</xref>). Recent research by King et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2015</xref>) demonstrated that mothers with children younger than 2&#x000a0;years-of-age who attended community-based parenting groups demonstrated increased maternal sensitivity and reduced maternal depression.</p><p>The evidence for positive outcomes from programmes in the first year of parenting is limited, with the majority of the research reporting on expensive, individual support. A meta-analysis by Bakermans-Kranenburg et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2003</xref>) included 81 intervention studies that started before the child was 54-months of age, however only 33&#x000a0;% of the interventions were delivered outside the home and the review did not specify which interventions were group-based. The RCT&#x02019;s in their review (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;51, including 6282 mothers) showed that interventions at this early stage of parenting had a small effect in enhancing maternal sensitivity (d&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.33) and infant attachment security (d&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.22).</p><p>The Nurse-Family Partnership (NFP) is an individual support programme providing weekly home visits for targeted first-time mothers from the antenatal period until the child is 2&#x000a0;years of age (Olds et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2010</xref>). Extensive research on the NFP in the USA has demonstrated long-term benefits. These include improved pre-natal mental health, longer spacing between the birth of the first and second child, reduced childhood injuries, improved school readiness and reduced dependency on welfare payments (Goodman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2006</xref>; Olds et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2007</xref>). A pilot trial of the programme in the UK was promising but, a recent RCT evaluation in England has failed to show short-term benefits in levels of smoking during late pregnancy, hospital admissions for children and the proportion of second pregnancies in the first 2&#x000a0;years (Robling et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2015</xref>).</p><p>Intensive home visits by nurses to low-income families from pregnancy and throughout the first 2&#x000a0;years of parenting cost $9600 per family (Lee et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2012</xref>) and in times of financial constraints; this limits the number of mothers for whom such support can be provided. Groups have been shown to be six times as cost effective as individual and clinic support (Cunningham et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">1995</xref>).</p><p>Only a few studies have made direct comparisons of individual and group-based parenting programmes. Research with teenage mothers showed greater reductions in behaviour problems at home and better maintenance of these gains at 6-month follow-up after attending a group programme compared to individual support (Coren et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2003</xref>).</p><p>The Incredible Years (IY) parenting programmes are part of a suite of group-based programmes for parents, children and teachers, developed by Webster-Stratton (Pidano and Allen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2015</xref>; Webster-Stratton <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2011</xref>). The IY parent programmes are based on social learning theory principles, including the modelling of positive parenting practice in groups. Parents are encouraged to establish a positive relationship with their children through joint activities and praise. Groups are delivered by two trained leaders and parents collaboratively identify core parenting principles during group discussion following viewing pre-recorded vignettes of parent&#x02013;child interactions. These principles are then practised in the group and home activities are set.</p><p>The Welsh Government Parenting Action Plan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">2005</xref>) supported the provision of the Incredible Years parenting programmes with resources and training for group leaders to enable them to deliver the programme to a high standard and with fidelity to the manual. This support enabled a range of Incredible Years (IY) programmes to be delivered and evaluated in real world settings. Evaluation of the IY parenting programme within Sure Start areas with parents of identified high-challenge 3- and 4-year-old children demonstrated significant improvements in child behaviour, parental mental health, positive parenting and a range of other measures (Hutchings et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2007</xref>) with benefits maintained at the 18&#x000a0;month follow-up (Bywater et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2009</xref>). Following this evidence of successful outcomes for the IY parenting programmes in Wales, the IY Baby and Toddler parenting programmes (Webster-Stratton <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">2008</xref>) were introduced to support families in the early pre-school years. The Welsh Government funding supported leader training for over 475 parenting workers to deliver these IY programmes. The 12-week toddler programme was evaluated in an RCT study which reported significant improvements in observed parental praise and improved maternal mental well-being relative to waiting list control mothers at 6&#x000a0;months with significant improvements at 12&#x000a0;months for the intervention sample only for child development, home environment, and parental depression by which time control families had been offered the intervention (Hutchings et al., submitted). Recently reported significant improvements in self-reported parenting confidence and mental well-being in parents who attended the Incredible Years Parent and Baby programme (IYPB) community groups in Wales is encouraging (Evans et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2015</xref>). However, the study by Evans et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2015</xref>) only collected pre- and post-course measures in the groups and did not have any control comparison parents.</p><p>This paper reports data from the first comparison study of the IY Parents and Babies programme in which data was collected by independent researchers. Based on the existing literature, we hypothesised that mothers attending the group would show more positive parenting behaviours than mothers in the control condition and that maternal parenting confidence and mental well-being would improve as the result of the intervention.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Method</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Participants</title><p>The study&#x02019;s eligibility criteria required that mothers had infants aged between 2 and 16&#x000a0;weeks at baseline and who were living in an area where trained leaders were planning to deliver the IYPB programme within the study schedule. Mothers who had previously attended an IY parent programme or were currently receiving individual parenting support were not eligible to take part in this study. Eligible mothers were invited by group leaders to take part in the study (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> for details), and once they indicated their willingness to participate, informed consent was obtained by the researcher (first author) at a prearranged home visit. Baseline data was also collected at the same visit and mothers were encouraged to interact with their baby in their first language.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Consort diagram of the numbers of families involved in the study</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10826_2016_489_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>
</p><p>A summary of the demographic characteristics of all mothers who provided baseline data is presented in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>.

The mean age of mothers leaving full-time education was 16.67&#x000a0;years (range 13&#x02013;22, SD&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1.49). The infants were 52.4&#x000a0;% male and Welsh was the first language for 12 mothers, (19.0&#x000a0;%) equivalent to national proportions (Welsh Government <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">2015</xref>) with the remainder identifying English as their first language (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;51, 81.0&#x000a0;%).

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Procedure</title><p>This was a repeated measures (pre-post) quantitative study with the parental self-report and systematic observational data collected by the researchers in the community. Mothers were invited to take part in a study and allocated on a first come first served basis to compare usual care (provided health and social care services) plus attendance at the 8&#x000a0;week IYPB parenting programme to usual care alone (control). The study was approved by the Welsh NHS Research Ethics Committee (10/WNo01/40) and registered with ISRCTN (number ISRCTN62055412).</p><p>Once a sufficient number of families were recruited for an IYPB group, five of the nine areas continued to recruit waiting list control families. These were areas that planned to deliver the IY toddler programme and the recruited waiting list control parents were informed they would be offered places on the IY toddler programme after the 6-month follow-up assessment. Fourteen mothers who provided baseline data and were offered a place on the IYPB programme did not attend any sessions; another parent who attended the group and two control parents declined to complete follow-up interviews (see Jones et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2012</xref> for more details) this paper reports the data from the parents for whom both baseline and follow-up measures were available.</p><p>All group leaders had received the 2-day IYPB leader training and each group was co-led by two leaders (N&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;17, one leader co-led two groups). The leaders were mainly health visitors (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;10), other professions included family centre managers, specialist behaviour practitioners, parenting workers, educational and child psychologists. The majority of the leaders (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;14, 82&#x000a0;%) were leading their first IYPB group and five leaders (29&#x000a0;%) had not delivered any IY parent programmes prior to this study. Each group leader was invited to attend weekly supervision during the intervention provided by a qualified IY mentor.

The numbers of intervals when the behaviours were observed were totalled for the 10-min video recording of mothers&#x02019; play with their infants. No toys were allowed in the first 5&#x000a0;min and a standard toy was introduced for the subsequent 5&#x000a0;min. Parent behaviours were coded independently by a graduate who was trained by the first author using the PIPOc manual (Jones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2013</xref>). The coder remained blind to the group allocation of observed parents. Factor analysis of the data resulted in the six positive parenting behaviours forming three main behaviour components (Sensitive Parenting, Physical Encouragement and Verbal Engagement). Global scores for the PIPOc were produced by summing the values for these three positive parenting behaviour components. The PIPOc has shown strong to excellent intra-class correlation (ICC) test&#x02013;retest reliability scores on each target behaviour (N&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;6) observed over a 17-day interval (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;15) ICC single measure&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;.7&#x02013;.9.

</p><p>Both groups showed significant increases in mean Griffiths GQ scores from baseline to follow-up. These results may reflect improved developmental outcome or more accurate assessment as the infant develops more items were available for assessment. Significant improvements were also shown in the IT HOME scores of both the intervention and control groups over time, with the intervention group showing a very large effect size.</p><p>Neither the control nor IYPB group showed any significant changes in WEMWBS scores from baseline to follow-up. This may be because both groups demonstrated high baseline scores on this measure, other studies with at-risk families referred for interventions reported lower baseline values of 42.6 (SD&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;9.4) (Family Links; Grant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2012</xref>), 42.9 (SD&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;10.3) (PEIP, Lindsay et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2011</xref>) and 43.37 (SD&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;10.18) (IY Toddler evaluation; Griffith <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2011</xref>).</p><p>The control group reported a (0.12) increase in mean KPCS score from baseline to follow-up, which was significant (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;.046). A smaller, non-significant, increase was also evident in the KPCS scores of the IYPB group scores over time. Both groups reported mean baseline scores which were higher than the post group data reported by Evans et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2015</xref>) and &#x0010c;rn&#x0010d;ec et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2008a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">b</xref>).</p><p>The results from the PIPOc observational measure comparing baseline and 6-month follow-up data showed both groups increased in Global positive parenting and PIPOc Verbal Engagement. Neither group showed any significant changes in PIPOc Physical Encouragement scores from baseline to follow-up.</p><p>The IYPB group showed no significant changes in PIPOc Sensitive Parenting scores from baseline to follow-up. However, the control group were observed to show a significant reduction (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;.004) in PIPOc Sensitive scores from baseline to follow-up.</p><p>Variables such as mothers&#x02019; age at first birth, parity, marital status and baby&#x02019;s gender were excluded as covariates from the ANCOVA analyses because they were found to have no overall effect on the direction of the results. The first two models showed no main effect for treatment condition on PIPOc Physical Encouragement and Verbal Engagement components follow-up scores after controlling for baseline scores with both subscales showing an overall improvement for both groups. However, the final model for the PIPOc Sensitive Parenting sub-variable did show a main effect for treatment condition after controlling for the baseline covariate score, <italic>F</italic>(1,59)&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;5.66, <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;.021, partial eta-squared&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;.088.

The IYPB intervention appears to have been effective in increasing mothers&#x02019; Sensitive Parenting scores relative to the changes in control parents observed sensitivity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Discussion</title><p>The caregivers in this study were all biological mothers, Caucasian and living in rural areas of Wales. Therefore, the results cannot be generalised without replication in urban or multi-cultural samples, although other IY programmes have been shown to be equally effective with parents from different cultural backgrounds (Reid et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2003</xref>). At present, we do not know whether the IYPB intervention would be effective with fathers or other carers.</p><p>Despite the practical and financial constraints within the present research, which prevented an RCT design, baseline data on key demographic and outcome measures showed that intervention and waiting list control group parents were well matched. The groups were all delivered within a schedule that enabled leaders to join other IYPB group leaders in weekly supervision. This support was valued by the leaders, as many were delivering their first IYPB groups; however, the schedule for the groups and relatively low birth rates within the recruitment areas limited the number of families who were eligible to take part.</p><p>The requirement for parents to opt in/self-select to the study appears to have resulted in parents with above average levels of mental well-being and confidence taking part, possibly reducing the scope for improvement in these areas following a brief intervention. The group means for KPCS in this study were higher than the mean scores reported by the scale developers (&#x0010c;rn&#x0010d;ec et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2008a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">b</xref>; Kohlhoff and Barnett <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2013</xref>) and parents in a targeted recruitment to IYPB groups over a longer period reported by Evans et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2015</xref>) demonstrated lower self-assessed parenting confidence and mental health at the start of the programme. Essentially, the parenting confidence of the study sample was high at the outset, which limited the potential for improvement. Similarly, baseline mental well-being scores (WEMWBS) were also higher in this study than in twelve other reported studies that have previously utilised this measure during intervention studies (Maheswaran et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2012</xref>). The high group baseline mean scores for parent-reported mental well-being and confidence suggest that the opt-in mechanism for recruiting families to the evaluation may have attracted mothers who were motivated and self-assured in relation to their skills as a parent, leaving less scope for improvement after an 8-week programme.</p><p>The parents in both intervention and control conditions within our study showed improvements on the infants Griffiths GQ scores, IT HOME ratings, and parents observed PIPOc Global and PIPOc Verbal Engagement scores. The universal access to services as usual which in the UK are well developed (Hall and Elliman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2006</xref>) may have had a positive impact on the families irrespective of their status in this study. A larger study which monitored use of other services would be justified to increase our understanding of the benefits gained from parenting support.</p><p>Research by Hutchings et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2007</xref>) evaluating the preschool IY programme included a screening tool for parents recruited to the study, hence ensuring the programme was delivered to parents who were most in need of additional support. Future research should consider targeting recruitment of parents with infants between 3 and 6&#x000a0;months of age at baseline who may be at higher risk of poorer outcomes. The significant benefit for the intervention group in observed maternal sensitivity was not evident in the rating of maternal warmth by the researcher using the IT-HOME subscale. Although we found the expected associations between the PIPOc global scores and IT- HOME measure, the latter measure was possibly less sensitive to change in the mothers&#x02019; interactions with their infants. This finding is consistent with the literature that promotes the use of direct observational measures over indirect assessments of behaviour (Aspland and Gardner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2003</xref>), and provides another justification for independent observation.</p><p>The observed positive parenting behaviours: Verbal Engagement and Global PIPOc scores, increased for the whole sample with no significant differences observed between the two groups. It is possible that in the early months of the infants&#x02019; lives, mothers adapted their behaviours as the infants became more alert and that this is a natural change in mother-baby interactions as shown by the longitudinal analysis of maternal responsiveness by Bornstein et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2008</xref>). Further research with a larger sample would be needed to confirm this shift in parenting behaviour to coincide with infant development. The encouraging benefit of intervention on PIPOc Sensitive Parenting in this study may facilitate infants secure attachment, an important protective factor in children at increased risk of poorer outcomes.</p><p>The IY programmes have fidelity tools that include basic leader training; manual and other resources for parents including the IY baby book which was published after this study. In addition, there is a rigorous leader certification process as part of which leaders submit a tape of a full session of delivery of the programme and this is rated for the key leader collaborative process skills. This is a quality control process that provides evidence that the programme is being delivered as intended. Most of the mothers in the intervention group had group leaders who were delivering the programme for the first time and none had achieved leader certification so it is likely that the present results underestimate the true effectiveness of the IYPB intervention. A trial with certified leaders who have more experience in programme delivery is needed to establish if experience and certification of leaders results in better outcomes.</p><p>The IYPB group leaders encouraged mothers to observe their infants and the video vignettes modelled how to respond appropriately to their infants&#x02019; cues. We predicted that mothers attending this group-based intervention would interact more positively and encourage their infants&#x02019; development. It seems likely that this was effective, as we found that the IYPB intervention increased mothers&#x02019; Sensitive Parenting PIPOc scores relative to the control group. The size of this improvement in maternal sensitivity in the group of parents who attended the IYPB (Cohen&#x02019;s d&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.32) was comparable to the effect sizes reported in Bakermans-Kranenburg et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2003</xref>) review of RCT intervention effects on maternal sensitivity (d&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.33).</p><p>The results from this study have higher ecological validity than laboratory-based research since all the data including the observations of mothers playing with their infants were collected in the home. The results of the IYPB intervention evaluated in the present paper suggest that although the parents were already functioning well at the start of the programme, it successfully increased the mothers&#x02019; sensitivity to their infants&#x02019; needs relative to control parents over the same time period.</p><p>Although the demographic and health data collected in this study showed parents were well matched, the small sample size limited the potential for any moderator and mediator analyses of the results. The parents and infants in the study had access to other support programmes in their community and this reflects the challenges of evaluating such interventions within communities already receiving universal early years support. The other challenge involved evaluating a brief intervention targeted at promoting positive parenting and preventing problems from developing when only short-term outcome measures were available.</p><p>The IYPB programme has the potential to impact on attachment and support the establishment of stable relationships at a crucial period of development. A larger RCT delivered by experienced and certified IYPB leaders working with parents at greater risk for poorer outcomes with service use followed from birth into school-age would be justified. This would further increase our understanding of the value of primary preventative parenting interventions delivered to families in the first year of their child&#x02019;s life.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was funded by the ERDF Knowledge Economy Skills Scholarship studentship in partnership with the Children&#x02019;s Early Intervention Trust (BU Maxi 017).
