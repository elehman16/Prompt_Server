Players were randomly assigned to a control (N = 14, participated only in measurements and practices) or an experimental group (N = 20, participated also in a football match). Participants trained daily during the two days after the match. Match and training overload was monitored with GPS devices. Venous blood was sampled and muscle damage was assessed pre-match, post-match and at 12h, 36h and 60h post-match. Isometric strength as well as eccentric and concentric peak torque of knee flexors and extensors in both limbs (dominant and non-dominant) were measured on an isokinetic dynamometer at baseline and at 12h, 36h and 60h after the match. Functional (KF<sub>ecc</sub>/KE<sub>con</sub>) and conventional (KF<sub>con</sub>/KE<sub>con</sub>) ratios were then calculated. Only eccentric peak torque of knee flexors declined at 60h after the match in the control group. In the experimental group: a) isometric strength of knee extensors and knee flexors declined (P&#x0003c;0.05) at 12h (both limbs) and 36h (dominant limb only), b) eccentric and concentric peak torque of knee extensors and flexors declined (P&#x0003c;0.05) in both limbs for 36h at 60&#x000b0;/s and for 60h at 180&#x000b0;/s with eccentric peak torque of knee flexors demonstrating a greater (P&#x0003c;0.05) reduction than concentric peak torque, c) strength deterioration was greater (P&#x0003c;0.05) at 180&#x000b0;/s and in dominant limb, d) the functional ratio was more sensitive to match-induced fatigue demonstrating a more prolonged decline. Discriminant and regression analysis revealed that strength deterioration and recovery may be related to the amount of eccentric actions performed during the match and athletes' football-specific conditioning. Our data suggest that recovery kinetics of knee flexor and extensor strength after a football match demonstrate strength, limb and velocity specificity and may depend on match physical overload and players' physical conditioning level.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Donation received by Bodosakis Foundation, Athens, Greece Departmental funding to IGF.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="6"/><table-count count="7"/><page-count count="22"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>During Association football (soccer) competition, football players cover a distance of 9&#x02013;13 km at high intensity including &#x0003e;200 high-intensity runs that require demanding changes in direction [<xref rid="pone.0128072.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] with forceful accelerations/decelerations [<xref rid="pone.0128072.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] causing fatigue during and at the end of a game [<xref rid="pone.0128072.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Daily in-season training protocols incorporate a similar activity profile of lower volume compared to match-play [<xref rid="pone.0128072.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The recovery process from a game is slow compared to continuous sports of similar duration [<xref rid="pone.0128072.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], which may be associated with the specific movement pattern of the game provoking muscle injuries, inflammation and impaired recovery [<xref rid="pone.0128072.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. As professional players may participate in &#x0003e;70 matches/season, interspersed with 3 to 6-day training sessions over the course of a ~10 month long season, accumulated fatigue may deteriorate performance and increase inflammation that may predispose athletes to injuries [<xref rid="pone.0128072.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Injuries may occur during practice and match-play with hamstring tears and anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) ruptures being more common [<xref rid="pone.0128072.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Imbalances between the strength of knee extensors (KE) and flexors (KF), poor eccentric strength of KF and bilateral strength asymmetries may represent serious injury risk factors in professional and semiprofessional players [<xref rid="pone.0128072.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] although a recent systematic review concluded that evidence for the risk factor muscle imbalance are still inconclusive [<xref rid="pone.0128072.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. During forceful knee extensions when running and kicking, hamstrings contract eccentrically to counteract anterior shear forces and decelerate tibia's forward movement and internal rotation during the later part of a forward swing phase [<xref rid="pone.0128072.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. It has been documented that isokinetic evaluation of lower limb strength and use of KF:KE ratios to evaluate potential asymmetries is a valuable screening tool for injury risk and development of injury prevention strategies [<xref rid="pone.0128072.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Indeed, abnormal conventional (KF peak concentric torque to KE peak concentric torque, KF<sub>con</sub>/KE-<sub>con</sub>) and functional (KF peak eccentric torque to the KE peak concentric torque, KF<sub>ecc</sub>/KE<sub>con</sub>) ratios have been associated with hamstring/ACL injury risk [<xref rid="pone.0128072.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Fatigue induced by simulated intense football activity significantly altered both ratios due to a greater loss of KF strength [<xref rid="pone.0128072.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0128072.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] rendering KF more susceptible to stretch injury [<xref rid="pone.0128072.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, the use of KF<sub>con</sub>/KE<sub>con</sub> has been questioned since opposing muscles cannot contract concentrically simultaneously whereas KF<sub>ecc</sub>/KE<sub>con</sub> evaluates muscle actions taking place simultaneously [<xref rid="pone.0128072.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Reduced KF<sub>ecc</sub>/KE<sub>con</sub> indicates suboptimal KF strength to decelerate the tibia at the end of a forceful eccentric contraction predisposing the musculo-tendinous unit to tearing [<xref rid="pone.0128072.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128072.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128072.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Consequently, deceleration is limited and KF, in order to maintain limb's forward momentum, must produce a greater eccentric contraction which may then cause their tearing [<xref rid="pone.0128072.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128072.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128072.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>The occurrence of acceleration/deceleration motions during running, sprinting, tackling, turning, changing pace, physical contact with opposition, jumping and changes in direction have been associated with muscle damage induced by football matches and their frequency may affect post-match recovery kinetics [<xref rid="pone.0128072.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128072.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. These activities incorporate a strong eccentric component which is associated with the onset of muscle damage [<xref rid="pone.0128072.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] eliciting muscular pain, acute inflammatory response and performance deterioration for as long as 1&#x02013;5 days after a match [<xref rid="pone.0128072.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128072.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. KF may be more susceptible to injury during the rapid transition from their eccentric to concentric contraction, when they act to extend the hip [<xref rid="pone.0128072.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Evidence suggest that at the end of each half hamstrings tears and ACL ruptures are increased because of KF reduced ability to contract eccentrically due to accumulated fatigue [<xref rid="pone.0128072.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] suggesting that KF<sub>ecc</sub>/KE<sub>con</sub> fluctuations may be a better predictor of football injuries. However, no information exists about the temporal changes of KF<sub>ecc</sub>/KE<sub>con</sub> and KF<sub>con</sub>/KE<sub>con</sub> in response to football match-play in competitive players. Most previous studies utilized non-specific, intermittent running protocols on a treadmill or football field to simulate football activity that lack football-specific movement patterns. Thus, the present study aimed to i) examine the temporal effect of football match-induced fatigue on changes in KF and KE strength performance at slow vs. fast contraction velocities, ii) investigate whether the conventional or the functional ratio is more affected by a football game, iii) determine whether KF and KE strength performance fluctuations demonstrate a different response pattern in dominant vs. non-dominant limb, iv) determine factors that may affect strength decline during the inflammatory phase after a football game and v) determine factors that may affect kinetics of strength recovery during the recovery phase of the post-game period. Consequently, our initial null research hypotheses state that: i) strength performance fluctuations of KE and KF following a football game will be related to knee velocity, ii) the conventional and the functional ratios will respond differently to a football game, iii) dominant and non-dominant limbs will demonstrate a different response pattern of KE and KF responses, iv) KE and KF strength decline and recovery following a football game will be associated with players' conditioning status and v) the rate of strength recovery of KF and KE after the game will be related to high-intensity activities performed by the players during the game.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>Participants signed a consent form after they were informed of all risks, discomforts and benefits involved in the study.

The study was conducted one week after completion of the in-season period while players were still accustomed to vigorous training and match loads. Three days after baseline testing, participants played a 90-min match according to official regulations. Athletes were randomly assigned to either a) a control group (C: participated only in daily training and measurements, N = 14) to account for the day-to-day variation of dependent variables or b) an experimental group (EG, participated in a match, N = 20). Participants in EG were randomly assigned to two different teams (each team consisted of a goalkeeper, four defenders, four mid-fielders, two forwards). Two matches were performed and 10 field players were monitored each time. Players participated in the entire match. On match day (18.00&#x02013;20.00), athletes consumed a light standardized meal as described [<xref rid="pone.0128072.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. During the match, participants were allowed to drink only water <italic>ad libitum</italic>. Athletes' activity profile and heart rate was monitored throughout the match. Blood sampling and measurement of muscle damage markers were performed before the match, 3&#x02013;4 min post-match (lactate measurement only) and 2h, 12h, 36h and 60h post-match. KF and KE peak torque was measured at baseline and 12h, 36h and 60h after the match. Since subjects in C did not participate in the experimental game, mean heart rate and peak heart rate values as well as post-game lactate values were not recorded and are not reported. During the post-match period (two days), athletes of both groups participated in one practice session/day (conducted by the investigators) simulating in-season training sessions of corresponding days (<xref rid="pone.0128072.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).

Participants wore a GPS device (15 Hz) equipped with a triaxial accelerometer (100 Hz). Devices were fitted on the upper back using an adjustable neoprene harness and were turned on 45 minutes before use (at least four satellites were detected). The system's validity and reliability is 1.7% [<xref rid="pone.0128072.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and have been applied in football match-play [<xref rid="pone.0128072.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and training [<xref rid="pone.0128072.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Data recorded were exported to software (Team AMS software V 2.1.0.6, GPSports) for subsequent analyses. Match- and practice-related activities were classified as: standing/walking (0.5&#x02013;7.2 km/h), jogging (7.3&#x02013;14.4 km/h), running (14.5&#x02013;19.8 km/h), high-intensity running (19.9&#x02013;25.2 km/h) and sprinting (&#x0003e;25.2 km/h).

GPS units with a frequency of 15 Hz provide a good level of reliability when measuring total distance (ICC&#x0003c;1.9%). However, the ICC increased in the case of peak speed measurement (ICC = 8.1%), especially when the exercise performed in speeds above 20 km/h [<xref rid="pone.0128072.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Heart rate was monitored using a telemetric portable HR monitor system (Team Polar, Polar Electro Oy, Kempele, Finlandia).</p><p>Concentric and eccentric isokinetic peak torque at 60&#x000b0;/s and 180&#x000b0;/s and maximal isometric strength of KE and KF in both dominant and non-dominant limb was measured using an isokinetic dynamometer (Cybex 6000). Prior to testing, participants received adequate instruction and performed a familiarization protocol with submaximal repetitions as well as 10-min warm-up on a cycle ergometer (Monark 834E, Sweden) Participants, sat on the dynamometer with their back slightly reclined, their thigh fully placed on the seat (a thigh-trunk angle of 85&#x000b0; was adapted), were stabilized with pelvic and shoulder strapping. The rotational axis of the knee was lined up with the axis of the instrument (aligned to the lateral femoral epicondyl) with the lever arm strapped on the shank of the tested limb. Participants relaxed their limb to allow a passive measurement of the effects of gravity on the lower limb and lever arm (and a correction was applied on recorded moment of force). During isometric testing, three maximal repetitions were performed separated by 45-second intervals and the highest torque value was recorded [<xref rid="pone.0128072.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Repetitions during which participants performed an initial countermovement were canceled and repeated. During isokinetic testing, knee's range of motion was 70&#x000b0; [<xref rid="pone.0128072.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. To secure knee's full extension, anatomical 90&#x000b0; was assessed manually with a goniometer. During the preliminary instruction and familiarization, participants were taught how to move the lever (by pushing up and pulling down) with a maximal intensity and velocity. During concentric and eccentric testing, knee extension was performed first. For eccentric testing, participants were taught how to resist the lever arm. During isokinetic testing at 60&#x000b0;/s and 180&#x000b0;/s, participants performed five maximal repetitions separated by 60-second intervals. Isometric and isokinetic testing (concentric and eccentric) in each limb were performed in a random sequence separated by a 2-minute recovery period. To ensure maximal effort, verbal encouragement was provided to all participants. The intra-class correlation coefficients for repeated measurements were: 0.92 for isometric strength, 0.91 for concentric knee flexion at 60&#x000b0;/s, 0.88 for concentric knee flexion at 180&#x000b0;/s, 0.94 for concentric knee extension at 60&#x000b0;/s, 0.90 for concentric knee flexion at 180&#x000b0;/s, 0.86 for eccentric knee flexion at 60&#x000b0;/s, 0.83 for eccentric knee flexion at 180&#x000b0;/s, 0.85 for eccentric knee extension at 60&#x000b0;/s, 0.88 for eccentric knee flexion at 180&#x000b0;/s).</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Blood sampling and assays</title><p>After an overnight fast and with participants in a semi-recumbent position, blood samples (~12 ml) were collected (7:00&#x02013;8:00 a.m.) as described elsewhere [<xref rid="pone.0128072.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. A blood portion was collected into Vacutainer tubes containing ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) for plasma separation by centrifugation (1,370g, 4&#x000b0;C, 10 minutes) for the measurement of creatine kinase activity. Samples were stored in several aliquots at -75&#x000b0;C for later analyses. Samples thawed only once before analyzed and assays were performed in duplicate. Another blood portion (2 ml) was immediately placed in EDTA tubes to prevent clotting for the determination of complete blood count within 24h using an automated hematology analyzer (Shenzhen Mindray, BC&#x02014;5500, Shenzhen, China). Blood lactate was measured with a hand-portable analyzer (Accutrend Plus, Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland) as described [<xref rid="pone.0128072.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].

In order to examine the different time point changes between the experimental and control group during the recovery period, in isokinetic performance and exercise-induced muscle damage variables, a two-way (group by time) repeated measures ANOVA with planned contrasts on different time points was used. When a significant interaction was observed, a Bonferroni correction analysis was utilized for pairwise comparisons. To determine if there was a difference between the responses of dominant limb and non-dominant limb, changes in the ratio of non-dominant limb to dominant limb values were evaluated across time.</p><p>Cluster analysis is used to group a set of objects or subjects in such a way that subjects in the same group (also named a cluster) have similar characteristics to each other compared to those in the other groups (or clusters). Cluster analysis with Ward method and squared Euklidean measure was used in order to group the subjects of EG group in two sub groups, low and high performers, based on their external load. Variables that were included in the calculation were total distance, walking, running, high intensity running, sprinting, low acceleration, moderate acceleration, high acceleration, low deceleration, moderate deceleration, high deceleration and total of acceleration and deceleration. Subsequently, a discriminant analysis was performed to identify which variables separated the groups formed by cluster analysis that revealed that players could be categorized in two groups: a) high performers and b) low performers (<xref rid="pone.0128072.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). The pooled within groups correlation between discriminating variables and standardized canonical discriminant functions was calculated (<xref rid="pone.0128072.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). The post-match period (60h) was then subdivided in two separate phases: i) performance deterioration phase: the first 12h during which performance decline reached its nadir and ii) performance recovery: 12h-60h during which performance gradually returned to baseline values. In order to examine the different time-point alterations between groups (formed by cluster analysis, i.e. high and low performers) in conventional and functional ratios at 60&#x000b0;/s and 180&#x000b0;/s during the two phases, a two-way, repeated measures ANOVA was used. Then, a stepwise multiple regression analysis (variables inserted: total distance, high-intensity running, sprinting, moderate and high acceleration/deceleration, maximal oxygen consumption and meters covered in YO-YO IR2 test) was constructed to evaluate the parameters that affected performance deterioration (period from baseline to Day 1 of recovery) and recovery (period from day 2 to day 3). Significance was accepted at p&#x0003c;0.05.

Thigh injuries and especially hamstring strains are the most prevalent ones in football resulting in significant loss of practice and match hours. However, limited data exist regarding temporal changes of KF and KE isokinetic strength performance after a match. Previous investigations used mostly intermittent running protocols on the field or in the laboratory that consist of running at pre-determined maneuvers and intensities but lack random, non-linear runs characterized by rapid, eccentric in nature, acceleration/deceleration motions. These protocols also lack other psychological and environmental factors that affect metabolic and biomechanical variables that predispose athletes to injuries [<xref rid="pone.0128072.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Data on how a football match affects different types of strength (isometric vs. concentric vs. eccentric) at various knee movement velocities (low vs. high) and in respect to limb dominance are lacking [<xref rid="pone.0128072.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0128072.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128072.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128072.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128072.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128072.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0128072.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Furthermore, limited information exists regarding the independent effects of football practice on strength performance responses. We found that a football match induced a prolonged decline of strength performance of muscles involved in knee motions in a limb- and velocity-specific manner and that recovery kinetics of strength performance may be related to match activity profile and players' fitness status.</p><sec id="sec019"><title>Match activity</title><p>Although semi-professional players participated, the experimental match resembled elite football competition since athletes displayed values of match-related physical activity and physiological response (lactate, heart rate) that approximated those reported for elite match-play [<xref rid="pone.0128072.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128072.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Furthermore, the match provoked an increase in muscle damage and inflammatory markers similar to that previously reported in response to official football matches [<xref rid="pone.0128072.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128072.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].

Creatine kinase activity increased ~2-5-fold after the game compared to baseline at 36h. This is considered a physiological post-game response for creatine kinase activity since its reference intervals for football players are exceptionally high probably due to the nature of football training and competition [<xref rid="pone.0128072.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The inflammatory response, as evidenced by the leukocyte count, was short-lived (12h) and in agreement with previous findings [<xref rid="pone.0128072.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128072.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128072.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Interestingly, individuals reported more soreness of KF than KE at all times which is in accordance with the greatest decline of KF eccentric and concentric strength during the post-match period. Although hamstrings' soreness and performance decline has been reported following football-like intermittent-type running and after sport events characterized by strong eccentric component such as basketball and team handball [<xref rid="pone.0128072.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128072.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], such findings were not seen after a football match [<xref rid="pone.0128072.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. This is not surprising since both the magnitude and the time-course of soreness is poorly correlated with fluctuations of muscle function following muscle damaging exercise [<xref rid="pone.0128072.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In fact, soreness peaks after the onset of histologically-assessed muscle damage and strength decline [<xref rid="pone.0128072.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. KF may be more prone to exercise-induced damage due to their intense eccentric involvement during landing in actions such as sprinting, accelerations/decelerations and cutting maneuvers in an attempt to prevent knee's overextension and hip's flexion [<xref rid="pone.0128072.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128072.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128072.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Strength decline, which is considered as a valid marker of muscle damage [<xref rid="pone.0128072.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], demonstrated a marked decline for both knee flexors and extensors during recovery with flexors demonstrating a greater loss than extensors indicating the occurrence of muscle damage for both muscle groups.</p></sec><sec id="sec021"><title>Temporal changes of strength performance</title><p>In this study, strength performance was evaluated by isokinetic testing since it has been shown to be an effective diagnostic mode of KF and KE strength imbalances that predispose football players to knee injuries [<xref rid="pone.0128072.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In fact, normalization of such imbalances or asymmetries between KE and KF led to prevention of subsequent knee re-injuries [<xref rid="pone.0128072.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. All types of strength (isometric, concentric, eccentric) of both KE and KF reached their lowest value 12h after the match and recovered thereafter without, however, returning at baseline 60h after the match. Most previous studies agree that strength reaches its nadir 12&#x02013;24h after a match [<xref rid="pone.0128072.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128072.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0128072.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. However, most studies suggest that strength recovers 36h to 48h after a match [<xref rid="pone.0128072.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128072.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0128072.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In accordance with our results, a recent study [<xref rid="pone.0128072.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] reported more prolonged strength deterioration (72h). Prolonged strength decline may be explained by a decrease in muscle voluntary activation due to soreness-related inhibition [<xref rid="pone.0128072.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. A plausible explanation for discrepancies in the time-frame of strength decline after a football match may be related to the presence or absence of daily practice during the post-match recovery period and the nature of the experimental game (i.e. friendly or competitive). In this study, athletes trained daily after the match and training might have extended the period of strength reduction. The fact that the C demonstrated a performance decline of concentric and eccentric peak torque, especially at high velocity testing, at 60h (after the second and more intense practice), provides further support to this claim, i.e. intense football practice may independently predispose to strength decline of knee extensors and flexors that contract both concentrically and eccentrically during intense cyclic running football activity. Future research should investigate strength performance fluctuations due to practice load during a training microcycle.</p></sec><sec id="sec022"><title>Comparison of strength responses at 60&#x000b0;/s and 180&#x000b0;/s</title><p>Our data suggest that strength deterioration was velocity-specific since KF<sub>ecc</sub>/KE<sub>con,</sub> KF<sub>con</sub>/KE<sub>con</sub>, eccentric and concentric peak torque of both KF and KE were more pronounced at 180&#x000b0;/s as compared to 60&#x000b0;/s. Greig et al. [<xref rid="pone.0128072.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] reported that KF<sub>ecc</sub>/KE<sub>con</sub> is more impaired at fast compared to slow velocities. The decline observed in that study was similar to that seen here (12% at 60&#x000b0;/s, 23% at 180&#x000b0;/s). This data reveals a specificity effect since football consists of a large number of explosive ballistic motions during which knee velocity reaches values of 745&#x02013;860&#x000b0;/s and 860&#x02013;1720&#x000b0;/s during knee flexion and extension, respectively [<xref rid="pone.0128072.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec023"><title>Conventional vs. functional ratio responses</title><p>Concentric peak torque of KF declined at a greater extent than concentric peak torque of KE at 60&#x000b0;/s (3.1%-10.6% for KF vs. 2.1%-9.1% for KE) and 180&#x000b0;/s (5.6%-16.1% for KF vs. 1.8%-8% for KE). Likewise, eccentric strength of KF demonstrated a far more pronounced reduction than eccentric peak torque of KE at 60&#x000b0;/s (6.3%-19% for KF vs. 2%-8.3% for KE) and 180&#x000b0;/s (7.2%-27.7% for KF vs. 1.9%-9.4% for KE). Similar results have been reported following football-like intermittent running [<xref rid="pone.0128072.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] suggesting that KF demonstrate greater strength deficits than KE (also supported by higher soreness values for KF), especially at high contraction velocities, for prolonged periods after or even during a football match [<xref rid="pone.0128072.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. These results also suggest that eccentric strength of KF is more susceptible to deterioration than concentric strength in response to football activity. Compared to concentric contraction, eccentric muscle elongation elicits a higher tension per cross-sectional area of active musculature thereby resulting in greater ultrastructural damage of myofibre [<xref rid="pone.0128072.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Due to the protective role of KF towards prevention of knee hyperextension, these deficits may increase knee's susceptibility to injury, especially in response to fatigue induced by condensed training and competition during in-season. A greater decline of KF strength compared to KE may compromise knee's control and stability and thus increase injury risk during intense training usually scheduled 30&#x02013;80h post-match within an in-season microcycle. Therefore, training and recovery strategies (such as water therapy and cryotherapy) should emphasize the restoration of eccentric strength of KF in order to maintain an optimal KF/KE ratio.</p><p>The fact that KF<sub>con</sub>/KE<sub>con</sub> remained unaltered at 60&#x000b0;/s and demonstrated a decline of smaller magnitude than KF<sub>ecc</sub>/KE<sub>con</sub> at 180&#x000b0;/s also supports the notion that eccentric peak torque of KF is more affected by intense football activity suggesting that the functional ratio may be a better alternative for monitoring football-related fatigue than the conventional ratio. Although there is no previous information on how match activity affects these two ratios, results from studies that utilized intermittent running tests to simulate football activity are in agreement with our findings [<xref rid="pone.0128072.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128072.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. In fact, football-like activity has been to shown to leave concentric peak torque of KF unaffected [<xref rid="pone.0128072.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128072.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. These results may also be attributed to hamstrings' greater proportion of type II myofibre that are characterized by a greater fatigability than type I fibers [<xref rid="pone.0128072.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Hamstrings contract eccentrically during actions such as sprinting, kicking, tackling, changing directions etc. to counterbalance anterior shear forces produced by KE and decelerate thigh and leg movements prior to foot contact [<xref rid="pone.0128072.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] rendering them susceptible to tear thereby reducing their input to stabilize the knee and thus placing more stress on the ACL during states of fatigue. The size of reduction of KF<sub>ecc</sub>/KE<sub>con</sub> in this study was smaller than that observed after an intermittent shuttle test [<xref rid="pone.0128072.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] but similar to that recorded after treadmill running [<xref rid="pone.0128072.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Differences in protocols used and musculoskeletal fitness status of participants may explain such discrepancies. All together, these findings suggest that football players may need to eccentrically train their KF at high velocities such as those obtained during the late-stance phase of sprinting [<xref rid="pone.0128072.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Additional eccentric training of KF during the pre-season has been shown to decrease in-season knee injuries [<xref rid="pone.0128072.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec024"><title>Dominant vs. non-dominant limb responses</title><p>Football players have been suspected for bilateral asymmetries due to a greater unilateral stress of dominant leg's hamstrings when acting to stabilize the knee when players perform football-specific actions such as passing and kicking tackling [<xref rid="pone.0128072.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. However, participants in this study demonstrated a &#x02264;10% strength (isometric and isokinetic) asymmetry between dominant limb and non-dominant limb at low- and high-velocity testing at baseline (prerequisite for participation) and thus any differences observed during the post-match period could be attributed mainly to match or practice load.</p><p>Dominant limb demonstrated not only higher soreness values for both KE and KF but also a greater decline of strength at 0&#x000b0;/s (both KE and KF), 60&#x000b0;/s (concentric peak torque of KE, eccentric peak torque of KF and KF<sub>ecc</sub>/KE<sub>con</sub>) and 180&#x000b0;/s (concentric peak torque of KE and KF, eccentric peak torque of KF, KF<sub>ecc</sub>/KE<sub>con,</sub> KF<sub>con</sub>/KE<sub>con</sub>). Although they had only one post measurement, two previous studies that used protocols simulating football reported similar findings [<xref rid="pone.0128072.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128072.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] while a third one failed to detect statistically meaningful differences between limbs despite a 6% greater decline in dominant limb [<xref rid="pone.0128072.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In fact, male football players tend to injure their dominant limb more [<xref rid="pone.0128072.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Our results indicate that dominant limb is affected more than non-dominant limb, especially KF strength at high velocity, for as long as 60h post-match. These findings may be explained by the fact that players tend to use their dominant limb more as their pivot limb during technical actions, agility running (especially towards the end of a run to decelerate the body), tackling, dribbling, passing and kicking [<xref rid="pone.0128072.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. When these actions include ball handling they require more energy and force production [<xref rid="pone.0128072.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and thus placing asymmetric demands on dominant limb. This notion must be taken into consideration when investigating potential match recovery strategies for affected muscles (such as water therapy, cryotherapy, etc.).</p></sec><sec id="sec025"><title>Factors related to recovery kinetics of strength performance</title><p>Cluster and regression analyses revealed that those who covered the largest distances sprinting and accelerating also demonstrated the greatest decline of functional ratio at 60&#x000b0;/s and of both ratios at 180&#x000b0;/s during the first 12h after the match. Similar results have been obtained during the first 24h after a football match by a very recent and interesting study that used video analysis [<xref rid="pone.0128072.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. These results suggest that the magnitude of muscle performance deterioration during the first 24h after a match may be attributed to the distances covered by sprinting and maximal accelerations during the match. In agreement with our results, performance deterioration after a competitive event was highly correlated with collision, tackle and acceleration number during rugby or Australian football match [<xref rid="pone.0128072.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128072.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. These activities are all characterized by intense eccentric actions that induce considerable muscle damage and soreness. Interestingly, these two studies in Australian football and rugby [<xref rid="pone.0128072.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0128072.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] observed no other relationships between playing actions and recovery kinetics beyond 24h of recovery. In this study we separated recovery into two distinct phases; the first 12h during which maximal performance decline is observed following a downward slope and a later two-day phase during which performance recovers following an upward slope. Slopes of these two phases may be related to different factors. Our analyses revealed that players with a higher Yo-Yo IR2 testing performance tend to recover faster 12h-60h after the match suggesting that football-specific conditioning may be crucial in this aspect. Yo-Yo IR2 can distinguish players of various performance levels and is highly correlated with distance covered with high-speed running during a match [<xref rid="pone.0128072.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. The protective role of training is also illustrated by findings suggesting that eccentric training not only limits muscle damage but also enhances its recovery rate due to increases of satellite cell content and activation [<xref rid="pone.0128072.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Furthermore, an inverse relationship was observed between maximal runs/accelerations and recovery of functional performance at 180&#x000b0;/s during the 12h-60h period suggesting that match activity may not only affect subsequent strength deterioration but also limit its recovery. Furthermore, the degree of familiarization with football activity related eccentric activity, expressed as number of soccer matches performed by players during a season, may provide protection to skeletal muscle from strength attenuation and enhance its recovery following a football game [<xref rid="pone.0128072.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Football players with a smaller number of games per season may be more susceptible to knee flexor and extensor strength losses after a game and a slower recovery rate, a concept that needs further investigation.</p></sec><sec id="sec026"><title>Perspectives</title><p>Injuries of thigh musculature are the most prevalent during football match-play and training and may lead to ACL rupture during powerful ballistic motions with strong eccentric component. This study revealed that the decline of strength performance of flexors and extensors KE peaks 24h after a football match and its magnitude is greater for the flexors than extensors. Strength deterioration may be more pronounced at higher knee velocities and for dominant limb as compared to slower knee velocities and non-dominant limb. Our results also suggest that rate of strength performance deterioration may be affected by the amount of sprints and accelerations a player performs during match-play while the rate of strength recovery is positively related to players' level of football-specific conditioning. Data indicate that eccentric training of hamstrings could be used as a strategy to prevent large deterioration of eccentric peak torque of knee flexors following competition and training. This investigation also showed that the functional ratio may be more beneficial than the conventional ratio for practitioners to monitor strength deficits due to football-related fatigue for injury prevention during in-season. Although high R squared and F values were obtained in our regression analysis and a large number of comparisons have been made, a limited number of subjects were used for the number of predictor variables used in our model [<xref rid="pone.0128072.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Further studies that will recruit a cohort of a larger sample size are needed in order to confirm the results presented by this study. Another potential limitation of this study is that participants were not professional or elite-level players who may demonstrate different recovery potential and undergo a greater football stress during a season. Another limitation is that participants in this study were healthy and with no asymmetries whereas those with musculoskeletal problems are more susceptible to match and practice injuries. Future research needs to address the post-match recovery kinetics of flexors and extensors strength of elite-level players with muscular imbalances and bilateral limb asymmetries.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec027"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0128072.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Includes data of participants' characteristics as well as practice and game physical activity data.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0128072.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0128072.s002"><label>S2 File</label><caption><title>Includes data on muscle damage and strength performance responses.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0128072.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>Authors are grateful to all participants for their contribution and commitment to this study.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0128072.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
