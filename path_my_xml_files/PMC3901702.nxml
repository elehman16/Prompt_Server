The previous studies have demonstrated that in utero exposure to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-<italic>p</italic>-dioxin (TCDD, an environmental toxicant) induces the intrauterine fetal death in many species via the activation of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). In the current study, we compared the effects of 2-(1&#x02032;H-indole-3&#x02032;-carbonyl)-thiazole-4-carboxylic acid methyl ester (ITE) and TCDD on the vascular remodeling of rat placentas. Pregnant rats on gestational day (GD) 15 were randomly assigned into 5 groups, and were exposed to a single dose of 1.6 and 8.0 mg/kg body weight (bw) ITE, 1.6 and 8.0 &#x000b5;g/kg bw TCDD, or an equivalent volume of the vehicle, respectively. The dams were sacrificed on GD20 and the placental tissues were gathered. The intrauterine fetal death was observed only in 8.0 &#x000b5;g/kg bw TCDD-exposed group and no significant difference was seen in either the placental weight or the fetal weight among all these groups. The immunohistochemical and histological analyses revealed that as compared with the vehicle-control, TCDD, but not ITE, suppressed the placental vascular remodeling, including reduced the ratio of the placental labyrinth zone to the basal zone thickness (at least 0.71 fold of control), inhibited the maternal sinusoids dilation and thickened the trophoblastic septa. However, no marked difference was observed in the density of fetal capillaries in the labyrinth zone among these groups, although significant differences were detected in the expression of angiogenic growth factors between ITE and TCDD-exposed groups, especially Angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2), Endoglin, Interferon-&#x003b3; (IFN-&#x003b3;) and placenta growth factor (PIGF). These results suggest ITE and TCDD differentially regulate the vascular remodeling of rat placentas, as well as the expression of angiogenic factors and their receptors, which in turn may alter the blood flow in the late gestation and partially resulted in intrauterine fetal death.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This research was supported in part by Shanghai Natural Science Foundation (No.11ZR1428700) (to KW) and National Natural Science Foundation of China (No.81100429 &#x00026; (No.81270703) (to KW).

Any impaired placental vascular development will lead to adverse effects on both mother and fetus, possibly leading to preeclampsia, abortion and intrauterine growth retardation <xref rid="pone.0086549-Wulff1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0086549-Eskenazi1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. In rats, the rapid placental vascular growth and remodeling occur between gestational day (GD)15 to GD20 as the placenta blood flow increases exponentially in order to nourish the rapid growth of fetus <xref rid="pone.0086549-Reynolds1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0086549-Emond1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Thus, it may provide useful information to study the placental vascular development in such an important phase by comparing the effects of environmental factors.</p><p>It is well documented that placental vasculature develops through two consecutive processes: vasculogenesis and angiogenesis <xref rid="pone.0086549-Ishimura1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0086549-Carmeliet1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. During the vasculogenesis, the endothelial progenitor cells are assembled to form a primitive vascular network. The term angiogenesis represents the process of sprouting and remodeling of new vessels from the pre-existing vascular network into a complex vascular network <xref rid="pone.0086549-Zygmunt1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0086549-Carmeliet1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. The establishment and remodeling of the placental blood vessels are regulated by a broad spectrum of angiogenic-associated factors and their receptors, including of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)/VEGF receptor (VEGFR) system and Angiopoietin (Ang)/Tie2 system and cytokines, etc. In addition, placental vascular development can be stimulated under a hypoxic condition because the activation of HIF-1&#x003b1; not only leads to the adaptation of hypoxia, but also activates the transcription of VEGF/VEGFR system and regulates the expression of VEGF and fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (Flt-1) <xref rid="pone.0086549-Ishimura1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0086549-Ferrara1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0086549-Andraweera1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.</p><p>The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is a ligand-inducible transcriptional regulator which is highly expressed in human placentas and many fetal organs during fetal development <xref rid="pone.0086549-Jiang1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0086549-Lahvis1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Upon binding to its ligands, the AhR translocate into the nucleus and binds to its heterodimer aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT), inducing the expression of downstream genes, such as CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 (encoding cytochromes P450 1A1 and 1B1). It was reported that activated CYP1 enzymes are responsible for both metabolizing and detoxifying numerous environmental contaminants collectively called aryl hydrocarbons (AHs) <xref rid="pone.0086549-Pocar1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0086549-Nebert1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-<italic>p</italic>-dioxin (TCDD) is the most potent toxicant among dioxins and related environmental pollutants. It is released unintentionally in industrial processes, waste combustion, metal smelting, etc. Because of its resistance to metabolic breakdown and accumulation in biologic chain, TCDD can cause many toxic effects on human and animal health, including teratogenicity, immunotoxicity and various metabolic dysfunctions <xref rid="pone.0086549-Pocar1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0086549-Henry1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0086549-IvnitskiSteele1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Among all the adverse events of TCDD, intrauterine fetal death is the most common in mammals as the fetus is much more sensitive to TCDD when compared with the mother <xref rid="pone.0086549-Ishimura1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0086549-Mizutani1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0086549-Ishimura2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Convincing evidence from laboratory animal studies has shown that TCDD affects placental angiogenesis and vascular remodeling during embryo and fetal development by reducing blood flow and circulatory function <xref rid="pone.0086549-Ishimura1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0086549-Ishimura2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0086549-Ishimura3" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Considering the highly conserved structure of AhR, many endogenous AhR ligands have been discovered, including 2-(1&#x02032;H-indole-3&#x02032;-carbonyl)-thiazole-4-carboxylic acid methyl ester (ITE), which was first isolated from porcine lungs <xref rid="pone.0086549-Song1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.

<xref rid="pone.0086549-Quintana1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. However, ITE does not cause adverse effects on fetus like TCDD does <xref rid="pone.0086549-Henry1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p><p>Considering the toxic outcomes of TCDD on both pregnant women and fetus, in the present study, we try to use ITE as a nontoxic, endogenous control to imitate the physiological activation of AhR and compare the potential differences between ITE and TCDD on the vascular remodeling and expression of angiogenic-associated factors in the rat placentas. The results suggest that ITE and TCDD differentially regulate the placental vascular remodeling, as well as the profile of angiogenic factors and their receptors through the activation of AhR.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Reagents</title><p>TCDD (purity: &#x0003e;99.2%) was purchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratory (Andover, MA, USA).

In agreement with these observations, our current study exhibited that the expression of HIF-1&#x003b1; mRNA was elevated with the increasing dose of TCDD. Although high dose ITE also increased HIF-1&#x003b1; mRNA expression, it was probably due to the direct regulation of AhR ligands on the HIF-1&#x003b1; expression <xref rid="pone.0086549-Terzuoli1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>.</p><p>Regarding the VEGF/VEGFR system, VEGFs and their receptors VEGFRs play a critical role in the establishment and remodeling of placental blood vessels. The present results showed that administration of TCDD and ITE differentially elevated the transcription of VEGF-A, VEGF-B and their receptors. This different induction of such angiogenic factors might attribute to the induction of HIF-1&#x003b1; <xref rid="pone.0086549-Yamakawa1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0086549-Pugh1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Moreover, the expression of PIGF mRNA was only significantly up-regulated in both TCDD-exposed groups, which was consistent with the nonredundant roles of PIGF in tissue ischemia, malignancy and several disease conditions <xref rid="pone.0086549-Dewerchin1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>.</p><p>In addition, the expression of Ang/Tie2 system, which plays a pivotal role in vascular remodeling <xref rid="pone.0086549-Ishimura1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0086549-Ishimura3" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0086549-GoldmanWohl1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, was also described in the current study. It was proposed that Ang-1 serves as an agonist ligand, while Ang-2 serves as an antagonist ligand of their common receptor Tie2, which is expressed on endothelial cells <xref rid="pone.0086549-GoldmanWohl1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0086549-Lobov1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. The increased Ang-1 and Tie2 mRNA transcriptions were detected in both ITE- and TCDD-exposed placentas, whereas the expression of Ang-2 mRNA was enhanced only in TCDD-exposed placentas. Therefore, we proposed that the elevated expression of Ang-2 mRNA following exposure to TCDD was due to the ischemia induced by TCDD and might partially contribute to the morphological alterations in the labyrinth zone on GD20. This explanation was also demonstrated by the recent report that the expression of Ang-2 mRNA was induced under the ischemic conditions whereas the expression of Ang-1 and Tie2 mRNA remained unchanged in primary human endothelial cells and rat brain tissues <xref rid="pone.0086549-Yamakawa1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0086549-Pichiule1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Most importantly, in the current study, two anti-angiogenic factors Endoglin and IFN-&#x003b3; were notably elevated only in TCDD-exposed groups compared with both ITE-exposed groups and vehicle-control, which might be a consequence of ischemic conditions by TCDD administration <xref rid="pone.0086549-Gilbert1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref> and interaction with other angiogenic-associated genes expression <xref rid="pone.0086549-Laug1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>.</p><p>In conclusion, in the current study we compared putative endogenous AhR ligand ITE, and the prototypical xenobiotic ligand TCDD in the regulating the placental vascular remodeling. We found that in utero exposure to ITE or TCDD has distinct effects on fetal survival, differentially regulates placenta morphologic changes in the maternal side and the angiogenic-associated factors. Meanwhile, the dose or the exposure time of TCDD administration might not enough to induce the significant alteration in the density of fetal capillaries, placental weight and fetal weight. Thus, we speculated that the increase incidence of fetal death by exposure to TCDD is possibly due to the reduced blood flow and alterations of vascular morphologies in the placental labyrinth zone. Moreover, we also hypothesized that endogenous AhR ligand ITE and the toxic ligand TCDD may modify the transcription of different sets of genes to account for their different toxicity.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0086549-Wulff1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
