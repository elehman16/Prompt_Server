In the 14-day berberine-containing quadruple regimen, 1 esomeprazole tablet, 2 amoxicillin capsules, 1 clarithromycin tablets, and 5 berberine tablets were taken twice a day (Esomeprazole before breakfast and dinner, other drugs after breakfast and dinner) and swallowed whole with 250 mL of water. In the 14-day bismuth-containing quadruple regimen, 1 esomeprazole tablet, 2 amoxicillin capsules, 1 clarithromycin tablet, and 4 tartrate bismuth potassium citrate were taken twice a day (Esomeprazole and bismuth potassium tartrate before breakfast and dinner, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin after breakfast and dinner) and swallowed whole with 250 mL of water. Patients were asked to refrain from consuming alcohol during the entire treatment period and for 48&#x0200a;hours after the last dose, and avoid taking the study drugs with milk, other daily products or antacids. <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> eradication was assessed on the 28th day after the end of treatment with <sup>13</sup>C-UBT (Beijing Richen-Force Science &#x00026; Technology, Beijing, China).</p></sec><sec><label>2.3</label><title>Outcomes</title><p>The primary outcomes of the study were <italic>H pylori</italic> eradication rates, based on negative <sup>13</sup>C-UBT 28th day after the end of eradication treatment (follow-up at the 6th week).

Compliance was defined low when &#x0003c;80% of study medicines were taken. The patients were notified of the common side effects of study medicines, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, skin rash, headache, and dizziness at the time of enrollment.

This study was designed as a noninferiority trial. Given the primary efficacy variables selected, 218 patients were required to complete the trial in each group in order to show noninferiority of experimental drug as compared to active control. Since it is estimated that 25% of patients would be excluded from the per-protocol analysis for not meeting 1 or more major test program, 40% of patients were increased. As a result, 306 patients were randomly assigned to each group in order to ensure the power of test.</p><p>Statistical calculations were performed using SPSS 19.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Continuous variables were expressed as mean and evaluated using Student's <italic>t</italic> test. Categorical variables were evaluated using Chi-square or Fisher's exact test. Noninferiority test was carried out in patients meeting the program. <italic>H pylori</italic> eradication was confirmed by negative <sup>13</sup>C-UBT 4 weeks after the end of therapy. Positive breath test indicated treatment failure and these patients were classified as eradication failed cases. Missing test results were not needed to be estimated in patients meeting the program, while breath test data missed or test performed not at specified time were considered eradication failure when intend-to-treat (ITT) patients were assessed. All the other results were evaluated based on observed-case. The primary outcome assessment was carried out in patients meeting the program.</p><p>The main analysis (comparing noninferiority of 2 regimens) was evaluated through hypothesis testing and derivation of a 2-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) using Student's <italic>t</italic> test. Berberine-containing quadruple therapy was considered noninferior to the bismuth-containing quadruple therapy if the lower limit of the CI was &#x0003e;&#x02212;10%, whereas noninferiority was not supported if the lower limit was &#x02264;&#x02212;10%. If noninferiority of berberine-containing quadruple therapy compared to bismuth-containing quadruple therapy was confirmed in per-protocol (PP) population, then the corresponding CI was obtained in ITT population.

Both bismuth-containing and berberine-containing quadruple therapy can be used as the first-line treatment for <italic>H pylori</italic> eradication in the region.</p><p>It was recommended in the Chinese guideline (updated in 2012) that bismuth-containing quadruple therapy is recommended as both first-line and second-line treatment for <italic>H pylori</italic> infection. Numerous studies have confirmed that the addition of bismuth to triple therapy can significantly improve the eradication rate, due to its direct antibacterial activity and the enhancement eradication of <italic>H pylori</italic> resistant strains.<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup> The population eradication rate with bismuth-containing quadruple therapy is usually associated with the cure rate with resistant strains and the prevalence of resistance. Zhang et al<sup>[<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]</sup> recently conducted a survey of <italic>H pylori</italic> resistance in the Xi&#x02019;an area. They found the antibiotic resistant rates of isolated <italic>H pylori</italic> strains as following: metronidazole 61.3%, amoxicillin 6.5%, tetracycline 4.8%, clarithromycin 33.9% and levofloxacin 25.8%. According to the model suggested by Dore et al,<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup> the eradication rate of bismuth quadruple therapy (containing amoxicillin and clarithromycin) should be approximately 87% in the Xi&#x02019;an area. The present study was conducted in Xi&#x02019;an and the eradication rate of bismuth-containing quadruple therapy in ITT and PP analysis were 90.1% and 91.3%, respectively. This is very close to the estimated eradication rate. However, a randomized, controlled, open-label clinical trial conducted in China from 2009 to 2011 showed that the eradication rate of 10-day bismuth quadruple therapy varied greatly in different cities, which was especially lower in Xi&#x02019;an, as 50.0% and 53.6% in ITT and PP analysis.<sup>[<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]</sup> The differences between the previous and the present studies may be explained with the following 2 facts. First, the bismuth dosage (220&#x0200a;mg, bid) used in the present study was standard dose recommend in the Chinese guideline (updated in 2012), whereas a lower dose of bismuth (110&#x0200a;mg, bid) was used in the previous study. Second, the treatment course was 14 days in this study but was 10 days in the previous study. Previous results showed that 14-day regimen is better than 7-day and 10-day regimen, and the eradication effect of full dosage bismuth-containing quadruple therapy is superior to low-dose regimens.<sup>[<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]</sup></p><p>Berberine, an isoquinoline alkaloid isolated from Coptis chinensis (Huanglian in Chinese), has been studied extensively and is known to have antiprotozoal, antibacterial, and anti-inflammatory properties. Also, berberine could be applied in clinical settings to treat diabetes and dyslipidemia.<sup>[<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]</sup> Some pharmacological studies have demonstrated that berberine can inhibit <italic>H pylori</italic> activity in vivo and in vitro.<sup>[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup> However, the mechanisms are still unclear. One study conducted by Chung JG showed that berberine could inhibit arylamine N-acetyltransferase activity of <italic>H pylori</italic>.<sup>[<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]</sup> In addition, berberine could act as a urease inhibitors, which impairs the colonizing and virulent factor of <italic>H pylori</italic>.<sup>[<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]</sup> The present study indicated berberine could substitute for bismuth in quadruple therapy with satisfactory eradication rates for treatment-naive patients. Accumulated evidence demonstrated that berberine can effectively inhibit and kill <italic>H pylori</italic> in vitro, even in multidrug resistant strains.<sup>[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</sup> And, the present study is the first randomized, controlled trial that provided clinical evidence for berberine in quadruple therapy of <italic>H pylori</italic>.</p><p>In addition, the berberine-containing quadruple therapy is safe and tolerate to patients. Although adverse reactions in the berberine group are slightly higher than that in bismuth group in this study, most of them were mild and there were no significant differences between the 2 groups. The patients could tolerate and complete the 14-d eradication therapy. But when melena is excluded, the adverse events rates were 22.7% (69&#x0200a;/ 304) and 35.7% (110&#x0200a;/ 308) in the bismuth group and the berberine group, respectively, and the difference was statistically significant. But berberine quadruple therapy still has positive application prospect when considering the lower cost. The therapy cost of 14d berberine hydrochlorides tablets (&#x000a5; 11.9) is significantly lower than that of colloidal bismuth tartrate capsules (&#x000a5; 112.0) at least in China, which makes berberine quadruple therapy a cheaper regimen for <italic>H pylori</italic> eradication.</p><p>There are also some limitations in this study. First, this study is a single-center trial and patients are mainly from the northwest China (Shaanxi Province and its surrounding areas), whether the result of this study can be applied to other countries or regions is still questionable due to genetics and regions differences. So, further multi-center clinical studies of large samples in other areas are needed before its popularization and application. Second, the antibiotic susceptibility and resistance rate of <italic>H pylori</italic> are not detected in this study and drug selection is based on empirical medication. Therefore, it could not offer more useful information for antibiotic selection in <italic>H pylori</italic> eradication therapy in local areas.</p><p>In conclusion, our study is a useful exploration for <italic>H pylori</italic> eradication therapy in the local region. Based on the results of the study, both bismuth-containing and berberine-containing quadruple therapy can be used as first-line treatment for <italic>H pylori</italic> eradication in the region and berberine-containing quadruple therapy is an effective alternative in patients who would not take bismuth or in region where bismuth is not available. Whether the berberine-containing quadruple therapy can be applied to other countries or regions deserves further investigation.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations: 95% CI = 95% confidence interval, BMI = body mass index, <italic>H pylori</italic> = <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic>, ITT = intention-to-treat, PP = per-protocol, UBT = urea breath test.</p></fn><fn fn-type="equal"><p>DZ and LK contributed equally to this study.</p></fn><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p>Funding: The study was supported by Promotion Project of Excellent Young Investigators in Xijing Hospital (XJZT12J06).</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>The authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><label>[1]</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Suerbaum</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Michetti</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name></person-group>
