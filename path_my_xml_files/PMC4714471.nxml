Recently, non-randomized trials have shown superiority of a most intuitive anastomosis (Blumgart technique), which involves both a duct-to-mucosa and a full-thickness pancreatic &#x0201c;U&#x0201d; stitch, in effect a mattress stitch, over a standard duct-mucosa technique (Cattell-Warren). The aim of this study is to examine if these findings remain within a randomized setting.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>The PANasta trial is a randomized, double-blinded multi-center study, whose primary aim is to assess whether a Blumgart pancreatic anastomosis (trial intervention) is superior to a Cattell-Warren pancreatic anastomosis (control intervention), in terms of pancreatic fistula rates. Patients with suspected malignancy of the pancreatic head, in whom a pancreato-duodenectomy is recommended, would be recruited from several UK specialist regional centers. The hypothesis to be tested is that a Blumgart anastomosis will reduce fistula rate from 20 to 10 %. Subjects will be stratified by research site, pancreatic consistency and diameter of pancreatic duct; giving a sample size of 253 per group. The primary outcome measure is fistula rate at the pancreatico-jejunostomy. Secondary outcome measures are: entry into adjuvant therapy, mortality, surgical complications, non-surgical complications, hospital stay, cancer-specific quality of life and health economic assessments. Enrolled patients will undergo pancreatic resection and be randomized immediately prior to pancreatic reconstruction. The operation note will only record &#x0201c;anastomosis constructed as per PANasta trial randomization,&#x0201d; thus the other members of the trial team and patient are blinded. An inbuilt internal pilot study will assess the ability to randomize patients, while the construction of an operative manual and review of operative photographs will maintain standardization of techniques.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The PANasta trial will be the first multi-center randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing two types of duct-to-mucosa pancreatic anastomosis with surgical quality assurance.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ukctg.nihr.ac.uk/trialdetails/ISRCTN52263879">ISRCTN52263879</ext-link>.

The &#x0201c;Whipple&#x0201d; procedure, as it became known, was refined and standardized during the 1940s to treat head of pancreas cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Preservation of the pylorus is now accepted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Hence, the current &#x0201c;standard&#x0201d; resection preserves the pylorus with en-bloc resection of the pancreatic head to the right of the portal vein, the extra-hepatic bile duct, the gall bladder, the duodenum and the proximal jejunum. Despite centralization of pancreatic services lowering mortality to below 5 %, morbidity still remains high, often around 50 % for all causes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Failure of the pancreatic anastomosis to heal is a common culprit, with the medical literature quoting a pancreatic leak/fistula rate of between 2 % and in excess of 20 %, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. This wide range of leak/fistula rate was due partly to a lack of a consensus definition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]; however, recently this has been proposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and is beginning to gain support and be quoted in the medical literature. Health economic studies of pancreatic resection from the USA have reported an average length of stay of just over 20 days with an approximate cost of US$1000 per day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Edge et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], showed a strong association between complications, length of hospital stay and cost. Resection without complication on average had a hospital stay of 13 days and cost US$30,000. Stay and cost increases proportionally with complications, such that a minor complication increased stay to 18 days (US$43,000) and a major complication to 32 days (US$90,000). Data to 2005 suggest hospital stay is similar but that cost has increased by 63 % [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>There are a number of techniques of pancreatic remnant reconstruction. Stump closure is a poor option as there are excessive rates of pancreatic fistula, pancreatitis and post-operative exocrine failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Advocates of pancreato-gastrostomy (PG) quote the superior nature of this technique over that of a jejunal loop, though from a poor literature base [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] with meta-analyses showing conflicting results as studies are combined and both standardized and non-standardized definitions of post-operative pancreatic fistulae (POPF) are used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Anastomosis between the pancreatic stump and the jejunum is regarded as the &#x0201c;standard&#x0201d; technique by many pancreatic surgeons. There are two main ways to perform this: invagination of the pancreatic stump into the jejunum (pancrea<italic>to</italic>-jejunostomy) or anastomosis of the pancreatic duct to the jejunal mucosa (pancrea<italic>tico</italic>-jejunostomy), with covering parenchymal sutures. To date there is a lack of well-designed and well-conducted randomized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] and non-randomized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] studies, specifically looking at these techniques, which have sufficient homogeneity to be compared in meta-analyses. Design issues include the use of non-standardized definitions of POPF, a lack of surgical quality assurance, discontinuous time frames, no stratification for pancreatic consistency or diameter of the pancreatic duct, lack of consideration of the surgical learning curve and irregular use of octreotide and pancreatic duct stents across the groups. Leslie Blumgart (Memorial Sloan Kettering, New York City, NY, USA) has devised a most intuitive anastomosis to use in the setting as it involves both duct-to-mucosa stitches and a full-thickness pancreatic &#x0201c;U&#x0201d; stitch, in effect a mattress stitch. This method of placing the pancreatic parenchymal stitches has significant mechanical advantages over standard techniques as it in effect uses the jejunal mucosa as a pledgelet to minimize sheering forces of the stitches (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Schematic of the stages of pancreatic anastomosis construction</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2015_1144_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p>The rationale for this trial is that an improved method of pancreatic anastomosis should reduce POPF, decrease all complications, hospital stay, cost, improve patient-reported outcomes and promote enhanced recovery programs. Moreover, fewer POPF should enable more patients to take advantage of adjuvant therapy with a possible impact on longer-term survival.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Preliminary data</title><p>Since the description of the &#x0201c;Blumgart&#x0201d; anastomosis, initial results show advantages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Moreover, Kleespies et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] compared a standard Cattell-Warren pancreatico-jejunostomy with a Blumgart anastomosis (BA) technique; this reduced pancreatic leak rate from 13 to 4 % (<italic>p</italic> = 0.03) and overall complications from 31 to 15 % (<italic>p</italic> = 0.015) in favoUr of the BA. Although this study was <italic>not</italic> randomized and was single center, it suggests the usefulness of this technique.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Objective</title><p>To compare the effectiveness of the BA pancreatico-jejunostomy construction versus standard treatment, that is the Cattell-Warren anastomosis (CWA), for patients undergoing an elective pancreatico-duodenectomy in terms of rates of pancreatic fistula.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Trial design</title><p>The PANasta trial is a phase III multi-center study with an internal pilot phase with blinding of patients and outcome assessors (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Flow diagram for the PANasta trial</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2015_1144_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec7"><title>Study setting</title><p>Screening and identification of eligible patients will take place at the research site&#x02019;s pancreatic multi-disciplinary team (MDT) meeting; all such sites are supra-regional referral centers for suspected pancreatic malignancy.

Current experience suggests the present rate of leak is 20 % in the standard treatment; a reduction to a 10 % rate in the trial treatment is of clinical importance. A sample size of 208 patients per group would allow a two-sided, two-sample test for binomial proportions to detect a difference in proportions of 10 % (10 % versus 20 %) with power of 80 % and significance level of 0.05. The sample size calculation was based on an O&#x02019;Brien-Fleming two-stage design with binding futility boundaries (SAS PROC SEQDESIGN version 9.3). Non-compliance would occur in the event of unresectable disease at laparotomy (estimated at 15 %) with a further assumed loss to follow-up of 3 %, giving an overall sample size of 253 per group (506 in total).</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Randomization</title><p>Randomization will be undertaken intra-operatively by the surgeon following pancreatic head excision and just prior to pancreatic remnant reconstruction. Hence, the surgeon will only randomize the participant if they feel at complete equipoise and are happy to perform either anastomosis. Randomization will take place via a password-protected web-based tool called the Treatment Allocation Randomization System (TARDIS) developed, maintained and controlled by Liverpool Cancer Trials Unit&#x02019;s IT Department. Patients will be randomized to one of the treatment groups in a 1:1 ratio, with the following stratification factors: (1) research site, (2) pancreatic texture: soft versus normal/hard, and (3) pancreatic duct diameter: 3 mm or &#x0003e;3 mm.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Blinding</title><p>Patients and all team members except for the surgeons will be blinded to the intervention. In order to maintain the blinding for the patient and other site staff, the surgeon will not write which anastomosis has been performed in the surgical notes but rather this will be recorded in the notes as &#x0201c;anastomosis constructed as per PANasta trial randomization.&#x0201d; Serious adverse events (SAEs) will be assessed blinded, and only if deemed necessary would un-blinding occur, i.e., if subjects require life-saving surgery in a district hospital. This, however, would be a rare event. Adverse event (AE) and SAE reporting would follow as soon as is practical. This will not have any impact on the endpoint assessment of the patient.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Data management</title><p>This study is run from the Liverpool Cancer Trials Unit (LCTU). The study CRF is the primary data collection instrument for the study. CRF pages will be available for sites to download from the LCTU portal: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.lctu.org.uk">http://www.lctu.org.uk</ext-link>.</p><p>Individual participant medical information obtained as a result of this study is considered confidential and disclosure to third parties is prohibited. CRFs will be labelled with patient initials and unique trial screening and/or trial number. Intra-operative photographs will be transferred to the LCTU and will be identifiable by unique trial number only. Histological slides will be transferred to the Department of Pathology at the Royal Liverpool University Hospital and will be identifiable by unique trial number only. Blood samples will be transferred to the University of Liverpool GCLP laboratory and will be identifiable by unique trial number only. Consent forms sent to the LCTU as part of the randomization process may contain patient identifiers for the purpose of monitoring as described in the trial risk assessment. Such information will be stored in secure, locked cabinets.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Withdrawals</title><p>If voluntary withdrawal occurs, the patient will be asked to allow continuation of scheduled evaluations, complete an end-of-study evaluation, and be given appropriate care under medical supervision until any AE symptoms resolve or the subject&#x02019;s condition becomes stable. Subjects are free to leave the trial at any point without the need to give reasons for their decisions. If voluntary withdrawal occurs prior to the surgical intervention the patient will not be randomized and no further trial data will be collected on that patient. Patients may wish to withdraw from the trial following the surgical intervention. In such cases no further data should be collected but data up to this time can be included in the trial if anonymized. Patients may also wish to remove all data and/or any samples collected up to the point of withdrawal from the trial analysis. In these cases an End of Study Form along with the reason for withdrawal will be submitted to the LCTU. However, safety data that have been sent to regulatory authorities prior to that point (e.g., Annual Safety Reports to Research Ethics Committee) will not be withdrawn. For patients moving from the area, every effort should be made for the patient to be followed-up at another participating trial center and for this trial center to take over responsibility for the patient or for follow-up via the GP.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Statistical methodology</title><p>Formal interim statistical monitoring of the accumulating data will be performed at regular intervals and reviewed by an Independent Data Monitoring and Safety Committee (ISDMC). In addition, the design allows for an interim analysis with possible early stopping after results for 208 patients are available. At this stage, based on an O&#x02019;Brien-Fleming two-stage design, if the standardized <italic>Z</italic> value lies in the interval (&#x02212;0.698, 0.698) then the trial is stopped for acceptance of the null hypothesis of equal proportions. If the standardized <italic>Z</italic> value is less than &#x02212;2.736 or greater than 2.736 then the trial is stopped accepting one proportion is significantly less than the other. Otherwise the trial continues to the final stage where the test for the standardized <italic>Z</italic> value will have acceptance region for the null hypothesis of (&#x02212;1.934, 1.934). Values outside this region will indicate significantly different proportions. (SAS PROC SEQDESIGN version 9.3 was used for the design.)</p><p>Early stopping rule: the first 6 months of the study will be run as a feasibility/pilot study with a decision, whether to continue or not, made at that point. Two sites will be opened initially for this feasibility/pilot phase. The decision whether to continue or not will be based on the number found to be eligible across the two sites, the number enrolled, the number randomized and the number who took up the randomization. If the number enrolled at 6 months is less than 40 patients, then a decision will be made as to whether to continue the trial or not. If the recruitment rate is acceptable then the other sites will be opened, with an expected number of patients at 12 months of 137 across all sites.</p><p>The trial will be analyzed and reported following the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. All statistical analyses will be on an intention-to-treat basis. Missing data, which are anticipated to mainly affect the quality of life outcome measure, will be handled by considering the robustness of the complete case analysis to sensitivity analyses using different imputation assumptions informed by data collected on reasons for missing data. Continuous variables will be summarized by descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, minimum, median and maximum) and frequency tables will be provided for categorical data. The two-sided, two-sample test for binomial proportions will be used to test for a difference in the probabilities of leak/fistula occurrence between the two arms. Sensitivity analysis will be performed using the continuity-corrected Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test calculated over the recruiting centers. Logistic regression will be used to investigate the variation in these probabilities by center. The secondary endpoints will be analyzed using summary statistics, CMH tests, logistic regression, analysis of variance and multi-variate methods as appropriate. As the two procedures are standard practice, a formal analysis of the primary endpoint only will be undertaken when half the patients have been recruited. Quality of life measurements will be assessed over time and comparisons made between treatment groups using longitudinal analysis with appropriate recognition for informative dropout.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Trial oversight committees</title><sec id="Sec24"><title>Trial Management Group (TMG)</title><p>This comprises the chief investigator, other lead investigators (clinical and non-clinical) and members of the LCTU.

Although centralization of services has driven mortality down, the morbidity, if honestly reported, coupled with sensitive definitions and active, prospective ascertainment of complications, is around 50 %. Although some complications are modest, failure of the pancreatic remnant anastomosis to heal is a major cause for a number of significant and life- threatening complications. In addition, pancreatic anastomotic breakdown causing a POPF is a cause of increased length of stay and cost to the healthcare provider, notwithstanding misery for the patient and the potential of delayed adjuvant chemotherapy, until the fistula is healed.</p><p>There are many options available to surgeons when considering pancreatic anastomosis; however, this has muddied the waters rather than provided clear evidence. Thus, to date there are neither randomized nor non-randomized trials of any of the techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]; whether comparing reconstruction to the stomach versus a jejunal loop, or duct to mucosa versus invagination of jejunal limbs, to adequately construct meta-analyses that inform the medical literature. Those that are published, are littered with homogeneity and bias relating to: non- standardized definition of POPF, non-standardized technique, no attempt at internal quality control, discontinuous time frames, no stratification of soft/hard pancreatic consistency or diameter of pancreatic duct, unfamiliarity with technique at some centers and irregular use of octreotide and pancreatic duct stents.</p><p>The PANasta trial (logo Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) is unique in that it will compare two different methods of pancreatic duct-to-mucosa pancreatico-jejunostomy: Blumgart versus Cattell-Warren anastomoses. Hence, the PANasta trial aims to identify an improved method of pancreatic anastomosis which should reduce POPF, decrease all complications, hospital stay, cost and promote enhanced recovery programs. Moreover, fewer POPF should enable more patients to take advantage of adjuvant therapy.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>PANasta logo</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2015_1144_Fig3_HTML" id="MO3"/></fig></p><p>This study is ambitiously intending to randomize over 500 patients undergoing pancreatic surgery. These numbers are powered to detect a 10 % absolute point reduction in the primary endpoint of POPF &#x02013; which is a relevant difference in surgical trials. Included is a generous dropout rate and account is also taken of patients who are not randomized if unresectable disease is encountered at laparotomy. Furthermore, randomization will be undertaken following resection, just prior to pancreatic anastomosis; therefore, maximising surgeon equipoise. One of the prime reasons that the current medical literature base on pancreatic anastomosis is so poor is the lack of operative standardization not only between individuals but also between centers. In order to diminish this as much as is possible a number of safeguards are built into this study: notably incorporation of a feasibility pilot study within the first 6 months; a pre-pilot consensus meeting; formulation of an operative manual and operative photographs.</p><p>The internal pilot will run in two centers initially and will evaluate in step-wise fashion: (1) the number of patients eligible at each site; (2) the number of patients consented; (3) the number of patients randomized; and finally (4) the number of patients who took up the randomization. This will inform us of the real figures for stopping this trial for futility in recruitment. In addition, an interim analysis will be undertaken once 208 patients have been randomized.</p><p>The pre-pilot consensus meeting was attended by the research site principal investigators (PIs), who agreed that the use of octreotide, pancreatic duct stents and post-operative drains were to be used in <italic>all</italic> patients. The steps of each anastomosis were discussed and agreed. The adherence to these steps will be reviewed at the end of the internal pilot phase and the manual and protocol modified as necessary.</p><p>An operative manual (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>) has been constructed and will be followed during the pilot phase of this study. The investigators will meet following the pilot study, prior to the main study opening to re-evaluate which steps are <italic>mandatory</italic>, <italic>prohibited</italic> or <italic>flexible</italic> to the construction of a safe anastomosis. Furthermore, during both the pilot and full trial operative photographs will be taken of the three key phases of each anastomosis. These will be continuously monitored and any recurrent defects will be reported to the ISDMC. Both the operative manual and operative photographs will form the quality control and standardization of the trial beyond the pilot phase into the full trial.</p><p>In conclusion, the PANasta trial will be the first multi-center randomized controlled trial (RCT) to compare two methods of pancreatico-jejunostomy (Blumgart versus Cattell-Warren) to assess the impact on pancreatic fistula and leak. This study is, therefore, planned to provide important evidence to inform health policy and clinical decision-making relevant to patients undergoing pancreatico-duodenectomy for presumed cancer of the pancreas.</p></sec><sec id="Sec37"><title>Trial status</title><p>Open and recruiting: &#x0201c;green light&#x0201d; 23 April 2015; first patient enrolled 29 April 2015 and first patient randomized 5 May 2015.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec38"><title>Additional file</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="13063_2015_1144_MOESM1_ESM.pdf" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>
