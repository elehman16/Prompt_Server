Aflapin is significantly better as an anti-inflammatory agent compared to the <italic>Boswellia</italic> extracts presently available in the market. A 90-day, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study was conducted to evaluate the comparative efficacy and tolerability of 5-Loxin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> and Aflapin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> in the treatment of osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee (Clinical trial registration number: ISRCTN80793440). Sixty OA subjects were included in the study. The subjects received either 100 mg (n=20) of 5-Loxin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> or 100 mg (n=20) of Aflapin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> or a placebo (n=20) daily for 90 days. Each patient was evaluated for pain and physical functions by using the standard tools (visual analog scale, Lequesne's Functional Index, and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index) at the baseline (day 0), and at days 7, 30, 60 and 90. A battery of biochemical parameters in serum, urine and hematological parameters in citrated whole blood were performed to assess the safety of 5-Loxin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> and Aflapin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> in OA subjects. Fifty seven subjects completed the study. At the end of the study, both 5-Loxin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> and Aflapin conferred clinically and statistically significant improvements in pain scores and physical function scores in OA subjects. Interestingly, significant improvements in pain score and functional ability were recorded as early as 7 days after initiation of the study in the treatment group supplemented with 100 mg Aflapin. Corroborating the improvements in pain scores in treatment groups, our <italic>in vitro</italic> studies provide evidences that Aflapin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> is capable of inhibiting cartilage degrading enzyme MMP-3 and has the potential to regulate the inflammatory response by inhibiting ICAM-1. Aflapin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> and 5-Loxin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> reduce pain and improve physical functions significantly in OA subjects. Aflapin exhibited better efficacy compared to 5-Loxin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>. In comparison with placebo, the safety parameters were almost unchanged in the treatment groups. Hence both 5-Loxin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> and Aflapin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> are safe for human consumption.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Aflapin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup></kwd><kwd>5-Loxin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup></kwd><kwd><italic>Boswellia serrata</italic></kwd><kwd>anti-inflammation</kwd><kwd>osteoarthritis and clinical study.</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Osteoarthritis (OA) is the commonest form of arthritic disease, characterized by articular cartilage degradation with an accompanying peri-articular bone response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>. OA affects nearly 21 million people in the USA, accounting for 25% of visits to primary care physicians. It is estimated that 80% of the population will have radiographic evidence of OA by age 65 years, although only 60% of those will be symptomatic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>. Clinical manifestations of OA of the knee include pain in and around the joint, stiffness of the joint, crepitation on motion and limited joint motion, among others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>. Current recommendations for managing OA focus on relieving pain and stiffness and improving physical function as important goals of therapy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>. Currently available medication regimens for most cases include nonopioid analgesics such as acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) including cyclo-oxygenase II inhibitors. These pharmaceutical agents can reduce both pain and inflammation quite effectively, but long term use of NSAIDs has been found to associate with enhanced risk for gastrointestinal bleeding, hypertension, congestive heart failure and renal insufficiency, among other adverse effects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>. Because of the high incidence of adverse events associated with both nonselective and cyclo-oxygenase II selective NSAID therapy, effective and safer alternative treatments for OA are urgently needed. In recent years, the gum resin extracted from the ancient herb, <italic>Boswellia serrata </italic>has gained lot of attention as a potent anti-inflammatory, anti-arthritic and analgesic agent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>. 3-O-acetyl-11-keto-beta-boswellic acid (AKBA) is the most active component of <italic>Boswellia </italic>extract and has been demonstrated to be a potent inhibitor of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX), a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of leukotrienes from arachidonic acid in the cellular inflammatory cascade <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>. 5-Loxin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> is a novel <italic>B. serrata </italic>extract enriched to 30% AKBA (US Patent publication no.: 2004/0073060A1). Affimatrix gene chip analysis demonstrated that 5-Loxin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> can potently inhibit tumor necrosis factor &#x003b1; (TNF&#x003b1;) induced gene expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), adhesion molecules such as intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1); and mediators of apoptosis in human microvascular endothelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>. Cell based <italic>in vitro </italic>studies suggest that 5-Loxin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> can inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1;, interleukin-1&#x003b2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>. In the carrageenan-induced inflammation model, 5-Loxin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> treatment yielded significant improvement in paw inflammation in albino Wistar rats. 5-Loxin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> also exhibited significant Anti-arhtritic efficacy in FCA induced model of Sprague-Dawley rats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>. Extensive acute and dose dependent subchronic safety studies on rats demonstrated that 5-Loxin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> is safe even at dose levels 2,000 to 3,000 times higher than the human equivalence dose <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>. In addition, 5-Loxin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> was found to be non genotoxic as per the standard AMES bacterial reverse mutation assay, chromosomal aberration test in Chinese hamster cells and mouse peripheral blood micronucleus assay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref> The efficacy and tolerability of 5-Loxin&#x000ae; was assessed in a previous double blind placebo controlled clinical study. The supplementation of 5-Loxin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> was well tolerated and its efficacy against osteoarthritis was found to be statistically significant. The dose dependent efficacy of 5-Loxin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> was assessed against pain, joint stiffness, mobility and a cartilage degrading enzyme MMP-3 in OA subjects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>. Aflapin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> is a novel synergistic composition derived from <italic>Boswellia serrata </italic>gum resin (Indian Patent Application No. 2229/CHE/2008). Interestingly it was found that the oral bioavailability of AKBA from Aflapin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> was better compared to that of 5-Loxin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>. Aflapin exhibited better 5-lipoxygenase inhibitory activity and MMP-3 inhibition. Various <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>In vivo </italic>studies were performed to compare efficacy of Aflapin and 5-Loxin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>. These studies proved Aflapin to be more efficacious compared to 5-Loxin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (to be presented in a separate communication). The broad spectrum safety of Aflapin was tested using a battery of safety studies conducted according to OECD guidelines and it was found to be safe <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>. Although a significant number of clinical study reports support the anti-inflammatory and anti-arthritic properties of <italic>Boswellia </italic>extract <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>, no human clinical studies were done to prove the efficacy and tolerability of Aflapin in osteoarthritis. Hence in the present clinical study we sought to evaluate the comparative efficacy and tolerability of 5-Loxin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> and Aflapin<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>in the treatment of OA of the knee.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Study materials</title><p>BE-30 (5-Loxin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) is a novel <italic>Boswellia serrata</italic> extract standardized to contain at least 30 percent 3-O-Acetyl-11-keto-&#x003b2;-boswellic acid (AKBA) using a selective enrichment process (Indian patent # 205269). The process involves selective enrichment of AKBA while simultaneously suppressing the concentration of triterpene compounds that are less active and those that antagonize the activity of AKBA. Aflapin is a novel synergistic composition containing <italic>B. serrata</italic> extract selectively enriched with AKBA and <italic>B. serrata</italic> non-volatile oil. The non-volatile oil was prepared using a special process (PCT application # PCT/IN2009/000505) involving selective removal of Boswellic acids followed by removing volatiles under high vacuum.

The study protocol was evaluated and approved by the ASRAM Institutional Review Board (IRB). An overview of the clinical study is provided in <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref></bold>. Briefly, 186 subjects out of 283 attending the orthopaedic outpatient department of the ASRAM hospital were selected in the first phase of the screening procedure, based on the signs, symptoms and radiological changes consistent with OA. A total of 60 subjects suffering for more than 3 months with medial tibio-femoral OA were selected using inclusion/exclusion criteria summarized in <bold>Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref></bold>. All subjects signed the IRB approved consent form. Subjects, who were otherwise healthy, were aged 40 years or older and had a diagnosis of OA, fulfilling the American College of Rheumatology classification criteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>. After recruitment, the subjects were randomly distributed into three groups. The demographic data and baseline characteristics are summarized in <bold>Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref></bold>.</p><p>Before study enrollment, subjects were required to be taking an NSAID at prescription strength for at least 30 days or acetaminophen 1,200 to 4,000 mg/day on a regular basis (at least 25 of the preceding 30 days) with a history of therapeutic benefit. Eligibility requires subjects to meet specific flare criteria upon medication washout. At screening, subjects had to demonstrate a visual analog scale (VAS) score between 40 and 70 mm during the most painful knee movement, and Lequesne's Functional Index (LFI) score greater than 7 points after 7-day withdrawal of usual medication.</p><p>A total of 60 selected subjects with symptoms of moderate to mild OA were recruited into the study. Each subject was randomly assigned to a treatment group using a randomization table generated using validated computer software CODE; IDV, Gauting, Germany. The clinical trial pharmacist and statistician ensured that treatment codes remained confidential. The subjects were distributed into three groups: placebo (n=20); 5-Loxin&#x000ae; group, in which subjects received 50 mg encapsulated 5-Loxin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> twice daily (n=20); and Aflapin group, in which subjects received 50 mg encapsulated Aflapin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> twice daily (n=20). Subjects in the placebo group received two capsules of similar color, taste and appearance but filled with suitable exicipient. Each subject completed a questionnaire, providing details regarding demographics, medical history and nutritional status, at the baseline evaluation and during the follow-up evaluations on days 7, 30, 60 and 90. At the baseline evaluation, and at each visit during the 90-day follow up period, all subjects were assessed for pain and physical function using validated pain scores. Various parameters of serum biochemistry, hematology and urine analysis were carried out on each evaluation day. Safety was monitored by clinical and laboratory assessments conducted during the study visits and subject-reported adverse experiences.</p></sec><sec><title>Functional disability and pain score evaluation</title><p>Functional disability was assessed by the investigators at baseline and on each follow-up visit (days 7, 30, 60 and 90). Questionnaire-based assessment of pain, stiffness and physical function were done using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) index <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>, LFI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref> and VAS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>. The WOMAC index produces scores for three subscales: pain, stiffness and physical function. The pain, stiffness and function subscales of the WOMAC were normalized to a scale of 0 to 100 units (NU) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>. The pain subscale was the average of the first five questions of WOMAC and measured using the NU scale from 0 ('no pain') to 100 ('extreme pain') for each question. The stiffness subscale was the average of questions 6 and 7, measured using the NU scale from 0 ('no stiffness') to 100 ('extreme stiffness') for each question. The physical function subscale was the average of questions 8 through 24 of the WOMAC and measured by NU scale from 0 ('no difficulty') to 100 ('extreme difficulty') for each question. Analyses of these end-points were based upon the time-weighted average change from baseline over 90 days.</p></sec><sec><title>Hematological and biochemical evaluations</title><p>For assessment of safety of 5-Loxin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> and Aflapin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, several parameters were evaluated in serum, urine and whole blood of all subjects at each visit of the study duration. Serum biochemical parameters and hematological parameters were measured using an automated analyzer (HumaStar 300) and a hematological counter (Humacount, Human, Wiesbaden, Germany). The urine analysis was carried out using UroColor&#x02122;10 Dip Sticks and Urometer 600 (Standard Diagnostics, Kyonggi-do, Korea) and by sediment analysis using microscopy.</p></sec><sec><title>In vitro studies to identify mechanisms of actions of Aflapin: Effect on expression of ICAM-1 and MMP3</title><p><bold>Adhesion molecule (ICAM-1) expression on endothelial cells:</bold> 20,000 Endothelial cell (HDMEC, Lonza Inc., USA) per well in quadruplicate wells were treated with medium, vehicle, TNF&#x003b1; (20ng/ml), TNF&#x003b1; (20ng/ml) with 5-Loxin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> or Aflapin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (4&#x003bc;g/ml each) for 24 hour then ICAM-1 ELISA was performed on fixed cells of these wells as per our established protocol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>.</p><p><bold>Effect on secretion of MMP3 in TNF&#x003b1; induced human chondrocyte:</bold> Human primary Chondrocytes (HCH) was procured from Promo Cell GmbH (Heidelberg, Germany).

No other pain relieving interventions were allowed during the study period.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Detailed statistical analyses were performed using SAS software to evaluate the efficacy of 5-Loxin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> and Aflapin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> in comparison with the placebo group in terms of improvement in pain and physical function scores at baseline and on days 7, 30, 60 and 90 of treatment and serum MMP-3 levels at baseline and on day 90 of treatment. Pair-wise changes were examined by carrying out a least significant difference test for all possible pairs. The significance of the effects of the treatment groups was compared by using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey's multiple comparison tests. Results with <italic>P&#x0003c;</italic>0.05 are considered statistically significant. This is a three-arm (5-Loxin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Aflapin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> and placebo), randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-centre trial conducted over 90 days. The trial's primary objective was to determine the effects of 5-Loxin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> and Aflapin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> on pain, physical function and joint stiffness. For power calculations, the estimates for variability and assumed mean changes for each treatment group were based on results from previous placebo-controlled studies of celecoxib, etoricoxib and rofecoxib conducted in subjects with OA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>. We believe that an intervention that gives an average improvement of mean change &#x000b1; 1 standard deviation, rather than mean change alone will provide results of greater significance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>. Our trial is designed to have more than 80% power to detect a situation in which either active drug dosage yields an improvement to at least mean change &#x000b1; 0.9 standard deviation, under a conservative assumption, and we tested differences between groups in mean improvement using ANOVA (&#x003b1;=0.05, two-sided).

Therefore, in order to determine whether 5-Loxin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> and Aflapin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> treatments can ameliorate the ICAM-1 expression, we evaluated the ICAM levels on HDMEC. <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref></bold> depicts that 5-Loxin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> and Aflapin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> significantly reduce TNF&#x003b1; induced ICAM-1 expression (p&#x0003c;0.01, student t-test). Interestingly, Aflapin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> shows more capability to reduce ICAM-1 secretion than that of 5-Loxin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>.</p></sec><sec><title>Biochemical evaluations</title><p>As a part of the safety evaluation, laboratory tests were performed to evaluate different biochemical parameters (serum and urine) and hematological parameters. The significance of the differences between baseline and 90 days was tested by using repeated measures ANOVA. The f ratio is considered significant if P&#x0003c;0.05. Although minor changes were observed in some of the parameters, they remained within the normal laboratory range. Statistical analyses of these parameters did not indicate any significant changes. Similarly, no significant changes in hematological and urinary parameters were observed in the active treatment groups when compared to the placebo (data not shown). These findings further demonstrate the safety of 5-Loxin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> and Aflapin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> in humans.</p></sec><sec><title>Adverse Events and Dropouts</title><p>During the course of the 90-day study, no major adverse events were reported.

Aflapin is a novel synergistic composition comprising AKBA enriched <italic>B. serrata </italic>extract and non acidic gum extract of <italic>B. serrata</italic>. In a battery of preclinical studies designed in <italic>in vitro </italic>cellular models and <italic>in vivo </italic>animal models, Aflapin exhibited significantly better anti-inflammatory activities in comparison with 5-Loxin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (Data to be presented in a separate communication). 5-Loxin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> is a <italic>Boswellia serrata </italic>extract standardized to 30% AKBA. Its multidirectional activities related to anti-inflammatory efficacies obtained in appropriate cellular, animal models and in human subjects have established that 5-Loxin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> is a potent dietary supplement for the management of inflammatory diseases such as osteoarthritis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>. In a series of experiments designed in <italic>in vitro</italic> cellular and <italic>in vivo</italic> animal models, Aflapin showed significantly better efficacy in comparison with 5-Loxin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>. In addition, Aflapin exhibited better AKBA bioavailability than 5-Loxin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> in Wistar rat model. Broad spectrum safety of Aflapin was also established in a battery of acute and sub-acute toxicity studies in rat and rabbits. These findings altogether motivated us to evaluate efficacy of Aflapin in comparison with 5-Loxin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> against osteoarthritis in human subjects. In the present 90-day clinical study, we assessed the efficacy and tolerability of Aflapin in comparison with 5-Loxin&#x000ae; in OA subjects. Pain, stiffness of joints, reduced joint movement and physical disability are the major clinical manifestations of OA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>. Our study demonstrates that Aflapin potentially improves pain, joint stiffness and physical function in OA subjects (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref></bold>). In order to check improvements in the treatment groups, we compared the data for all parameters between the baseline and day 90. Paired <italic>t</italic>-test revealed that both treatment groups showed statistically significant improvements in all parameters.</p><p>Compared to the placebo, 5-Loxin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> supplementation for 90 days, significantly reduced VAS, WOMAC-pain, WOMAC-stiffness (<bold>Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref></bold>), which are consistent with our previous observations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>. Whereas, Aflapin supplementation for 90 days, resulted in significant reduction in all pain scores tested in comparison with placebo. These findings suggest that Aflapin has better therapeutic efficacy against OA compared to 5-Loxin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>. We observed that, in comparison with baseline, there were downward trends in VAS score and WOMAC scores in the placebo group. We believe that this might be partly attributable to the placebo effect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref> manifested while administering the questionnaires to placebo subjects and partly due to the consumption of ibuprofen as rescue medication by more subjects in the placebo group during the study. It is noteworthy that 5-Loxin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> possesses significant efficacy in lowering VAS score by 8.09% (<italic>P=</italic>0.022), WOMAC pain score by 8.68% (0.031) and WOMAC function score by 8.35% (<italic>P&#x0003c;</italic>0.015) in OA subjects as early as 7 days after the initiation of treatment. In comparison, Aflapin showed significant reduction in all the pain scores assessed including VAS score by 12.8% (<italic>P=</italic>0.0004), LFI score by 9.17% (<italic>P</italic>=0.003), WOMAC pain score by 11.78% (<italic>P=</italic>0.012), WOMAC stiffness score by 18.48% (<italic>P=</italic>0.012) and WOMAC function score by 10.24% (<italic>P=</italic>0.005) (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref></bold>). These findings therefore indicate that 5-Loxin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> and Aflapin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> confers prompt and significant pain relief, improvement in physical ability and quality of life in OA subjects. However, Aflapin showed better reduction in all the tested pain scores and hence can be considered superior to 5-Loxin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>.</p><p>Pathogenesis of osteoarthritis is a complex process. These include mechano-transduction, the interplay between metalloproteases (MMP3, MMP13), protease inhibitors and cytokines on cartilage degradation and mechanisms of cartilage repair <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>. MMP-3 is over-expressed in OA and cause degeneration of cartilage tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>. Cytokines act via autocrine and endocrine functions to alter cartilage homeostasis. Interleukin-1 (IL-1) and TNF-&#x003b1; are perhaps the best characterized cytokines for cartilage degradation (46,47). They are synthesized by chondrocytes and FLS. These cytokines act in various ways in the pathogenesis of OA such as inhibition of synthesis of type 2 (articular) cartilage and activation of catabolic metalloproteases including MMP-3 which plays a critical role in cartilage degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>. A role of synovitis in OA can't be disregarded either. It is a well established clinical observation that pain and swelling in OA improves for months following intra-articular corticosteroid injection. In addition, histologic studies suggest that localized inflammatory changes characterized by foci of inflammatory cells occur in up to 50% of OA patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>. In this study to find out possible mechanism of actions of Aflapin we carried out <italic>in vitro</italic> studies to evaluate whether Aflapin can inhibit metalloprotease secretion or influence the inflammatory component of osteoarthritis. We observed: (1) Aflapin inhibits TNF&#x003b1; induced MMP-3 secretion in chondrocytes; (2) Aflapin inhibits TNF&#x003b1; induced expression of ICAM-1 in endothelial cells.</p><p>Overall, the foregoing data together demonstrates the better ability of Aflapin compared with 5-Loxin&#x000ae; in terms of reducing the pain, improving physical function, quality of life and joint health. Presumably these improvements might occur through down regulation of cartilage degrading enzymes such as MMP-3 in OA subjects. The present study also demonstrates no major changes in the hematological parameters, serum biochemical parameters and in urine analysis in the treatment groups compared to placebo. In addition, no major adverse effect was reported by the subjects in the treatment groups. Taken together, these observations further demonstrate that 5-Loxin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> and Aflapin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> are potentially safe in the treatment of OA in humans and more specifically Aflapin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> is more efficacious in the management of osteoarthritis than 5-Loxin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, the present study provides the evidence in support of the potential efficacy and tolerability of 5-Loxin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> and Aflapin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> in subjects with OA; 5-Loxin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> and Aflapin significantly improved joint function. Aflapin exhibited better therapeutic efficacy over 5-Loxin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> at 100 mg/day; it reduces pain rapidly, as early as after 1 week of treatment. Furthermore, <italic>in vitro</italic> studies also provide evidences that compared to 5-Loxin, Aflapin is capable of inhibiting cartilage degrading enzyme MMP-3 and has the potential to regulate the inflammatory component in by inhibiting ICAM-1. Most importantly, we have observed that 5-Loxin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> and Aflapin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> are safe for human consumption, even for long term supplementation. 5-Loxin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> and Aflapin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> are promising alternative therapeutic options, that may be used as nutritional supplements for management of OA. </p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>KS contributed to the design of the project and data analysis, and was primarily responsible for writing the manuscript.
