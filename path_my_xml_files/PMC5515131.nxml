</p><p>Nurse-coordinated care (NCC) has shown to be a promising strategy to improve secondary prevention, and is currently recommended in the 2016 European prevention guidelines.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> In line with this recommendation, we found in a recent systematic review that NCC programmes successfully reduce systolic blood pressure and LDL-C.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> However, a clear understanding of how NCC improves achievement of LDL-C targets is still needed. More specifically, no studies have investigated the effect of medication titration in NCC, but it has been hypothesised that medication titration could cause this effect.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
</p><p>To address this gap in knowledge, we investigated the process of medication titration in the treatment of LDL-C in NCC. We used data from the&#x000a0;Randomised Evaluation of Secondary Prevention by Outpatient Nurse Specialists&#x000a0; (RESPONSE) trial (see below). As the lifestyle risk factors were comparable in both groups in the study, the previously reported improvement of the proportion of patients on target for LDL-C in the NCC intervention group could not be explained by lifestyle changes. Additionally, participating nurses in this trial reported that the NCC intervention allowed them more frequent contact with patients and the opportunity to monitor targets more carefully.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> We therefore hypothesised that lipid-lowering medication titration activities occurred more often in the NCC than usual care group, and that this led to better achievement of LDL-C targets.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design and population</title><p>We used data from the RESPONSE trial, a multicentre randomised clinical trial including 754 patients from 11 centres in the Netherlands.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> The study was designed to quantify the impact of a practical, hospital-based nurse-coordinated prevention programme on cardiovascular risk in patients discharged after an acute coronary syndrome (ACS), as compared with usual care alone. Patients aged 18&#x02013;80 years were eligible if they had been diagnosed with ACS within 8 weeks prior to entry into the trial. Patients were excluded if they (1) were unable to visit the nurse-coordinated prevention programme, (2) were not available for follow-up, (3) had a limited life expectancy (<underline>&#x0003c;</underline>2 years), and (4) were diagnosed with heart failure New York Heart Association class III or class IV.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Nurse-coordinated care</title><p>Nurses participating in the NCC programme were registered nurses with at least a 4&#x02009;years bachelor&#x02019;s degree in nursing. They had experience in cardiovascular care and were trained in motivational interviewing. Patients in the NCC group visited the outpatient clinic up to four times during the first 6 months after inclusion, in addition to outpatient clinic visits to their cardiologist (usual care). During each nurse visit, cardiovascular risk factors were assessed, lipid profiles (including LDL-C) were reviewed, medication therapy evaluated and patient compliance with medical treatment and lifestyle recommendations was encouraged. To achieve the target lipid levels, the nurses were also encouraged to titrate medication in collaboration with the treating cardiologist.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Data collection</title><p>Data on clinical and demographic characteristics and CHD risk factors were collected at baseline and at 6 and 12 months after randomisation. Baseline measurements were performed within 8&#x02009;weeks after ACS. Patients were enrolled at an average of 4&#x02009;weeks (SD 2.7) after the ACS. Data on medication use was collected at baseline, 6 months and 12 months follow-up. The data on lipid-lowering medication included number of lipid-lowering medications and, for each medication, the generic name, dosage and frequency. When LDL-C was not on target during the four NCC visits, nurses documented when medication was changed during the NCC visit, and if the treating specialists were consulted and/or patients were referred to treating specialists. All venous blood measurements were taken after a minimum of 8&#x02009;hours of fasting. The target for LDL-C level was&#x000a0;<underline>&#x0003c;</underline>2.5&#x02009;mmol/L, as recommended by the national CVD prevention guideline at that time.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Dyslipidaemia was defined by the following criteria: a history of deviated serum cholesterol values (LDL-C&#x000a0;&#x0003e;4&#x02009;mmol/L, HDL-cholesterol&#x000a0;&#x0003c;1.0&#x02009;mmol/L, triglycerides&#x000a0;&#x0003e;2&#x02009;mmol/L or total cholesterol&#x000a0;&#x0003e;5&#x02009;mmol/L) or treatment for dyslipidaemia.

The 6 months follow-up visit was performed directly after completion of the NCC intervention (ie, after up to four NCC visits), while between 6 and 12 months follow-up, no specific interventions took place in either group. To account for the use of different lipid-lowering agents and dosages, the intensity of each prescription was expressed as a potential average lipid-lowering potency (ALLP, % LDL-C lowering) ranging from 13 to 70.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> ALLP and up-titration or down-titration was measured at 6 and 12 months follow-up.

These titrations took place in a relatively short amount of time (four visits in 6 months after an ACS), but changes made in the first 6 months in lipid-lowering medication were also observed 6 months after completion of the NCC programme, and were reflected in a higher proportion of patients reaching targets for LDL-C. Our study took place in a context of high prescription rates of lipid-lowering medication (96% in both groups at baseline). Despite these high prescription rates, the target for LDL-C (2.5&#x02009;mmol/L) was not reached in a considerable number of patients in both groups (NCC 26% vs usual care 36%). Our study shows that there is considerable room for individual tailoring of lipid-lowering medication therapy, with more both up-titration and down-titration in medication intensity in the NCC group. While lifestyle modification could account for some changes in LDL-C levels, it is unlikely that this can explain the differences in the higher proportion of patients on target in the NCC group, as lifestyle risk factors were comparable through the study up until 12 months follow-up.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Despite a small difference in the total sum of ALLP in both groups at 6 and 12 months, the proportion of individuals on target for LDL-C was markedly higher in the NCC group as compared with the usual care group, reflecting the efficacy of adequate individual medication titration.</p><p>Large proportions of high-risk cardiovascular patients have been shown to discontinue their statin therapy, emphasising the need for healthcare providers to discuss medication use with their patients.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> An integral part of the NCC intervention in our study was interviewing patients about their compliance, asking about barriers concerning adherence and titrating medication (ie, lipid lowering medication) to optimise adherence. Our data showed that down-titrations were made in NCC patients. A possible reason for these down-titrations could be maintaining compliance in case of side effects, as patients on high-intensity statin therapy who experience side effects (such as myopathy) are likely to be less compliant than patients down-titrated to a better tolerated statin intensity.</p><p>According to the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guideline, reducing dosage is an effective approach for enhancing medication adherence.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 15</xref> Nurse-coordinated programmes are associated with modest but positive effects on reducing cholesterol levels according to recent meta-analyses.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 16</xref> However, studies assessing patients&#x02019; medication adherence found improved patient adherence in one study<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> and no differences between NCC and usual care in two other studies.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18 19</xref> Reasons for poor patient adherence are multifactorial. According to the WHO, reasons for medication non-adherence are categorised in five groups: health system, condition, patient, therapy and socioeconomic factors.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> In particular, education and frequent follow-up visits have been shown to be associated with improved adherence,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> and NCC potentially positively influences several of these categories. While we found that targets for LDL-C were more frequently achieved in NCC, more research on the role of NCC to improve medication adherence in general would be valuable.</p><p>Patients allocated to the NCC group reached the target level of LDL-C in a short period of time after discharge. This is likely to be beneficial, as several trials have demonstrated important reductions in major cardiovascular events from lowering cholesterol, especially LDL-C.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> The total sum of ALLP for NCC patients was only slightly higher compared with patients in usual care. This should be seen as clinically relevant as this difference probably led to a larger proportion of patients achieving target level for LDL-C, and the clinical benefits of LDL-C lowering in general are well known.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22 23</xref>
</p><p>Secondary prevention based on nurses&#x02019; collaboration has the potential to improve patient care. While healthcare organisations differ widely across Europe, the ESC prevention guidelines recommend a multidisciplinary team for secondary prevention including physicians and nurses. In some countries, secondary prevention is mainly the task of physicians, while in others, specially educated and trained nurses play a more prominent role.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Physicians and nurses are recommended to work together as a team to provide the most effective multidisciplinary care. NCC has proven to be effective in reducing risk factors,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 9</xref> anxiety and depression,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> and nurses reported to appreciate participating in such multidisciplinary teams.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Therefore, depending on local practice, integrating NCC should be considered in secondary prevention in ACS patients.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>New developments and limitations</title><p>The ESC guideline target for LDL-C changed from 2.5&#x02009;mmol/L to 1.8&#x02009;mmol/L after the completion of inclusion of patients in the RESPONSE trial.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> This change increases the need for new initiatives to reach LDL-C targets in patients with CHD, as it is shown that only a minority of patients reach these stricter targets.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> The specific role of NCC in this process needs further evaluation, especially with the upcoming availability of new pharmacological strategies, such as PCSK9-inhibitors.</p><p>Moreover, it should be noted that our data on medication use were based on self-report by professionals, and not corroborated with additional questionnaires regarding adherence or pill counts. While side effects were discussed with patients during NCC consultation, we did not specifically collect data on such side effects. This might be a valuable part of follow-up research. Furthermore, we did not correct for possible confounders such as lifestyle factors in our analysis. The development of a model with the hypothesised pathways between LDL-C on target and NCC interventions, including all potential confounders of this relation, could potentially help to more fully investigate the association between NCC titration and LDL-C on target. Such causal mediation analysis may be used to investigate the causal role of titration activities relative to other factors associated with NCC in future trials.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25 26</xref>
</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, among patients hospitalised for ACS, NCC resulted in more intensive medication titration compared with usual care alone. The greater proportion of patients on LDL-C target at 6 and 12 months follow-up is likely explained by the more intensive titration of lipid-lowering medication in NCC patients compared with usual care alone. Merely starting the guideline-recommended dose is insufficient to reach the guideline-recommended LDL-C target level. NCC, combined with guideline-based titration recommendations, can improve ACS patient outcomes and should become part of routine daily practice.</p><fig id="F2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Medication intensity (ALLP) changes between baseline and 6 months, by (not) being low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol&#x000a0;(LDL-C) target at baseline for nurse-coordinated care&#x000a0;(NCC) (red dots) and usual care (blue dots) patients.&#x000a0;Dots represent individual patients.
