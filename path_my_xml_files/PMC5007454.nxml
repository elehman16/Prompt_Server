In the presence of personality disorder, the benefits of cognitive&#x02013;behavioural therapy (CBT) for anxiety and depression may not be as marked as those from antidepressant drug treatment.<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Hypochondriacal personality features may also impair the outcome of common mental disorders in the long term.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> The status of health anxiety in current psychiatric classifications has also been a subject of debate, particularly as the diagnosis of hypochondriasis has been removed from DSM-5,<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> and partly replaced by &#x02018;illness anxiety&#x02019;.<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> In ICD-11 health anxiety may or may not be a formal diagnosis in its own right, and the diagnosis of hypochondriasis (together with illness anxiety) could still be retained. Because of this uncertainty we used a two-stage process of recruitment to a planned randomised study of psychological treatment to ensure that we recruited those who not only had hypochondriasis but also significant associated anxiety, so that those who were primarily depressed and hypochondriacal were not included. At the time the trial began there was only limited evidence of the efficacy of psychological treatments for this condition.<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> In addition, because of the strong associations between personality disorder and anxiety, confirmed recently in another study,<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> the assessment of personality status was included in the planned protocol. This was a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of the cost-effectiveness of a modified form of cognitive&#x02013;behavioural therapy for health anxiety (CBT-HA).<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Two hypotheses related to personality were given in the published protocol.<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> First, that CBT-HA would be less effective in patients who had additional personality disorder and second that such comorbid personality disorder would be associated with increased costs over a period of 2 years.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="S1"><title>Method</title><sec id="S2"><title>Study design</title><p id="P12">The Cognitive behaviour therapy for Health Anxiety in Medical Patients (CHAMP) trial was a pragmatic RCT (ISRCTN14565822); full details of the trial are given elsewhere.<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> In brief, the study recruited patients attending medical out-patient clinics and randomised them to either 5&#x02013;10 sessions of CBT-HA (from initially naive but subsequently trained therapists) or to standard care in primary and secondary care clinics. Patients attending cardiology, endocrine, gastroenterology, neurology and respiratory medicine clinics were included from six hospitals in London, Middlesex and North Nottinghamshire. The recruitment process was as follows: patients, with their consent, who were attending clinics completed the short form of the Health Anxiety Inventory (HAI),<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> a self-rated scale of 14 questions with a score range of 0&#x02013;42. Those that scored 20 or more on the scale (a point that has previously been shown to discriminate between those who have persistent worries over health and those who show normal variation<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>) were invited to take part in the trial and an information sheet about the study was given. In addition, the initial assessment involved asking key questions from the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> covering the formal diagnosis of hypochondriasis. The inclusion criteria were patients aged between 16 and 75 years, living in the area covered by the hospital, with sufficient understanding of English to read and complete study questionnaires and interviews, and who had given written consent for interviews, audiotaping of 50% of treatment sessions, and for access to their medical records.<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> All those who satisfied the inclusion criteria and hypochondriasis diagnosis were then offered randomisation to the trial, and, if they agreed, full baseline assessments were completed and written informed consent obtained. This ensured a population who had anxious hypochondriasis primarily. Follow-up data were collected at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months. The study was approved by the North Nottingham Ethics Committee (08/H0403/56) before the start of data collection.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Assessments</title><p id="P13">The primary outcome measure was the HAI score change from baseline after 1 year.<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> Other measures included generalised anxiety and depression using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS-A and HADS-D),<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> health-related quality of life using the short Euroqol measure (EQ-5D),<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> and social functioning using the Social Functioning Questionnaire (SFQ).<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> All measures were recorded at baseline, 6, 12 and 24 months (with the exception of the HAI which was also recorded at 3 months). Assessments were made completely independently by research assistants. Service-use data for the economic evaluation were collected at baseline, 6-, 12- and 24-month follow-up using the Adult Service Use Schedule (AD-SUS), a self-report instrument assessed in interview and designed on the basis of previous economic evaluations in adult mental health populations.<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup></p><p id="P14">Personality assessment was carried out using the quick version of the Personality Assessment Schedule (PAS-Q),<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> which records both the severity and the type of personality disorder using a four-point scale (see online supplement DS1). This contains a series of screening questions for each area of personality dysfunction, and those that score positive are asked further questions. The PAS-Q was administered by a trained research assistant, and the assessment forms include both numerical ratings and written comments on each of the sections. During the course of the study the Working Group for the Reclassification of Personality Disorder in ICD-11 completed its initial work on a new system of classification based on severity criteria (April 2010).<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> The ICD-11 classification at that stage is summarised (<xref ref-type="app" rid="APP1">Appendix</xref>). Subsequently, R.S., P.T. and G.L. reclassified the personality status of the patients in the study to convert them to ICD-11 severity equivalents by examining the PAS-Q data and written comments<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> as well as interviewing assessors if the data were not clear. For 30 of the assessments R.S. and P.T. completed independent assessments and achieved a good level of agreement (kappa (&#x003ba;) = 0.84, 95% CI 0.60&#x02013;1.0). The ICD-11 classification will be published in 2017.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Randomisation and masking</title><p id="P15">Randomisation to the two treatment groups was carried out by an independently operated computerised system (Open-CDMS), with a computer-generated random sequence using block randomisation with varying block sizes of four and six.

The current study was a secondary analysis of the outcomes for different levels of severity of personality disturbance and so no formal sample size calculation was performed. The primary end-point (HAI) was analysed using a mixed model with time, treatment group and time &#x000d7; treatment interaction as fixed effects, baseline measurement as covariate and patient as random effect by personality severity group in order to test for the first hypothesis, that the CBT-HA would be less effective in participants with a personality disorder. The treatment differences between the four ICD-11 personality groups were calculated at each time point (3 months for HAI only), 6 months, 1 year and 2 years). Other secondary end-points were analysed in the same way. All analyses were based on the intention-to-treat principle. At baseline, continuous data were expressed as means and standard deviations and compared using analysis of variance (ANOVA). Categorical data were summarised using number (%) and compared using chi-squared tests.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Economic analysis</title><p id="P17">The planned economic evaluation is described in detail elsewhere.<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Total costs were calculated by combining the service-use data collected from the AD-SUS together with hospital use from electronic records with nationally applicable unit costs.<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> Costs were calculated and analysed in UK pound sterling for the financial year 2008&#x02013;2009 and were discounted in the second year at a rate of 3.5% as recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence.<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> Complete case analysis was used for the economic evaluation.<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> The second hypothesis, that participants with personality disorder would have increased costs was explored through the examination of differences in costs over the 24-month follow-up period between ICD-11 groups.

These results should be seen in the context of the main primary aim of the trial; in the analysis of outcomes independently of personality status CBT-HA was markedly superior to standard care with respect to clinical symptoms of anxiety (and to some extent depression) but no marked changes were found in social function.<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> People with no personality dysfunction did not benefit from CBT-HA and as their social functioning deteriorated with CBT this treatment cannot be regarded as effective in this population. By contrast those with any form of personality abnormality (personality difficulty, mild or moderate personality disorder) did benefit from CBT-HA and their improvement was maintained over 2 years except in those with moderate or severe personality disorder. Such a finding has not been reported before and as it contradicted our main hypothesis (with the possible exception of worse outcome in more severe personality disorder) other explanations need to be considered before it can be accepted as valid.</p><p id="P23">In the report from the original trial<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> the costs were equivalent in both treatment groups and no clear saving was made with CBT-HA. A large part of the costs was taken up with the care of patients with severe medical illness and this may have disguised any savings made by CBT-HA. Nonetheless, the costs were less, but not significantly so, in all groups receiving CBT-HA compared with standard care, with the exception of those with moderate and severe personality disorder who cost more in the CBT-HA group (mean &#x000a3;1166) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>). This suggests the possibility that for those who have moderate or severe personality disorder there is a greater cost with CBT-HA, for reasons that are not completely clear but seem to be independent of medical status, and, as suggested in a previous paper,<sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> may be related to poorer social function.</p><p id="P24">A qualifying comment is necessary here, as in the trial a large proportion of those screened did not agree to take part in the trial.<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> It could be argued that the 444 patients seen were not therefore representative of the total population.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>ICD-11 classification of personality disorder</title><p id="P25">It is worth emphasising that this is the first study to report on the effect of personality status using the new ICD-11 coding and so there are no other studies with which this one can be compared. The small number of patients with no personality dysfunction (<italic>n</italic> = 63) may appear surprising but there are other data suggesting that when personality difficulty is taken into account this subsyndromal group accounts for a large proportion of the total.<sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> Patients with health anxiety commonly have symptoms for many years before they present for treatment<sup><xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> and people with chronic anxiety conditions have a high prevalence of personality disorder<sup><xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> and so the overall prevalence of personality disorder of 42% in this sample is in keeping with other figures. It is also important to stress that the diagnosis of core personality disorder is very little different in ICD-11 from ICD-10, but the great flexibility in diagnosis across the lifespan tends to increase prevalence.<sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> Only one other study has examined the effect of personality status on the outcome of health anxiety and hypochondriasis and this is not directly comparable with our data. This was a follow-up of an RCT of paroxetine, placebo, CBT and those who dropped out. In total, 60% were followed up successfully and those who had less harm avoidance and were more cooperative had a better outcome.<sup><xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> No analysis by treatment group was made.</p><p id="P26">It also could be argued in our study that a proportion of the population may have been misdiagnosed with health anxiety and this could be explained by the cut-off of 20 points on the HAI as being too low. This score equates to around 62 on the long version of the HAI, and a score of 67 on the long HAI has been found to be a good cut-off point for discriminating between severe and less severe health anxiety.<sup><xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup> But as all patients satisfied the criteria for hypochondriasis it is unlikely the level of health anxiety was too low. The requirement for high scores on health anxiety and the diagnosis of hypochondriasis would only exclude patients with a primary depression component to their symptoms. Third, it could be argued that the patients with no personality dysfunction had appropriate health anxiety because of incipient and concurrent significant medical illness but this view is not supported by the figures as the costs were lower in those with no personality dysfunction compared with those with personality difficulty and personality disorder, although none of these differences was statistically significant.</p><p id="P27">It is also fair to add that the ICD-11 classification of personality disorder is not yet approved by the World Health Organization and more is currently being done to confirm the cut-off points for the levels of personality disturbance.<sup><xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup> The fundamental structure of the reclassification is nonetheless very likely to be approved. The version of the ICD-11 classification used in the study<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> shows some slight differences to the current version, but not to any substantive degree. It is also worth pointing out that if the analysis of this study had been carried out using the old ICD-10 diagnostic system of &#x02018;personality disorder&#x02019; <italic>v.</italic> &#x02018;no personality disorder&#x02019;, it is unlikely that these important differences would have been found, as the markedly positive value of CBT-HA in mild personality disorder and personality difficulty would have been split between the groups.</p><p id="P28">There are also other suggestions that personality status may improve during the course of psychological treatment for health anxiety, and although one needs to be aware of the well-established evidence that standard personality measures tend to improve as mood improves<sup><xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup> there are some reasons to think that the change is more substantial.<sup><xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Implications for treatment</title><p id="P29">Taken together, but subject to further replication studies, it is reasonable to suggest that in the absence of personality dysfunction CBT-HA is an inappropriate treatment for health anxiety. It also implies that an assessment of personality status is necessary in the evaluation of people with suspected pathological health anxiety, as those without any personality disturbance may be much more appropriately treated, as at present, with reassurance and support rather than formal psychological intervention. The findings also give some clinical credence to the notion of a subsyndromal form of personality dysfunction in the form of personality difficulty, as the differences in outcome between this group and those with no personality dysfunction were so different.</p><p id="P30">In contrast with studies in depression and anxiety,<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> we found little evidence that personality disorder had an impact on service use and cost. The results in terms of costs present a mixed picture, one which reflects those of the main study. Clear conclusions regarding differences in cost are difficult to make in this group because, irrespective of health anxiety and personality status, study participants often had substantial physical health problems that result in substantial levels of service use and therefore high costs. The relative influence of personality on service-use behaviour may therefore be limited. Previously reported evidence of greater service use at all levels of services in patients with personality disorder, especially at levels of greater severity,<sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> is slightly at variance with our findings, which showed lower costs in more severe personality disorder, again illustrating the likely impact of comorbid medical conditions on total cost.</p><p id="P31">Clinical psychiatry has not yet embraced the importance of twin assessments of mental state and personality status when deciding on treatment but this study, and others across a wide range of conditions<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup> suggest that better judgements can be made when personality status is given as much importance as mental state in clinical practice.</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Declaration of interest</bold></p><p>P.T. and M.C. are members of the World Health Organization ICD-11 work group for the revision of the classification of personality disorder.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding</bold></p><p>This research was funded by the <funding-source>National Coordinating Centre for Health Technology Assessment (NCCHTA) programme</funding-source> (project number 07/01/26) and the <funding-source>National Institute for Health Research: Imperial Biomedical Research Centre</funding-source>.
