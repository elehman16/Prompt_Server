Responses were quantified by recording facial movements identified on 3D/4D ultrasound. One hundred and six normal pregnancies between 14 and 39 weeks of gestation were randomized to 3D/4D ultrasound with: (a) ABM with standard headphones (flute monody at 98.6&#x02009;dB); (b) IVM with a specially designed device emitting the same monody at 53.7&#x02009;dB; or (c) intravaginal vibration (IVV; 125&#x02009;Hz) at 68&#x02009;dB with the same device. Facial movements were quantified at baseline, during stimulation, and for 5 minutes after stimulation was discontinued. In fetuses at a gestational age of &#x0003e;16 weeks, IVM-elicited mouthing (MT) and tongue expulsion (TE) in 86.7% and 46.6% of fetuses, respectively, with significant differences when compared with ABM and IVV (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.002 and <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.004, respectively). There were no changes from baseline in ABM and IVV. TE occurred &#x02265;5 times in 5 minutes in 13.3% with IVM. IVM was related with higher occurrence of MT (odds ratio&#x02009;=&#x02009;10.980; 95% confidence interval&#x02009;=&#x02009;3.105&#x02013;47.546) and TE (odds ratio&#x02009;=&#x02009;10.943; 95% confidence interval&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.568&#x02013;77.037). The frequency of TE with IVM increased significantly with gestational age (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.024). Fetuses at 16&#x02013;39 weeks of gestation respond to intravaginally emitted music with repetitive MT and TE movements not observed with ABM or IVV. Our findings suggest that neural pathways participating in the auditory&#x02013;motor system are developed as early as gestational week 16. These findings might contribute to diagnostic methods for prenatal hearing screening, and research into fetal neurological stimulation.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Ultrasound</kwd><kwd>fetal movements</kwd><kwd>hearing</kwd><kwd>music</kwd><kwd>prenatal diagnosis</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1742271X15609367"><title>Introduction</title><p>The behavior of the fetus and its response to stimuli as a measure of its well-being and normal neural development is of great interest and has been the object of previous studies.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-1742271X15609367" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bibr2-1742271X15609367" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> In this context, the advent of 3D/4D ultrasound has been a major breakthrough in the field: the fetus can be observed in real time, and very small-scale movements can be identified.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-1742271X15609367" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="bibr4-1742271X15609367" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr5-1742271X15609367" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr6-1742271X15609367" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr7-1742271X15609367" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup></p><p>Variations in fetal heart rate (FHR) or nonspecific movements on ultrasound have led to reports that the fetus can respond to sounds perceived through the amniotic fluid from at least weeks 19&#x02013;20 of gestation.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-1742271X15609367" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="bibr9-1742271X15609367" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Nevertheless, hearing should be theoretically possible from week 16, when the auditory structures are formed.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-1742271X15609367" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="bibr11-1742271X15609367" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> We also know that as it matures, the fetus is increasingly able to discriminate frequencies between 100 and 3000&#x000a0;Hz, starting with the lowest frequencies.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-1742271X15609367" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="bibr12-1742271X15609367" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="bibr13-1742271X15609367" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> It is widely agreed that the fetus can hear external stimuli through the mother&#x02019;s abdomen,<sup><xref rid="bibr14-1742271X15609367" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> but after crossing the maternal abdominal tissues and amniotic fluid, the quality and intensity of the stimulus have diminished substantially by the time it reaches the fetal ear.<sup><xref rid="bibr15-1742271X15609367" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="bibr16-1742271X15609367" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Highly intense external sounds (higher than 100&#x02009;dB) are reduced to levels typical of human conversation (&#x0223c;40&#x02009;dB) in the fetal ear, although this varies according to the frequency of the vibroacoustic stimuli used;<sup><xref rid="bibr8-1742271X15609367" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="bibr17-1742271X15609367" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="bibr18-1742271X15609367" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> frequencies higher than 500&#x000a0;Hz can be attenuated by up to 50&#x02009;dB.<sup><xref rid="bibr17-1742271X15609367" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> It is also estimated that a maternal voice at 60&#x02009;dB reaches the fetus at &#x0223c;24&#x000a0;dB<sup><xref rid="bibr18-1742271X15609367" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> (distortions aside), which is equivalent to a quiet conversation.

Both emitters were placed appropriately in all participants, regardless of the device finally used for the stimulus. Headphones were placed on the sides of the lower abdomen in all cases, and the intravaginal emitter was also always in the same position, so the ultrasound probe could be used freely to obtain good-quality images of the fetus head. The mother was isolated from the environment with relaxing music emitted through headphones.

A previous pilot study had been initially conducted that suggested oral movements as possible candidate variables. A musical stimulus was chosen, consisting of a flute monody, which exposed the fetus to fundamental frequencies and harmonics within the Western tonal system; this was compared with the noise generated by a vibration with a principal frequency component at 125&#x000a0;Hz. Our results show that the musical stimulus was significantly associated with a fetal response in the form of fetal mouth and tongue movements (Video 1&#x02014;available with the online version of this article at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ult.sagepub.com">http://ult.sagepub.com</ext-link>) that was not observed during stimulation with vibration at a frequency considered to be within the fetus&#x02019; preferential auditory range, according to the literature.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-1742271X15609367" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="bibr15-1742271X15609367" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="bibr17-1742271X15609367" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> The extensive TE observed with IVM did not occur in the 5-minute baseline recording.

However, our recording of spontaneous movements was much shorter, intended to serve as a control to observations made during vibroacoustic stimulation, and previously observed percentages of occurrence might have been achieved with longer baseline explorations. In view of those reports, such a high number of TE in such a short period during stimulation in our study (&#x0003e;4 TE in 5 minutes with IVM in 14.6%, i.e., 4/55 fetuses aged 24&#x02013;39 weeks) is therefore remarkable. This high frequency of TE did not appear at baseline in any case, and disappeared or diminished when stimulation ended, thus appearing to indicate its association with music. It is also notable that MT movements, especially TE, were uncommon among fetuses exposed to ABM in the conditions described. Although IVM, unlike the vibratory stimulus, was significantly associated with TE, fetuses with ABM showed no such response with the same melody. This suggests that the intensity of the ABM may have been too low for the fetal ear, or that the distortion with this route is too high to elicit a response. We used standard headphones in our study, and the loss of intensity described in the literature (30&#x02013;50&#x02009;dB) was taken into account when designing the methodology, in an attempt to ensure that IVM and ABM were as similar as possible, while avoiding harm to the fetus at all times. FHR and MCA-PI indicate that the fetus was not startled by any of the stimuli, although the IVM caused a slight, but not significant increase in FHR. As regards potential losses in sound intensity described in the literature, the ABM delivered in this study was more intense between 0.4 and 3&#x02009;kHz; it has been reported that frequencies&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.5&#x000a0;kHz suffer losses of up to 50&#x02009;dB before they reach the fetus.<sup><xref rid="bibr17-1742271X15609367" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> However, the IVM was emitted at an intensity of only &#x0223c;30&#x02009;dB between 0.1 and 2&#x02009;kHz, and at human conversation levels between 2.5 and 4&#x02009;kHz, which apparently did not prevent the fetus from responding to it.</p><p>Our results also suggest that the fetus can hear musical stimuli from an early age. However, studies based on transabdominal stimulation have determined that a younger fetus would perceive frequencies between 0.25 and 0.5&#x02009;kHz, while responses to frequencies over 1000&#x000a0;Hz have been described only in fetuses older than 30 weeks.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-1742271X15609367" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> In this respect, it should be remembered that the intravaginal vibroacoustic stimulus at 125&#x02009;Hz did not elicit any response. It may be that a noise at such low frequency is masked by surrounding sounds, which have been reported to be between 200 and 500&#x02009;Hz with an intensity of 65&#x02009;dB at times.<sup><xref rid="bibr25-1742271X15609367" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="bibr26-1742271X15609367" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> Moreover, these sounds may not elicit a reaction in fetuses that have become habituated to them. In any case, determining a distinction between a sustained frequency and a sequence of tones, as in the case of a melody, is an area to be explored in future studies.</p><p>At present, our data appear to suggest two interpretations: that intravaginal application, with fewer obstacles, could be more effective in transmitting music to the fetus, and that the fetus might perceive these higher frequencies at an earlier age than reported to date. In this regard, we observed a response to IVM in fetuses of all ages from as early as week 16. Older fetuses responded more, as expected from the literature,<sup><xref rid="bibr4-1742271X15609367" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bibr8-1742271X15609367" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="bibr22-1742271X15609367" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> since during neural development, initially simple circuits are formed that grow in complexity and definition during pregnancy and the first few months of life.

Thus, our results suggest possibly earlier functioning, although the intensity or quality of the perception remains unknown.</p><p>With respect to neural substrates, various studies in the literature suggest that these MT and TE movements, apparently induced by a musical stimulus, could be related to preparation for vocalization.
