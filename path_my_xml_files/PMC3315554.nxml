With effective HAART HIV-infected patients have a life expectancy approaching that of the general population <xref rid="pone.0032445-Lohse1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, but are faced with life-long treatment. Understanding the long-term consequences, including bone and renal effects, of HIV-infection and anti-retroviral exposure is therefore of increasing importance.</p><p>At the initiation of this study fixed-dose combinations of tenofovir (TDF)/emtricitabine (FTC) or abacavir (ABC)/lamivudine (3TC) were recommended for initial treatment of HIV infection <xref rid="pone.0032445-Society1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0032445-Hammer1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>; TDF/FTC was later recommended over ABC/3TC in some guidelines <xref rid="pone.0032445-Thompson1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p><p>Previous studies have indicated an increased prevalence of osteopenia and osteoporosis <xref rid="pone.0032445-Brown1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, as well as increased rates of fractures <xref rid="pone.0032445-Young1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, among HIV-infected individuals compared to HIV-uninfected controls, but the relative contribution to this of HIV-infection, anti-retroviral therapy exposure, and traditional risk factors is still not completely resolved. Results from several randomized clinical trials among anti-retroviral na&#x000ef;ve patients have shown that initiation of HAART is associated with a decrease in bone mineral density (BMD) of 2&#x00025;&#x02013;6&#x00025; at both the hip and spine that occurs within the first year of treatment with stabilization thereafter <xref rid="pone.0032445-Gallant1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0032445-McComsey1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Of these, two trials directly compared TDF/FTC with ABC/3TC and both found greater decreases in BMD with TDF/FTC-based treatment than with ABC/3TC-based treatment <xref rid="pone.0032445-Stellbrink1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0032445-McComsey1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. To date, only one trial has reported on BMD among virologically suppressed HIV-infected patients switching to TDF/FTC or ABC/3TC-based treatment. In this study, patients randomized to TDF/FTC experienced decreases in BMD compared with ABC/3TC as measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) <xref rid="pone.0032445-Martin1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.</p><p>Case reports of renal dysfunction associated with TDF therapy <xref rid="pone.0032445-Karras1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0032445-Peyriere1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> raised concerns of a nephrotoxic effect with this compound, but the incidence of adverse renal effects were low in initial randomized trials and comparable to thymidine analogues <xref rid="pone.0032445-Gallant1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0032445-Gallant2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. In a recent meta-analytic review of prospective studies comparing TDF-containing with non-TDF containing HAART-regimes a small but statistical significant loss of renal function was associated with TDF use <xref rid="pone.0032445-Cooper1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Included herein are 3 studies comparing TDF with ABC with mixed results on the renal endpoints <xref rid="pone.0032445-Smith1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0032445-Moyle1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. In addition, there was no difference in estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) between patients randomized to ABC- or TDF-based therapy in the STEAL <xref rid="pone.0032445-Martin1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> or ASSERT-study <xref rid="pone.0032445-Post1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, but increases in markers of proximal tubule dysfunction were observed in the TDF-arm of the latter. Some of the discrepancy is likely related to differences in selection criteria for study participants with regard to renal function.</p><p>The Efficacy and Safety of Switching from Zidovudine to Tenofovir or Abacavir in HIV-infected Patients (SWAP) study was a randomized trial comparing switching from zidovudine (AZT)/3TC to ABC/3TC or TDF/FTC. We have previously published a report on cardiovascular biomarkers from this trial <xref rid="pone.0032445-Rasmussen1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> and here provide the main results from the trial. The aims of this study were to compare the effects of abacavir and tenofovir on renal function and bone mass density, including exploratory analyses of several biomarkers of bone turnover and renal dysfunction.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0032445.s001">Checklist S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0032445.s002">Protocol S1</xref>.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Study participants</title><p>The SWAP study was an open-label, parallel-group, randomized clinical trial assessing the safety and efficacy of switching from AZT to ABC- or TDF-based therapy. The study design and patient group have been described previously <xref rid="pone.0032445-Rasmussen1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. In brief, eligible patients had documented HIV-infection and, for at least 3 months, had been treated with HAART comprising AZT and had undetectable plasma HIV-RNA. The pre-specified primary endpoints were renal function assessed by cystatin C (cysC), creatinine clearance (CrCl) and markers of tubule function; bone mass density and bone metabolism assessed by DXA and bone turnover markers; lipodystrophy and body composition assessed by DXA and patient questionnaire; and insulin sensitivity. A sample size of 90 participants was estimated as being required to detect differences in the renal tubular function at a 5&#x00025; significance level based on existing limited knowledge on the frequency of impaired tubular function with tenofovir and abacavir based therapy. Patients who had previously used ABC or TDF, had diabetes mellitus, untreated hypertension, renal disease, osteoporosis or who were positive for the HLAB5701 allele upon screening were excluded. Informed written consent was obtained before enrolment. At baseline, patients were stratified after use of protease inhibitors and randomized 1&#x02236;1 to switch from AZT to ABC 600 mg or TDF 300 mg daily using sequentially numbered envelopes generated by the Aarhus University Hospital Pharmacy. The treating physician assigned patients to intervention. If lamivudine (3TC) or emtricitabine (FTC) was given as part of HAART at inclusion, patients were randomized to a fixed-dose treatment with ABC/3TC 600/300 mg or TDF/FTC 300/200 mg daily. The study took place at the Department of Infectious Diseases, Aarhus University Hospital, Skejby, Denmark. Patients were followed up at 4, 8, 12, 24, and 48 weeks after randomization. A pre-planned follow up at 96 weeks was not performed because the study was discontinued in November 2009 before reaching the intended number of study participants. For this reason, and lack of funding, final analyses were restricted to bone, renal, and cardiovascular investigations. No interim analyses were planned and none was performed before recruitment was stopped. The study was approved by the Regional Research Ethics Committee, Central Denmark Region (Journal number: M-20070189; Eudract. number: 2007-004372-39) and conducted in accordance with <italic>Good Clinical Practice</italic>. Anthropometric information and data on age, sex, smoking habits, blood pressure, CD4&#x0002b; cell counts, viral load, and duration of HIV-infection and HAART exposure were retrieved from the study database or patient records.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>BMD and biomarkers of bone turnover</title><p>DXA scans (DXA machine Hologic Discovery A (S/N 82962)) of the lumbar spine and hip were performed at baseline, week 24 and 48 at The Department of Endocrinology and Internal Medicine, Aarhus University Hospital, Denmark.

Plasma alkaline phosphatase levels were measured by a micro slide assay (Vitros FS 5.1, Ortho-clinical Diagnostics, reference range 35&#x02013;105 U/L) at baseline and week 4, 12, 24, and 48. Plasma levels of type I collagen cross-linked C-telopeptide (CTx), a biomarker of bone resorption <xref rid="pone.0032445-Szulc1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0032445-Leeming1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, and osteoprotegerin (OPG) that is competitive inhibitor of osteoclast activation and differentiation <xref rid="pone.0032445-Leeming1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0032445-Wagner1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, were measured at baseline and week 4, 12, and 48.

Baseline levels of 25-OH D2/D3 vitamin D in serum were determined using a mass spectrometry assay (reference range 50&#x02013;160 nmol/L). Previous plasma measurements of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and high sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) <xref rid="pone.0032445-Rasmussen1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> were used to assess concurrent inflammation at baseline. All biomarkers were batch-tested.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Markers of renal dysfunction</title><p>Twenty-four hour urine collection was done at baseline and week 12, 24, and 48, but was incomplete or omitted in several patients at various time points. Instead, we measured plasma creatinine and phosphate levels at baseline and week 4, 8, 12, 24, and 48 (Vitros FS 5.1 Ortho-clinical Diagnostics) and used the Cockcroft-Gault formula to estimate creatinine clearance (eCrCl). Plasma cysC was measured at baseline and week 48. In addition, we determined urinary levels of creatinine, albumin, cysC, and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) among patients with urine samples from at least 2 time points and used the ratios of albumin, cysC, and NGAL levels relative to urine creatinine concentration to identify signs of renal dysfunction. The change in ratio from baseline to the second measurement was compared across study arms regardless of which time the latter was performed. Plasma and urinary cysC was determined by a particle enhanced nephelometric assay using the N Latex cysC assay on the Behring Nephelometer II (Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics Products GmbH, Marburg, Germany) as described previously <xref rid="pone.0032445-Erlandsen1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>; reference level for plasma cysC is 0.51&#x02013;1.02 mg/L <xref rid="pone.0032445-Randers1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Urinary NGAL concentration was determined using a commercial ELISA assay (Bioporto).

Percentage changes from baseline to week 24 and 48 in total hip and lumbar spine BMD were computed and compared within and between study arms using one- and two-sample t-tests, respectively. The changes from baseline to the various time points in levels of bone and renal biomarkers were compared between study arms using two-sample t-test or Wilcoxon rank sum test, as appropriate. Data distribution was assessed through visual inspection of frequency histograms and normal probability plots; logarithmic transformation was explored on skewed data to allow parametric hypothesis testing whenever possible. Linear regression was used to explore whether changes in bone turnover biomarkers at early time points (baseline to week 4 and 12, respectively) predicted subsequent reductions in BMD at week 48. Statistical analyses were per-protocol as pre-specified in the study protocol. <italic>P</italic>-values&#x0003c;0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Because of uncertainty about ABC as an appropriate first-line treatment option, patient inclusion was suspended in January 2009 and finally terminated in August 2009. By this time 40 patients had been enrolled (20 in each arm). Of these, 35 completed 48 weeks of therapy and follow-up (20 in the TDF/FTC arm and 15 in the ABC/3TC arm). The flow of patient inclusion and follow-up is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0032445-g001">Fig. 1</xref>. Two patients in the ABC/3TC arm were excluded shortly after randomization and contribute only to baseline data. One patient was excluded because of an allergic skin reaction upon starting ABC therapy (the patient was tested negative for the HLAB5701 allele), and one patient was excluded because of alcohol abuse and poor adherence to study drugs. Three patients in the ABC/3TC arm were excluded at week 12 for the following reasons: initiated treatment for hepatitis C, intention of pregnancy, and a history of diabetes mellitus, respectively. The latter patient had a history of diabetes prior to randomization and was listed as a screening failure. All 3 patients contributed data up to and including week 12. The remaining 35 study subjects all completed 48 weeks of therapy and follow-up. One patient (TDF/FTC arm) did not provide the week-4 blood sample. One serious adverse event was reported during the study; this was a resolved episode of pyelonephritis in a patient with a history of recurrent urinary tract infections. Five grade 2 adverse advents were registered (4 in the ABC/3TC arm and 1 in the TDF/FTC arm), but none necessitated discontinuation of study drugs. No grade 3 or 4 adverse advents were reported.</p><fig id="pone-0032445-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0032445.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Flow chart of inclusion and follow up.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0032445.g001"/></fig><p>None of the study participants received systemic corticosteroids, bisphosphonates, vitamin D, calcium or other therapies known to affect bone metabolism at enrolment or during the study.

However, we used changes in BMD as the principal bone endpoint measure and found reductions in BMD with TDF/FTC-treatment, but stable rather than increased BMD with ABC/3TC-treatment. Our patient material is much smaller and, consequently, our data less robust.

We measured bone turnover biomarker as early as 4 weeks after randomization, which was not done in the STEAL-sub study, but generally the changes seen in biomarkers of bone turnover in the present study are in line with the findings of the STEAL- study. In the SMART-study BMD declined more with continuous than interrupted therapy, but no consistent drug-specific association with BMD decline was found <xref rid="pone.0032445-Grund1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Bone turnover markers were measured in an unpublished sub-study of the SMART study and early changes (4 months after baseline) in some of these markers predicted BMD changes over 12 months <xref rid="pone.0032445-Hoy1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>.

First, this should be interpreted in the context of a normal reduction in BMD after the age of 30 both in premenopausal women (&#x0223c;0.3&#x00025;/year), perimenopausal women (&#x0223c;1&#x00025;/year), and men (0&#x02013;0.5&#x00025;/year) <xref rid="pone.0032445-Warming1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>.

Still, initiation of corticosteroid therapy is associated with an increase in incident fractures <xref rid="pone.0032445-vanStaa1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, which has not been observed with initiation or switch to TDF-based HIV-treatment <xref rid="pone.0032445-Stellbrink1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0032445-McComsey1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0032445-Martin1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0032445-Martinez1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, but studies so far have been too small or too short to sufficiently address this issue.</p><p>Whether the observed changes in BMD in our study and those of others are clinically relevant is a very interesting but difficult to answer question. The observed loss of BMD is quite small and not likely to confer a consequent increase in fracture risk in the majority of HIV-infected patients. At least there is no data to suggest that patients with higher risk of fractures should not receive TDF, but alternatives may be considered for those with previous fractures or known osteoporosis <xref rid="pone.0032445-Carr1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. In addition, no increase in risk of fracture among TDF-treated patients in the STEAL-study was revealed with use of the FRAX&#x000ae; tool <xref rid="pone.0032445-Haskelberg1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, but it should be noted that the FRAX&#x000ae; tool is not validated for patients with BMD reductions within the previous year.</p><p>It has been suggested that the initial loss of BMD may stabilize after 1 year of treatment and therefore may be caused by a continued effect of viral replication on bone turnover until complete suppression, even though other explanations have also been put forward <xref rid="pone.0032445-Mallon1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Our data, and those of the STEAL-study, indicate a direct effect of anti-retroviral therapy (ART) on bone mass density. This is helpful in the efforts to understand how traditional risk factors for low BMD, HIV-infection and ART each contribute to the increased risk of low BMD and fractures among HIV-infected individuals.</p><p>We measured several bone turnover markers to provide additional information on the effects of these treatments on bone remodeling and potentially the mechanisms underlying the changes seen in BMD. Bone turnover markers increased in the TDF/FTC arm within the first 12 weeks after treatment switch and remained stably elevated hereafter. This indicate that loss of BMD is associated with an increased rate of bone resorption and formation that can be detected as early as 12 weeks after initiation of TDF, and possibly already after 4 weeks. The early time point evaluated in this study is particularly interesting, as comparable studies have not provided data on bone turnover biomarkers so shortly after treatment shift to a TDF-based regimen. Both OC and OPG showed initial decreases in the TDF/FTC arm followed by increase or stabilization, which raises the question if certain signaling events relevant for the bone remodeling effects of TDF are taking place within the first few weeks of treatment switch. However, this remains speculative and the meaning of these finding are uncertain.

In other HAART-initiation studies biochemical parameters of renal function were similar between TDF/FTC and ABC/3TC treated patients <xref rid="pone.0032445-Smith1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0032445-Moyle1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, but more patients in the TDF groups developed clinical renal impairment <xref rid="pone.0032445-Smith1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0032445-Martinez1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. No difference in eGFR, creatinine clearance or other renal endpoints was found among virologically suppressed HIV-patients in the STEAL-study <xref rid="pone.0032445-Martin1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.</p><p>The primary limitation of our study is the failure to reach the intended number of enrolled patients, which reduced the statistical power to detect differences between study arms. In addition, DXA was not performed in all patients and we only have 48 weeks of follow-up, which is too short to acknowledge the long-term effect on BMD reductions that appear to occur primarily within the first 24&#x02013;48 weeks with stabilization hereafter. Interestingly, while eCrCl decreased over time in both study arms, no change in plasma cysC was observed indicating a stable GFR. We did not include GFR measurement by an exogenous marker and thus cannot compare these two estimates with more precise GFR-measurements. However, the eCrCl estimate based on plasma creatinine is dependent on factors other than GFR, including changes in muscle mass and tubular secretion of creatinine, and is possible that either the HIV infection or the anti-viral treatment may influence such factors. Previous studies comparing eCrCl and cysC based GFR estimates on HIV patients with normal renal function and on anti-viral treatment have generated mixed results <xref rid="pone.0032445-Bonjoch1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0032445-Barraclough1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. The 24-hour urine collections were not complete precluding us from determining 24-hour excretion of albumin, tubular markers, and the fractional phosphate excretion. Furthermore, due to incomplete sampling, urinary biomarkers were not measured in all patients at all time points. We did not, however, detect differences in plasma phosphate levels between study arms.</p><p>Long-term effects of HAART, including effects on bone and renal function, will continue to be outcomes of interest in future clinical trials. Beside this, more prospective studies will be needed to evaluate potential interventions to prevent or reverse loss of BMD. While several clinical trials have shown that bisphosphonate, vitamin D and calcium, either separate or in combination, are safe and effective in the treatment of decreased BMD among HIV-infected patients on HAART <xref rid="pone.0032445-McComsey2" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0032445-Bolland1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, there are still no published studies on interventions to prevent bone loss associated with TDF or HAART initiation.</p><p>In conclusion, we observed decreases in hip and lumbar spine BMD, in conjunction with early increases in bone turnover markers, in patients randomized to TDF/FTC-based treatment compared with ABC/3TC. Changes in renal function were not different between study arms although a very small increase in NGAL was detected among TDF-treated patients. The clinical significance of the latter is unclear.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0032445.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>
