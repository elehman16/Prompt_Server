The first session involves psychological education about the brain and what research tells us about cognitive styles in eating disorders.

Patients&#x02019; self-reported cognitive style, motivation to change and their feedback on the intervention were used as outcome measures.</p><p>From the previous literature, as presented in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, group CRT was reported in different clinical settings (mostly case series and clinical observations) but no research to date has been conducted to explore the impact of group CRT in patients with both AN and ASD. This is an important question because research evidence shows clear links between AN and ASD (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]). Amongst other similarities between AN and ASD, set shifting and bigger picture thinking are well researched and since CRT targets cognitive style the group setting is an ideal and safe environment to practice experiential cognitive exercises and role plays. It is therefore a very relevant question to explore similarities and differences in response to CRT group therapy for these patient groups. In addition to this, inpatient treatment for severe and enduring AN needs more development in the area of psychological treatment according to multicentre studies e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>Our findings from this observational study does not allow us to draw causal conclusions about the effect of group CRT, due to a lack of control group, but instead provides interesting observations and pilot data for future studies. For example, our findings suggest that the subgroup of inpatients with AN who had no ASD traits reported medium size statistically significant improvements in self perceived flexibility of thinking and seemed to have developed a bigger picture approach after the group CRT. Their self-reported ability to change was also higher after the intervention, interestingly this increase was significantly larger than the small increase found in the high ASD trait group. The feedback questionnaire showed overall satisfaction with the brief group format from both groups, with no significant differences in feedback between the groups (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Patient feedback questionnaire</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12888_2016_1044_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p><p>This is an interesting finding as gaining insight into your own thinking patterns and being able to make changes and adaptations from a very early stage of treatment in an inpatient programme is helpful to engage patients in the treatment and make behavioural changes in different domains. In the context of inpatient psychological treatment, group interventions are practical and easy to deliver alongside nutritional and other inpatient treatment interventions [for more details see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] &#x02018;Brief group psychotherapy for eating disorders: inpatient protocols&#x02019;].</p><p>Our results also highlight that in the group of patients scoring high on one of the ASD measures (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;14), no significant changes in self-reported thinking styles after group CRT or improvements in motivation; negligible effect sizes suggest that it is unlikely due to the power of study. From these results we can see that the current brief group format of CRT had no influence on self perceived cognitive styles. It is possible that the group setting, dosage or even style of delivery of the cognitive training could be modified for people with both AN and ASD traits.</p><p>In regards to the form of delivery of CRT, in AN literature the authors always highlight the importance of a motivational approach using Socratic questioning throughout the sessions moving from experiential exercises to reflective and implementation stages. This approach might be modified and adapted to suit an ASD/AN patient group making questions more concrete and giving more examples rather than expecting patients to do too much guess work and struggle with open ended questions. A recent systematic review of the CBT literature in ASD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] has highlighted the need of protocol modifications for individuals with ASD. The authors presented useful recommendations to make CBT more accessible for the ASD group, similar adaptations are achievable for CRT.</p><p>Although this small case study is limited, it is informative and has useful implications when considering future developments, for example individual format of cognitive training will perhaps be more suited for people with comorbid ASD traits and AN. In future CRT studies, it is also worth exploring the proportion of comorbid ASD in AN samples, as the literature has shown that it is harder to diagnose women with ASD. Careful examination and clinical interviews will help detect a larger proportion of women in clinical settings with comorbid AN and ASD e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. According to our results, inclusion or exclusion of an AN/ASD group might change results of other studies in the context of treatment evaluation. Our results suggest that the sub-group of patients with elevated ASD traits may need special adaptations of the available treatments in terms of length and content, not only to restore their nutrition, but to address wider aspects of recovery including addressing underlying anxiety and broader social functioning.</p><p>Our small observational study has a number of limitations for example the study was based on audit and a control group (non CRT group) will be needed in the future. Neuropsychological testing would also help to address the question around whether changes in thinking styles in the current study are subjective or reflective of improved cognitive test performance. It would also be worth addressing the role of co-morbidities, such as depression and anxiety, on cognitive change and treatment outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This small study has implications for future studies for example, it will be easier to design studies with a more accurate power calculation, taking into account ASD traits by developing a modified version of group CRT for the individuals with AN and ASD.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ADOS</term><def><p>Autism diagnostic observation schedule</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AN</term><def><p>Anorexia nervosa</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AQ</term><def><p>Autism-spectrum quotient</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ASD</term><def><p>Autism spectrum disorder</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CRT</term><def><p>Cognitive remediation therapy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DFlex</term><def><p>Detail and flexibility questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MR</term><def><p>Motivational ruler</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank our patients for their informative feedback and active participation in the development of this therapeutic package.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p>Swiss Anorexia Foundation (34&#x02013;16) and the Maudsley Charity &#x0201c;Health in Mind&#x0201d;.</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p>Data available from the corresponding author upon request.</p></sec><sec id="FPar3"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>KT devised the therapy manual with clinical team, selected the outcome measures, supervised the study and drafted the manuscript.
