This is so important in patients with any kind of chronic liver disease, especially chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) patients in whom acute HBV infection may lead to decompensation of liver disease. Some of the studies have shown that immunogenicity of HBV vaccination is decreased in these patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of double dose vaccination of HBV in these patients, compared with standard dose vaccination in similar patients and healthy adults.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Methods:</title><p>A total of 64 patients with chronic HCV infection were randomized into 2 groups of 32. Group A received standard dose HBV vaccine, at 0, 1, 6 months, whereas group B received double dose HBV vaccine. Group C consisted of 32 healthy adults who also received standard dose vaccination. At 1 month after the end of vaccination, Hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb) titer was checked in all participants and the results were compared.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>There was no significant difference in age or sex among three groups. The response rate in groups B and C was 100% (all had HBsAb titer &#x0003e;10 mIU/mL), while in group A, 4 patients (12.5%) were non-responders (HBsAb titer &#x0003c; 10 mIU/mL).

Many of the estimated 130-170 million people with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection may also progress to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Due to the gradual course of disease, its morbidity and mortality is often underestimated. CLD is the tenth cause of mortality in the United States and is responsible for 25,000 deaths annually.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] It is estimated about 40% of all CLDs in the United States is due to HCV infection. HCV-associated cirrhosis is the most common indication for orthotopic liver transplantation in adults.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimates that 8,000-13,000 deaths occur each year in the United States due to chronic HCV infection. A number of preventive measures for patients with CLD have been recommended to improve quality-of-life, prevent the development of complications and improve overall survival. One of them is the prevention of HBV super-infection by HBV vaccination and is recommended for people at high risk of either exposure to or severe morbidity of HBV infection, such as patients with other CLD,[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] particularly chronic hepatitis C. In co-infection with chronic HBV and HCV, replicating HBV lowers the replication of HCV,[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] but both independently enhance the severity of hepatitis[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and the risks of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Therefore, many organizations endorse HBV vaccination for patients with CLD. These include the World Health Organization, the CDC and prevention, the National Institutes of Health, the Veteran's Health Administration, the American Liver Foundation and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] The first HBV vaccine was produced by the inactivation and purification of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) obtained from the plasma of chronic HBV carriers.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] This was replaced by the production of HBsAg using recombinant deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) technology.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] All the studies have shown that available ribosomal deoxyribonucleic acid (rDNA) HBV vaccines of 5-10% or more do not create an antibody response to the HBsAg component present in these preparations (non-responders) or they respond poorly (hypo-responders) in individuals with healthy immune system.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] The definition of non-responsiveness and hypo-responsiveness, generally, is anti-HBs level less than 10 mIU/mL and 100 mIU/mL, respectively.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Non-responders remain susceptible to infection with HBV. Several factors affect the antibody response to HBsAg, including the site of injection, sex, advancing age, being overweight and immunodeficiency. Available information suggests that the immunogenicity of the HBV vaccine is reduced in patients with CLDs and in liver transplant recipients, but is unimpaired in patients with fatty liver.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</p><p>Testing for post-immunization antibody titers is not recommended; exceptions include patients at increased risk for recurrent exposure. This includes health-care workers, patients on chronic hemodialysis, gay or bisexual men and sexual partners of carriers. Some experts also test for post-immunization antibody titers in patients with CLDs, due to the high risk of severe infection in this subgroup.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Precipitants selection and study design</title><p>The study was designed as an open prospective trial to compare the immunogenicity of the recombinant HBV vaccine of 40 and 20 &#x003bc;g in patients with chronic HCV infection.

Blood sample was obtained to assess the anti-HBs concentration 1 month after the basic vaccine schedule was completed to determine the rate of non-responsiveness (anti-HBs &#x0003c; 10 mIU/mL), seroconversion (anti-HBs between 10 and 99 mIU/mL) and seroprotection (anti-HBs &#x02265; 100 mIU/mL).[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</p><p>Criteria for inclusion were subjects between 18 and 65 years old with chronic HCV infection and negative serum markers for HBV infection. Chronic HCV infection was defined based on positive HCV-Ab and HCV-ribonucleic acid (RNA), in a patient without clinical or laboratory findings, indicating acute hepatitis (jaundice, very high aminotransferases). The exclusion criteria were transplanted patients or those on waiting lists, dialysis therapy and chronic renal patients with GFR &#x0003c; 60 ml/min/1.73 m<sup>3</sup>, HIV-positive patients, patients with neoplasias, immunosuppressed patients, pregnant women and alcoholic hepatitis or cirrhosis. Individuals already immunized against HBV (presence of anti-HBs) were excluded too. HIV-Ab was tested in all patients and also the control group and those with positive results were not recruited. Alcoholic patient was considered in the study, if he/she did drink at least 40 g of alcohol/day (males) and 20 g/day (females) for at least 5 years. Presence of chronic hepatitis or cirrhosis in proven HCV infected patients (by HCV RNA or Recombinant Immuno Blot Assay (RIBA), was detected based on clinical, laboratory, ultrasonographic, endoscopic and histopathological findings.</p><p>Cirrhotic patients were sorted using the original classification proposed by Child-Turcotte and modified by Pugh.</p><p>HBsAg and quantitative anti-HBs were detected by Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.</p><p>All precipitants who did not match the exclusion criteria and had given written, informed consent were recruited. A total of 64 patients with chronic infection of HCV and 32 healthy volunteers, as a control group, were included in the study. Healthy volunteers were chosen from newly arrived hospital staff who were not vaccinated against HBV and needed to be vaccinated before starting their job as medical staff. The control group matched to the patient groups by age. We didn&#x02019;t match the patients and the controls by sex, because sex is not an important factor in response to HBV vaccination. Chronic HCV infected patient were randomized to two groups (standard dose and a double dose groups), using a computerized randomization software. Each group consisted of 32 patients. For all participants, body mass index (BMI) was calculated at the beginning of the study and the quantitative anti-HBs titer was checked.

The majority of patients were male (90.6%) and had high-risk behaviors such as smoking, Intraravenous drug users (IVDU) and tattooing. It was not surprising that injection drug abuse was the most common identifiable risk factor of HCV infection in our study (75%).
