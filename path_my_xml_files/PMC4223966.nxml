The frequency of cesarean section due to labor dystocia was two times in the control group compared to propranolol group (13.6% and 6.25%, respectively).

It is well known that the half-life of propranolol is 2-3 h and its peak effect is at 1 h. Therefore, at first, we consulted with expert pharmacologists, gynecologists, and cardiologists, and then, we used oral propranolol.

Participation in the study was voluntary and the participants were free to withdraw from the study whenever they wished to do so. An informed consent was obtained from all participants before they were enrolled in the study.</p><p>Using Epi Info version 3.5.1 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA) and Stat Calc version 1.0.1 (AcaStat, Leesburg, VA, USA), a sample size of 150 participants was determined to have 80% power to detect significant differences between the studied groups for a confidence interval of 95%.</p><p>Elective induction of labor beyond 40 weeks of gestational age may be associated with a decrease in the risk of both cesarean delivery and meconium-stained amniotic fluid. Therefore, the induction of labor increased from 9.5% in 1990 to 22.1% in the US in 2004.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] We studied 146 nulliparous women with singleton pregnancy of 40-42 weeks of gestational age (according to a reliable last menstrual period and ultrasound evaluation at the first trimester).</p><p>The inclusion criteria were absence of the following: a history of uterine surgery, polyhydramnios, contraindications to &#x003b2;&#x02013;adrenergic agents, such as systolic blood pressure less than 100 mmHg or pulse rate less than 60/min and more than 120/min, history of any known cardiac disease, mother's pulmonary or metabolic disorders, maternal use of drug, and fetal distress. The exclusion criteria were estimated weight of the fetus more than 4 kg by ultrasound of cephalic presentation, rupture of membrane, and Bishop score of more than 5 present of uterus contraction[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] or fetal height estimated by symphsis-fundal height measurement.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</p><p>The participants were selected by the simple random sampling method. Then, all participants were examined by a cardiologist and a gynecologist in order to identify the conditions mentioned in the inclusion and exclusion criteria before using any intervention. Next, randomization was carried out at the obstetric triage unit on a 1:1 basis using a random number table and 73 participants were allocated in each group, as described in previous clinical trial studies.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</p><p>A checklist was used to collect the demographic and obstetric data. The participants&#x02019; characteristics such as age, primary Bishop score, gestational age, body mass index (BMI), and estimated birth weight were recorded and compared between groups. The partogram was used to monitor the fetal heart rate, membrane status, cervical dilation and effacement, station of the fetus, uterine contractions, maternal pulse and respiratory rate, maternal blood pressure, maternal temperature, and Apgar scores at 1 and 5 min. Amniotomy was performed by a trained midwife when cervical dilation reached 5 cm, if the membrane had not been ruptured spontaneously.</p><p>A capsule containing 20 mg propranolol to the first group (propranolol plus oxytocin) and a similar capsule as a placebo to the second group (oxytocin plus placebo) were administrated orally by the researcher before beginning induction. Oral capsules were repeated after 8 h, if tree forceful contractions were not obtained during 10 min. Then, induction was initiated by an experienced midwife. The study was of a double-blind design.</p><p>Induction was initiated with a dose of 2 mIu/min and increased by 2 mIu/min every 15 min until tree forceful contractions were obtained for 10 min, or to a maximum dose of 30 mIu/min. Then, it was continued at this rate for 8 h. If patients entered the active phase of labor (cervical dilatation = 3&#x02013;4 cm), induction was continued until delivery. If the parturient had hyperstimulation of contractions (in a situation with more than 5 contractions/10 min, duration of contraction &#x0003e; 90 sec, interval of contraction less than 2 min, or fetal distress), the induction was stopped, and the parturient was kept in left lateral position and given oxygen, and intravenous dextrose. If the situation returned to normal, the induction was started with half of the previous dosage. Otherwise, the gynecologist was informed and the treatment process was chosen based on the gynecologist's decision. In the cases not entering the active phase, induction was stopped and participants were transferred to the pre-labor ward. On the second day, all interventions like those of the first day were performed. If there was no response to induction on the second day, a cesarean section was performed. The participants were followed up until delivery. All collected data were analyzed using SPSS version 14 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). Comparisons of means were done by <italic>t</italic>-test.

Therefore, in the present study, we decided to evaluate the effect of propranolol, a &#x003b2;-adrenergic blocker, on labor duration and the mode of delivery. One difference between our trial and other studies performed up to now is that we used the oral form of propranolol. Our results showed that propranolol could significantly shorten both the duration of active phase and the second stage of labor.</p><p>The &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptor (&#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-AR) is a type of G protein&#x02013;coupled receptor[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] which is distributed in n umerous tissues and is found widely in the smooth muscle of the vasculature, trachea, bronchi, and uterus. This receptor has an important role in smooth muscle relaxation resulting from the activation of the adenylate cyclase signaling cascade.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] Stimulation of &#x003b2;2-AR causes relaxant effects on the smooth muscle of the uterus. It has been shown that the number of these receptors decreases by about 50% when the labor contraction begins.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] Propranolol blocks &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>&#x02013;&#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-ARs, but has no effect on &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub>-AR of the myometrium.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Previous studies have shown that administration of intravenous propranolol could increase myometrial contractility in pregnant and non-pregnant women,[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and acts against the relaxant effects of ritodrine.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] Ziolkowski showed that use of a combination of propranolol and oxytocin in post-term pregnancies leads to reduction of labor duration by approximately 30%, which is consistent with our findings.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] In a randomized trial by Kashanian <italic>et al</italic>., when they used intravenous injection of a single dose of 2 mg propranolol before starting labor induction, duration of the active phase was shortened, which supports our findings. However, in their study, no significant difference was seen in the duration of second stage of labor. Use of a different dosage of propranolol in the above-mentioned study can be a possible explanation for the difference observed. The half-life of propranolol is about 2-3 h and its maximal effect is at about 1-1.5 h after injection. Perhaps use of repeated doses of propranolol may result in more effectiveness.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Palomaki <italic>et al</italic>. reported that in cases of labor arrest due to insufficient power of contractions, adding propranolol to oxytocin could improve the power of contractions and decrease the length of labor, which is consistent with our results.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] In a similar study on labor dysfunction, Mitrani <italic>et al</italic>. showed that propranolol could reinforce labor contraction by blocking the &#x003b2;-ARs.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] In our study, however, the length of the third stage of labor decreased in the propranolol group, but the difference between groups was not significant; this finding is in accordance with other previous studies.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] We repeated 20 mg oral propranolol after 8 h if a poor contraction was obtained. With regard to the half-life of propranolol and duration of its effect, it seems that administration of repeated doses of oral propranolol may lead to more effects.</p><p>Also, it was observed in our study that use of propranolol plus oxytocin decreased the frequency of cesarean section deliveries, confirming several previous studies.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] However, the results of some other studies are not consistent with our finding.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] In our study, propranolol had no adverse effects on neonates according to the Apgar scores at 1 and 5 min and the need for NICU admission.
