In the present study, we studied the prevalence of MeS 7&#x02005;years postpartum among women with GDM risk factors during pregnancy, women with early GDM diagnosis and women without GDM risk factors. We also analysed the early pregnancy risk factors associated with MeS.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A Finnish cluster randomised controlled GDM prevention trial was conducted in 2007&#x02013;2009. The prevalence of MeS according to International Diabetes Federation criteria was determined in the follow-up study 7&#x02005;years after original trial. Eligible participants (n=289) in 4 study groups (intervention (n=83) and usual care (n=87) with GDM risk factors; early GDM (n=51), and healthy control without GDM risk factors (n=68)) were evaluated for MeS. Binary logistic regression models were used to analyse risk factors associated with MeS.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>7 years postpartum, the MeS prevalence was 14% (95% CI 8% to 25%) in the intervention group; 15% (CI 8% to 25%) in the usual care group; 50% (CI 35% to 65%) in the early GDM group and 7% (CI 2% to 18%) in the healthy control group. OR for MeS in women with GDM risk factors did not differ from the healthy control group. Body mass index (BMI)-adjusted OR for MeS was 9.18 (CI 1.82 to 46.20) in the early GDM group compared with the healthy control group. Increased prepregnancy BMI was associated with MeS (OR, 1.17, CI 1.08 to 1.28, adjusted for group).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Increased prepregnancy BMI and early GDM diagnosis were the strongest risk factors for developing MeS 7&#x02005;years postpartum. Overweight and obese women and especially those with early GDM should be monitored and counselled for cardiometabolic risk factors after delivery.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Metabolic syndrome</kwd><kwd>gestational diabetes</kwd><kwd>postpartum</kwd><kwd>follow-up</kwd><kwd>pregnancy</kwd><kwd>women</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Strengths and limitations of this study</title></caption><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Our study was a long-term follow-up of a large gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) prevention trial.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The study was one of the first follow-up studies on the prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MeS) after delivery among women with risk factors for GDM.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The results include data of the MeS prevalence among different risk groups.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Thirty-seven per cent of the invited women entered the measurements for MeS, and the four subgroups were relatively small.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The results may have been moderately affected by a healthy selection bias.</p></list-item></list></boxed-text><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Metabolic syndrome (MeS) is a clustering of atherosclerotic risk factors, including abdominal obesity, elevated plasma triglycerides, decreased high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, elevated blood pressure and elevated fasting glucose.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>

Maternity clinics were randomised into seven intervention and seven control clinics. Pregnant women were recruited by nurses at their first visit (8&#x02013;12 weeks&#x02019; gestation) in maternity clinics. Women were eligible if they had at least one of the following GDM risk factors: age&#x02265;40&#x02005;years, prepregnancy body mass index (BMI) &#x02265;25&#x02005;kg/m&#x000b2;, GDM or any sign of glucose intolerance in any previous pregnancy, a macrosomic baby (&#x02265;4500&#x02005;g) in any previous pregnancy or diabetes in first-degree or second-degree relatives. The main exclusion criteria were age&#x0003c;18&#x02005;years, a GDM diagnosis at 8&#x02013;12 weeks' gestation, twin pregnancy, physical restrictions that precluded exercise or a clinical history of chronic disease. A diagnosis of GDM was based on a 2-hour 75&#x02005;g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) according to at least one of the following criteria: fasting plasma glucose of &#x02265;5.3&#x02005;mmol/L, &#x0003e;10.0&#x02005;mmol/L at 1&#x02005;hour or &#x0003e;8.6&#x02005;mmol/L at 2&#x02005;hours.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></p><p>The original intervention included individual counselling on weight gain, diet and physical activity by public health nurses during five routine visits to maternity clinics.

Height was measured at the first maternity care visit (8&#x02013;12&#x02005;weeks' gestation), and weight was measured at each maternity care visit, and at 1 and 7&#x02005;years postpartum. Waist circumference was measured at 1 and 7&#x02005;years postpartum, and the average of three measurements was used in the analysis. Blood pressure was measured in duplicate at each maternity care visit and at 1 and 7&#x02005;years postpartum.</p><p>Blood samples for glucose, cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and triglyceride analysis after a 12-hour fast, and a 2-hour OGTT were collected at baseline and at 1 and 7&#x02005;years postpartum. All blood analyses were performed at the UKK Institute. During the OGTT, the participants drank 75&#x02005;g glucose in 330&#x02005;mL water (Glucodyn, Ultimed, Finland), and the samples were taken after 60 and 120&#x02005;min. Plasma glucose concentrations were measured fresh within 24&#x02005;hours after the OGTT. Plasma samples for lipid analysis were stored frozen at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C until analysed. Citric acid/fluoride and EDTA tubes were used for glucose and lipid analysis of venous blood. Glucose, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations were determined in enzymatic assays using a Roche Cobas Mira Plus analyser.

The Wilson score method without continuity correction was used to calculate 95% CIs for prevalence. A &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test was used to investigate whether distributions of categorical variables differed from one another. Continuous variables were normally distributed. We used one-way analysis of variance to compare means across groups. Differences in continuous variables between the healthy control or the early GDM group compared with the other three groups merged together were tested by independent samples t-test. Binary logistic regression models were used to obtain ORs and their 95% CIs to study associations between MeS and its explanatory variables. Explanatory variables were group (the intervention, the usual care, the early GDM and the healthy control as a reference group), age (continuous), BMI (continuous) and the five GDM risk factors which were used in entrance criteria to the original study: BMI &#x02265;25&#x02005;kg/m&#x000b2;, age&#x02265;40&#x02005;years, GDM or any sign of glucose intolerance in any previous pregnancy, a macrosomic baby (&#x02265;4500&#x02005;g) in any previous pregnancy, and diabetes in first-degree or second-degree relatives. Based on the rule of 10 events per variable, multivariable logistic regression models were adjusted only for BMI and GDM or any sign of glucose intolerance in any previous pregnancy. The results were considered to be statistically significant if p&#x0003c;0.05. All analyses were performed with SPSS software (V.20.0).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Background characteristics</title><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2016014565TB1">Table&#x000a0;1</xref> shows the characteristics of the 289 women who participated in the follow-up study 7&#x02005;years postpartum.

Twenty-nine (10%) women smoked frequently or occasionally. The most common inclusion criteria for the study were prepregnancy overweight or obesity, and diabetes in first-degree or second-degree relatives.

Healthy controls did not meet inclusion criteria (GDM risk factors) at baseline. The prevalence of overweight and obesity 7&#x02005;years postpartum (53%, 69%, 80%) had stayed around the same level, or slightly increased, compared with early pregnancy (48%, 68%, 78%) among women in the intervention, usual care and early GDM group, respectively. Four women (2 in the early GDM and 2 in the healthy control group) had medication for type 2 diabetes. Sixteen (5%) women had medication for dyslipidaemias and eight (3%) for hypertension, with no difference between groups.

Further, participation in a GDM prevention study may have improved health consciousness and lifestyle habits in the intervention and the usual care group. Additionally, also usual care includes some lifestyle counselling in Finland. Dropout rate was rather high, but since it was non-differential for group, the possibility for bias in the differences between groups remains low.</p><p>Our subgroups differed in the prevalence of MeS. Women in the early GDM and women in the healthy control groups represented the extremes (50% vs 7%). Earlier studies have found that history of GDM is strongly associated with a higher risk of future MeS and other cardiometabolic disorders.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>
<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> In a Finnish cohort among 240 women, the risk of developing MeS 2&#x02013;6&#x02005;years after pregnancy complicated by GDM was 2.4-fold higher compared with normal pregnancy.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> In our earlier report of the same original trial, the MeS prevalence among women with early GDM was already elevated (31%) at 1-year postpartum compared with the intervention group (11%).<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Seven years postpartum, the MeS prevalence among women with early GDM had increased to 50%. Further, women with early GDM had increased odds for MeS compared with other three groups (intervention, usual care and healthy controls). The association remained after adjustment for BMI. Also history of GDM was associated with the MeS occurrence. These findings attest the later cardiometabolic risk associated with GDM. Nevertheless, GDM diagnosis at 26&#x02013;28 weeks' gestation among the 19 women in the intervention and usual care group seemed not to be associated with higher MeS prevalence in our data. Therefore, our study suggests that GDM was associated with an increased MeS prevalence 7&#x02005;years postpartum if it was diagnosed in early pregnancy (8&#x02013;12&#x02005;weeks). Women with early GDM are a special high risk group for later cardiometabolic disorders. A large meta-analysis found that women with early pregnancy GDM were at a twofold risk for future type 2 diabetes compared with women with later GDM.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></p><p>Several cardiometabolic risk factors were clustered in the women in the early GDM group. In early pregnancy, they had been more often overweight or obese, and 7&#x02005;years postpartum, they still were more often overweight or obese, and had components of MeS more frequently than the other women. Further, compared with Finnish female population, the women with early GDM in our study were three times more often obese (45% vs 16%),<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> and over two times more often abdominally obese (waist circumference &#x0003e;88cm) (71% vs 30%).<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> Present obesity partly explains the increased MeS prevalence. Clustering of lifestyle-related risk factors is common.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38&#x02013;40</xref> Pregnancy-related weight retention tends to be highest among those women who have been overweight or obese before pregnancy.<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>
<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> Further, many women retain weight after pregnancy, and the mean weight gain associated with parity is around 0.5&#x02013;3.2&#x02005;kg, with a high personal variation.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>
<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>
<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> In a Finnish population study, parity-related weight retention was associated with visceral obesity.<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></p><p>High prevalence of obesity promoting insulin resistance was probably the common denominator for the increased prevalence of early pregnancy GDM and MeS after 7 years.<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>
<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> This finding clearly underlines that it is particularly important to invest in lifestyle counselling among overweight and obese pregnant women entering maternity care. Prevention of excessive weight gain during pregnancy and promoting postpartum weight reduction by individually tailored lifestyle modifications have been effective against weight retention, and in preventing further cardiometabolic disorders, such as MeS in parous women.<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48&#x02013;52</xref> A weight reduction of 5&#x02013;10% is associated with significant decreases in cardiometabolic risk factors.<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>
<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref> The possibilities for reaching pregnant women in many countries are good due to maternity care systems, but there is often lack of long-term follow-up as the healthcare providers change.<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref> Actions to increase cooperation between different providers are needed.</p><p>Healthy controls were healthier than the other three groups with GDM risk factors, as assessed by components and the prevalence of MeS at 7&#x02005;years postpartum. Also compared with the Finnish population, they represented an unexceptionally healthy group, in what comes to the prevalence of obesity (0% vs 16%), abdominal obesity (12% vs 30%) as well as MeS (7% vs 17&#x02013;23%).<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>
<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> The results suggest that keeping normal weight and prevention of excessive pregnancy-related weight retention are important in not only preventing GDM, but also in preventing later MeS.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>Our study has several strengths. It was a long-term follow-up, from early pregnancy until 7&#x02005;years postpartum. It was also one of the first follow-up studies of gestational trials, in which the prevalence of MeS has been determined among women with risk factors for GDM. To the best of our knowledge, the only previous follow-up report was ours on the MeS prevalence among women with GDM risk factors at 1-year postpartum.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> In general, there is a limited amount of studies of the MeS prevalence among reproductive-aged female populations, even though obesity is rapidly increasing worldwide, especially among young adults.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref> Our study results include data of the MeS prevalence among different risk groups&#x02014;women with an increased GDM risk, women diagnosed with early GDM and healthy pregnant women. Also associations between risk factors assessed in early pregnancy and MeS 7&#x02005;years postpartum have not been identified earlier. Our original trial<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> was one of the largest RCTs about preventing the development of GDM in women with GDM risk factors.</p><p>After 7&#x02005;years, the recruitment of the women of the original study was difficult, and eventually, 37% of the invited women entered the measurements for analyses of MeS. Thirty-seven per cent were either not willing to participate or only completed the follow-up questionnaire. Dropout analyses showed that the results may have been affected by a healthy selection bias, as the women who participated in the follow-up study were less often smokers and were higher educated. On the other hand, the bias affected all four subgroups entering the follow-up study, as they did not differ from each other regarding to the participation rate. The subgroups were relatively small, which weakened the power to compare the subgroups. The study was implemented among Finnish women, and thus, the results can only be generalised to Caucasian populations.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Seven years postpartum, MeS was diagnosed among 14% of the women with risk factors for GDM during pregnancy, which is less than average. The MeS prevalence was the highest among women with a diagnosis of early GDM (50%), and the lowest among the healthy control group (7%). Early GDM diagnosis and increased prepregnancy BMI were the strongest risk factors for developing MeS. Prepregnancy and present overweight or obesity were common among women with GDM risk factors, and especially among those with early GDM. Overweight and obese women and especially those with early GDM should be monitored and counselled for cardiometabolic risk factors after delivery. Prevention of pregnancy-related weight retention, including excessive gestational and postpartum weight gain, is important for the prevention of MeS. Overweight and obesity among reproductive-aged women is increasing, which represents even a greater challenge in monitoring and managing risk factors for chronic diseases. Larger population studies on the MeS prevalence and evaluation of prevention strategies are needed among reproductive-aged women, especially among those with GDM risk factors.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank hospital chemist, Anne Rauhio, from Fimlab Laboratories who was responsible for the laboratory testing.
