When patients go home and return to the community after hospital discharge, they face physically demanding challenges such as negotiating curbs, stairs of various heights, and uneven walking surfaces. The functional challenges that patients face require good balance skills to prevent falls.

Potential participants for the study were recruited between April 2006 and April 2009 from a large outpatient home physical therapy provider. At their first post-operative home visit and before any assessments, qualified participants were randomly assigned by their physical therapist to a typical exercise (TE) group or a typical exercise plus balance exercise (TE&#x02009;+&#x02009;B) group using a coin toss method of randomization. Heads was allocated to the TE group, and tails was allocated to the TE&#x02009;+&#x02009;B group to determine the group assignment of each participant. The participants flipped the coin and were assigned to the exercise group based on the outcome. The participants were blinded to their group allocation; however, the physical therapists were not blinded to the group allocation of the participants. Participants in the TE group completed joint ROM and muscle strengthening exercises, and participants in the TE&#x02009;+&#x02009;B group completed joint ROM, muscle strengthening, and additional balance exercises. All participants were assessed before (baseline) and after (follow-up) the intervention period. Assessments of participants at baseline were completed at the participant&#x02019;s home by their attending physical therapist, who was one of the two participating physical therapists, having 3&#x02013;4&#x02009;years of experience in working with patients with THA and/or TKA. The physical therapists started administering intervention to the participants on the same day immediately after the baseline assessments were completed. The intervention program was administered for a period of 5&#x02009;weeks. At the end of 5&#x02009;weeks, follow-up assessments were completed by the primary investigator (one of the two participating physical therapists) within 3&#x02013;6&#x02009;days in a biomechanics laboratory at an academic center. At the beginning of the study, the two physical therapists visited one patient together for the first as well as the follow-up visits to ensure that similar information was conveyed to all participants with respect to instructions during assessment on outcome measures and also during implementation of the intervention. Ethics approval for the study was received from the University Research Ethics Board for Health Sciences Research Involving Human Subjects, and all participants provided written consent prior to participation.</p><sec id="section7-2050312115570769"><title>Participants</title><p>Participants in the study were a sample of convenience of consecutive patients that were referred for outpatient home physical therapy following either THA or TKA. Patients&#x02019; charts were reviewed to determine their eligibility with respect to the operated joint, any surgery-related complications, any contraindications to exercise, and other health conditions, for participation in the study. The inclusion criteria were patients who had primary unilateral THA or TKA as a result of hip or knee joint OA and had been advised by their surgeon to weight-bear as tolerated following their surgery. Patients with revision THA or TKA, or those who had been advised by their surgeon to remain nonweight-bearing or partial weight-bearing on either the operated or nonoperated leg, were excluded. Patients with neurological conditions, such as hemiplegia, peripheral neuropathy, Parkinson&#x02019;s disease, multiple sclerosis or spinal cord compression, and vestibular disorders that might affect balance, and those who were considered unable to communicate or follow instructions were also excluded from the study. A total of 63 patients (22 males, 41 females) with a mean age of 66&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;10&#x02009;years were included in the study. As advised by the surgeons, all patients were taking blood thinners for prevention of blood clots, and pain medication as needed following surgery. Some patients had other health problems such as high blood pressure and high cholesterol level which did not affect their balance or participation in the study and were taking medication for these health problems as advised by their family physicians.</p></sec><sec id="section8-2050312115570769"><title>Intervention</title><p>After completion of assessment by the physical therapist at the first post-operative home visit, qualified patients performed their home exercise program.

Thereafter, the patients were visited by their physical therapist once or twice per week until 5&#x02009;weeks. Overall, patients received 4&#x02013;6 home visits during the 5&#x02009;weeks that they were seen for home visits. All patients received routine education about safety, transfers, and limb positioning, as well as typical exercises relative to their surgery. Those assigned to the TE&#x02009;+&#x02009;B group were also instructed in three balance exercises that they were to complete in addition to the typical exercises. The total duration of home exercise program for the TE&#x02009;+&#x02009;B group was expected to be slightly longer than that of the TE group. All patients were provided with exercise sheets that included written and photographed instructions for each prescribed exercise, an exercise compliance table, and a contact phone number for their physical therapist.</p><p>Patients were advised to complete 10 repetitions of each exercise three times a day and to keep a record on the compliance table.

physical therapy irrespective of their exercise groups demonstrated significant improvement on all four functionally oriented tests. Although this finding supports the traditional clinical belief that balance will improve following a typical exercise program alone, this study did observe that those who performed balance exercises in addition to typical exercises demonstrated significantly greater improvement in the balance-oriented tests (BBS and TUG) than those who performed typical joint ROM and muscle strengthening exercises alone. These results suggest that should the therapist believe that balance is of key importance for their patient, the use of simple balance exercises can readily lead to improvement in this component of many functional activities as determined within a relatively short period of 5&#x02009;weeks.</p><p>Similar improvement in balance has been reported by Liao et al.<sup><xref rid="bibr36-2050312115570769" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> in patients with knee replacement after administering a balance exercise program. However, the study by Liao et al.<sup><xref rid="bibr36-2050312115570769" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> included patients who had surgery 2&#x02009;months before they started participation in the exercise program, and therefore, the patients&#x02019; TUG scores were lower at baseline assessment (12&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1 and 13&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2 for the control and experimental groups, respectively). In this study, the patients were recruited 7&#x02013;10&#x02009;days after the THA or TKA surgery, and therefore, the patients&#x02019; TUG scores were comparatively higher at baseline assessment. At the completion of this study, the patients&#x02019; TUG scores had significantly reduced. This study was completed before the end of 2&#x02009;months&#x02019; duration following THA or TKA surgery.</p><p>Improvements in balance as observed in this study have also been reported in previous studies following balance intervention in patients with other health conditions. Diracoglu et al.<sup><xref rid="bibr37-2050312115570769" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> in an 8-week study reported improvement in balance from kinesthesia and balance exercises added to strengthening exercises as compared to strengthening exercises alone in female patients with knee OA. Williams et al.<sup><xref rid="bibr38-2050312115570769" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> also reported improvement in balance following a home-based balance exercise program in women with lower limb OA or rheumatoid arthritis on balance measures such as functional reach test, but no differences were observed on the WOMAC-function scores. Hiroyuki<sup><xref rid="bibr3-2050312115570769" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> reported significant improvement in balance measures such as one leg stand test, functional reach test, and the TUG following balance and gait exercise in the frail elderly population. Similar improvements in balance following balance exercises have also been reported in patients with stroke<sup><xref rid="bibr39-2050312115570769" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> and multiple sclerosis.<sup><xref rid="bibr40-2050312115570769" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup></p><p>No significant differences were observed between the exercise groups on the WOMAC-function or the ABC. This finding may reflect the lack of balance orientation of these outcome measures compared to the BBS and the TUG. The BBS is designed to assess balance while performing 14 functional tasks, and performance on the TUG relies heavily on the patient&#x02019;s balance during transfers and walking. The WOMAC-function and the ABC, on the other hand, are self-report questionnaires which rely on the patient&#x02019;s subjective assessment of their performance, without actually requiring the patient to perform the tasks described in the questions,<sup><xref rid="bibr41-2050312115570769" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr43-2050312115570769" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> not all of which include a balance-related component.</p><p>In this study, no differences were observed between the THA and the TKA patients on the outcome measures. Subsequently, data for THA or TKA patients were pooled together. Previous studies have reported no differences between patients undergoing THA and those undergoing TKA at 6-month follow-up after surgery.<sup><xref rid="bibr44-2050312115570769" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="bibr45-2050312115570769" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup> Whereas previous studies have used typical joint ROM and muscle strengthening exercises following THA or TKA,<sup><xref rid="bibr13-2050312115570769" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="bibr14-2050312115570769" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr15-2050312115570769" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr16-2050312115570769" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr17-2050312115570769" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr18-2050312115570769" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr19-2050312115570769" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> to our knowledge, this study is thought to be the first to assess the utility of adding balance exercises for these patients in the acute post-operative phase following THA or TKA. We chose to add balance exercises to a typical acute post-operative exercise program, rather than replacing some of the typical exercises with balance exercises. Liao et al.<sup><xref rid="bibr36-2050312115570769" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> have used a similar strategy to administer balance exercise program to the patients in experimental group following TKA. Since neither the typical exercises nor the balance exercises used following THA or TKA are standardized among therapists, it was unclear which exercises would best be replaced in order to match the two exercise programs on the number of exercises to be completed. Furthermore, we believed that a treatment effect that could be confidently linked to the balance exercises alone needed to be demonstrated before attempting to replace some of the typical ROM and muscle strengthening exercises with balance exercises. As a result, the balance exercises&#x02013;added option was considered to be the most practical means to initially assess the viability of balance exercises and to optimize the chances of finding a balance effect if it existed.</p><p>The seven typical joint ROM and muscle strengthening exercises and three balance exercises were selected by two physical therapists who routinely provide physical therapy to THA or TKA patients following surgery and who both had 3&#x02013;4&#x02009;years of clinical experience. They were guided by the exercises utilized in previous studies,<sup><xref rid="bibr13-2050312115570769" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="bibr14-2050312115570769" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr15-2050312115570769" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr16-2050312115570769" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr17-2050312115570769" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr18-2050312115570769" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> as well as their own clinical experience. In this study, the same three balance exercises were used for patients following THA or TKA surgery. These exercises were selected for their simplicity and the ability of all patients to complete them. All patients were able to perform all of the typical exercises, and patients in the typical plus balance exercise group were able to perform all of the balance exercises for the recommended 10 repetitions and frequency of three times per day by their second home visit. All patients reported completion of all exercises at the recommended frequency and number of repetitions with the exception of three patients (one in the typical plus balance exercise group and two in the typical exercise group) who did not perform exercises for a day due to a prior engagement.</p><p>Although nine patients completed testing at baseline, but not at follow-up, neither their demographic variables nor their functional scores at baseline differed significantly from those of patients who completed the study. Also, the nine patients who dropped out were not included in the final analyses. For these reasons, we believe that the patients who dropped out of the study did not affect the outcome of the study. From a clinical standpoint, patients undergoing THA or TKA tend to be elderly, have other medical conditions, and have transportation and mobility issues which may contribute to their dropping out. Previous investigators have reported similar proportions of drop-outs during the post-operative rehabilitation phases.<sup><xref rid="bibr16-2050312115570769" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="bibr17-2050312115570769" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="bibr36-2050312115570769" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="bibr43-2050312115570769" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="bibr46-2050312115570769" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup></p><p>Several limitations of this study need to be recognized. Participants in the study comprised a sample of convenience that was referred to home-based, outpatient physical therapy within a limited geographical area. Furthermore, all patients had been advised by their physician to weight-bear as tolerated on the operated limb; nonweight-bearing or partial weight-bearing patients were excluded. The assessor was not blinded to the patients&#x02019; exercise group assignment during assessment at follow-up, and the assessments at follow-up were carried out in a laboratory setting as opposed to the patient&#x02019;s home setting at baseline. Although assessments were done by two different assessors at baseline and by one at follow-up, interrater reliability of outcome measures was not evaluated before completing the assessments. The total duration for home exercise program for patients in the typical plus balance exercise group was slightly longer than those in the typical exercise group to accommodate the additional balance exercises. In addition, this study examined the effectiveness of balance exercises after a relatively short-term intervention of 5&#x02009;weeks in the acute post-operative phase following THA or TKA. Pre-surgical and longer term (12&#x02013;24&#x02009;weeks post-surgery) assessments were not completed. The involvement of the hip and knee joint proprioception in maintaining balance in patients was not the object and so not assessed in this study.</p><p>In conclusion, this study suggests that balance exercises in addition to typical joint ROM and muscle strengthening exercises in the acute post-operative phase following THA or TKA can result in significantly greater improvements in balance with a 5-week intervention period, compared to a typical post-operative physical therapy program alone. In clinical situations where the therapist considers improvement in balance to be important, balance exercises such as those used in this study may provide a practical means to rapidly improve balance.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank all participants who took part in the study.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Declaration of conflicting interests:</bold> The authors report no conflict of interest.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding:</bold> This research received no specific grant from any funding agency in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Study Registration:</bold> ClinicalTrials.gov Protocol Registration System; ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT01555307; Protocol ID: R-06-461.</p></fn></fn-group><app-group><app><title>Appendix</title><table-wrap id="table4-2050312115570769" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><label>Appendix 1.</label><caption><p>Rehabilitation program (duration: 10 repetitions, 3 times a day).</p></caption><alternatives><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Typical exercises for THA</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Typical exercises for TKA</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Balance exercises for THA and TKA</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.&#x02003;Assisted knee flexion with a strap in lying<break/>2.&#x02003;Knee extension on a towel roll in lying<break/>3.&#x02003;Isometric quadriceps in lying<break/>4.&#x02003;Hip abduction in standing with holding a stable support<break/>5.&#x02003;Hip extension in standing with holding a stable support<break/>6.&#x02003;Hip flexion in standing with holding a stable support<break/>7.&#x02003;Knee flexion in standing with holding a stable support</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.&#x02003;Assisted knee flexion with a strap in lying<break/>2.&#x02003;Knee extension on a towel roll in lying<break/>3.&#x02003;Knee flexion by sliding foot on bed in lying<break/>4.&#x02003;Straight leg raises in lying<break/>5.&#x02003;Assisted knee extension with strap around the foot in lying<break/>6.&#x02003;Knee extension in sitting<break/>7.&#x02003;Knee flexion by sliding foot on the floor in sitting</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.&#x02003;Rotate trunk clockwise and then in anti-clockwise direction in standing without support<break/>2.&#x02003;Lunge in walk standing position without support and then repeat with the other leg forward<break/>3.&#x02003;Shift weight to one side in a stride standing position without support and then repeat on the other side</td></tr></tbody></table><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_2050312115570769-table4"/></alternatives><table-wrap-foot><fn id="table-fn8-2050312115570769"><p>THA: total hip arthroplasty; TKA: total knee arthroplasty.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></app></app-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bibr1-2050312115570769"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
