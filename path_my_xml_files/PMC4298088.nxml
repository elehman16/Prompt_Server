Exclusion criteria included difficult airway such as mouth opening restriction and any contraindication for the use of SGDs (eg, morbid obesity (body mass index, &#x0003e;35), gastro-oesophageal reflux and previous upper abdominal surgery) or a recent history (within 7&#x02005;days) of upper respiratory tract infection.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p><p>Routine monitoring of blood pressure, heart rate, ECG, percutaneous oxygen saturation and end-tidal carbon dioxide tension was performed. Without any premedication, propofol 1&#x02013;2&#x02005;mg/kg and fentanyl 1.0&#x02013;2.0&#x02005;&#x003bc;g/g were administered to patients. Doses of sedatives and analgesics were limited so as to maintain spontaneous ventilation to a certain extent. In case of loss of respiratory arrest, the anaesthesiologist performed mask ventilation until the recovery of spontaneous ventilation. The i-gel was warmed to 42&#x000b0;C in a heating cabinet with an automatic temperature control for 30&#x02005;min before use in the W group. The time from i-gel delivery from the heating cabinet to insertion into the mouth is approximately 30&#x02013;60&#x02005;s. The approximate temperature of the i-gel was 37&#x02013;39&#x000b0;C at the time of insertion, which was measured in the preliminary study. On the basis of this preliminary study, we decided the prewarming to 42&#x000b0;C.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> For the C group, i-gel was stored at room temperature (approximately 23&#x000b0;C). A thermometer was used to measure the temperature of the heating cabinet directly. The decision of whether to use a size 3 or 4 i-gel was based on the patient's body weight, as per the manufacturer's instructions. The anaesthesiologist made size determinations for patients weighing 50&#x02013;60&#x02005;kg (ie, between sizes 3 and 4). Sealing pressure was measured after insertion of i-gel with the indicator attached to the anaesthesia machine. Successful insertion was confirmed by bilateral chest wall movement, auscultation and normal capnograms; a sealing pressure of &#x0003e;15&#x02005;cm&#x02005;H<sub>2</sub>O was considered a successful insertion. In case of failed ventilation, an insertion trial was immediately performed, and the number of insertion attempts was recorded. However, if the third attempt failed, the trial was recorded as a failure, and airway management with the LMA-ProSeal was performed. Sealing pressure was compared in successful cases between the W and C groups.</p><p>Following successful ventilation, anaesthesia was maintained with inhalation of sevoflurane and 33&#x02013;40% nitrous oxide in oxygen in order to maintain spontaneous ventilation. Patients were extubated postoperatively, and hoarseness and pharyngeal pain after arousal were assessed by non-blinded anaesthesiologists.</p><p>Statistical analysis was performed with JMP 11 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, North Carolina, USA). The &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test and Mann-Whitney U test were used for data pertaining to patient characteristics. The &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test was used for the number of insertion attempts and hoarseness and pharyngeal pain incidents. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare sealing pressure. Data are presented as mean&#x000b1;SD with 95% CIs. p Value &#x0003c;0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p><p>With respect to sample size, the incidence of successful i-gel insertions (sealing pressure &#x0003e;15&#x02005;cm&#x02005;H<sub>2</sub>O on first insertion) in a non-warming preliminary trial in the previous study with muscle relaxation was approximately 50%. As such, we hypothesised that prewarming i-gel would increase the successful insertion rate to 80%.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> To detect this difference with 80% power at a 5% significance level, 36 patients would be necessary in each group.

A higher sealing pressure is an indicator of how well a device might perform during controlled ventilation. Moreover, the i-gel has already been shown to exhibit better airway-sealing pressure than conventional SGDs.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></p><p>Previous reports have suggested that the thermoplastic nature of the material from which the i-gel cuff is manufactured may conform to the laryngeal anatomy as it approaches body temperature.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> The sealing pressure of i-gel is suggested to improve over time, which might be due to the thermoplastic property of the cuff which may form a more efficient seal around the larynx after warming to body temperature.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> These reports noted that the sealing pressure appeared to improve over time, suggesting that the i-gel formed a more efficient seal around the larynx after warming to body temperature. In a previous study which used muscle relaxants, the sealing pressure was higher and leak volume smaller after prewarming the i-gel to 42&#x000b0;C.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>The hypothesis tested in this study was that prewarming of i-gel to 42&#x000b0;C would enable the cuff to fit the pharyngeal structure more quickly than if it was stored at room temperature in both non-paralysed, sedated patients. However, we found that the warmed i-gel did not significantly increase successful airway management with a high sealing pressure, in the absence of muscle relaxants. One possible reason is the administration of muscle relaxants which may be attributed to changes in the pharyngeal space.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Since muscle relaxants reduce the pharyngeal space and occasionally collapse the upper airway, the fit of the i-gel might be partially augmented by muscle relaxation.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> It may be worth evaluating the effects of muscle relaxants on the insertion success rate and sealing pressure of i-gel in a future study.</p><p>SGDs are suited for difficult airway management, especially in a &#x02018;cannot intubate, cannot ventilate&#x02019; situation.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Furthermore, SGDs are used in emergent airway management during resuscitation or emergent respiratory suppression.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> For example, the sedation guidelines of the American Society of Anesthesiologists indicate that SGDs are useful for airway rescue in oversedated patients.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Furthermore, airway management is considered as an essential element of both in-hospital and out-of-hospital cadiopulmonary resuscitation. Tracheal intubation is the most widely used method for airway management, but is considered difficult for occasional users.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> The AHA-ACLS guidelines emphasise continuous chest compression, and avoiding interruptions as much as possible, even for airway management.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> However, the guidelines do not recommend tracheal intubation for all rescuers, but rather suggest SGDs as alternatives.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> In emergent situations, such as oversedation or resuscitation, patients are not paralysed by muscle relaxants. Our data suggest that prewarming of i-gel is not needed for emergent airway management for non-paralysed patients.</p><p>This study has several limitations. First, we performed the power analysis based on a previous study with a muscle relaxant. Power analysis based on without muscle relaxation may provide more practical number. The study may be underpowered as the power analysis was based on a previous study using a muscle relaxant, and the fit of the i-gel might be partially augmented by muscle relaxation. Also, the number of additional cases for missing cases may be relatively small. Second, sealing pressure was measured only once immediately after insertion and sealing may have improved over time. Subsequent sealing pressure monitoring may clarify the effect of i-gel prewarming. Third, as this study was conducted at a single institute, a multicentre study or a meta-analysis would clarify the utility of prewarming of i-gel. Fourth, we did not fix the dose of anaesthetic drugs which may yield a non-blinded bias.</p><p>In conclusion, we found that the prewarmed i-gel did not provide a higher success rate for insertion or higher sealing pressure in non-paralysed, sedated patients who were not treated with muscle relaxants, as compared with i-gel kept at room temperature.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e162" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2014-006653.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e163" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2014-006653.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> NK designed the study, analysed the data and wrote the manuscript.
