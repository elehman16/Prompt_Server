Approximately 50% of individuals withdraw from an exercise program within the first 6 mo of initiation, citing lack of time as a main influence. Time efficient exercise such as high intensity interval training (HIIT) may provide an alternative to moderate intensity continuous exercise (MICT) to elicit substantial health benefits. This study examined differences in enjoyment, affect, and perceived exertion between MICT and HIIT. Twelve recreationally active men and women (age = 29.5 &#x000b1; 10.7 yr, VO<sub>2</sub>max = 41.4 &#x000b1; 4.1 mL/kg/min, BMI = 23.1 &#x000b1; 2.1 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) initially performed a VO<sub>2</sub>max test on a cycle ergometer to determine appropriate workloads for subsequent exercise bouts. Each subject returned for two additional exercise trials, performing either HIIT (eight 1 min bouts of cycling at 85% maximal workload (Wmax) with 1 min of active recovery between bouts) or MICT (20 min of cycling at 45% Wmax) in randomized order. During exercise, rating of perceived exertion (RPE), affect, and blood lactate concentration (BLa) were measured. Additionally, the Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale (PACES) was completed after exercise. Results showed higher enjoyment (p = 0.013) in response to HIIT (103.8 &#x000b1; 9.4) versus MICT (84.2 &#x000b1; 19.1). Eleven of 12 participants (92%) preferred HIIT to MICT. However, affect was lower (p&#x0003c;0.05) and HR, RPE, and BLa were higher (p&#x0003c;0.05) in HIIT versus MICT. Although HIIT is more physically demanding than MICT, individuals report greater enjoyment due to its time efficiency and constantly changing stimulus.</p><p><bold><italic>Trial Registration</italic>:</bold>

However, in the United States, only approximately 20% of adults meet this recommendation [<xref rid="pone.0166299.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The greatest barrier to regular physical activity is lack of time ([<xref rid="pone.0166299.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0166299.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], which questions the practicality of MICT in the overall adult population considering its relatively large time commitment. High intensity-interval training (HIIT) consisting of repeated, intense exercise bouts separated by passive or active recovery has been widely studied in the last decade ([<xref rid="pone.0166299.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Data show that compared to MICT, 6 wk of HIIT in the form of repeated Wingate tests elicits similar improvements in maximal oxygen uptake (VO<sub>2</sub>max) and mitochondrial function [<xref rid="pone.0166299.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In addition, some studies show significantly greater improvements in VO<sub>2</sub>max in response to HIIT compared to MICT [<xref rid="pone.0166299.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>While HIIT may require less time compared to MICT, the shortness of breath, leg pain, and dramatic fatigue usually experienced during HIIT may make this modality less tolerable in certain populations. The Dual-Mode theory [<xref rid="pone.0166299.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] demonstrates that at intensities below the ventilatory threshold (VT), affect as measured with the Feeling Scale [<xref rid="pone.0166299.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] is positive, suggesting that exercise at this intensity is pleasurable and long-term may promote exercise adherence [<xref rid="pone.0166299.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, at supra-VT work rates which are characteristic of HIIT, affect becomes less positive due to onset of interoceptive cues and greater contribution of anaerobic metabolism to ATP supply [<xref rid="pone.0166299.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. This may ultimately reduce exercisers&#x02019; willingness to partake in more intense exercise, which is important for designing proper exercise prescription especially when more intense exercise may elicit superior improvements in VO<sub>2</sub>max [<xref rid="pone.0166299.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>A few studies have compared perceptions of affect and/or enjoyment in response to acute bouts of HIIT versus MICT. Bartlett et al. [<xref rid="pone.0166299.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] reported that running-based HIIT led to greater perceived enjoyment compared to MICT in active men. When average intensity was matched between HIIT and MICT (intensity equal to 85% respiratory compensation point), young healthy men reported higher RPE and fatigue, lower affect, but similar enjoyment in response to HIIT versus MICT [<xref rid="pone.0166299.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In untrained adults, HIIT was reported to be less pleasurable than MICT [<xref rid="pone.0166299.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], but more than 50% of participants reported that they preferred it. In addition, HIIT was viewed as more enjoyable than vigorous exercise yet no differences in enjoyment were seen compared to MICT. In obese young women, Kong et al. [<xref rid="pone.0166299.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] reported that enjoyment was significantly higher during each week of a 5 wk HIIT regimen (repeated 8 s &#x0201c;all-out&#x0201d; sprints separated by 12 s passive recovery) compared to MICT (40 min at 60&#x02013;80%VO<sub>2</sub>max).</p><p>Despite empirical evidence showing significant adaptations and potentially higher enjoyment in response to HIIT compared to MICT, acceptance of high intensity interval training is not universal. Recently, Hardcastle et al. [<xref rid="pone.0166299.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] criticized the practicality of one paradigm of HIIT, sprint interval training (SIT) characterized by repeated Wingate tests, which has been used to improve VO<sub>2</sub>max and other health outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0166299.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0166299.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Hardcastle et al. [<xref rid="pone.0166299.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] assert that SIT is too physically demanding for a largely sedentary population, and that low levels of enjoyment and affect elicited by the intense nature of SIT may discourage exercise adherence and motivation. However, the current study and related investigations ([<xref rid="pone.0166299.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0166299.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] incorporated HIIT which has a lower metabolic perturbation than SIT. Despite significant physiological differences between these modes of interval training, findings from recent studies showed similar enjoyment between two regimes of HIIT [<xref rid="pone.0166299.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and similar affect between HIIT and SIT [<xref rid="pone.0166299.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>Due to these equivocal results, it remains to be determined whether HIIT is a more enjoyable and preferable modality of exercise compared to MICT. This line of inquiry is necessary to identify effective, time-efficient, and enjoyable modes of exercise to impact fitness and overall health status in various populations.</p><p>The aim of this study was to examine differences in enjoyment, perceived exertion, and affect between MICT and HIT in recreationally active individuals. It was hypothesized that HIIT will be perceived as more enjoyable compared to MICT, although lower affect and higher RPE were anticipated in response to HIIT.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>Prior to providing written informed consent, all participants filled out a health-history questionnaire to ensure that they met all inclusion criteria, and all procedures were approved by the CSU&#x02014;San Marcos Institutional Review Board (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0166299.s002">S1 protocol</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Design</title><p>This repeated measures, within-subjects study required all participants to complete three sessions of exercise in a climate-controlled laboratory (temperature and relative humidity equal to 19&#x02013;22&#x000b0;C and 40&#x02013;60%, respectively). Initially, VO<sub>2</sub>max was assessed on a cycle ergometer during progressive exercise to exhaustion.

They were asked to respond to each scale in terms of how they felt at that moment.</p><p>After a 5 min cool-down, subjects were seated for 5 min and subsequently completed the Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale (PACES) [<xref rid="pone.0166299.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The 10 min period between the cessation of exercise and completion of PACES was necessary to ensure focus by mitigating effects of residual fatigue on participants&#x02019; score. This scale was used to assess level of enjoyment of HIIT and MICT using participant responses to 18 questions scored on a 1&#x02013;7 Likert scale. After completion of both trials, participants were asked which modality of exercise they ultimately preferred (HIIT or MICT).</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Assessment of Blood Lactate Concentration and Heart Rate</title><p>Blood lactate concentration (BLa) was recorded during MICT and HIIT at the following intervals: before the warm-up, at 25% and 75% of exercise completion, and 3 min post-exercise. During HIIT, blood was sampled immediately after the completion of training bouts 2 and 6. Blood samples were acquired with a portable analyzer (Lactate Plus, Nova Biomedical, Waltham, Massachusetts) and fingerstick lancets (Unistix 3 Comfort, Owen Mumford, Marietta, GA).

If a significant F ratio was obtained, Tukey&#x02019;s post hoc test was used to identify significant differences between means. A paired t-test was used to determine significant differences in enjoyment between exercise modalities.

According to Burgomaster et al. [<xref rid="pone.0166299.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], interval training has been shown to elicit comparable physiological adaptations to endurance training, despite a much lower training volume and time commitment. Although a lower time commitment of exercise may have the potential to increase exercise adherence, the extent to which individuals enjoy HIIT remains unclear. This study examined differences in enjoyment in response to cycling-based HIIT compared to MICT. Our data showed greater enjoyment of HIIT compared to MICT despite higher metabolic stress in the form of significantly higher RPE, HR, and BLa.</p><p>Unlike previous studies in this area [<xref rid="pone.0166299.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0166299.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0166299.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], we examined differences in BLa between MICT and HIIT. Our data show significant increases in BLa for both exercise regimes, although values were significantly higher in HIIT compared to MICT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0166299.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). This partially supports the less positive affect exhibited throughout and at cessation of HIIT versus MICT, which is explained by the Dual-Mode Theory [<xref rid="pone.0166299.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. It is apparent [<xref rid="pone.0166299.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] that affect begins to decline with increasing reliance on anaerobic metabolism which would be more substantial at intensities equal to 85%Wmax versus 45%Wmax as performed in MICT.</p><p>Yet despite this more aversive response consequent with HIIT, enjoyment as measured with the PACES scale was significantly higher compared to higher-volume MICT. Three potential factors explain this response. First, the intermittent nature of HIIT provides participants with multiple recovery intervals which may provide a &#x0201c;break&#x0201d; from less positive affective responses [<xref rid="pone.0166299.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] which are seen with continuous exercise at supra-VT intensities. Second, many participants viewed MICT as quite monotonous and did not enjoy maintaining a moderate effort for 20 min. In contrast, HIIT provides an ever changing stimulus that breaks the entire session up into small increments of work interspersed with recovery. Third, there is a certain level of accomplishment that is experienced during HIIT which is not apparent in MICT [<xref rid="pone.0166299.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Overall, this may give the exerciser a greater amount of self-confidence and may explain why 92% of participants preferred HIIT to MICT.</p><p>Various methodological differences inherent in previous studies need to be considered when trying to compare findings across studies. In the Bartlett et al. study [<xref rid="pone.0166299.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], participants were highly-fit men with a VO<sub>2</sub>max equal to 57 mL/kg/min who completed a 50 min session of MICT at 70%VO<sub>2</sub>max or HIIT consisting of six 3 min intervals at 90%VO<sub>2</sub>max. Work and average intensity were matched across bouts. Enjoyment as measured with PACES was higher by approximately 25 units in response to HIIT compared to MICT. However, these findings are not unexpected considering that this sample of participants likely has a history of positive responses to intense exercise participation. In a subsequent study in 15 young men (VO<sub>2</sub>max = 47.9 mL/kg/min) [<xref rid="pone.0166299.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], repeated 2 min intervals at 100%VO<sub>2</sub>max led to less positive affect and greater fatigue versus MICT consisting of 24 min of cycling at 72%VO<sub>2</sub>max, although enjoyment was similar. In the Jung et al. study [<xref rid="pone.0166299.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], 44 inactive men and women (VO<sub>2</sub>max = 36 mL/kg/min) performed in randomized order HIIT consisting of 1 min bouts at 100%Wpeak, and moderate (40 min at 40%Wpeak) and vigorous MICT (20 min at 80%Wpeak). Despite a less positive affect reported in HIIT versus moderate MICT, participants exhibited similar task self-efficacy and greater enjoyment versus vigorous exercise (p = 0.01) and MICT (p = 0.08). An examination of these data and ours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0166299.g001">Fig 1D</xref>) suggests some interesting trends. Lower intensity HIIT (~78%Wpeak) as performed in a previous study [<xref rid="pone.0166299.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] elicits more positive affect values during exercise equal to 2.0 (between fairly good and good) compared to HIIT used in the present study (85%Wpeak) and that of Jung et al. (100%Wpeak) [<xref rid="pone.0166299.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], in which affect reached a nadir to values near 0 (neutral). When HIIT bouts are sustained for up to 2 min at 100%VO<sub>2</sub>max [<xref rid="pone.0166299.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], affect declined to values of approximately -2.5 (bad). Although speculative, this suggests an inverse association between the specific work rate employed in HIIT and the affectual response to exercise.</p><p>A recent study [<xref rid="pone.0166299.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] showed similar affect in response to a single bout of sprint interval training (SIT) with a 1:3 ratio of work to recovery compared to HIIT with a 1:1 ratio, although BLa and RPE were higher in response to SIT. Nevertheless, enjoyment was not assessed in this study. Similarly, there was no difference in enjoyment between dissimilar HIIT regimes (16 X 1 min at 90&#x02013;95%HRpeak versus 4 X 4 min at 90&#x02013;95%HRpeak) in young men [<xref rid="pone.0166299.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. As intensities of HIIT can widely vary from as low as 60%Wmax [<xref rid="pone.0166299.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] to 300%Wmax [<xref rid="pone.0166299.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], there is a potential for differences in physiological and perceptual responses across this continuum. Future studies should explore the optimum intensity and/or work:recovery interval enhancing levels of enjoyment and affect in HIIT compared to MICT, considering that in-task affect is related to intentions to exercise [<xref rid="pone.0166299.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In addition, a few studies have examined changes in enjoyment during chronic administration of HIIT. In young, healthy obese men and women [<xref rid="pone.0166299.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], enjoyment significantly increased during training, and in another study [<xref rid="pone.0166299.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], enjoyment was consistently higher throughout 5 wk of HIIT versus MICT despite it being at a higher intensity (80%VO<sub>2</sub>peak vs. 71%VO<sub>2</sub>peak). These findings, albeit preliminary, show that chronic HIIT is viewed as more enjoyable than MICT and emphasize the potential of this exercise paradigm in young, overweight-to-obese individuals.</p><p>The structure of HIIT in the present study followed a 1:1 ratio of work to recovery. This ratio was also used in sedentary adults [<xref rid="pone.0166299.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0166299.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and in overweight to obese inactive adults [<xref rid="pone.0166299.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In contrast, a 2:1 ratio was used in the study by Oliveira et al. [<xref rid="pone.0166299.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] in which many participants could not complete the interval protocol, which may have led to greater fatigue compared to MICT. Martinez et al. [<xref rid="pone.0166299.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] revealed that interval exercise can be pleasurable even in sedentary individuals. In this study, 20 insufficiently active (BMI = 25&#x02013;35 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) individuals completed a trial of heavy continuous exercise (20 min at 50%Wmax) and three bouts of HIIT: 30s work/30s rest, 60s work/60s rest, and 120s work/120s rest. Interval sessions were 24 min in duration and were completed at an intensity equal to 60% of the difference between anaerobic threshold and VO<sub>2</sub>max, which was equivalent to 78%Wmax. Affect and enjoyment were assessed during and after exercise. Greater enjoyment and affect (p&#x0003c;0.05) were reported for 30 and 60 s HIIT bouts compared to the 120 s duration and continuous exercise, which were seen as significantly more aversive. These findings suggest that interval duration &#x02264; 60 s and having a 1:1 ratio of work:recovery may be optimal for increasing perceptual responses to exercise and potentially long-term adherence to this modality of training.</p><p>Limitations of the current study included a relatively small sample consisting of habitually active men and women varying in age and gender. Despite this small and heterogeneous sample, differences in outcome measures were highly significant between regimes. In addition, the inclusion of both genders, which was not done in previous studies [<xref rid="pone.0166299.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0166299.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], broadens our findings to a more diverse population. Similar to our results, Jung et al. [<xref rid="pone.0166299.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and Martinez et al. [<xref rid="pone.0166299.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] also showed significantly higher enjoyment in response to HIIT compared to MICT in a large sample of men and women, which would suggest that men and women consistently report higher enjoyment of HIIT. However, their participants were inactive and those in the current study were habitual exercisers, which suggests that fitness level may not significantly alter enjoyment responses to low-volume HIIT. Nevertheless, individual differences in affective responses exist [<xref rid="pone.0166299.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], so further study is merited to examine if differences in gender and fitness level mediate the enjoyment response to various intensities of exercise including HIIT. It remains to be determined to what extent perceptual responses such as higher enjoyment and lower affect in HIIT are influenced by the timing of inquiry. It is possible that a greater sense of accomplishment is realized after rather than during HIIT, altering perceptions of enjoyment and mood. The entire HIIT session performed in the present study was 4 min shorter in duration than MICT, making it more time efficient. In addition, the unequal disparity of male and female participants does not allow us to consider a potential role of gender on these responses, as done in a previous study [<xref rid="pone.0166299.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Although enjoyment responses to a single bout of HIIT may be predictive of attitudes towards chronic exercise participation in this modality, little research [<xref rid="pone.0166299.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0166299.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] exists examining if enjoyment is modified long-term. Lastly, sprint interval training [<xref rid="pone.0166299.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0166299.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] is a widely used and more intense approach to HIIT whose completion improves various health outcomes; however, it was not completed in the present study. Consequently, additional research is merited to examine if this modality elicits different perceptions of enjoyment compared to MICT or HIIT.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec015"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Data reveal that HIIT requiring a shorter time commitment than MICT led to greater enjoyment in a small sample of active men and women. Despite greater metabolic stress, over 90% of participants preferred HIIT versus MICT. These findings may support increasing integration of HIIT into the regular exercise routine of healthy, active individuals. Further study in larger heterogeneous populations should attempt to substantiate our findings and investigate if the greater enjoyment in response to low-volume HIIT compared to MICT is also revealed at all intensities above VT as well as when work:recovery interval is manipulated.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec016"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0166299.s001"><label>S1 Checklist</label><caption><title>STROBE checklist.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0166299.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0166299.s002"><label>S1 Protocol</label><caption><title>IRB protocol.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0166299.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank the participants for their effort in completion of this study as well as David Ertley and Brandon Avery for assistance with data collection.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0166299.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Garber</surname><given-names>CE</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Blissmer</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Deschenes</surname><given-names>MR</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Franklin</surname><given-names>BA</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Lamonte</surname><given-names>MJ</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>IM</given-names></name>, <etal>et al</etal>
