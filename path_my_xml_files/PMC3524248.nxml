Co-administration of single inhaled doses of umeclidinium and vilanterol to healthy Japanese subjects was well tolerated and not associated with meaningful changes in systemic exposure or PD effects compared with administration of either compound individually. Pharmacokinetic assessments showed rapid absorption for both drugs (Tmax&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;5 min for both umeclidinium and vilanterol) followed by rapid elimination with median tlast of 4&#x02013;5 h for umeclidinium and median tlast of 1.5&#x02013;2.0 h for vilanterol. Assessments of pharmacokinetic interaction were inconclusive since for umeclidinium, Cmax following combination was higher than umeclidinium alone but not AUC whereas for vilanterol, AUC following combination was higher than vilanterol alone but not Cmax.

The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0050716.s001">Checklist S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0050716.s002">Protocol S1</xref>. Patients and investigators were blinded to treatment assignment and the treatments were indistinguishable. Sixteen subjects (not pre-screened for bronchodilator responsiveness) received single inhaled doses of the following treatments: (1) Placebo and placebo; (2) umeclidinium 500 &#x000b5;g and placebo; (3) vilanterol 50 &#x000b5;g and placebo; (4) umeclidinium 500 &#x000b5;g and vilanterol 50 &#x000b5;g via separate NDPI over four treatment periods, each separated by a &#x02265;7 day wash-out. The treatment order was determined by the randomization schedule. The randomization schedule was generated by GlaxoSmithKline Discovery Biometrics using validated internal software (RandALL). Subjects were assigned to one of the four treatment sequences which were based on a Williams Design <xref rid="pone.0050716-Williams1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> in accordance with the randomization schedule, prior to the start of the study. Primary endpoint was safety and tolerability, specifically adverse events (AEs), vital signs (heart rate [HR], blood pressure, electrocardiogram (ECG), 24 h Holter monitoring and clinical laboratory assessments. PD endpoints included blood potassium and HR. Secondary endpoints were plasma concentrations of umeclidinium and vilanterol and derived PK parameters. Lung function assessment by spirometry (FEV<sub>1</sub>) was exploratory.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Subjects</title><p>Healthy non-smoking Japanese male volunteers (20&#x02013;65 years of age) were enrolled.

The maximum of three individual readings of FEV<sub>1</sub> data at serial time points (0&#x02013;24 h post dose) was analyzed using a mixed effects model. Repeated measures analysis was carried out using subject by period as a blocking effect.

This single dose study assessed the safety and tolerability, PD and PK of umeclidinium and vilanterol as monotherapies and in combination. The study was conducted in male subjects of Japanese heritage.</p><p>Single inhaled doses of umeclidinium 500 &#x000b5;g, vilanterol 50 &#x000b5;g and the combination were safe and well tolerated. There were no deaths or SAEs reported. A total of 13 AEs were reported by 8 subjects (50%) and all AEs were of mild intensity. There were no clinically significant or relevant changes in vital signs, hematology, and clinical chemistries that were attributed to the study drug. There were also no clinically significant 12-lead ECG or 24 h Holter ECG abnormalities observed during the study following dosing of study medication. No significant episodes of arrhythmia were observed. There were some minor elevations in HR and ECG parameters that were not considered of potential clinical importance.</p><p>&#x003b2; agonists are known to contribute to a lowering of blood potassium levels <xref rid="pone.0050716-Salpeter1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050716-Sovani1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. PD analysis of blood potassium parameters showed small decreases in minimum and weighted mean blood potassium levels over the 4 h period for all treatment comparisons except for umeclidinium compared with placebo where there was an increase of 0.10 mmol/L. This increase may have influenced the larger decrease of the umeclidinium/vilanterol compared with umeclidinium treatment which was the only treatment comparison decrease for which the 95% CI did not cross 0.0.</p><p>Increases in FEV<sub>1</sub> following bronchodilator inhalation has been demonstrated in healthy non smoking adult subjects <xref rid="pone.0050716-Kainu1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050716-Albert1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. The FEV<sub>1</sub> exploratory analysis in our study revealed a slightly higher adjusted mean FEV<sub>1</sub> for all active treatments compared to placebo, with the highest increase in FEV<sub>1</sub> being the umeclidinium and vilanterol concurrent administration at 6 h.</p><p>The concurrent administration of umeclidinium and vilanterol resulted in a 30% higher umeclidinium Cmax than umeclidinium alone although the treatment ratio for AUC parameters, with the exception of AUC<sub>(0&#x02013;0.25)</sub>, showed no difference. It is important to note that no trends were observed between individual change from baseline maximum for supine HR and umeclidinium Cmax when delivered as umeclidinium vilanterol administered concurrently or when delivered as umeclidinium alone.</p><p>There was no difference in vilanterol Cmax when delivered as umeclidinium and vilanterol administered concurrently compared with vilanterol alone and no trends were observed between individual change from baseline maximum for supine HR and vilanterol Cmax when delivered as umeclidinium and vilanterol administered concurrently or vilanterol alone. AUC parameters indicated that the concurrent administration of umeclidinium and vilanterol resulted in an up to 39% higher systemic exposure to vilanterol when compared to vilanterol alone.</p><p>The factors contributing to the approximately 30% higher umeclidinium Cmax and 39% higher vilanterol AUC when administered concurrently in this single dose study have not been clearly identified. However, a potentially important aspect of the study conduct was that within a treatment period the order of dosing using the 2 separate inhalers was not pre-defined. There was also a formulation difference in treatments due to increased magnesium stearate exposure using two separate inhalers for the concurrent administration compared with umeclidinium and vilanterol alone. Regardless of the factors contributing to the increased exposure, the results of a repeat dose combination study (GlaxoSmithKline protocol: DB2113950; Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT01128634) indicated that when administered simultaneously in a single inhaler device, vilanterol did not have an effect on systemic exposure of umeclidinium following single or repeat doses (R. Mehta et al., unpublished data). Thus concerns of a potential PK interaction have not been substantiated and the observations of increased exposure of umeclidinium Cmax and vilanterol AUC from the combination reported in this study are not considered clinically meaningful.</p><p>With regard to study limitations, the sample size of the study population was small. Although the study aimed to recruit 16 subjects and have a minimum of 12 subjects complete the study, a larger population would have allowed for additional analysis and statistical determinations.</p><p>In conclusion, administration of single inhaled doses of umeclidinium (500 &#x000b5;g) alone, vilanterol (50 &#x000b5;g) alone and administered concurrently to healthy Japanese male subjects was safe and well tolerated and not associated with meaningful changes in systemic exposure or PD effects compared with administration of either compound alone.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0050716.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>
