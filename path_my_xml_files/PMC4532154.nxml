People with very severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have a well-recognised burden of disabling physical symptoms, compounded by co-morbidity, psychological distress and social isolation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3 bib4 bib5">3&#x02013;5</xref></sup> although they rarely have access to co-ordinated supportive care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref></sup></p><p>The current approach, predicated on an ability to recognise a terminal phase,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref></sup> has been challenged in the context of COPD,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref></sup> in which prognostication for individuals is unpredictable.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref></sup> In addition, qualitative data suggest that a &#x02018;point of transition&#x02019; to palliative care is meaningless in a life-long condition characterised by a fluctuating, unpredictable decline.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref></sup> This is compounded by a tendency for people with COPD to be &#x02018;silent&#x02019; about their physical and social disabilities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref></sup> Recognising trigger events may be a strategy to overcome these professional and patient barriers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref></sup> Analogous to &#x02018;red flags&#x02019; in the context of diagnosis, triggers are events (such as hospital admissions) in the life of the disease that are meaningful to patients as signifying deterioration in their condition, and visible to health and/or social care professionals so that they can trigger holistic assessment of needs. Palliation of symptoms and supportive care can then be intensified without the requirement to identify end-stage disease.</p><p>Through a programme of work,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref></sup> we developed a novel intervention, HELPing older people with very severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (HELP-COPD), involving a proactive holistic assessment of physical, psychological, social and spiritual needs delivered by a specialist respiratory nurse shortly after an admission with an exacerbation of COPD. Our pilot trial used quantitative and qualitative methods to assess feasibility, acceptability and potential impact of the HELP-COPD intervention and to test the trial procedures.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>This 6-month feasibility pilot was conducted during 2012/13 with ethical approval from South East Scotland Research Ethics Committee (Ref:12/SS/0016) and governance approval from NHS Lothian (No:2012/R/RES/02).</p><sec><title>Participants and recruitment</title><p>People registered with Lothian general practices admitted to Edinburgh Royal Infirmary or St John&#x02019;s Hospital, Livingstone with a primary diagnosis of exacerbation of COPD were eligible. We excluded people with other significant lung disease, those unable to give informed consent (e.g., because of severe dementia) or to complete questionnaires in English. The trial respiratory nurse (SF) liaised with the ward staff to identify potentially eligible patients whom she approached with information about the study and obtained written informed consent.</p></sec><sec><title>Questionnaires</title><p>We assessed the feasibility in this group of patients of using a range of validated questionnaires to assess outcomes.

A checklist of agreed actions was recorded prominently on the HELP-COPD record to facilitate implementation, and referrals made through the usual channels.</p><p>The completed one-page record was retained by the patient, with copies for the primary and secondary care records.

The aim was to explore perceptions of the benefits (or otherwise) of the intervention. The topic guide (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="xob1">Supplementary Information</xref>) was informed by the constructs of the Normalisation Process Theory (NPT),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref></sup> (summarised in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) and refined iteratively as themes emerged.

At the end of the study, the trial team (HP, MK, SB, SF and Cristina Matthews) used the online NPT toolkit<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref></sup> to aid understanding of the experience of using HELP-COPD as reflected in our data.</p></sec><sec><title>Interpretation and synthesis of qualitative and quantitative data</title><p>Members of the team (MK, SB, SF and Cristina Matthews) met on multiple occasions to construct in-depth case studies of participants for whom we had quantitative, qualitative and documentary data, as well as field notes from the researchers and respiratory nurse. For each individual, we noted any &#x02018;unmet&#x02019; needs, &#x02018;recently met&#x02019; needs (e.g., referrals made during discharge planning), evidence of any impact (or not) of the HELP-COPD intervention and noted any relevant context that may have affected the outcome. Individual cases were then compared and contrasted to aid understanding of the feasibility and impact of the intervention.</p><p>As findings emerged, we arranged discussions with the NHS Lothian Respiratory Managed Clinical Network (Managed Clinical Networks are multidisciplinary, cross-sector groups that oversee provision of clinical services throughout Scotland) and palliative care colleagues.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref></sup> Preliminary findings were discussed in a workshop (including grant holders, invited clinicians and researchers), enabling us to site our intervention in the context of existing services.

We had substantial attrition largely owing to ill-health/death. Of the 44 patients who provided consent during their admission, we randomised 32 patients after their baseline assessment 2 weeks post discharge.

<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> (Questions 1&#x02013;6) gives the answers to our questions about the feasibility of the intervention and the implications for future practice. In summary, the HELP-COPD intervention was well received by patients, and the concept resonated with professionals, but we identified fewer actions than anticipated (an average of 1.6 actions/assessment, of which five were referrals: most were provision of information or contact details of support agencies (see <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> for further details)). Key reasons for this were the overlap with existing discharge planning, patients&#x02019; adaptation to their long-term disability and their over-riding preference to retain independence.</p></sec><sec><title>Feasibility of the trial processes</title><p>
<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> (Questions 7&#x02013;14) gives the answers to our questions about the feasibility of the trial processes and the implications for future research.

We achieved data saturation with respect to our key qualitative objective of understanding the feasibility of the intervention.</p><p>Researchers&#x02019; attitudes influence design, data collection and analysis of qualitative studies; discussion with our multidisciplinary professional team and lay advisors ensured a balanced interpretation of the data.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref></sup></p></sec><sec><title>Interpretation of findings in relation to previously published work</title><p>There has been a widespread assumption that supportive care for people with organ failure should be modelled on the successful cancer model,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref></sup> predicated on identifying people who have reached a transition point in their disease trajectory when they would benefit from a supportive care approach.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref></sup> However, qualitative work has questioned the relevance of such a &#x02018;transition&#x02019; in COPD,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref></sup> and has suggested that the concept of &#x02018;triggers&#x02019; might be more appropriate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref></sup> The HELP-COPD initiative used hospital admissions as a trigger, and although this had face validity there were two over-arching reasons why it seemed less successful than we had hoped.</p><p>First, the HELP-COPD intervention, in part, duplicated care already provided as part of discharge planning. Care for physical needs had already been stepped up and assessment undertaken for social support needs. Outstanding actions detected by HELP-COPD were then limited to providing information about local (often voluntary) support agencies.</p><p>Second, offers of help were frequently declined. The HELP-COPD intervention occurred 4 weeks post discharge, at a time when many people felt they were returning to (their) normal,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref></sup> and potentially needing less rather than more help. Recalibration of expectations as a result of adaptation to their slowly progressive disability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref></sup> meant that action was not necessarily wanted despite significant symptoms and social burden. In addition, an over-riding preference to cope independently meant that family help was more acceptable than outside services.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref></sup></p></sec><sec><title>Implications for future research, policy and practice</title><p>Despite adopting an overtly holistic approach with systematic assessment of physical, psychological, social and spiritual needs, HELP-COPD had limited success in identifying actions. The intervention thus requires further developmental work before progressing to a large-scale randomised controlled trial.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref></sup> Future iterations of HELP-COPD should retain the holistic approach, but may seek to integrate brief assessments into the annual reviews of people with symptomatic COPD,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref></sup> thus intervening earlier in the course of the disease. The burden imposed on family carers as patients eschew formal support needs to be considered and addressed.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The HELP-COPD intervention was well received by patients and the concept resonated with professionals, but the holistic assessment delivered 4 weeks after an admission generated few actions apart from provision of information. A more appropriate approach may be to provide holistic care routinely throughout the life-long course of the disease as an integral component of good primary care management of a long-term condition.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors acknowledge the invaluable help of Cristina Matthews, the project administrator, and are grateful for the support of the staff of the respiratory ward at the Royal Infirmary Edinburgh and Dr Donald Noble and Sr Kim Bracher from the respiratory team at St John&#x02019;s Hospital, Livingstone who helped with recruitment.

How acceptable is the intervention?</td><td align="left" valign="top" charoff="50">Patients were generally positive about the assessment, openly discussing concerns and coping strategies in all domains.

In what proportion of patients was an action identified?</td><td align="left" valign="top" charoff="50">Twenty-three patients received the intervention. Overall, 37 action points were noted: an average of 1.6 per assessment. Of these:
Five were referrals (one each to pulmonary rehabilitation, the home oxygen service, carer support, social care direct and a request to the GP).
&#x0000a;
Fifteen were contacts for the patient to follow-up (e.g., social support agencies)
&#x0000a;
Seventeen people were given information about COPD, and local services.
&#x0000a;
</td><td align="left" valign="top" charoff="50">The reasons for fewer actions than anticipated needs to be explored and addressed. Key issues were: overlap with discharge planning, the priority attached to retaining independence and adaptation to long-term disability.</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" charoff="50">

Physical symptoms were discussed in 21 assessments, but only one required action (referral to GP about morphine to relieve breathless)
&#x0000a;
Psychological issues were discussed in 19 assessments, but no actions were generated. Most felt well supported by their family.
&#x0000a;
A range of social issues were discussed in most assessments, but only one referral (for help with social care). Maintaining independence was the priority.
&#x0000a;
Fifteen spoke of pleasure in family life and/or the importance of their faith. Five had put their affairs in order recognising &#x02018;<italic>We all have to die sometime&#x02019;.</italic>
&#x0000a;
</td><td align="left" valign="top" charoff="50">Although few actions were generated, the physical, psychological, social and spiritual aspects of the assessment resonated with the participants and should be retained as the underpinning structure of the assessment.</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" charoff="50">

Did follow-up help ensure that referrals occurred in a timely manner?</td><td align="left" valign="top" charoff="50">The follow-up telephone calls generated few actions and were perceived as achieving very little.

Over-riding preference for independence (often with family support)
&#x0000a;
&#x0000a;
Previous bad experience of social services
&#x0000a;
&#x0000a;

Fifty-nine occurred during a period when the ward was isolated for infection control reasons (we were not allowed to recruit) or when the respiratory nurse was unavailable.
&#x0000a;
Of the remaining 130, 57 patients had other lung conditions and 22 were unable to provide valid consent (e.g., because of cognitive impairment) or complete questionnaires in English.

What is the likely attrition rate?</td><td align="left" valign="top" charoff="50">Forty-four patients provided consent during their admission:
Twelve were unable to participate in the baseline assessment 2 weeks post discharge because of death (<italic>n</italic>=3), readmission (<italic>n</italic>=3), too ill (<italic>n</italic>=3), uncontactable (<italic>n</italic>=3).
&#x0000a;
We randomised 32 patients. Twenty-four were allocated to the HELP-COPD intervention: one was too ill to participate in the intervention at 4 weeks.
&#x0000a;
On-going attrition throughout the 6 months: 7 of 23 participants in the HELP-COPD group and five of eight in the usual care group mostly for reasons of ill-health.
&#x0000a;
</td><td align="left" valign="top" charoff="50">This very substantial attrition, mainly related to severity of disease and the fact that we were recruiting at a time when the disease had just exacerbated, is an important consideration for researchers recruiting people with COPD at the time of an admission.</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" charoff="50">&#x02003;10. What is the most appropriate duration for a trial?</td><td align="left" valign="top" charoff="50">Documentary evidence from the HELP-COPD records suggested that referrals to or uptake of pulmonary rehabilitation (one of the actions we identified) or other referral agencies (oxygen, social services) take time to implement.</td><td align="left" valign="top" charoff="50">Our experience suggests that an RCT should be at least 6 months in duration.</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" charoff="50">&#x02003;11. How feasible/practical are the proposed outcome measures?</td><td align="left" valign="top" charoff="50">Questionnaire completion proved burdensome for some patients, with 13 unable/declining to complete follow-up questionnaires (3 had died, 3 were too ill, 2 had family illness/bereavement, 4 gave no specific reason). For those well enough to complete the questionnaire, FACT-L (the outcome we were considering as a future primary outcome) appeared to be acceptable.</td><td align="left" valign="top" charoff="50">In this frail group of patients use of questionnaires needs to be rationalised. FACT-L covers all domains and obviates the need for multiple questionnaires.</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" charoff="50">&#x02003;12. What is the expected change in the primary outcome measure?</td><td align="left" valign="top" charoff="50">The FACT-L showed a trend to a difference at 6 months (See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="xob1">Supplementary Information</xref>). The change from baseline (85 to 97) in the intervention group is substantial and at least twice the minimum clinically important difference of 5.5</td><td align="left" valign="top" charoff="50">The substantial attrition means that numbers were very small, and difficult to interpret with confidence</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" charoff="50">&#x02003;13. Which outcomes matter to patients/carers?</td><td align="left" valign="top" charoff="50">The Lay Advisory Group considered that important outcomes for them were greater independence, ability to improve their social lives and to live fuller lives.</td><td align="left" valign="top" charoff="50">FACT-L reflects this and endorses our decision to use it.</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" charoff="50">&#x02003;14.
