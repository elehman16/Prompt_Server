However, postoperative pain following tonsillectomy is one of the most difficult to manage in this area of surgery. The severe pain from a tonsillectomy can delay the recovery process and extend the hospital stay [<xref rid="pone.0117161.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Therefore, various analgesics and a number of surgical techniques have been suggested to improve pain relief [<xref rid="pone.0117161.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0117161.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Opioids or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and local anesthesia have been used exclusively or in combination. However, opioids can cause respiratory depression, bradycardia, hypoxia, nausea, and vomiting; NSAIDs can increase the risk of bleeding in the operated area [<xref rid="pone.0117161.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0117161.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]; and local anesthesia can cause toxic reactions and upper airway closures [<xref rid="pone.0117161.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Therefore, there is a need for a new approach that can control the pain after a tonsillectomy while reducing the use of opioids and NSAIDs.</p><p>Recent advances in the pathophysiology of pain have suggested that it is possible to prevent or attenuate the central neural hyperexcitability that contributes to enhanced postoperative pain [<xref rid="pone.0117161.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117161.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Pregabalin is a novel anticonvulsant drug that has demonstrated analgesic effects in acute postoperative pain management. Jokela et al. [<xref rid="pone.0117161.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] reported that perioperative administration of 600 mg pregabalin decreases oxycodone consumption compared with administration of 10 mg diazepam, but is associated with an increased incidence of adverse effects. Mathiesen et al. [<xref rid="pone.0117161.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] reported that pregabalin and pregabalin combined with dexamethasone reduced postoperative pain scores and consumption of ketobemidone following tonsillectomy, although dizziness was increased with pregabalin. However, there are few studies of the effectiveness of premedication with pregabalin for post-tonsillectomy pain control compared with an active placebo, such as diazepam, to exclude the effects of sedation or dizziness. Therefore, this study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of pregabalin premedication compared with diazepam as an active placebo on postoperative pain control after tonsillectomy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec008"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec009"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>The study was approved by Institutional Review Board of Incheon St. Mary&#x02019;s Hospital (IRB Number: OC10MISE0025) and the Korean Food and Drug Administration (KFDA).

This was a randomized, double-blind study that was set up according to a computer-generated block randomization. Patients were excluded from the study based on the following criteria: (1) allergy to drugs in the study, (2) alcohol or drug abuse, (3) treatment with antidepressant or antiepileptic medication within 4 weeks of the operation, (4) pregnant or breastfeeding patients, (5) tonsillar malignancy, (6) impaired kidney function, or (7) daily intake of analgesics or intake of any analgesic within 24 hours of surgery.</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Study Interventions</title><p>Prior to surgery, we explained the goal of this study to all patients, who were then educated in the use of the visual analogue scale (VAS) chart and the use of a patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pump. The night before and 1 hour before surgery each patient received either a 150 mg capsule of pregabalin (total 300 mg before surgery) (Lyrica, Freiburg, Germany) or a 2 mg capsule of diazepam orally (total 4 mg before surgery). General anesthesia was induced with intravenous propofol (2 mg/kg) and tracheal intubation was facilitated with intravenous rocuronium bromide (0.6 mg/kg). Anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane and 50% nitrous oxide in oxygen. Paralysis was reversed with glycopyrrolate and pyridostigmine at the end of surgery. Tonsillectomy was performed using the same technique for all patients, including monopolar electrocautery; bleeding was controlled using simple compression, bipolar electrocautery, and topical application of hydrogen peroxide. As a basic analgesic regimen, both groups were given acetaminophen 650 mg three times daily (total 1950 mg per day) for 8 postoperative days. While in the hospital, patients in both groups were supplied with 1% fentanyl that was administered via a PCA device (Abbott Aim Plus<sup>TM</sup>, Abbott Laboratories, Illinois) with the same parameters (demand dose = 2 ml, lockout time = 10 min, no basal infusion), and the total amount of injected fentanyl was recorded before discharge. Additionally, 30 mg of ketorolac tromethamine was injected intramuscularly at the patient&#x02019;s request, and the number of ketorolac tromethamine injections was recorded. The grade of pain was self-assessed by the patients using a visual analogue scale (VAS) that ranged from 0 (no pain) to 10 (most severe pain). The pain grade during resting periods (rVAS) and during swallowing (sVAS) was assessed at 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 hours postoperatively, and then daily for 7 days after discharge. Each patient was questioned regarding their overall satisfaction with the analgesic effects during the first 24 hours after surgery and again 8 days after surgery (scored from 0, not satisfied, to 10, very satisfied). Possible side effects of the medications, including drowsiness, nausea, dizziness, headache, and vomiting, were assessed and recorded in the patient&#x02019;s medical chart during the 24 hours following tonsillectomy.</p><p>The primary outcome measure was patient-controlled fentanyl consumption from 0 to 24 hours after tonsillectomy. Secondary outcome measures were the number of ketorolac tromethamine injections, postoperative pain score at rest and swallowing, the overall satisfaction score, and occurrence of side effects such as drowsiness, nausea, dizziness, headache, and vomiting.</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Sample Size and Statistical Analysis</title><p>Based on data from a previous study [<xref rid="pone.0117161.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], the presumption was that the total fentanyl consumption of the control group would be 47 ml (standard deviation 28). We considered a 50% reduction (24 ml) to be of clinical relevance. With a <italic>P</italic>-value of 0.05 and a power of 80%, a sample calculation showed that 22 patients were required in each group.

In this study, we have demonstrated that pregabalin reduced the fentanyl requirement significantly in the pregabalin group compared with the diazepam control group. Pain scores both at rest and during swallowing in the pregabalin group following tonsillectomy were lower than in the diazepam group, although a significant difference was not found. To our knowledge, this is the first study that has investigated the effectiveness of pregabalin premedication on postoperative tonsillectomy pain control compared with diazepam as an active placebo.</p><p>Pregabalin was originally developed as a spasmolytic agent and adjunct for the management of generalized or partial epileptic seizures resistant to conventional therapies [<xref rid="pone.0117161.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The pharmacological effects of pregabalin are believed to result from its action as a ligand at the alpha-2-delta binding site associated with voltage-gated calcium channels in the central nervous system [<xref rid="pone.0117161.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Potent binding of pregabalin at the alpha-2-delta site has been shown to reduce the depolarization-induced calcium influx at nerve terminals with a consequential reduction in the release of several excitatory neurotransmitters, including glutamate, norepinephrine, and substance P [<xref rid="pone.0117161.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117161.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Pregabalin demonstrates highly predictable and linear pharmacokinetics, a profile that makes it easy to use in clinical practice. It is rapidly and extensively absorbed after oral dosing in the fasted state, with maximal plasma concentration occurring 1 hour after single or multiple doses, and steady state being achieved within 24&#x02013;48 hours after repeated administration [<xref rid="pone.0117161.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Furthermore, pregabalin has no effect on arterial pressure or heart rate [<xref rid="pone.0117161.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and exhibits an analgesic effect that is approximately 2&#x02013;4 times stronger than that of gabapentin [<xref rid="pone.0117161.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Therefore, several reports have indicated that pregabalin may be useful for the management of postoperative pain [<xref rid="pone.0117161.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0117161.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117161.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0117161.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In the first trial investigating the postoperative analgesic effect of pregabalin, a dose of 300mg demonstrated significant pain-relieving properties for patients in dental surgery [<xref rid="pone.0117161.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In patients undergoing spinal fusion surgery [<xref rid="pone.0117161.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], two doses of 150 mg pregabalin reduced morphine consumption compared with placebo; in laparoscopic hysterectomy [<xref rid="pone.0117161.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], two doses of 300 mg pregabalin reduced 24-hour postoperative oxycodone consumption; in laparoscopic cholecystectomy [<xref rid="pone.0117161.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], 150 mg pregabalin reduced postoperative patient-controlled fentanyl consumption. In our study, patients received 150mg pregabalin at each of two time points before tonsillectomy. Treatment with pregabalin significantly decreased the consumption of fentanyl (<italic>P &#x0003c;</italic> 0.001), which is concordant with the findings of other studies [<xref rid="pone.0117161.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0117161.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117161.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] that have reported diminished opioid intake when pregabalin was used.</p><p>The postoperative side effects that accompanied the surgery when pregabalin was used as a preemptive analgesic conflict with previous results. In a consecutive report regarding laparoscopic OB/GYN surgery by Jokela et al. [<xref rid="pone.0117161.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117161.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], the authors reported that when the dosage of pregabalin as a preemptive analgesic was less than 300 mg, it did not have postoperative side effects such as dizziness and drowsiness, but when administered at more than 600 mg, it increased the occurrence of postoperative side effects. By contrast, White et al. [<xref rid="pone.0117161.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] reported that in cases of simple surgery, side effects appeared even when the pregabalin dosage was less than 300mg. In our study, oral administration of 300 mg pregabalin before surgery had a similar effect to that of 4 mg diazepam. No statistically significant difference was observed between the two groups in the occurrence of drowsiness, nausea, dizziness, headache, and vomiting (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05, <xref rid="pone.0117161.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).</p><p>The dosage and medication method of pregabalin that effectively reduce postoperative pain and minimize the adverse effects have not yet been delineated. In a study by Mathiesen et al. [<xref rid="pone.0117161.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], patients received an oral dose of 300mg pregabalin 1 hour before tonsillectomy. Pregabalin reduced postoperative pain scores and consumption of ketobemidone following tonsillectomy, but dizziness was increased with pregabalin. Jokela et al. [<xref rid="pone.0117161.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] reported that perioperative administration of 600 mg but not 300 mg pregabalin decreased oxycodone consumption postoperatively, as compared with 10 mg diazepam. Perioperative administration of 600 mg pregabalin was associated with an increased incidence of dizziness, blurred vision, and headache. Paech et al. [<xref rid="pone.0117161.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] reported that a single preoperative dose of 100mg pregabalin was ineffective in reducing acute postoperative pain or improving recovery after minor surgery involving only the uterus. In our study, we used an oral dose of 150 mg pregabalin the night before and again 1 hour before tonsillectomy. Despite the relatively small dose of pregabalin used in this study, the total amount of fentanyl demanded was decreased in the pregabalin group, as compared with the control group given 4 mg diazepam. This result indicates that pregabalin had a significant analgesic effect on post-tonsillectomy pain, which is concordant with the study of Mathiesen et al. [<xref rid="pone.0117161.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], while drowsiness, dizziness, and other side effects were similar to those from 4 mg diazepam.</p><p>To investigate purely pain control while reducing the influence of side effects such as sedation, we used diazepam as an active control. However, this study has some limitations. The measures of pain may be influenced by the patient&#x02019;s compliance or subjectivity. Therefore, further studies using neurotransmitters [<xref rid="pone.0117161.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117161.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], such as substance P, or other control regimens are necessary to clarify the precise influence of pregabalin on postoperative pain and to determine the appropriate dosage and medication method.</p><p>Although opioids play a fundamental role in the management of post-tonsillectomy pain, their use is associated with a number of side effects, including nausea, vomiting, and respiratory depression. Therefore, it is necessary to develop an effective approach to control post-tonsillectomy pain by combining treatment modalities that can block different pain mechanisms. In our study, pregabalin, which can control central neuronal pain sensitization, decreases fentanyl consumption without increasing the incidence of adverse effects compared with diazepam, which has a sedative effect. We believe that these results indicate that although pregabalin may have sedative side effects, in the context of post-tonsillectomy pain it has a more analgesic effect than a sedative effect. Therefore, we suggest that the addition of pregabalin prior to tonsillectomy may play an adjunct role in the control of post-tonsillectomy pain.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec015"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The administration of 300 mg pregabalin prior to tonsillectomy decreases fentanyl consumption without increasing the incidence of adverse effects compared with 4 mg diazepam.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec016"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0117161.s001"><label>S1 CONSORT Checklist</label><caption><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0117161.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0117161.s002"><label>S1 Protocol</label><caption><title>Trial Protocol in Korean.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0117161.s002.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0117161.s003"><label>S2 Protocol</label><caption><title>Trial Protocol in English.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0117161.s003.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><sec id="sec017"><title>Data Access and Responsibility</title><p>Dong-Hyun Kim had full access to all of the data in the study and takes responsibility for the integrity of the data and the accuracy of the data analysis.</p></sec></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0117161.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
