The psychic anxiety subscale consists of HARS items 1 to 6 (anxious mood, tension, fears, insomnia, intellectual, depressed mood) and item 14 (behavior at interview); the somatic anxiety subscale consists of HARS items 7 to 13 (somatic-muscular, somatic-sensory, cardiovascular symptoms, respiratory symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms, genitourinary symptoms, autonomic symptoms).</p><p>Efficacy was evaluated on the basis of mean changes from baseline to week 8 in HARS total score, HARS psychic and somatic anxiety subscale scores, and HARS individual item scores.

In a novel category shift analysis, the percentage of patients who shifted from a more severe symptom category at baseline to no symptoms at the end of week 8 on each of the 14 individual HARS items was assessed.

The mean decrease from baseline to week 8 was statistically greater with vilazodone versus placebo in HARS total and subscale (psychic anxiety, somatic anxiety) scores and on 11 of 14 individual HARS item scores. At week 8, HARS response and remission rates were significantly greater for vilazodone than for placebo. In a unique category shift analysis, a significantly higher percentage of vilazodone-treated than placebo-treated patients shifted from the moderate to very severe symptom category at baseline to no symptoms at week 8 on 9 of 14 HARS items. This multifaceted approach to determining treatment effect suggests that adult patients with GAD who were treated with vilazodone achieved meaningful improvements across the range of psychic and somatic anxiety symptoms.</p><p>In the pooled ITT population, the HARS total score effect size for vilazodone was 0.26. In a meta-analysis of acute treatment trials in GAD,<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> the overall effect size for placebo-controlled studies that reported change in HARS total score was 0.39, with some differences among drug classes or individual drugs (pregabalin, 0.50; hydroxyzine, 0.45; SNRIs, 0.42; benzodiazepines, 0.38; SSRIs, 0.36; buspirone, 0.17). While these values provide some context for discussing drug effects in GAD, interpretation of effect sizes in clinical trials is not straightforward due to methodological differences among studies that may influence the magnitude of effect. For the current analyses, the magnitude of effect sizes was affected by factors inherent to the study designs (eg, application of stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria) or the post hoc design (eg, constituent studies not prospectively designed or powered to evaluate single items). In addition, tolerability issues may have biased some of the efficacy results. Moreover, the symptomatic profile of individual GAD patients should be taken into account since different medications may have varying effects on specific symptoms, as suggested by the range of effect sizes that were found for individual HARS items in the current analysis.</p><p>Mean baseline scores were higher on the psychic anxiety subscale than on the somatic anxiety subscale, indicating a higher burden of psychic symptoms and the potential for more improvement in this symptom domain. As expected, the effect size for vilazodone was larger on the psychic anxiety subscale (0.28) than the somatic anxiety subscale (0.19). However, vilazodone appeared to improve both psychic and somatic anxiety symptoms, as shown by the significant improvement seen for vilazodone compared with placebo for 6 of 7 individual items on the HARS psychic anxiety subscale (all except insomnia) and for 5 of 7 items on the somatic anxiety subscale (all except genitourinary and gastrointestinal symptoms). Effect sizes for psychic anxiety subscale items ranged from 0.11 (insomnia) to 0.32 (intellectual); effect sizes for the somatic anxiety subscale items ranged from &#x02212;0.07 (gastrointestinal symptoms) to 0.20 (respiratory symptoms).</p><p>Robust responses on certain HARS items may reflect particularly strong improvement in some of the core features of GAD. Compared with other HARS items, larger effect sizes were seen in anxious mood, tension (ie, restlessness, tension, fatigability), intellectual (ie, difficulty concentrating, poor memory), somatic-muscular, and autonomic symptoms, which closely correspond to the diagnostic symptoms for GAD as defined by the <italic>DSM-5</italic>.<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Improvement in respiratory symptoms may be related to improvement in respiratory conditions that are common in patients with GAD, such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; treating GAD may improve patient functioning even with the limitations of comorbid medical conditions.<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> The lack of a statistically significant effect size in insomnia was unexpected and may be related to the permitted use of hypnotics for insomnia in the constituent studies.</p><p>Current pharmacotherapeutic options for the treatment of GAD may have differential effects on the psychic and somatic symptoms associated with GAD. For example, benzodiazepines, which facilitate &#x003b3;-aminobutyric acid neurotransmission, are thought to have greater efficacy in treating somatic anxiety symptoms relative to psychic anxiety symptoms.<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Conversely, tricyclic antidepressants, azapirones (eg, buspirone), SSRIs, and SNRIs, all of which modulate monoamine neurotransmission, have been associated with greater reductions in psychic symptoms than somatic symptoms in several reports, although findings are not consistent throughout the literature.<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> A meta-analysis investigating the efficacy of pregabalin,<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> an antiepileptic drug licensed for treating GAD in Europe, found significant improvements relative to placebo across more anxiety symptoms with pregabalin 300&#x02013;450 mg/d than with benzodiazepines (13 and 5 HARS items, respectively). Results from the present post hoc analyses indicate that mean decreases on most HARS item scores were significantly greater with vilazodone than placebo, suggesting efficacy in both psychic and somatic anxiety.</p><p>Perhaps of greater clinical relevance were the category shift analyses, which showed that among patients with moderate to very severe symptoms at baseline, the odds of achieving no symptoms after 8 weeks of treatment were significantly greater with vilazodone than with placebo on 4 psychic anxiety items (anxious mood, tension, intellectual, depressed mood) and 5 somatic anxiety items (somatic-muscular, somatic-sensory, cardiovascular symptoms, respiratory symptoms, and autonomic symptoms). These findings are noteworthy since excessive worry and anxiety are considered essential features of GAD, while somatic symptoms greatly contribute to disability in patients with GAD.<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> In primary care settings, patients with GAD are more likely to present with a somatic symptom complaint than with anxiety,<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> and many patients are unaware that physical symptoms can be indicative of a psychiatric disorder.<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> Additionally, the level of somatic symptoms are similar in individuals with GAD regardless of the presence of a psychiatric comorbidity (eg, depression), suggesting that somatic symptoms are an inherent component of GAD itself.<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> Therefore, choosing a treatment that is effective in both psychic and somatic anxiety symptom domains may be an important component of comprehensive treatment in GAD.</p><p>Despite its chronic nature and high level of recurrence, several follow-up studies<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> have shown that full and partial recovery in GAD is possible in some patients and that chronicity is at least partly due to the high rate of symptom recurrence after remission. Results from 5-, 8- and 12year follow-up studies,<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> all conducted in the same patient sample, have provided evidence pertaining to the chronicity of GAD in a psychiatric setting. After 5 years, 35% of men and 38% of women had full symptomatic remission, with 8-year rates of 46% and 56%, respectively.<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> Over a 12-year period, 58% of patients in this sample had recovered, but the probability of recurrence in recovered patients was 45%.<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> In a study of patients with GAD from a community sample, a 20-year follow-up showed that 16% of patients still had GAD, 29% had subthreshold syndromes or anxiety symptoms, and 52% were symptom-free, suggesting more improvement than progression within the anxiety spectrum.<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> In patients with GAD in primary care, a 2-year follow-up<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> found the probability of full and partial recovery were 0.39 and 0.54, respectively (Kaplan-Meier estimate); of the patients who fully recovered, 22% had partial recurrence of symptoms, 30% had full recurrence, and 48% experienced minimal symptom return, highlighting the persistence of GAD in many primary care patients.</p><p>In spite of its chronicity and the likelihood of recurrence, durable remission may be possible for some GAD patients, and measures that encourage treatment success should be implemented early in the disease course. Similar to the methods used in these post hoc analyses, deconstructing GAD into individual symptom components may be a clinically useful way to assess patient status at the end of acute treatment, potentially providing information that could enable a clinician to better manage subsyndromal or residual symptoms. Since GAD may remain at a subthreshold level even when it appears to be in remission,<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> achieving meaningful reduction in symptom severity across psychic and somatic domains and symptom-free status after acute treatment may be an important step toward an extended recovery. It is important to note, however, that whereas residual symptoms have long been known to be an important factor in predicting recurrence in MDD,<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> little is known about residual symptoms in GAD.<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> Currently, predictors of response to treatment in GAD are largely based on clinical characteristics including severity of symptoms, shorter duration of illness, lack of comorbidities, and lower severity of psychosocial impairment.<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></p><p>Limitations of these analyses included their pooled, post hoc nature, lack of an active comparator, and short treatment duration; results should be interpreted accordingly. In addition, the constituent studies were not powered to detect treatment differences in individual symptoms. Vilazodone treatment groups were pooled from 1 fixed-dose and 2 flexible-dose trials; therefore, no conclusions can be drawn regarding the effects of specific vilazodone doses on HARS total, subscale, or item scores. Conventional <italic>P</italic> values without adjustment for multiple comparisons were used, and although this is typical in post hoc analyses, random chance may have played a role in determining statistically significant differences. Patients with significant depressive symptoms were excluded from participation in the constituent studies, so the ability to generalize these post hoc findings to populations with comorbid depression and anxiety is limited.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>In these post hoc analyses, acute treatment with vilazodone 20&#x02013;40 mg/d demonstrated significant improvement across a wide range of symptoms associated with GAD. Statistically significant differences in favor of vilazodone versus placebo were noted on change in HARS total, subscale, and individual item scores. Rates of HARS response and remission were also significantly greater for vilazodone than for placebo. Moreover, a significantly higher percentage of vilazodone- than placebo-treated patients shifted from moderate or worse symptoms at baseline to no symptoms at week 8 on several HARS individual psychic and somatic anxiety items, an outcome that may be meaningful to clinicians and patients alike.</p></sec><sec><title>Drug names:</title><p>alprazolam (Xanax, Niravam, and others), diazepam (Valium and others), duloxetine (Cymbalta), escitalopram (Lexapro and others), eszopiclone (Lunesta), hydroxyzene (Vistaril and others), lorazepam (Ativan and others), paroxetine (Paxil, Pexeva, and others), pregabalin (Lyrica), sertraline (Zoloft and others), vilazodone (Viibryd), zaleplon (Sonata and others), zolpidem (Ambien, Edluar, and others).</p></sec><sec><title>Potential conflicts of interest:</title><p>Dr Khan is the medical director of the Northwest Clinical Research Center, which was an investigative site for the vilazodone phase 3 studies randomizing 241 patients; he has served as an uncompensated advisor to Forest Research Institute and is not compensated for his role as an author on scientific publications.
