The epidemic of HFMD broke out in Taiwan in 1998, leading to 129,106 cases of HFMD, 405 severe cases with complications <xref rid="pone.0094466-Ho1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, and even 78 deaths <xref rid="pone.0094466-Chang1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. And then it was followed by outbreaks in other parts of the Asia-Pacific region, including Singapore, Australia and Japan. <xref rid="pone.0094466-Chan1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094466-Fujimoto1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> HFMD epidemics have been a serious public health concern in China since 2007. The recent epidemic in 2010, which was manily caused by coxsackievirus A16 (CVA16) and enterovirus 71 (EV71), involved 1,774,669 cases of HFMD, resulting in 905 deaths <xref rid="pone.0094466-Chinas1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. The viruses are members of the Picornaviridae family and can be spread through contact with virus-containing body fluids, respiratory droplets, and feces. No specific antiviral agent or vaccine is now available for HFMD for clinical practice. Although ribavirin and immunoglobulin are commonly used, the efficacy remains uncertain <xref rid="pone.0094466-Ooi1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Therefore, good personal hygiene, including hand washing and disinfection of surfaces in child care facilities was recommended as the most effective approach to reduce the transmission rate of HFMD <xref rid="pone.0094466-Solomon1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p><p>During several recent epidemics of HFMD in China, some of the herbs or herbal preparations have shown therapeutic efficacy against the disease, including ameliorating the symptoms and shortening the course of HFMD <xref rid="pone.0094466-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. <italic>Jinzhen</italic> oral liquid, a kind of Chinese patent medicine extracted from the herbs including baikal skullcap root, rhubarb, gypsum, etc. (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0094466.s005">Table S1</xref>), approved by China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA), has been used to treat fever induced by some childhood viral-infectious diseases for decades and has been recorded into &#x0201c;Pharmacopoeia of the People's Republic of China in 2010&#x0201d; <xref rid="pone.0094466-Pharmacopoeia1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. <italic>Jinzhen</italic> oral liquid could inhibit the replication of EV71 and Cox A16 in vitro <xref rid="pone.0094466-Lu1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. The major components in this oral liquid have been demonstrated to have some active pharmacological functions for viral-infectious diseases, such as antipyretic activities (baikal skullcap root <xref rid="pone.0094466-Tsai1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>), immunoregulatory and anti-inflammatory effects (rhubarb <xref rid="pone.0094466-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, baikal skullcap root <xref rid="pone.0094466-Hsieh1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094466-Woo1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>), antiviral properties (baikal skullcap root <xref rid="pone.0094466-Yoon1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>), etc. Besides, a pilot clinical study conducted in 42 children with HFMD in China suggested that <italic>Jinzhen</italic> oral liquid combined with ribavirin could both reduce the duration of fever and the time to the first disappearance of oral ulcers and vesicles on hand or foot, compared with only use of ribavirin <xref rid="pone.0094466-Tan1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. However, there was insufficient evidence to support its widespread clinical use in the treatment of HFMD.</p><p>Therefore, we conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to assess the antipyretic and anti-inflammatory benefits of <italic>Jinzhen</italic> compared with placebo. We hypothesized that patients in the <italic>Jinzhen</italic> group would have greater reductions in time to the first disappearance of oral ulcers and vesicles on hand or foot and time of fever clearance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Trial Design and Ethics Statement</title><p>This is a randomized, double-blind, parallel, placebo-controlled trial with an allocation ratio of 1&#x02236;1. The study protocol was approved by the institutional review board of the Institute of Basic Research in Clinical Medicine (IRB-IBRCM-2010-NO 3) in China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences. After obtaining the approval of the Institutional Review Board (IRB) on May 30th 2010, we started to prepare the trial registration. However, since HFMD is a seasonal infectious disease which highly took place in April to July, the first patient was recruited on June 30th, 2010 in the Fifth People's Hospital of Guiyang City, which is located in West of China and lack of awareness of trial registration. After getting the news of recruitment, we accelerated our process of trial registration and finally completed the trial registration on July 4th, when the first patient had not completed the treatment. The authors confirmed that all ongoing and related trials for this drug were registered at the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR-TRC-10000937). The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0094466.s001">Checklist S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0094466.s004">Protocol S1</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Participants</title><p>Participants in hospital were recruited from June 30th 2010 through November 2010 in 3 centers across China: The Fifth People's Hospital of Guiyang City, Infectious Disease Hospital of Cangzhou City and Infectious Disease Hospital of Tangshan City. Samples from the throat or stool were sent to the laboratory of Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention to determine that which non-polio enteroviruses caused the illness by the real time polymerase chain-reaction (RT-PCR) test.</p><p>Patients aged 1 and 7 years who have been clinically diagnosed as uncomplicated HFMD if they had at least one of the following features accompanied or not accompanied by fever: maculopapular of vesicular rash on the palms and/or soles and vesicles or ulcers in the mouth according to the &#x0201c;Diagnosis and treatment guidelines of HFMD (2010 edition)&#x0201d; issued by Ministry of Health of China <xref rid="pone.0094466-Ministry1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> were recruited into the trial, with a history of vesicles or fever with a maximum duration of 48 hrs and a temperature no more than 39&#x000b0;C. We excluded those children who were complicated with congenital heart disease, chronic hepatitis, nephritis or hematological diseases; those who were prone to allergies or with known allergy to the study drug; those or their guardians with psychiatric disorders; those with chronic diarrhea; and those who were participating other clinical trials. All parents or guardians of the eligible children provided written informed consent.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Interventions</title><p>Inpatient children were randomly assigned to receive 1 mL of <italic>Jinzhen</italic> or its matched placebo (both produced by Kanion Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd) per kilogram body weight every day for 7 days, followed by a 3-day follow-up. The amount of the every-day drug would be taken orally for three times a day using a calibrated syringe. All liquid were sugar-free. Since it's reported that the symptoms in some cases of HFMD disappeared after 48 hrs <xref rid="pone.0094466-Gao1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, we asked parents to give the drugs three times per day in the first 2 days. And from Day 3 to Day 7, if their child's symptoms persisted, parents should give the drugs three times per day right along until all symptoms were disappeared. At the end of Day 7, we terminated the drug delivery.</p><p>The ibuprofen suspension (Motrin, Johnson &#x00026; Johnson) was also used for treating children whose temperature exceeded 38.5&#x000b0;C. Usually, it was administrated once every 4&#x02013;6 hrs if the temperature did not decrease under 38.5&#x000b0;C, but no more than 4 times a day.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Outcomes</title><p>The primary outcomes were time to the first disappearance of oral ulcers and vesicles on hand or foot within 10 days (including 3-day follow up), and time to the first normalization of temperature (fever clearance). The starting points of these two time were both being calculated from the moment of symptom onset. The axillary temperature was measured using mercury-thermometers for 5 mins each time and recorded in the temperature card by the children's parents with the help of investigators every 4 hrs each day. If the temperature was tested normal (&#x0003c;37&#x000b0;C) more than 3 times, recording of temperature could be terminated. The investigators also recorded the status of the oral ulcers and vesicles on hand or foot daily. When all of the oral ulcers and vesicles on hand or foot disappeared, defined as &#x0201c;no new ones appearing&#x0201d; determined by the experienced clinicians, the investigator recorded the date as the time for the first disappearance of oral ulcers and vesicles.</p><p>With the help of investigators, the parents also completed symptom diaries by assessing if their child had the following symptoms or not: vomiting, salivation, expectoration, diarrhea, nasal discharge, poor appetite, hypersomnia, cough, constipation, and dysphoria. And then investigators recorded the proportion of the children who were free of these symptoms every day as a secondary outcome. If used, the frequency and dose of ibuprofen were also recorded. Treatment failure rate was another important outcome, defined as the occurrence of any of the following conditions <xref rid="pone.0094466-Sun1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>: (1) severe disorders (such as encephalitis); or (2) white blood cell (WBC) counts &#x0003e;10,000/mm<sup>3</sup>.</p><p>Throughout the 7-day intervention period, all the patients should be kept in the hospital unless they were healed, and the investigators monitored all adverse events, using a standard adverse-event case report form to collect information about the adverse event if occurred.

The form contained a description of all unanticipated events and undesirable experiences, particularly exacerbations of HFMD symptoms.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Sample size</title><p>We assumed an exponential distribution for the time-to-event outcomes of the two groups in sample size calculation using log-rank test.

Compared with the placebo, <italic>Jinzhen</italic> oral liquid could improve the clinical symptoms of HFMD more rapidly, including fever, oral ulcers, vesicles on hand or foot, and other symptoms in multiple organs or systems. The onset time of <italic>Jinzhen</italic> oral liquid for lowering body temperature was probably between 3 hr and 6 hr after administration. In addition, HFMD is a highly contagious disorder that is spread by fecal contamination and contact <xref rid="pone.0094466-Thomas1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094466-Bendig1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Moreover, the intraoral sores often interfere with proper feeding, presenting a risk of dehydration and fluid imbalance, especially in infants. Thus, early control of the vesicle rash could reduce the risk of transmission of HFMD, relieve the corresponding symptoms and improve the quality of daily life for the sufferers. Our results also demonstrated that early treatment with <italic>Jinzhen</italic> oral liquid might be beneficial in reducing the risk of multi-organ exacerbations by lowering the rate of treatment failure. Besides, the tolerability and a low incidence of adverse events of <italic>Jinzhen</italic> oral liquid indicated that this drug was probably a well-tolerated and safe therapy for children with HFMD, which is also easy to be incorporated into the treatment of HFMD. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0094466-t002">Table 2</xref>, although there were no statistically significant difference of SAEs between the two groups, <italic>Jinzhen</italic> oral liquid seemed to associate with a lower incidence of SAEs. Some of the SAEs, as encephalitis, bronchopneumonia, symptomatic sinus tachycardia, were mostly considered as the severe complications of HFMD, indicating that the lower incidence of these SAEs might be more effective for preventing the mild HFMD to serious, even life-threatening forms of the disease. It might suggest that <italic>Jinzhen</italic> oral liquid had protential advantages for preventing HFMD from exacerbations, which was also justified in relation to the gain in terms of shortened disease duration.</p><p>The biologic mechanisms how <italic>Jinzhen</italic> oral liquid affects the clinical course of HFMD remain unknown. On one hand, HFMD is caused by numerous members of the Enterovirus genus e.g. <italic>Cox</italic>A 16 and EV71, which may induce multiple system organ damage <xref rid="pone.0094466-Sun1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. On the other hand, the intervention of <italic>Jinzhen</italic> oral liquid may focus on multiple outcomes based on the spectrum of multi-ingredients to treat HFMD instead of using a single pure chemical to produce a single outcome <xref rid="pone.0094466-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Previous reports suggested that baicalin and its aglycone baicalein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0094466.s002">Figure A in File S1</xref>), one of the major active compounds in <italic>Jinzhen</italic> oral liquid, had a wide range of pharmacological effects, including anti-allergic <xref rid="pone.0094466-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, anti-inflammatory <xref rid="pone.0094466-Lu2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, antiviral <xref rid="pone.0094466-Xu1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, and antipyretic <xref rid="pone.0094466-Tsai1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> effects, and also showed strong activities in preventing acute lung injury <xref rid="pone.0094466-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref> and neurological dysfunction <xref rid="pone.0094466-Tu1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>.</p><p>Study strengths include (1) its originality: there were only two trials of supportive treatment for HFMD reported in <italic>PubMed</italic>: one was using low-lever laser treating 19 patients with HFMD-induced painful stomatitis <xref rid="pone.0094466-Toida1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>; and the other was using milrinone treating 24 children with EV71-induced pulmonary edema <xref rid="pone.0094466-Wang2" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Otherwise, our study pays close attention to the improvement of the whole status of HFMD with a large sample size, considered novel and original. (2) Its internal validity: randomization was concealed, patients, investigators and biostatisticians were blinded to treatment allocation, and confounding factors and bias were minimal. (3) The use of identically matched placebos: We prepared the matched placebos and made a quantitative comparison of the appearance, color, taste and smell between <italic>Jinzhen</italic> oral liquid and its placebo by intelligent sensory technology (the overall similarity&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;93.225%) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0094466.s003">File S2</xref>). The use of identically matched placebo ensured the validity of the double-blind design. (4) We kept the pharmacological effects of <italic>Jinzhen</italic> oral liquid and placebos relatively stable in this trial. The quality control of ingredients in <italic>Jinzhen</italic> oral liquid was performed via high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) fingerprinting (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0094466.s002">File S1</xref>), and both <italic>Jinzhen</italic> oral liquid and its placebo were manufactured in a same batch strictly accordance with the standards of &#x0201c;good manufacturing practice &#x0201d;(GMP).</p><p>However, we are also aware of four possible weaknesses of the study. Firstly, the facts that the treatment was not delivered under a stratified randomization of viral types and the outcomes did not include the clearance of certain viruses, potentially limited the pertinence of our results. However, we believe that the subject population with an overall poor health status at baseline may be representative of the patients with HFMD in a real-world clinical practice. Thus, it would be prudent to further explore the benefits of <italic>Jinzhen</italic> in treating HFMD caused by the certain virus. Secondly, since we followed participants for only 3 days and the clearance of virus did not occur simultaneously with the disappearance of symptoms, the anti-viral effect of <italic>Jinzhen</italic> oral liquid might require further evaluations with a longer follow-up. Thirdly, to minimize potential confounding factors in this trial, we kept all patients hospitalized, which may have an impact on the generalisability of the study result. In accordance with the published guideline <xref rid="pone.0094466-Ministry1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, HFMD with mild symptoms could be managed in outpatient clinic. However, according to China's national health reports, HFMD has been the fifth leading cause of death among all contagious diseases since 2010 <xref rid="pone.0094466-Chinas1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, and if the child with fever, most of the Chinese family would like to leave him/her in-hospital to prevent the disease exacerbating. Indeed, in the future, we'd like to conduct the registry study on <italic>Jinzhen</italic> oral liquid for evaluating its effect on HFMD in real-world clinical practice. Fourthly, in our study, <italic>Jinzhen</italic> Oral liquid was only treated for HFMD with mild symptoms based on its clinical application for decades. However, the severe complications of HFMD, e.g. viral meningitis, encephalitis, pulmonary edema, were the main life-threatening causes. Therefore, for further studies on HFMD, we should pay more attention to the the higher risk cases, e.g. HFMD with severe symptoms of central nervous systems such as high fever, lethargic, drowsy or irritability. We should set main outcome measures or primary endpoints as mortality rates, or survival rates, or occurrence of transition of the disease to serious, even life-threatening forms of the disease. Besides, the evaluation of the antiviral effect also should be considered in the future studies.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In summary, our study provides evidence that <italic>Jinzhen</italic> oral liquid is beneficial in the treatment of HFMD. This treatment may reduce the risk of treatment failure by improving both the overall condition and clinical symptoms with less serious adverse events. The mechanism of the multiple actions of <italic>Jinzhen</italic> oral liquid needs to be further explored in future clinical pharmacological studies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0094466.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>
