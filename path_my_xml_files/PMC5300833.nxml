circumference and blood pressure in the elderly. The present study used a nonequivalent
control group pretest-posttest design. [Subjects and Methods] Sixty-eight elderly
individuals residing in J city were divided into 2 groups: 34 in the experimental group,
who received Tai Chi training for 6 weeks, and 34 in the control group, who did not
receive Tai Chi training. Simplified Yang style 24-form Tai Chi was used as the
intervention, which was conducted for 60 minutes per session, 5 sessions per week, for a
total of 6 weeks. In each session, subjects in the experimental group conducted 10 minutes
of warm-up exercises, 45 minutes of Tai Chi, and 5 minutes of cool-down exercises. Waist
circumference and blood pressure were measured before and after the 6-week intervention.
[Results] Waist circumference and blood pressure decreased significantly after the 6-week
intervention in the experimental group compared with the control group. [Conclusion] Tai
Chi can be used as an effective intervention to improve waist circumference and blood
pressure in the elderly.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Blood pressure</kwd><kwd>Tai Chi</kwd><kwd>Waist circumference</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Average life expectancy has increased owing to continued economic growth and advancements
in medical science and technology, and, as such, the elderly population is increasing
rapidly. According to a recent report, elderly individuals are less likely to receive
medical treatment as they age, when their income is lower, and if they are female<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>, and the burden of medical costs is
increasing accordingly.</p><p>In particular, because prevalence of metabolic syndrome is higher in those aged over 60
than in other age groups, it has been of clinical interest. In those with metabolic
syndrome, risk of cardiovascular disease is increased by more than 2-fold, while risk of
diabetes is increased by more than 10-fold<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Increasing prevalence of metabolic syndrome in older individuals has been reported to be
closely related to low physical activity in the elderly<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Among various risk factors for metabolic syndrome, high blood
pressure has been found to be most significant, followed by abdominal obesity. Thus, in
order to decrease prevalence of metabolic syndrome, factors that can decrease blood pressure
and abdominal obesity should be investigated<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Exercise&#x02014;a factor influencing metabolic syndrome that can be regulated&#x02014;is essential for
maintaining health, recovering health from chronic disease, and maintaining independence in
the elderly, and is reported to have positive physical, psychologic, and social
influences<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. In a previous study
regarding Tai Chi in middle-aged women, risk factors for metabolic syndrome decreased while
health-related quality of life improved<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Similarly, in a pilot study investigating Tai Chi in 11 middle-aged subjects with metabolic
syndrome, waist circumference and blood pressure showed significant improvement compared
with baseline values<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Therefore, the present study aimed to determine the effects of Tai Chi in the elderly, who
show high prevalence of metabolic syndrome, and to investigate whether Tai Chi can be used
actively in a clinical setting.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study used a nonequivalent control group pretest-posttest quasi-experimental design.
The sample size necessary for t-tests was calculated as 36 subjects in each group according
to G* power analysis conducted with an effect size of 0.67, significance level of 0.05, and
power of 0.80, based on the results of a previous study<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In the present study, 68 elderly individuals residing in J city were divided into 2 groups:
36 in the experimental group, who received Tai Chi training for 6 weeks, and 36 in the
control group, who did not receive Tai Chi training. However, 2 subjects in each group
withdrew, resulting in 34 subjects in each group. Subjects were assigned to groups using a
coin-flip strategy. Subjects were aged over 65, had not exercised regularly during the last
6 months, had no health problems preventing them from exercising, and could perform physical
activities independently. Subjects received an explanation regarding the purpose and methods
of the study prior to participation and provided written informed consent according to the
principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.</p><p>The intervention used in this study was Yang style 24-form Tai-Chi, which was conducted for
60 minutes per session, 5 sessions per week, for a total of 6 weeks. In each session,
subjects in the experimental group conducted 10 minutes of warm-up exercises, 45 minutes of
Tai Chi, and 5 minutes of cool-down exercises. Similar to the experimental group, the
control group performed 10 minutes of warm-up exercises and 5 minutes of cool-down exercises
in each session, 5 times per week, for a total of 6 weeks. The content validity of the
program was verified by a medical specialist, nursing professor with experience conducting
exercise-related research, and exercise therapist. The intervention was conducted at our
organization&#x02019;s auditorium from 14:00 pm to 15:00 pm.</p><p>Waist circumference and blood pressure were measured before and after the 6-week
intervention. Mean waist circumference was determined after measuring twice using a tape
(Dritz), while blood pressure was measured using an automated sphygmomanometer (model
BPBIO330, Meditec) on the subject&#x02019;s right arm after relaxing for 20 minutes. Data were
collected between December 2, 2013, and February 24, 2014. After collecting data from the
control group for 6 weeks, data from the experimental group were collected for 6 weeks.</p><p>Data were analyzed using SPSS version 19.0 for Windows (IBM Corporation). Homogeneity
between the experimental and control groups was tested using &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> and t-tests. T
and paired t-tests were performed to determine differences in waist circumference and blood
pressure between groups. Statistical significance was set at p&#x0003c;0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Subjects&#x02019; mean age was 72.4 &#x000b1; 3.8&#x02005;years and 71.2 &#x000b1; 5.1&#x02005;years in the experimental and
control groups, respectively.</p><p>Because there were no significant differences between groups in age, gender, marital
status, educational level, religion, income, or exercise status, the groups were found to be

This finding is consistent with a previous study<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup> reporting a significant difference in waist circumference after 24
weeks of exercise, and with another study<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>

decrease of 1.8% in the control group after 1&#x02005;year of Yang style Tai Chi exercise.</p><p>Regarding BP in the experimental group, before the Tai Chi intervention, values for SBP and
DBP were higher than normal. After the intervention, however, SBP and DBP measured within
normal ranges. On the contrary, in the control group, values for SBP and DBP were higher
than normal both before and after the intervention. These results are similar to a previous
study<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup> showing that high BP contributed
to prevalence of metabolic syndrome in middle-aged and elderly individuals living in one
region. Our findings also agree with another study<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup> in which 12 weeks of Tai Chi exercise conducted in middle-aged women
with metabolic syndrome exerted significant effects on decreasing certain risk factors for
metabolic syndrome (DBP, waist circumference) in the experimental group compared with the
control group.</p><p>In the present study in which the intervention was conducted for a relatively short period
of time (6 weeks), significant differences in dependent variables, including waist
circumference and BP, may have occurred because the exercise was conducted frequently (5
times per week). We applied Tai Chi exercise 5 times per week for a total of 6 weeks in
elderly men and women and observed significant decreases in waist circumference and BP in
the experimental group.</p><p>Thus, regular Tai Chi training has a positive impact on decreasing the risk factors for
metabolic syndrome in the elderly.</p><p>The findings of this study suggest the need for further research to identify the effects on
body mass index and blood-related indicators in the elderly.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Ministry of Health, Welfare and
