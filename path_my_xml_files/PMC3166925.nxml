Twenty-four hours later the monkeys were assessed using a clinical rating scale, matched accordingly to disability, randomly assigned to one of three groups [placebo (n = 5), 2.5 (n = 6) or 5 (n = 5) mg/kg of pioglitazone] and their treatments started.

Behavioral recovery was associated with preservation of nigrostriatal dopaminergic markers, observed as higher tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) putaminal optical density (<italic>P </italic>= 0.011), higher stereological cell counts of TH-ir (<italic>P </italic>= 0.02) and vesicular monoamine transporter-2 (VMAT-2)-ir nigral neurons (<italic>P </italic>= 0.006). Stereological cell counts of Nissl stained nigral neurons confirmed neuroprotection (<italic>P </italic>= 0.017). Pioglitazone-treated monkeys also showed a dose-dependent modulation of CD68-ir inflammatory cells, that was significantly decreased for 5 mg/kg treated animals compared to placebo (<italic>P </italic>= 0.018).

Activation of the PPAR-&#x003b3; subtype is known to increase insulin sensitization, modulate glucose and lipid metabolism. Pioglitazone (Actos<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>; Takeda Pharmaceuticals Ltd.) is a thiazoledinedione (TZD) and a highly selective PPAR-&#x003b3; agonist. It is currently approved as an oral monotherapy and adjunctive therapy for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>A growing body of evidence points towards chronic neuroinflammation having a key role in Parkinson's Disease (PD) pathogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. This suggests that anti-inflammatory strategies may be beneficial to prevent PD's typical progressive loss of dopaminergic nigral neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. PPAR-&#x003b3; activators reduce inflammation by inhibiting expression of proinflammatory cytokines and metalloproteases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In a model of neuroinflammation by intrastriatal injection of lipopolysaccharides (LPS), pioglitazone decreased glial activation, improved mitochondrial function and attenuated oxidative stress, preserving nigral dopaminergic cell count and partially restoring striatal dopamine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In mouse models of PD induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) intoxication, oral administration of pioglitazone reduced glial activation and attenuated loss of substantia nigra (SN) pars compacta dopaminergic (DA) neurons, promoted l&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; induction and blocked NF&#x003ba;B and iNOS activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] In nonhuman primates (NHP) the most used models of PD are induced by MPTP administration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] which, similar to mice, it induces loss of dopaminergic nigral cells and their striatal terminals as well as inflammation that persists many years after the original neurotoxin exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Yet, the effects of PPAR-&#x003b3; agonists in a NHP PD model have not been assessed and its investigation may define whether the clinical translation of this strategy is valid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>Here we report our evaluation of the disease modifying properties of pioglitazone in a paradigm resembling early PD in NHP. We hypothesized that the PPAR-&#x003b3; agonist would modulate the inflammatory reaction induced by the neurotoxin MPTP and, in consequence, prevent nigral cell loss and associated PD syndrome. We chose to induce a hemiparkinsonian model by a single intracarotid artery administration of MPTP due to the stability and replicability of the model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. We started pioglitazone administration 24 hours after neurotoxin challenge to resemble the ongoing degeneration observed in PD patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Oral dosing was equivalent to the one used to treat diabetic conditions. Our results demonstrate that pioglitazone administration attenuated the inflammatory response, preserved dopaminergic nigrostriatal function and improved PD signs in this experimental paradigm.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>Adult rhesus monkeys (<italic>Macaca mulatta</italic>, 5-7 years old) were obtained from the Wisconsin National Primate Center (WNPRC) and singly housed with a 12-hr light/dark cycle at the WNPRC facility.

All efforts were made to minimize the number of animals used and ameliorate their suffering. This study was performed in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. Two sets of experiments were carried out: a neuroprotective and a CSF penetration analysis. The protocols were approved by the Institutional and Animal Care Committee at the University of Wisconsin-Madison (permits #: G00492 and G00569, respectively).</p></sec><sec><title>Behavioral Evaluations</title><p>All behavioral training and evaluations used positive reinforcement to entice monkeys' cooperation.

Neuronal counts were performed using Stereo Investigator Version 7.5 (MicroBrightField, Williston, VT). The SN was outlined under a low magnification (2.5&#x000d7;). The total number of TH-ir and VMAT2-ir neurons within the counting frame was counted using a 100&#x000d7; oil immersion objective with a 1.4 numerical aperture.

Images from five coronal sections per monkey approximately 2 mm apart were captured using a Nikon E800 microscope equipped with a SPOT camera. CD68-ir was calculated using the particle count function of the ImageJ program, which refers to the quantification of objects of a certain size within a region of interest in a thresholded image. The object size was set between five and 75 square pixels. The particle number and their total area within each region of interest was then analyzed and recorded. For GFAP, nitrotyrosine and HO-1-ir, ImageJ was calibrated using a step tablet, grey scale values were converted to OD units using the Rodbard function, and the area in pixels above a threshold of 0.30 OD units was recorded.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of plasma and CSF levels of pioglitazone</title><p>To determine CSF penetration of pioglitazone, five rhesus monkeys (female, 6-7 yrs, 5-6 kg) received daily oral administration of placebo, 2.5, 5 or 7.5 mg/kg of pioglitazone.

Currently we are unable to predict who will develop sporadic PD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The best option in protecting as many DA nigral neurons as possible is to intervene early after the onset/diagnosis of the disease. In this study we started pioglitazone administration soon after MPTP challenge, attempting to resemble clinical conditions of ongoing degeneration in early PD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. In rhesus monkeys, a single intracarotid artery MPTP infusion immediately induces extensive unilateral depletion of striatal DA (and associated hemiparkinsonian signs, that allow for the selection and matching of the animals according to disability) <underline>but little loss of TH-ir nigral neurons</underline>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. By 2-3 months, there is extensive loss of both striatal terminals and nigral neurons. The established syndrome has been shown to persist (without spontaneous recovery) for up to 8 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. This pattern of neurodegeneration creates a window of opportunity to test the efficacy of neuroprotective strategies (e.g.: [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]). The placebo-treated monkeys' behavioral stability overtime of the PD syndrome and associated severe loss of DA markers and Nissl-stained nigral cell counts confirm that the criteria used for the selection of the animals was appropriate. Moreover, the Nissl cell counts confirm that the differences between treatment groups in DA markers were related to neuroprotection, not to up- or down- regulation of nigral neuronal phenotype.</p><p>A caveat for this experimental design is that in monkeys, pioglitazone achieves a steady-state at 5-7 days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] which limited the availability of the compound between early dosings. This may have restricted the behavioral and nigrostriatal recovery, inducing improvements mostly in CR (which is more sensitive to small DA changes than FMS) associated to the partial DA nigrostriatal recovery. Yet, we chose this paradigm and its limitations (rather than intervening before MPTP) due to its clinical relevance.</p><p>Similar to PD patients, MPTP-intoxicated monkeys present reactive inflammation in the nigrostriatal system that persists for many years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In our study, pioglitazone-treated monkeys had a dose-dependent, significantly less CD68 expression than placebo animals, suggesting that pioglitazone decreased the MPTP-induced inflammatory response. This is the first report of pioglitazone (or any PPAR&#x003b3; agonist) inducing an anti-inflammatory response in parkinsonian monkeys, and it agrees with similar findings in other paradigms. For example, pioglitazone prevented microglia-mediated lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced cell death in cortical neuron-glia co-cultures as well as in rats with intrastriatal injections of LPS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].

Although it is not clear if pioglitazone's effect on inflammatory cells is PPAR&#x003b3;-dependent or independent, our data supports the concept that pioglitazone can modulate glia activation and its harmful effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].</p><p>We found some evidence of less nigral oxidative stress in pioglitazone-treated monkeys compared to controls. This was observed as a trend toward a decreased expression of nitrotyrosine positive cells and a negative correlation between nitrotyrosine immunostaining and the number of TH-positive nigral neurons. Pioglitazone may have diminished oxidative stress and supported cell survival indirectly by decreasing microglia activation and its harmful metabolites and/or attenuating oxidative stress. It should be noted, however, that since our animals were euthanized 3 months after MPTP administration, this may have affected the expression levels of these markers, compared to microglia immunoreactivity that can persist for many years. Further studies are currently ongoing to assess the effects of PPAR&#x003b3; agonists in oxidative stress.</p><p>Pioglitazone neuroprotective effects may have also been related or enhanced by mechanisms different from anti-inflammatory or anti-oxidative pathways. These mechanisms could have triggered early cell recovery and prevented or decreased the inflammatory response. For example, pioglitazone may have facilitated neuropreservation by its effects on glucose metabolism. This compound is currently used clinically as an anti-diabetic agent by increasing insulin sensitization and modulating glucose receptors in peripheral tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. MPTP-induced neurodegeneration increases glucose requirements in the substantia nigra pars compacta of rodents and primates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Although we did not observe changes in glucose blood levels in the animals that received pioglitazone, it is possible that there was a functional increase in CNS insulin sensitization, which may have increased the availability of intracellular glucose in a moment of high request for energy by nigral neurons.</p><p>MPTP toxicity depends on its transformation by intracerebral MAO-B into its metabolite MPP<sup>+</sup>. Pioglitazone may induce neuroprotection by inhibiting MAO-B activity (and in consequence, decrease toxic MPP<sup>+ </sup>levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]).

In the different models pioglitazone showed capacity to induce neuroprotective and/or restorative effects, mainly associated to modulation of inflammation.</p><p>Clinically, pioglitazone has been tested for Alzheimer disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>], multiple sclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>], autism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>], stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>], amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>], and Friedreich's Ataxia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>]. The results of these small clinical trials suggest that its administration can benefit patients with neurological disorders. In the case of PD, pioglitazone's clinical evaluation is supported by the reports on its capacity to modulate inflammation, oxidative stress, and glucose uptake, as well as its ability to inhibit MAO-B. Our current results further support the testing of pioglitazone as a disease modifying strategy for early PD.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>This is the first report in nonhuman primates that daily oral administration of the PPAR-&#x003b3; agonist, pioglitazone, is neuroprotective in a paradigm resembling early PD. Findings include modest but significant improvements in clinical rating, fine motor skills, and preservation of DA striatal fibers and nigral neurons. These changes were associated with a significant attenuation of CD68 positive microglia/macrophages. Significant correlations between behavioral and morphological outcomes were found. A separate experiment confirmed the ability of pioglitazone to cross the blood brain barrier. These results validate PPAR-&#x003b3; as a target to prevent neurodegeneration in early PD.</p></sec><sec><title>List of Abbreviations</title><p>(CR): clinical rating; (DA): dopamine; (FMS): fine motor skill; (GFAP): glial fibrillary acidic protein; (HO-1): heme-oxygenase-1; (MPTP): 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine; nitrotyrosine (OD): optical density; (PD): Parkinson's disease; (PPAR-&#x003b3;): peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-gamma; (SN): substantia nigra; (SPE): solid phase extraction; (T2DM): type 2 diabetes mellitus; (TH): tyrosine hydroxylase; (VMAT-2): vesicular monoamine transporter-2.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>CRS performed stereological cell counts, OD and particle data acquisition and analysis, general data analysis and manuscript writing, VJ performed <italic>in vivo </italic>data acquisition and analysis, VB developed and performed immunohistochemistry procedures, KB performed MPTP surgeries and was in charge of overall evaluation of animal health, HAS performed necropsies and analyzed autopsy data, TEZ analyzed pioglitazone levels in plasma and CSF, JWK, assessed the metabolic effects of pioglitazone, JAJ assisted in the experimental design, concept development and data interpretation, and MEE was in charge of the experimental design, concept development, data acquisition and analysis, and manuscript writing.
