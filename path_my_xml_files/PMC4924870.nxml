Everolimus was initiated at a dose (4.5 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/day) titrated to a target blood trough of 5&#x02013;15 ng/mL. SEGA response rate (primary end point) was defined as the proportion of patients achieving confirmed &#x02265;50% reduction in the sum volume of target SEGA lesions from baseline in the absence of worsening nontarget SEGA lesions, new target SEGA lesions, and new or worsening hydrocephalus. Of 111 patients (median age, 9.5 years) who received &#x02265;1 dose of everolimus (median duration, 47.1 months), 57.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 47.9&#x02013;67.0) achieved SEGA response. Of 41 patients with target renal angiomyolipomas at baseline, 30 (73.2%) achieved renal angiomyolipoma response. In 105 patients with &#x02265;1 skin lesion at baseline, skin lesion response rate was 58.1%. Incidence of adverse events (AEs) was comparable with that of previous reports, and occurrence of emergent AEs generally decreased over time.

In the kidneys, renal angiomyolipomas, which are tumors composed of fat cells, immature smooth muscle, and abnormal blood vessels, grow in number and size with age [<xref rid="pone.0158476.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0158476.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Larger angiomyolipomas can develop aneurysms that can rupture and cause life-threatening hemorrhage or encroach on normal renal tissue, leading to renal failure [<xref rid="pone.0158476.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Skin lesions, such as hypomelanotic macules, facial angiofibromas, and shagreen patches, can also be present at birth or develop early in life in the majority of patients and can cause significant physical and psychological burden [<xref rid="pone.0158476.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Everolimus has demonstrated efficacy in treating symptomatic, growing SEGAs in patients with TSC, first in an open-label phase 1/2 trial in 28 patients with TSC-associated SEGA [<xref rid="pone.0158476.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and subsequently in the double-blind phase in the large randomized, international, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial EXIST-1 [<xref rid="pone.0158476.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Everolimus has also demonstrated significant reduction in renal angiomyolipoma volume compared with placebo in the phase 3 EXIST-2 trial [<xref rid="pone.0158476.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].

In addition, mTOR inhibitors have shown promise in treating multiple manifestations of TSC, including skin manifestations, cardiac rhabdomyoma, pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis, and epilepsy, which supports the use of mTOR inhibitors as targeted multisystemic therapy for the disease [<xref rid="pone.0158476.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0158476.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>There is some evidence that TSC-associated tumors regrow after cessation of mTOR inhibitor treatment, suggesting that therapy with an mTOR inhibitor might necessitate long-term or perhaps indefinite use [<xref rid="pone.0158476.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].

Secondary efficacy end points included time to SEGA response, time to SEGA progression, and duration of SEGA response. SEGA progression was defined as an increase in SEGA volume &#x02265;25% from lowest value to a value greater than baseline or as appearance of new SEGA lesions &#x02265;1 cm in longest diameter, worsening of nontarget lesions, or new or worsening hydrocephalus.

This was defined as the proportion of patients with &#x02265;50% reduction in the sum volume of all target renal angiomyolipomas compared with baseline in the absence of any new target renal angiomyolipomas, as &#x0003e;20% increase in volume in either kidney from its lowest value, or as renal angiomyolipoma-related bleed of grade &#x02265;2 per central radiology review. Skin lesion response rate was defined as the proportion of patients with either complete clinical response (100% improvement) or partial response (&#x02265;50% improvement) in skin lesions according to the PGA per the investigator. Skin lesion types included in the assessment were hypomelanotic macules, shagreen patches, periungual or subungual fibroma, facial angiofibroma, and forehead plaques.

The current analyses included all patients who received &#x02265;1 dose of everolimus. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize baseline data at everolimus initiation. Changes of volume from baseline with exact 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for SEGA response and renal angiomyolipoma response. The 95% CIs were also calculated for skin lesion response rate.

In this final analysis, SEGA response rate increased to 58% over approximately 4 years of treatment, indicating that patients who do not initially respond to everolimus might achieve response with continued exposure. The proportion of patients with a clinically significant &#x02265;50% reduction in SEGA volume generally increased over time, showing that clinically relevant SEGA reductions persisted. The rate of SEGA progression was relatively low (~12%), and a number of patients continued everolimus despite progression because they were attaining clinical benefit.</p><p>Evaluation of SEGA was the primary focus of this study.

In this analysis, increasing and sustained reductions in renal angiomyolipoma volume and improvement in skin lesions were observed, providing evidence of broad clinical impact of systemic treatment with everolimus in patients with TSC. Although the study was not adequately designed to fully assess effects in these manifestations, the positive results are not entirely unexpected. The evidence examining use of oral mTOR inhibitors for TSC has shown that the drug class has the potential for multisystemic effects in TSC not only in treating SEGAs or renal angiomyolipomas, but also TSC-associated seizures, cardiac rhabdomyoma, lymphangioleiomyomatosis, or some of the TSC-associated neuropsychiatric disorders [<xref rid="pone.0158476.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0158476.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Additional studies in these areas are needed or are underway.</p><p>Everolimus proved to be safe and well tolerated over the long term. The pattern of AEs was consistent with the known safety profile of everolimus. Although more than 80% of patients experienced an AE suspected to be drug related during treatment, most AEs resolved without any complication. Nearly three-quarters of the patients completed this long-term study as per protocol, with only 10 patients (9.0%) discontinuing the study drug because of an AE.</p><p>The frequency of emerging AEs of all types decreased over time, with stomatitis and mouth ulceration remaining the most common. Lack of data on the long-term effects of mTOR inhibitors on growth and sexual maturation had represented an area of uncertainty, but clinical data from this report do not indicate that these areas are impacted by use of everolimus. This is further supported by data in pediatric transplant patients, in whom the use of everolimus for up to 11 years was not associated with growth disturbances and did not impact sexual maturation [<xref rid="pone.0158476.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0158476.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>The goal of treatment with an mTOR inhibitor is to decrease or stabilize the size and number of tumors in patients with TSC [<xref rid="pone.0158476.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0158476.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0158476.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In this long-term follow-up of patients with growing SEGA at baseline, no patient required surgery because of SEGA progression while on everolimus, and one patient elected to discontinue from the study to pursue surgery despite having &#x0003e;50% reduction in SEGA volume. For one patient there was radiographic evidence of hydrocephalus in the absence of SEGA growth and without clinical symptoms of progression. None of the patients with renal angiomyolipoma experienced renal hemorrhage.</p><p>Similar to long-term phase 1/2 data, at least half the patients had SEGA volume reduction &#x02265;50% at later time points (192 weeks [44 months] in this study and at 48 and 60 months in the phase 1/2 study) [<xref rid="pone.0158476.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In the core phase of the EXIST-1 study, 53% of patients receiving everolimus had a renal angiomyolipoma response [<xref rid="pone.0158476.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Comparatively, 42% of patients had a renal angiomyolipoma response in the core phase of the similarly designed EXIST-2 study in adults with TSC and renal angiomyolipoma [<xref rid="pone.0158476.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In a longer term interim analysis from that trial, the response rate had increased to 54% after median treatment duration of 28.9 months [<xref rid="pone.0158476.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. At the conclusion of the current EXIST-1 study, approximately 73% of patients had experienced renal angiomyolipoma response. Our study included fewer and younger patients with renal angiomyolipoma, and it reports longer duration of everolimus exposure than what is currently published for EXIST-2. A final long-term analysis of that study is forthcoming and might provide a better comparison.</p><p>Key safety results obtained during this long-term study remained consistent with those previously reported in TSC-associated clinical settings with everolimus [<xref rid="pone.0158476.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0158476.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0158476.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0158476.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0158476.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. No new long-term safety issues arose from this analysis.</p><p>Important limitations of this analysis include the open-label design of the extension phase and that the study was not powered or designed to adequately assess other secondary (skin lesions) or exploratory (renal angiomyolipoma) clinical end points. At the end of the study, a majority of patients had not yet completed their sexual development. Ongoing evaluation of sexual development in a subset of these patients is being planned in a follow-up study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec019"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Long-term efficacy and safety data from the completed EXIST-1 study confirm that everolimus is a safe and effective therapeutic option for patients with TSC-associated SEGA. Moreover, everolimus may reduce the risk for clinical complications of SEGA, such as hydrocephalus and surgery, and use of everolimus effectively manages other TSC manifestations, such as angiomyolipoma and skin lesions. Most AEs appeared in the first year of treatment and were managed by dose adjustment/interruption, and no new safety concerns were raised through this analysis. An upcoming final report on EXIST-2 will provide further assessment of the long-term efficacy and safety of everolimus in treating TSC.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec020"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0158476.s001"><label>S1 Checklist</label><caption><title>CONSORT 2010 checklist of information to include when reporting a randomized trial.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0158476.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0158476.s002"><label>S1 Protocol</label><caption><title>EXIST-1 study protocol.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0158476.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0158476.s003"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>List of ethics committees and/or intuitional review boards that approved the EXIST-1 study.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0158476.s003.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank the study participants, the EXIST-1 investigators, and study site personnel for their important contributions to this study.
