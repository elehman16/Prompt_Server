<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> One of the most commonly used absolute risk models is the Framingham risk equation (FRE),<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> which estimates the risk of a cardiovascular event based on sex, age, smoking status, diabetes, systolic blood pressure (SBP) and cholesterol ratio. The Australian guidelines classify patients with a 5-year risk of &#x0003e;15% as high risk and recommend that they should be simultaneously treated with cholesterol and blood pressure lowering medication in addition to lifestyle intervention unless contraindicated or clinically inappropriate.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> For lower risk patients &#x02264; 15% without additional risk factors such as family history, lifestyle intervention is recommended as the primary management approach. Adults with very high individual risk factors (SBP &#x02265;180 or diastolic blood pressure &#x02265;110&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg or total cholesterol &#x0003e;7.5&#x02005;mmol/L) do not require absolute CVD risk assessment because they are already considered to be at high risk of CVD.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p><p>Using absolute risk is a major shift from the traditional approach of treating high blood pressure and high cholesterol individually. An absolute risk approach is likely to achieve the best balance between preventing CVD events and avoiding unnecessary treatment with medication. It has the potential to reduce overtreatment of people who have an elevated individual risk factor (eg, blood pressure) but low or moderate overall risk of a CVD event and reducing under treatment of people with slightly elevated individual risk factors but a combined high overall risk.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> The first FRE was published in 1976<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> and New Zealand was the first country to introduce an absolute risk approach in 1993.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> More than 20&#x02005;years have passed since then and the absolute risk approach has been shown to reduce short-term CVD risk without causing clinical harms.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p><p>However, research suggests that general practitioners (GPs) often do not use absolute risk to guide their decision-making about CVD prevention.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15&#x02013;19</xref> Past research includes studies exploring barriers to GPs&#x02019; use of absolute risk<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19&#x02013;22</xref> and studies quantifying treatment gaps using clinical databases<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>

<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> but individual decision-making about absolute risk has not been comprehensively examined quantitatively. In this study we applied a method based on judgements of hypothetical patient cases to analyse GPs&#x02019; decisions about CVD risk management and their use of absolute risk. Hypothetical patient cases (also called vignettes) have been widely used to measure decision processes in a range of clinical settings,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> including GP decision-making about CVD.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26&#x02013;28</xref> Indeed, three recent studies using patient cases suggest that clinicians might not base treatment decisions on absolute risk thresholds (eg, only treat patients &#x0003e;15% for 5-year FRE based absolute risk or &#x0003e;20% for 10-year risk); instead they focus on the levels of the individual risk factors blood pressure and cholesterol.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26&#x02013;28</xref> However, these studies did not systematically assess different combinations of absolute risk and individual risk factor levels. Therefore, they provide limited interpretation of how GPs use absolute risk versus individual risk factors in decision-making.</p><p>In the current study we used hypothetical patient cases (from here on referred to as cases) in which the levels of absolute risk and three individual risk factors (SBP, cholesterol ratio (total cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein (TC/HDL), and age) were systematically varied in order to evaluate their respective influence on GPs&#x02019; decision-making about CVD risk management. Absolute risk levels were derived from the FRE.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p><p>In line with the literature suggesting that GPs tend to use an individual risk factor approach, we hypothesised that:

GPs were asked how they would manage the patient in the case: prescribe cholesterol medication, prescribe blood pressure medication and/or prescribe aspirin (yes/no for each). In addition, they were asked when they would reassess the patient (open ended). The aspirin and reassessment results are reported separately. We collected information regarding GP characteristics: gender, age, years in practice, practice size. We asked GPs two questions about their use of absolute risk as follows: &#x02018;For the cases you just read, how often did you use the absolute risk score to inform your management decision?&#x02019; and &#x02018;In your general practice, how often do you use absolute risk scores, calculators or charts when assessing a patient's level of cardiovascular risk?&#x02019; (5-point Likert scale; 1 never&#x02014;5 always).

We defined patients with a risk of a cardiovascular event over 5&#x02005;years greater than 15% as high absolute risk, for whom preventive medication is recommended. The Australian absolute risk guidelines recommend that adults with SBP &#x02265;180&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg or total cholesterol &#x0003e;7.5&#x02005;mmol/L do not require absolute CVD risk assessment because they are already known to be at clinically determined high risk of CVD.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> We ensured that the individual risk factor levels remained below these thresholds and, where possible, we avoided values that were close to the cut-off. High blood pressure levels varied between SBP 147 and 179&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg and high cholesterol (TC/HDL ratio) between 6.5 and 7.2&#x02005;mmol/L. Lower blood pressure levels varied between SBP of 110 and 145&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg and lower TC/HDL ratio between 3 and 6&#x02005;mmol/L. We defined three age categories within the target population for CVD risk assessment: 47, 61 and 72&#x02005;years. Previous Australian guidelines for cholesterol (2005)<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> and hypertension management (2010)<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> are consistent with the 2012 guidelines recommendations for the commencement of cholesterol lowering and/or blood pressure lowering drug treatment in patients with an absolute risk &#x0003e;15% of a CVD event in the next 5&#x02005;years, or those with an absolute risk of 10&#x02013;15% with the presence of additional risk factors but have now been replaced with the 2012 guidelines.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Randomisation</title><p>There were 25 core cases with systematically varied levels of absolute risk, cholesterol, blood pressure and age. Each case had between one and three versions to enable male/female and smoking/non-smoking comparisons, depending on clinical plausibility. Eleven of the core cases were randomly selected for each survey to reduce response burden, and only one version of the selected case was used (eg, only the female, non-smoking version). The 11 selected cases were presented in random order. This process generated a total of 43 clinically possible cases (see online supplementary appendix 1 for details of each case).</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Analysis</title><p>GPs&#x02019; decisions on risk management for the different cases were summarised as the percentage of cases in which the GPs would prescribe cholesterol or blood pressure lowering medication. We analysed how the chances of prescribing medication changed according to the risk profiles of the cases (ie, levels of absolute and individual risk factors). This was done using generalised estimation equations (GEEs) with a logit link (logistic regression) and an exchangeable working correlation matrix to take into account the clustering of cases per GP.</p><p>The outcome was whether the GP would prescribe medication for the case, and the covariates were the levels of absolute risk and individual risk factors (ie, blood pressure and cholesterol levels) presented in the cases. More specifically, four sets of cases were compared: (A) high individual risk factors and lower absolute risk, (B) high individual risk factors and high absolute risk, (C) lower individual risk factors and high absolute risk and (D) lower individual risk factors and lower absolute risk. The 95% CIs for the percentages presented in the results section and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2014004812F2">figure 2</xref> were obtained from the GEEs.</p><p>We performed exploratory analyses to examine (1) how risk management changed according to GP characteristics (ie, age, gender, years in practice, practice size and self-reported use of absolute risk in practice and in the cases) and (2) how risk management changed according to specific characteristics of the cases presented (ie, age, gender and smoking status). This was achieved by testing the interaction between each characteristic and the four sets of cases with different risk profiles in separate GEEs (one for each characteristic). The statistical analysis was performed with the software SPSS V.21.</p><sec id="s2f1"><title>Missing data handling</title><p>Five participants completed only half of the survey (1 out of 2 pages). For those participants, only the completed part of the survey was included in the analysis. In addition, there was an average of five missing responses per case. In most instances the missing values occurred in questionnaires where only positive responses were marked (ie, GP only gave a response for cases where he/she would prescribe) and it was therefore assumed that the missing values were negative responses (ie, GP would not prescribe for that case). A sensitivity analysis was conducted to check this assumption by excluding the surveys with missing values.

The results suggest that, inconsistent with the Australian guidelines,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> GPs are likely to prescribe blood pressure and cholesterol lowering medication to lower risk patients (5-year risk of CVD event &#x0003c;15%) if these risk factors are elevated, even when an absolute risk assessment is specifically provided to GPs. Conversely, GPs did not always prescribe medication to higher risk cases when blood pressure or cholesterol were not elevated. These results are in line with our hypotheses, and previous studies of patient records showing overtreatment of low-risk patients and undertreatment of high-risk patients, and that individual risk factors influence prescribing.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26&#x02013;28</xref>
<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31&#x02013;33</xref> Age appeared to be largely ignored as a risk factor, and GPs prescribed less blood pressure lowering medication for 72-year-old cases in comparison with 61-year-olds despite similar descriptions in the scenarios (a relatively healthy fit x year old). This finding is worthy of further exploration, given that age is one of the strongest risk factors for CVD, as it runs counter to the concept of absolute CVD risk and proposals based solely on an age cut-off.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>
<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> We acknowledge that in clinical practice GPs may have various and valid reasons for deviating from the guidelines, and strict adherence to guidelines and/or treatment thresholds may undermine the shared decision-making (SDM) approach that is now considered gold standard.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>
<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> SDM in the current context would entail that a GP assesses absolute CVD risk, explains this and the recommended management approach to the patient, discusses the benefits and harms of the different management options with the patient, and makes a shared decision with the patient. Our study and previous work suggests that many GPs do not base their recommendations on absolute risk, so it is unlikely that they can adequately inform their patients about the benefits and harms of CVD risk management and engage them in SDM.</p><p>Prescribing patterns were different for cholesterol and blood pressure medication. Although explanatory factors were not investigated in this study, historically, antihypertensive prescribing dates back to the late 1950s; hypertension was the first major CVD risk factor successfully treated.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> In contrast, there was controversy over the treatment of cholesterol until the large-scale trials of statins reported in the mid-1990s,<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> which coincided with the emergence of ideas and methods using absolute CVD risk. This history may have influenced the language used for these risk factors; &#x02018;hypertension&#x02019; is more commonly used than its lipid analogues such as &#x02018;hypercholesterolaemia&#x02019;.</p><p>The strengths of this study include the heterogeneity of the GPs who participated, and the systematic variation of cases, but there are also some limitations: First, the response rate was disappointing though typical for such GP studies.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> However, any bias in our sample is likely to favour GPs more interested and positive about absolute risk, although almost 15% of GPs in our study stated that they never use absolute risk in practice. Second, to keep cases simple and clear we were restrictive in the range of clinical variables and management options presented, excluding lifestyle modification although space was provided for comments. Third, we relied solely on self-reported intentions to prescribe in the different cases rather than actual prescribing behaviour. This allowed an experimental design, but the results may not reflect what is actually happening in clinical practice. However, our results are likely to be an over-estimate of the use of absolute risk in actual practice as the cases explicitly provided GPs with an absolute risk score. We know from our qualitative work that absolute risk is often not assessed in practice.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></p><p>In conclusion, GPs&#x02019; decision-making was more consistent with an individual risk factor approach than absolute risk, especially when prescribing blood pressure lowering medication. While more research to explore the cognitions behind these reported behaviours would be worthwhile, our study identifies a clear need to improve guideline recommendations about how GPs should integrate individual risk factor assessment with a management that is guided by absolute CVD risk.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e239" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2014-004812.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e240" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2014-004812.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank the general practitioners who participated in the study, Haryana Dhillon for assistance with administration and recruitment, Kristen Pickles and Corrinne Renton for assistance with data collection, Paige Bolton from the Heart Foundation for organising survey collection at their conference stalls, and Adam McSorley for assistance with data management.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> All the authors included in the paper fulfill the criteria of authorship.
