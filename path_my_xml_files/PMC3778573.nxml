Each year, 2.5% is added to the world population, which shifts the age ratio of the world toward the elderly.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>]</p><p>The elderly are increasing in Iran, too. Based on the 2006 census, 7 million people are over 60 years in Iran.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] They need special attention in various aspects. The elderly are vulnerable to both physical and mental disorders. Some mental problems are more prevalent during this period of life[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] including stress, which is a modern condition and underlies many physical and mental disorders.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>]</p><p>The elderly are exposed to different kinds of stresses like change in family structure, and physical and physiological changes. Furthermore, social effects such as retirement, death of friends, and reduced social activity cause stress.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>]</p><p>Considering all this, it is not possible to live without stress, either, but we have to learn how to cope with daily stresses and adapt our reactions to reduce their undesirable effects.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>]</p><p>Studies on the effect of stress management techniques including relaxation show that using these methods can significantly reduce stress and its destructive effects.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>]</p><p>In general, when it comes to changing human behavior in the field of health, health education and applying models is suggested. This helps explain how behaviors occur, how health education is applied, and how this education affects later behaviors.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>]</p><p>Among interventional studies on models and theories of behavior change, that of Hazavehei <italic>et al</italic>. may be mentioned. After implementing an educational program based on the PRECEDE model, the mean depression score in the intervention group reduced significantly as compared with the control group.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] In addition, Lesan <italic>et al</italic>. studied firefighters and found a significant reduction in their anxiety after implementing the PRECEDE model-based educational intervention for the case group.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>]</p><p>The PRECEDE model that is used in the studies mentioned is one of the most popular and common programming patterns in health education and health promotion.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>]</p><p>The PRECEDE (Predisposing, Reinforcing, Enabling Constructs in Educational Diagnosis and Evaluation) model was designed by Green <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] This model begins from the final results (causes) and proceeds in seven consecutive stages of design, implementation, and evaluation. This model was based on epidemiologic and social behavioral sciences, management, and education. It is a planning model; not a theory. This model sees healthy behavior as influenced by personal and environmental factors. It determines the factors that affect health status, helps planners achieve their goals through intervention, and designs steps to formulate policies and implement and evaluate educational programs.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>]</p><p>The results of studies on stress management showed that good planning makes various biological changes (like reducing hypertension) in a short time, but a comprehensive plan or a combination of individual with environmental programs is more effective and enables behavioral changes. The PRECEDE model is a similar program to manage stress.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] Therefore, this study aimed to determine the effect of the educational program based on the PRECEDE model on the stress of the elderly.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This study was quasi experimental and case control. The statistical society included the elderly (people over 60 years) in the elderly clubs of sixth and seventh regions of Tehran, which were selected by drawing lots. Because the number of the members of 60&#x02013;75 years at these clubs is low, eight clubs were randomly selected. In each region, members of two clubs were randomly assigned to the case group and those of two other clubs were assigned to the control group. A sample size with a confidence interval (CI) of 0.95 and power of 0.80 determined 44 for each group by using the following formula:</p><p>N=2(Z<sub>1</sub>+Z<sub>2</sub>)<sup>2</sup>.S<sup>2</sup>/d<sup>2</sup></p><p>To obtain the required number of subjects, 97 volunteers enrolled in the study, and in the end, 94 remained.</p><p>The data collection tool was in the form of two questionnaires. The standard questionnaire of DASS 21 was used to evaluate depression, anxiety, and stress. This questionnaire has 21 questions, of which seven questions are used for each set of symptoms. This questionnaire is designed as a four-point Likert scale with the following choices: Not at all, some of the time, good part of time, and most of the time.</p><p>The least score for each question was 0, and the highest score was 3, which were respectively assigned to the first and last choices. The questionnaire was completed as a self-report. Validity and reliability of the questionnaire have been evaluated and confirmed in several studies.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] In addition, several researchers in Iran have used this questionnaire for psychological studies.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>]</p><p>The next questionnaire was designed based on the PRECEDE model and had six sections. The first section covered demographics with 15 questions; the second section was about knowledge with nine questions where a correct answer had a score of 2, wrong answer had a score of 0, and &#x02018;I don&#x02019;t know&#x02019; had a score of 1. The third section was about attitude with 10 three-level Likert-style questions (agree, no idea, disagree). The fourth section covered enabling factors with five questions. The fifth section was about reinforcing factors with three questions and finally the sixth section was about functioning with seven questions. This questionnaire was designed after studying books and articles, and interviewing 30 elderly people at the clubs for the elderly of Tehran. Then it was validated by several lecturers of health education and psychology for validity of face and content, and their comments were used for validity. Reliability of the questionnaire was measured using 30 of the elderly people by internal correlation (a=0.86).</p><p>Both questionnaires were filled at two stages of pretest and at the end of the two-month educational intervention, in an interview with both groups of case and control. After the questionnaires were filled in the first stage, the data were analyzed and the content, objectives, and curriculum were adjusted based on these.</p><p>Educational intervention was carried out for eight weeks (one session per week). Mean duration of each session was 75 minutes (ranging 60&#x02013;90 minutes). The headings of the curriculum were determined for each session and included subjects like introduction to stress, its symptoms and complications, stress factors, the roles of nutrition, aromatherapy, massage, and laughter therapy in reducing stress, introduction to the role of social support as an important element in spiritual strengthening to combat stress factors, and introduction to relaxation behaviors, respiratory exercises, and stretch exercises suitable for stress reduction.</p><p>Educational pamphlets about introduction to stress, ways to cope with it, deep breathing, and relaxation along with a CD on relaxation were prepared. Lecture and question and answer sessions were held to increase knowledge of the participants. Group discussions about stress and positive experiences after practicing deep breathing and relaxation were held to change their attitude. Deep breathing and relaxation techniques were taught by the researcher, and in each session, the elderly were helped to relax. In addition, they shared their positive experiences at the beginning of each session to experience and reinforce replacement for others, and give them the opportunity to repeat these techniques at home. In this regard, they were given a sheet to record their exercises. Furthermore, friends and family members were allowed to attend educational sessions, and one session was held for questions and answers with families and friends to enhance their support. In the next stage, the educational program was implemented for the case group.</p><p>In the present study, educational resources included educational pamphlets, educators, educational classes, a CD on relaxation, educational photos, and slides about deep and correct breathing. The techniques included deep breathing, relaxation, stretch exercises, and hand and foot massage. Resources and skills were considered as enabling factors.</p><p>After executing the educational program, the effect of this program was evaluated on stress, and its predisposing, enabling, and reinforcing factors.</p><p>The collected data were analyzed by descriptive statistics (tables, mean, median&#x02026;.) and analytic statistics using the SPSS 15 software. Paired <italic>t</italic>-test and Wilcoxon test were used to compare mean score of predisposing, enabling, and reinforcing factors and mean of stress score and behaviors effective in preventing stress before and after education in each group. Independent <italic>t</italic>-test, Man-Whitney test, McNemar test, and chi square test were used to compare mean scores between the groups at two times.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Mean age of the participants in the case group and the control group was 63.68, and 64.42 years, respectively. In each group, there were 12 men and 35 women. The frequency of married people was 76.6% in both groups and 31.9% of the elderly in the case group and 40.4% of the elderly in the control group had a high-school diploma. In addition, 48.9% of the elderly in the case and 63.8% in the control groups lived with their spouse and single children. The independent <italic>t</italic>-test showed no significant difference between the groups in terms of the number of children. Totally, both groups were similar in background characteristics. Statistical tests did not find any differences between the two groups except for their current source of income.</p><p>There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of mean score of knowledge, attitude, functioning, and stress, but after the intervention, all the differences were significant.

This increase shows the effect of the PRECEDE model in increasing positive attitude. This finding has been confirmed in other studies that used the PRECEDE model including those by Lesan <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] Hazavehei <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] Moshki <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>] and Yates <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>]</p><p>In the PRECEDE model, predisposing factors such as attitude precede behavior, and provide the main reasons and motivation to improve the behavior.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] Therefore, positive attitude of the participants facilitated adopting ways to control stress.</p><p>It is necessary to focus on the point that emotional aspects are usually weakly addressed in health education, whereas most decisions about healthy behaviors are based on emotions and attitudes. Expressing emotions can reduce stress and anxiety, and improve the self-concept of the individual.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>] Therefore, we have tried to pay more attention to the emotional aspect in designing the educational content. The results are completely clear with regard to the changes.</p><p>With regard to using educational resources in terms of enabling factors before intervention, 12.8% of the case and 19.1% of the control group said that the resource they most used was mass media. This point shows that the importance of the educational content presented through mass media, especially their knowledge of relaxation as the main and most reliable way to manage stress and anxiety, was low.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>]</p><p>After educational intervention in the case group, both using the information provided by the trainer and educational pamphlets, were the most used resources (Frequency = 100%).

As a result, the factors of nonhealthy behaviors that predispose them to mental disorders reduce, thereby reducing health-care cost and improving their quality of life.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> This article was extracted from a Master's thesis in Isfahan University of Medical Sciences</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Tajvar</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Farzian</surname><given-names>Pour F</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Seniors&#x02019; health and review various aspects of their lives</article-title><year>2003</year><edition>1st ed</edition><publisher-loc>Tehran</publisher-loc><publisher-name>Nasle Farda Publication</publisher-name><fpage>21</fpage><lpage>8</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="webpage"><article-title>Statistical Center of Iran [Online]</article-title><year>2007</year><date-in-citation>Last cited on 2009 Feb 5</date-in-citation><comment>Available from:
