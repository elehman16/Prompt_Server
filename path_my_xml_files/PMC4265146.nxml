Control of myocardial iron is thus becoming the cornerstone of thalassaemia management. Recent evidence suggests a role for L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels in mediating iron uptake by the heart. Blocking the cellular iron uptake through these channels may add to the benefit of therapy to standard chelation in reducing myocardial iron. We aim to determine the efficacy of amlodipine (a calcium channel blocker) as an adjunct to standard aggressive chelation in retarding myocardial iron deposition in thalassaemics with or without cardiomyopathy.</p></sec><sec><title>Outcomes</title><p>The primary outcome is to compare the efficacy of amlodipine+chelation (intervention) versus standard chelation (control) in retarding myocardial iron deposition. Secondary outcomes include the effect of amlodipine therapy on systolic and diastolic function, strain and strain rate and liver iron content.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>This is a single-centre, parallel-group, prospective randomised control trial. Twenty patients will be randomised in a 1:1 allocation ratio into the intervention and control arms. In addition to conventional echocardiography, MRI T2* values for assessment of cardiac and liver iron load will be obtained at baseline and at 6 and 12&#x02005;months. Cardiac T2* will be reported as the geometric mean and per cent coefficient of variation, and an increase in cardiac T2* values from baseline will be used as an end point to compare the efficacy of therapy.

The estimated carrier rate is 5&#x02013;7%, which amounts to 9.8 million carriers in the entire population.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></p><p>Haemosiderosis due to transfusion treatments is a major cause of death in patients with thalassaemia major.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Iron overload can lead to iron deposits in many tissues, particularly in the heart. It has also been shown to be associated with elevated oxidative stress in tissues. Iron overload conditions can lead to increased iron uptake into myocardial cells, resulting in myocardial damage and failure.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4&#x02013;7</xref> Catastrophic deterioration in cardiac function resulting in death may occur rapidly once clinically obvious heart failure is present.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Therefore, heart disease is the most important complication and the major determinant of survival in patients with thalassaemia, responsible for more than half of the deaths in this population.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> It may take the form of cardiomyopathy, pulmonary hypertension, heart failure, arrhythmias, pericarditis and myocarditis.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9&#x02013;12</xref></p><p>Currently, the mechanism of iron uptake into myocardial cells is not clearly understood. Growing evidence suggests that L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (L-TCCs) are a possible pathway for ferrous iron (Fe<sup>2+</sup>) uptake into myocardial cells under iron overload conditions.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Several findings have been shown to support the role of L-TCC in myocardial iron transport.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> A study in an iron loaded rat heart showed that iron uptake was increased by the L-TCC agonist Bay K 8644 and inhibited by the L-TCC blocker nifedipine.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14&#x02013;16</xref> Oudit <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> demonstrated that treatments with L-TCC blockers such as amlodipine and verapamil could not only lead to the inhibition of the L-TCC current in myocardial cells, but also reduced myocardial iron accumulation, decreased oxidative stress and improved survival in iron-loaded mice.</p><p>Since iron overload patients can develop cardiomyopathy and heart failure,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>

<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> which serves as the major cause of death in these patients, it is important that the use of drugs such as amlodipine be studied for the prevention of myocardial iron deposition.</p><sec id="s1a"><title>Current clinical practice</title><p>In thalassaemia major, the current practice to prevent iron overload is to start chelation therapy after the first 10&#x02013;20 transfusions or when serum ferritin levels rise above 1000&#x02005;&#x000b5;g/L. The standard recommended method of administration of chelation therapy is slow subcutaneous infusion over 8&#x02013;12&#x02005;h of 10% deferoxamine (desferal) solution (DFO), using an infusion pump or oral deferasirox (DFX) or oral deferiprone (DFP). The standard dose of deferoxamine is 20&#x02013;40&#x02005;mg/kg for children and up to 50&#x02013;60&#x02005;mg/kg for adults as an 8&#x02013;12&#x02005;h subcutaneous infusion for a minimum of 3&#x02013;5 nights a week. Patients with high degrees of iron loading or those at increased risk of cardiac complications require adjustments in chelation therapy. The dose of oral deferasirox is 20&#x02013;40&#x02005;mg/kg/day. Recent studies suggest a possible synergistic effect of combination therapy of DFP with DFO, especially in reducing the myocardial iron load. This has led to multiple studies aimed at assessing the effectiveness of DFO, DFP and DFX either as monotherapy or as part of combination therapy in patients with transfusion-dependent thalassaemia. The multicentre, prospective Evaluation of Patients&#x02019; Iron Chelation with Exjade (EPIC) trial has demonstrated the effectiveness of DFX as monotherapy in reducing mild-to-moderate and severe myocardial iron load, as documented by improvements in cardiac T2* values at 12&#x02005;months,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> along with persistence of these improvements from baseline even after 24 and 36&#x02005;months of deferasirox treatment when evaluated in a substudy of these patients.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>
<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Pepe <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> demonstrated that the combined DFP+DFO regimen and DFP in monotherapy were not significantly different in removing myocardial iron and improving heart function, when followed up to 18&#x02005;months. Similarly, in a meta-analysis by Maggio <italic>et al</italic>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> myocardial iron concentration measured as T2* was found to be not statistically significantly different in the DFP+DFO versus the DFO-treated groups. This is in contrast to findings by Tanner <italic>et al</italic>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> who have demonstrated significant improvements in the combined treatment group compared with the deferoxamine group in myocardial T2* as well as absolute LVEF. Thus, algorithms involving single or combination chelation therapies have been developed and are used in different centres. As documented by Ver&#x000ed;ssimo <italic>et al</italic>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> the Scientific Committee of Associacao Brasileira de Thalassemia (ABRASTA) have proposed an evidence-based iron chelation protocol for patients with thalassaemia under regular transfusions, directed by the myocardial T2* values obtained. Attached as online supplementary appendix A, the protocol proves useful in helping to initiate appropriate chelation therapy particularly in the setting of severe myocardial iron overload.</p><p>With the growing evidence that suggests L-TCCs as a possible pathway for ferrous ions (Fe<sup>2+</sup>) uptake into myocardial cells,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> we hypothesise that the use of L-type calcium channel blockers such as amlodipine will lead to a reduction in this myocardial iron deposition.</p><sec id="s1a1"><title>Null hypothesis</title><p>There is no difference between the efficacy of chelation plus amlodipine therapy and chelation therapy alone in retarding the rate of myocardial iron deposition in patients with thalassaemia with iron overload and a constant transfusion need.</p></sec><sec id="s1a2"><title>Alternate hypothesis</title><p>Chelation plus amlodipine therapy is more efficacious than chelation therapy alone in retarding the rate of myocardial iron deposition in patients with thalassaemia with iron overload and a constant transfusion need.</p></sec><sec id="s1a3"><title>Primary objective</title><p>The aim of our study is to determine if amlodipine, an L-type specific calcium channel blocker, in addition to the standard aggressive chelation therapy, can retard the deposition of iron in the myocardium of patients with thalassaemia with significant myocardial iron load with or without cardiomyopathy.</p></sec><sec id="s1a4"><title>Secondary objectives</title><p>To determine if there is a difference in LV size, systolic and diastolic function in patients receiving amlodipine plus chelation therapy when compared with patients who receive only chelation therapy.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Operational definitions</title><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Myocardial iron load (see online <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bmjopen.bmj.com/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2014-005360/-/DC1">supplementary appendix</ext-link> B for study protocol):

The patients will be randomly assigned to either of the two intervention arms, amlodipine (0.1&#x02005;mg/kg/day or maximum of 2.5&#x02005;mg/day) plus chelation therapy or chelation therapy alone. Amlodipine is administered as a single daily dose. Recruited patients will receive treatment accordingly.

The chelation therapy is therefore left to the discretion of the treating haematologist. Since it is a single centre study and the patients are predominantly managed by two haematologists, we have been able to initiate the informal chelation protocol in our study patients, thus introducing standardisation of care. This, along with our current randomisation process, we hope, will help equally distribute the effect of the chelation in both the arms. On the basis of this reason, we have decided not to randomise on the type of chelation therapy.</p><sec id="s2g1"><title>Blinding</title><p>While the primary physician and the patients will be aware of the allocated arm, the readers involved in T2* assessment will be blinded to the allocated arm.

Younger children appear to require higher doses, often as much as 0.3&#x02013;0.4&#x02005;mg/kg/day.

The severe adverse effects of amlodipine, which may give rise to further complications, include peripheral oedema and sinus bradycardia. The contraindications to amlodipine use are hypotension, aortic stenosis and sinoatrial node disease.

The multiecho sequence parameters will be as follows: for the measurement of myocardial T2*, a single short axis mid-ventricular will be acquired at 10 echo times (1.99&#x02013;20.26&#x02005;ms, which will increase in 2.03&#x02005;ms increments) in a single breath-hold. A gradient-echo sequence will be used with a flip angle of 20&#x000b0;, a matrix of 90&#x02013;256 pixels, a field of view of 40&#x02005;cm, and a sampling bandwidth of 814&#x02005;Hz per pixel. The TR in between the 10 radio frequency pulses applied to each cardiac cycle will be 22.17&#x02005;ms. A homogeneous full-thickness region of interest (ROI) will be chosen in the LV septum, encompassing both epicardial and endocardial regions. The signal intensity of this region will be measured for each image using QMass V.7.6, MEDIS software, and will then be plotted against the echo time to form an exponential decay curve. To derive T2*, an exponential trend line will be fitted with an equation in the form y Ke&#x02013;TE/T2* where K represents a constant, TE represents the echo time and y represents the image signal intensity.</p><p>Given the known risk of sideroblastic cardiomyopathy in the hearts of patients with thalassaemia, we expect our T2* values to reflect this myocardial iron load as substantially shorter (4&#x02013;10&#x02005;ms) values. These values can potentially lead to a rapid decay in signal intensity with the signals of later echocardiography images buried in the background noise and motion.
