The major religious period of the Islamic calendar is Ramadan, which is considered as a period of purification, internal meditation and regeneration, when healthy postpubescent Muslims fast from dawn to sunset for 4&#x02005;weeks. During this whole month of Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF), they eat before dawn (Shaur meal) and after sunset (Iftar meal) without any dietary restriction and thus abstain from food and drink intake throughout the day that may lead to nutritional and behavioural changes.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1&#x02013;3</xref> Sleep deprivation, prevalence of irritability and headaches were also increased during this month.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p><p>During the month of Ramadan, both the food intake and sleep pattern become irregular and asymmetrical. The young Muslim men perform regular job-related physical activities that continue during the month of RIF. This might lead to a potential threat to the efficiency and safety of the concerned individuals. Hence, it is quite justified to speculate that RIF might have adverse effects on one's fitness profile. Therefore, this study was aimed at investigating the effects of RIF on selective fitness profile parameters of young untrained male Muslim individuals.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study protocol</title><p>The entire study was conducted in the Sports and Exercise Physiology Laboratory, Department of Physiology, University of Calcutta, India, during 8 June to 23 August 2013. Participants visited the laboratory on eight occasions which were divided into one familiarisation trial, one pre-experimental trial, five experimental trials and one postexperimental trial. The familiarisation trial, that is, the first study session, was conducted 15&#x02005;days before the month of Ramadan to explain and demonstrate to the participants about the experimental requirement as well as to familiarise them with the experimental procedures. Pre-Ramadan data were collected 7&#x02005;days before the month of Ramadan (pre-experimental trial). The next five sessions (ie, 1st&#x02013;5th experimental trials) were conducted on the 1st, 8th, 16th, 22nd and 30th day of the month of Ramadan. The remaining session, that is, the eighth session or postexperimental trial, was conducted 15&#x02005;days after the month of Ramadan to record the post-Ramadan values of the studied fitness profile parameters.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Selection of participants</title><p>Thirty-seven young Muslim untrained male participants (mean age: 22.62&#x000b1;1.77&#x02005;years, mean height: 164.71&#x000b1;7.76&#x02005;cm) who were undergoing RIF were recruited from different parts of Kolkata, India, as the experimental group (EG) of this longitudinal study. Another group of 40 untrained Muslim male participants (mean age: 23.00&#x000b1;1.48&#x02005;years, mean height: 165.27&#x000b1;4.26&#x02005;cm) who were not fasting during this period and not undergoing the rituals in the month of Ramadan were recruited from the same community as the control group (CG). All the participants belonged to the age group of 20&#x02013;25&#x02005;years with similar socioeconomic background. The sample size was calculated using the method of Das and Das<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> where the input of CI was set at 95%. The study was conducted with 37 and 40 participants in the experimental group and CG, respectively, which was greater than the computed sample size of 32 in each group.</p><p>Other than Muslim individuals or persons engaged in regular exercise, and under medication or with any history of health complication were excluded from the study. The experimental protocol was explained and demonstrated to all of them in the familiarisation trial to allay their apprehension. Each participant signed the written informed consent form.</p><p>EG abstained from eating and drinking during all the sessions according to the religious recommendations and all of them strictly followed the religious rules of the holy month. Participants in CG maintained their normal daily activities including food and water intake but abstained from any heavy work on the days of evaluation as per the objective of the study.</p><p>The age of each participant was calculated to the nearest year from the date of birth as obtained in the birth certificate. Participants arrived in the laboratory at 9:00 on all the occasions. Body height and body mass were measured with the participants standing barefoot and wearing minimum clothing on a weighing machine fitted with a height measuring rod (Avery India Ltd, India) with an accuracy of &#x000b1;0.50&#x02005;cm and &#x000b1;0.1&#x02005;kg, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Determination of VO<sub>2max</sub></title><p>Participants performed a warm-up exercise at 50&#x02005;W intensity for a duration of 5&#x02005;min on the Muller's magnetic brake bicycle ergometer (model of the Max-Planck Institute of Ergology, Germany).<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> After that, the working intensity was increased to the first incremental intensity of 100&#x02005;W and thereafter the intensity was increased by 20&#x02005;W every 3&#x02005;min until the participants stopped due to exhaustion. The criteria of exhaustion were set as:
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>A heartbeat within 10&#x02005;bpm of the age-predicted maximum heart rate;</p></list-item><list-item><p>A respiratory exchange ratio of more than 1.15;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Levelling off, that is, no further increase in oxygen uptake took place despite a further increase in work intensity, or the increase in oxygen uptake was less than 100&#x02005;mL/min. The expired gas was collected at the last minute of the exercise in a Douglas bag (150&#x02005;L) with the help of a low-resistance Collin's Triple &#x02018;J Type&#x02019; valve. A wet gasometer (Toshniwal, Germany, CAT. No. CG05.10) was used to measure the volume of expired gas. A Scholander microgas analysis apparatus was used to analyse the gas samples. Maximum oxygen uptake (VO<sub>2max</sub>) values were corrected to standard temperature pressure dry.</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Determination of HIE</title><p>High-intensity effort (HIE) was determined by a 60-yard dash test.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> This is a ladder shuttle of progressing distances. Three marker cones were placed at the yard lines 5&#x02005;yards apart. Participants started from one end, ran 5&#x02005;yards and came back to the start line, then rushed immediately to the 10&#x02005;yards mark and returned to the start line and finally rushed again to the 15&#x02005;yards mark and returned to finish at the start line. A total of 60&#x02005;yards were thus completed. In each step, the participants were asked to touch the line with their finger tips at each turn, for a total of five touches. The time taken for the entire running period was recorded by using a stopwatch.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Measurement of flexibility</title><p>Flexibility was determined by the modified sit and reach method.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Participants sat barefoot on the floor with legs stretched out straight ahead. The soles of the feet were placed flat against a wooden box. Both the knees were locked and pressed flat to the floor. With the palms facing downwards, and the hands on top of each other or side by side, the participants tried to reach forward along the measuring line as far as possible, ensuring that the hands remained at the same level, not one reaching further forward than the other. The participants reached out and held that position for 1 or 2&#x02005;s when the distance was recorded. A jerky movement of the arm or shoulder was avoided during this measurement.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Determination of agility by shuttle run test</title><p>Participants ran back and forth as fast as possible between two parallel lines which were set 30 feet apart.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Two wooden blocks were placed behind the line opposite to the start line. The participants started the run from the start line to other line and picked up one block and returned to place it behind the start line, and then again ran to pick up the second block and returned to place it back across the start line. The time taken for the entire running period was recorded using a stop watch.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Determination of VJT</title><p>The vertical jump score (VJT) of each participant was evaluated according to the procedure elaborated in an earlier report.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> The participant chalked his fingertips and stood side on to a wall and reached up with the hand closest to the wall. Keeping the feet flat on the ground, the point of the fingertip was marked or recorded. This was the standing reach height (M<sub>1</sub>). Then the participant jumped vertically from a static position as high as possible with the attempt to touch the wall at the highest point (M<sub>2</sub>) of the jump. The distance between M<sub>1</sub> and M<sub>2</sub> was measured. The participant repeated the test three times with a gap of at least 10&#x02005;min between the consecutive trials and the best of these three efforts was recorded.</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Determination of handgrip strength</title><p>Participants hold the dynamometer in the hand to be tested, with the arm at right angles and the elbow by the side of the body.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> The base of the dynamometer rests on the first metacarpal (heel of palm), while the handle rest on the middle of four fingers.

Bahammam<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> documented that sleep time was delayed in the first and third weeks of Ramadan compared with the regular month, and such delays in bedtime were coupled with a constant wake-up time which produced daytime fatigue.
