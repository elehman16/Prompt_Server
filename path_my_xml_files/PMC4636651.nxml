Outcome measures include: fatigue (the UK&#x02014;Chalder Fatigue Scale); Disability (the UK&#x02014;SF-36 physical function subscale; the Netherlands&#x02014;CHQ-CF87); school attendance, pain, anxiety and depression (the UK&#x02014;Hospital Anxiety &#x00026; Depression Scale, Spence Children's Anxiety Scale; the Netherlands&#x02014;Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children, Children's Depression Inventory); symptoms; time-to-assessment; and body mass index. We used multinomial regression to compare younger (aged &#x0003c;12&#x02005;years) and older (aged 12&#x02013;18&#x02005;years) children with adults, and logistic regression to compare UK and Dutch adolescents.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Younger children had a more equal gender balance compared to adolescents and adults. Adults had more disability and fatigue, and had been ill for longer. Younger children were less likely to have cognitive symptoms (OR 0.18 (95% CI 0.13 to 0.25)) and more likely to present with a sore throat (OR 1.42 (1.07 to 1.90). Adolescents were more likely to have headaches (81.1%, OR 1.56 (1.36% to 1.80%)) and less likely to have tender lymph nodes, palpitations, dizziness, general malaise and pain, compared to adults. Adolescents were more likely to have comorbid depression (OR 1.51 (1.33 to 1.72)) and less likely to have anxiety (OR 0.46 (0.41 to 0.53)) compared to adults.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Paediatricians need to recognise that children with CFS/ME present differently from adults.

Younger children were more likely to present with sore throat and were less likely to have sleep or memory problems, often considered cardinal symptoms in adults. Adolescents were more likely to present with cognitive and sleep dysfunction than were younger children, but less likely to present with tender lymph nodes and dizziness. Despite differences in sampling, UK adolescents with CFS/ME were similar to teenagers in the Netherlands, suggesting that the symptomatology of paediatric CFS/ME is generalisable to other populations and is robust across different healthcare settings.</p><p>The main strengths of this study were the large sample sizes, and the fact that symptoms and comorbid mood disorders were collected in the same way in UK children and adults. Adults and children were recruited from specialist CFS/ME services in the UK and the Netherlands, so the results may not be generalisable to other settings, such as primary care. Fatigue, disability, pain and mood were measured differently in the UK and the Netherlands, making it difficult to directly compare these characteristics. Also, while there is evidence for the validity and reliability of these instruments for adults diagnosed with CFS/ME,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> their use among paediatric CFS/ME patients has not been thoroughly evaluated,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> and we cannot assume that scores for adults, adolescents and children are comparable.</p><p>Data for UK adolescents were collected routinely as this group attended specialist CFS/ME services, whereas data for Dutch adolescents were obtained from a clinical trial. In the Dutch cohort, CFS/ME was diagnosed or confirmed in a tertiary academic hospital setting. However, since referrals were obtained nationwide from various sources (general practitioners as well as paediatricians), we consider that our study population was representative of the Dutch paediatric CFS/ME population.</p><p>The differences in symptom presentation that we found between younger and older children were not found in our previous comparison of these age groups,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> probably because this earlier study was insufficiently powered to detect such differences. It is striking that the gender balance is more equal in younger children (57% female), compared to adolescents (74.1%) and adults (77.9%). This shift in gender balance is consistent with population data, where an equal gender balance (49.6% female) has been described in a population cohort at age 13&#x02005;years.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Studies recruiting teenagers from secondary schools have consistently shown a female-to-male ratio of approximately 3:1,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>
<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> suggesting that, during adolescence, the prevalence of CFS/ME increases in females but not in males.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></p><p>Adolescents from the UK and the Netherlands presented with similar symptoms, although headaches were less common, and postexertional malaise, severe pain and mood disorders were more common in UK patients. The difference in postexertional malaise could be explained by the fact that this is considered a cardinal symptom in the UK. The lower prevalence of anxiety and depression in the Dutch cohort could be because high scores for mood disorder were a reason for further psychological assessment to exclude primary mood disorders, leading to possible exclusion from the study. Also, the UK and Dutch cohorts used different instruments to measure mood (and pain), and this is likely to contribute to discrepancies when these measures are categorised to indicate presence/absence (or degree) of symptoms.</p><p>Paediatricians need to be aware that children with CFS/ME present differently from adults with CFS/ME. Younger children are more likely to present with recurrent sore throats and teenagers are likely to present with headaches. Further research should investigate whether these differences in presentation reflect the underlying aetiopathology or explain prognostic differences.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> This study was conceived by EC.
