The intervention consists of a tailored, home-based balance training delivered through a tablet computer. Intervention participants will be asked to complete 2&#x02005;h of exercises per week for 2&#x02005;years. Both groups will receive an education programme focused on health-related information relevant to older adults, delivered through the tablet computer via weekly fact sheets. Primary outcome measures include number of fallers and falls rate recorded in weekly fall diaries at 12 months. A sample size of 500 will be necessary to see an effect on falls rate. Secondary outcome measures include concern about falling, depressive symptoms, health-related quality of life and physical activity levels (in all 500 participants); and physiological fall risk, balance, functional mobility, gait, stepping and cognitive performance (in a subsample of 200 participants). Adherence, acceptability, usability and enjoyment will be recorded in intervention group participants over 2 years. Data will be analysed using the intention-to-treat principle. Secondary analyses are planned in people with greater adherence.

This impact will grow substantially in the near future due to the increased proportion of older people in the population. Furthermore, the personal and societal impact from falls is enormous due to mobility-related disability and loss of independence. Developing and implementing effective strategies that prevent falls and mobility problems among older people is, therefore, an urgent public health issue.</p><p>There is clear evidence that falls in older people can be prevented with appropriately designed intervention programmes. A Cochrane systematic review concluded that exercise is one of the single most effective strategies to reduce the rate of falls in older adults.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> There is also systematic review evidence that, to be effective in preventing falls, exercise programmes must include at least moderately challenging balance exercises and be performed frequently (ie, for more than 2&#x02005;h a week over a 6-month period).<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> If well-designed, exercise programmes can reduce falls by 42%, as demonstrated by pooled results from 44 trials (pooled rate ratio 0.58, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.69),<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> and for up to 2&#x02005;years in people who continue to exercise.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> However, sustained adherence in effective trials is poor with median reported adherence rates of 52% (range 43&#x02013;61%) at 12&#x02005;months,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> dropping down to 35% at 2&#x02005;years.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Therefore, in order to prevent falls at the public health level, strategies that optimise long-term adherence to balance training programmes are needed.</p><p>The incorporation of regular exercise as a consistent lifestyle behaviour (ie, more than 2&#x02005;h per week) is not easy for many older people due to poor exercise tolerance and lack of enjoyment. Several factors create barriers to exercise uptake and adherence, including lack of interest in the exercise programme, low expectation of positive outcomes, fear of falling and adverse weather.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> A large survey in 5440 older adults indicated that home-based exercises were preferred over other fall prevention strategies and this was particularly so in older and more socially disadvantaged people who are a high risk of falling.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> A recent systematic review further highlighted that the inclusion of balance training was associated with the best adherence to home exercise programmes.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> This indicates that a well-designed home-based balance training programme has the potential to be widely adopted by older people as a fall prevention strategy.</p><p>Recent advances in smart phones and tablet computers offer viable, inexpensive and highly accessible means to deliver health messages, and to motivate and guide people to make lifestyle changes. Smart phone apps are currently used for management of chronic diseases, such as diabetes and cardiac rehabilitation, as well as to deliver exercise programmes. Using apps to deliver balance training to older people at risk of falls may enable greater choice in preferred exercise options, increased convenience and accessibility, and instil a greater level of engagement through immediate performance feedback. While many apps are available, few have been evaluated in rigorously conducted clinical trials.</p><p>We have developed an engaging home-based exercise programme delivered through a tablet computer in line with current evidence-based principles to prevent falls and maximise long-term adherence. The programme is called <italic>Standing Tall</italic>. It offers tailored and progressive balance exercises and an in built coach to encourage users to exercise at the desired frequency. This randomised controlled trial (RCT) aims to determine the effect of <italic>Standing Tall</italic> on fall rate and known fall risk factors (including balance, gait, concern about falling and physical activity levels) in older people over a 24-month follow-up period, when compared with a health promotion education &#x02018;control&#x02019; programme. The trial will also establish predictors of adherence to the exercise programme and estimate the cost-effectiveness of this approach.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods and analysis</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Trial design</title><p>An RCT will be conducted to examine the effectiveness of a home-based balance training programme delivered through a tablet computer.

The exercise trainer will perform an inbuilt initial balance assessment to ensure that the exercises are tailored to the participant's balance abilities. The exercise trainer will deliver exercise instructions and also explain how to use other features of the <italic>Standing Tall</italic> app (eg, scheduling exercises, tracking progress, setting goals), and use additional features of the tablet computer (eg, app store, browsing the internet, emails). Participants will receive a follow-up home visit at 1&#x02005;month (approximately 1&#x02005;h) to ensure safe use and progression of training, provide help with setting individual goals, and discuss any issues related to using the programme.</p><p>The exercises are designed to train static balance (semi-tandem, tandem, standing on one leg) and dynamic balance (leaning balance, walking), while also training on an unstable surface (ie, foam cushion), stepping in different directions on the exercise mat and stepping on a box. Instructions on how to perform each exercise will be provided with on-screen text, video demonstrations and voice-over instructions. The exercises will be tailored to the participant's balance abilities over the duration of the trial. The intensity of the balance exercises will be monitored continuously using a modified rate of perceived exertion (RPE) scale and adjusted as performance improves to ensure that exercises remain challenging. Progression of training intensity will be guided by an inbuilt coach that uses RPE scale data from their recent training activity. To maintain participant engagement and adherence, new exercises will be introduced based on progression rules.</p><p>The initial exercise duration is set at 40&#x02005;min per week (weeks 1 and 2), and gradually increases to 60&#x02005;min (weeks 3 and 4), 80&#x02005;min (weeks 5 and 6), 100&#x02005;min (weeks 7 and 8) and 120&#x02005;min from week 9 onwards. Participants will be encouraged to exercise at least 120&#x02005;min per week for 2&#x02005;years in line with current evidence.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> The activity planner will help participants to schedule their exercises (with reminder notifications). The goal setting component will help participants to set and monitor personal goals. Participant adherence (training duration and frequency) will be monitored following automatic data transfer to a server and will be examined weekly. Participants will also be reminded of their training duration within the app. Participants not engaging in the minimum weekly training duration for two consecutive weeks will be contacted by phone to discuss any issues and to encourage adherence for the first 6&#x02005;months. Phone support will be available and additional home visits will be offered as needed or requested for the duration of the study (ie, 2&#x02005;years).</p><p>Participants in both intervention and control groups will receive the <italic>Standing Tall</italic> education programme containing health-related information relevant to older adults. The health education programme is also delivered through the tablet computer. A message will alert participants that a new &#x02018;fact sheet&#x02019; can be viewed by automated weekly updates for the duration of the trial. The education content includes information on general health, medications, good sleep, diet, depression, how to talk to medical professionals, etc. It also includes fall-specific information on known risk factors for falls and evidence-based prevention strategies. Systematic review evidence has shown that falls cannot be reduced by increasing knowledge about fall prevention<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>; therefore, the provision of education material alone is considered a suitable control intervention. All participants are instructed on how to use the <italic>Standing Tall</italic> education programme during the baseline assessment as well as to provide data on falls and health service use, and complete the reassessment questionnaires. The control group is followed up by a phone call at 1&#x02005;week and again at 1&#x02005;month from their start in the trial, to discuss any issues with accessing the health education programme, using additional features of the tablet computer and data collection. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2015009173F2">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref> shows the study design.</p><fig id="BMJOPEN2015009173F2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>Study design.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen2015009173f02"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Outcomes</title><sec id="s2f1"><title>Data collection</title><p>Assessments will be conducted by trained research assistants with a health science background and will involve questionnaires, and physical and cognitive performance assessments (<xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2015009173TB1">table 1</xref>).

Participants may withdraw from the study for any reason at any time or may be withdrawn by the study investigators if they are unwilling or unable to comply with the study procedures. Once a participant is randomised, study staff will make every effort to follow-up the participant on outcome measures for the entire study period. All data will be stored securely at the study site, and participant information will be stored in locked cabinets in areas with limited access.</p></sec><sec id="s2f2"><title>Measures</title><p>The primary outcome measures include the number of fallers and falls rate at 12 months.

Utility-based quality of life (EQ-5D and AQoL-6D) will be measured at baseline and at 6, 12, 18 and 24&#x02005;months, allowing calculation of QALYs over the 24-month study duration. The base QALY analysis will use the EQ-5D, with AQoL-6D values being used in a sensitivity analysis. By using mean costs in each trial arm and mean health outcomes in each arm, the incremental cost per fall prevented and incremental cost per QALY gained of the intervention group compared with control group will also be calculated. Sensitivity analyses will be performed to assess the robustness of our base-case findings. We will conduct one-way and multiway sensitivity analyses, and a probabilistic sensitivity analyses to estimate the joint uncertainty in cost and effect parameters. The probability that the intervention is cost-effective, given a decision maker's willingness to pay for each additional unit of health outcome achieved, will be estimated by bootstrapping of costs and health outcomes. As the underlying willingness to pay is unknown, the probability of the intervention being cost-effective will be presented as a function of a varying willingness to pay in cost-effectiveness acceptability curves.</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Sample size</title><p>A sample size calculation (5% significance level, 80% power, 33% effect and 20% dropout rate) indicated a sample size of 500 will be necessary to see an effect on the fall rate.

However, poor compliance with the recommended duration of 2&#x02005;h of exercise per week calls for new alternatives. This trial involves the use of a tablet computer for delivering an innovative home-based balance training programme that has the potential to be effective, cost-effective and sustainable. The <italic>Standing Tall</italic> programme incorporates evidence-based exercises to prevent falls and behavioural techniques to enhance long-term exercise adherence, using a person-centred approach while embracing new and emerging technologies. Delivery of the intervention through a tablet computer allows real-time data gathering and is particularly appropriate for providing the tailored support that is needed towards effective fall prevention in older people. It may also enable greater choice in preferred exercise options, greater level of engagement, increased convenience and increased accessibility of health services to large populations. With growing popularity of tablet computers, it is anticipated that this mode of healthcare delivery will become increasingly widespread.</p><p>This project will be the first RCT to evaluate the effectiveness of a home-based exercise programme delivered through a tablet computer for preventing falls in older community-dwelling people. The 2-year duration of the trial will allow the evaluation of long-term adherence to the programme and predictors of adherence to the programme. The project will also include an economic analysis to provide information for future implementation. Outcomes will be disseminated through publication in peer-reviewed journals and presentations at international conference meetings. The completion of this trial is expected by the end of 2018.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> KD conceived the idea for the trial.
