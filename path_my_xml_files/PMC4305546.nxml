on foot pressure in elderly women. [Subjects and Methods] Twenty elderly people in local
communities performed dual-task gait training for 20 minutes three times per week for 8
weeks. Foot pressure was measured using an F-scan System (Tekscan, South Boston, MA, USA)
before the intervention and in the 4th and 8th weeks of the intervention. [Results] Foot
pressure increased significantly between the 4th and 8th weeks of the intervention in the
CFF (central forefoot); between before the intervention and the 4th week, between the 4th
and 8th weeks, and between before the intervention and the 8th week in the MF (midfoot);
and between before the intervention and the 4th and 8th weeks in the HL (heel).
[Conclusion] The results of this study indicate that dual-task gait training may improve
the gait ability of elderly persons residing in the community.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Aging</kwd><kwd>Gait</kwd><kwd>Dual tasks</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Gait is important in daily life and determines functional independency of activities of
daily living (ADL), which affects quality of life<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Generally, one foot is advanced forward while the other supports
the body weight during gait, with the stance phase and swing phase taking place in both feet
alternately and the COG (center of gravity) moving to the outside of the BOS (base of
support) temporarily, causing an increase in instability of posture, which leads to balance
control to correct the instability<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
feet are important in this balance control; they store and release energy for movement as
they make contact with the ground during gait to provide momentum and to change direction,
and they absorb shock in this process and directly control the balance of the body to
prevent falls<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Elderly people experience a functional change in the feet due to aging. Therefore, their
feet fail to work normally, causing a decrease in posture stability, and they can also have
problems with cognitive functions that control movement, causing a risk of falls due to
decreases in gait ability and balance control ability<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Dual-task training is widely used to reduce the risk of falls, and
it trains not only the physical part of gait but also the cognitive part to increase
stability and gait ability<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. It is also known that proper weight distribution and foot
function can be analyzed by measuring foot pressure<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of dual-task
gait training on foot pressure in elderly women.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study was conducted with 20 elderly women who resided in communities in D city. The
selection criteria for the subjects were as follows: at least 65&#x02005;years old, no falls within
the last year, and no disease that might affect conduct of the test. Those who had visual
impairments, hearing damage, or nervous system or vestibular organ problems or were unable
to understand the nature of the experiment were excluded. All the subjects understood the
purpose of this study and provided written informed consent prior to participation in the
study in accordance with the ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinki.</p><p>The average age, height, and weight of the subjects were 80.1&#x000b1;2.1&#x02005;years, 157.1&#x000b1;6.4&#x02005;cm, and
53.5&#x000b1;7.2&#x02005;kg, respectively. Dual-task gait training was performed by adding the task of
holding a tray containing a paper cup filled to 80% of its capacity with water to the task
of walking 5&#x02005;m. The subjects performed the training for 20 minutes three times per week for
8 weeks. Subjects had plenty of rest during the training when fatigued. An F-scan system
(Tekscan, South Boston, MA, USA) was placed in the subjects&#x02019; shoes in the form of insoles to
measure foot pressure during training. The plantar side of the foot, the measurement point
for foot pressure, was divided into 8 parts, the HL (heel), MF (midfoot), MFF (medial
forefoot), CFF (central forefoot), LFF (lateral forefoot), Mt (medial toe), and Lt (lesser
toe).</p><p>SPSS for Windows (version 20.0) was used to analyze the data. Repeated measure ANOVA was
used to examine foot pressure according to gait period, and Fisher&#x02019;s Least Significant
Difference test was used for post hoc analysis. The statistical significance level was set
to &#x003b1; = 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Foot pressure increased significantly between the 4th and 8th weeks of the intervention in

study. Performing dual-task gait training can be very effective, since it trains not only
physical parts but also cognitive parts<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Additionally, foot function is most
important in gait because the feet perform an essential role in balance control by absorbing
shock, providing momentum, and changing directions. Foot function can be examined through
measurement of foot pressure<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, gait and foot function were evaluated by
measuring foot pressure before dual-task gait training and at 4 and 8 weeks of dual-task
gait training.</p><p>Generally, elderly people experience changes in foot function due to aging. In the case of
plantar pressure, the foot COP (center of pressure) in the elderly is less evenly
distributed over the foot than in younger people, and this asymmetric plantar pressure
inhibits the normal foot functions that absorb shock and support the body weight. Generally,
the feet shift body weight to the midfoot and heel through the longitudinal arch, but
repeated asymmetrical transfer of the body weight to the midfoot and heel causes a decrease
in proprioception and structural deformity of the foot, which leads to instability of the
gait<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. The foot was divided into 7 parts to evaluate foot pressure in
this study, and a gradual increase in foot pressure in the central forefoot and midfoot was
observed during the intervention. Foot pressure increased significantly between before the
intervention and the 4th week, between the 4th and 8th weeks, and between before the
intervention and the 8th week in the midfoot and between before the intervention and the 4th
and 8th weeks in the heel. As a result, weight distribution increased after 4 weeks in the
midfoot and heel and after 8 weeks in the central forefoot, midfoot, and heel during the
dual-task gait training, which is consistent with the results of the research of Redmond et
al. in that the shock absorbing arch support mechanism of the foot, if it functioned
normally, shifted loads in the forefoot and heel to the midfoot and increased the pressure
value in Redmond&#x02019;s study; therefore, the function of the longitudinal arch is considered to
be performed properly as a result of dual-task gait training<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. The foot pressure values of the heel and midfoot are most affected
by heel strike and midstance. The results of this study, that the pressure in the heel and
midfoot increased, indicate an improvement in stability, as in that study of Kimmeskamp et
al., who also showed that the heel strike and midstance components of the gait can be
strengthened<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Control of foot pressure control while standing is related to cognitive function and
improvement of cognitive function through task training can improve gait and posture
stability<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, dual-task
gait training can be more effective for posture stability, gait ability, and preventing
falls. A limitation of this study is that representativeness could not be secured because
the number of subjects was relatively low. The duration of the improved balance and gait
ability in the elderly resulting from dual-task gait training should be investigated through
follow-up testing.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Barr</surname><given-names>EL</given-names></name><name><surname>Browning</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Lord</surname><given-names>SR</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Foot and leg problems are important determinants of
