This study provided the first evidence of the feasibility of such training using a battery of tasks intended to target visual attentional control in children with autism spectrum disorder within school-based settings. Twenty-seven children were recruited and randomly assigned to either training or an active control group. Of these, 19 completed the initial assessment, and 17 (9 trained and 8 control) completed all subsequent training sessions. Training of 120&#x02009;min was administered per participant, spread over six sessions (on average). Compliance with the training tasks was generally high, and evidence of within-task training improvements was found. A number of untrained tasks to assess transfer of training effects were administered pre- and post-training. Changes in the trained group were assessed relative to an active control group. Following training, significant and selective changes in visual sustained attention were observed. Trend training effects were also noted on disengaging visual attention, but no convincing evidence of transfer was found to non-trained assessments of saccadic reaction time and anticipatory looking. Directions for future development and refinement of these new training techniques are discussed.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>attention</kwd><kwd>autism</kwd><kwd>cognitive training</kwd><kwd>eye movements</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="section1-1362361315617880"><title>Introduction</title><p>Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are neurodevelopmental disorders characterised by impairments in social interaction and communication, and the presence of restrictive, repetitive patterns of behaviour (<xref rid="bibr2-1362361315617880" ref-type="bibr">APA, 2013</xref>). Although they are not a diagnostic feature, aspects of atypical attention have frequently been reported to be part of the cognitive profile of ASD (see <xref rid="bibr1-1362361315617880" ref-type="bibr">Ames and Fletcher-Watson, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bibr19-1362361315617880" ref-type="bibr">Keehn et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bibr23-1362361315617880" ref-type="bibr">Orekhova and Stroganova, 2014</xref>, for review). Furthermore, difficulties have been reported in aspects of volitional attention control not only in social but also in non-social situations (e.g. <xref rid="bibr5-1362361315617880" ref-type="bibr">Benson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bibr20-1362361315617880" ref-type="bibr">Kourkoulou et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bibr21-1362361315617880" ref-type="bibr">Leekam et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, recent research into the emergence of the ASD phenotype suggests that differences in aspects of attention appear very early in ASD symptomatology. Research suggests that difficulties that might be specific to social orienting are <italic>not</italic> generally detectable at very early stages of development (<xref rid="bibr15-1362361315617880" ref-type="bibr">Jones et al., 2014</xref>). Instead, infants who later develop ASD are similar to typically developing infants in their orienting to faces (<xref rid="bibr9-1362361315617880" ref-type="bibr">Elsabbagh et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref rid="bibr44-1362361315617880" ref-type="bibr">Young et al., 2009</xref>) and to social movement (e.g. eyes, mouth or hands movement; <xref rid="bibr8-1362361315617880" ref-type="bibr">Elsabbagh et al., 2013a</xref>). However, impairments in domain-general aspects of development, including in aspects of non-social attention, <italic>have</italic> been noted very early in infants who later receive a diagnosis of ASD. For example, <xref rid="bibr6-1362361315617880" ref-type="bibr">Elison et al. (2013)</xref> found that infants who later develop ASD are slower to disengage attention at 7-month-old infants, and <xref rid="bibr41-1362361315617880" ref-type="bibr">Wass et al.

The ability to regulate and direct attention releases the child from the limitation of passively responding to environmental events, which means that they are able to actively guide their attention towards the information-rich areas key for learning (<xref rid="bibr29-1362361315617880" ref-type="bibr">Ruff and Rothbart, 1996</xref>; <xref rid="bibr30-1362361315617880" ref-type="bibr">Scerif, 2010</xref>). Individual differences in aspects of attentional control have been shown to correlate with early language development (<xref rid="bibr16-1362361315617880" ref-type="bibr">Kannass and Oakes, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bibr27-1362361315617880" ref-type="bibr">Rose et al., 2009</xref>) and early learning in academic settings (<xref rid="bibr25-1362361315617880" ref-type="bibr">Razza et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bibr28-1362361315617880" ref-type="bibr">Rose et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bibr32-1362361315617880" ref-type="bibr">Steele et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bibr43-1362361315617880" ref-type="bibr">Welsh et al., 2010</xref>). It is thought that early disruptions in aspects of attention control can lead to cascade-like patterns of subsequently impaired learning across a range of domains (<xref rid="bibr14-1362361315617880" ref-type="bibr">Johnson, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bibr18-1362361315617880" ref-type="bibr">Karmiloff-Smith, 2009</xref>). Thus, targeting attention training at a young age could facilitate improvements in other areas of development.</p><p>A variety of treatment techniques exist for ASDs. Of the non-pharmacological interventions available, currently the largest evidence base exists for early, intensive behavioural interventions (<xref rid="bibr26-1362361315617880" ref-type="bibr">Reichow, 2012</xref>). Significant intervention effects have been demonstrated both on core ASD symptomology and on more general cognitive performance (<xref rid="bibr36-1362361315617880" ref-type="bibr">Wallace and Rogers, 2010</xref>). However, the staffing costs of these kinds of intervention can be formidable: typically home-based, early interventions commonly last 2+ years and involve clinician care for upwards of 40&#x02009;h per week.</p><p>Relatively, little research, however, has examined the effect of applying targeted cognitive training to individuals with ASD (<xref rid="bibr39-1362361315617880" ref-type="bibr">Wass and Porayska-Pomsta, 2013</xref>). Cognitive training regimes target particular, pre-defined cognitive domains. Evidence from cognitive training studies has shown that cognitive training can lead to changes in a variety of non-trained aspects of behaviour, such as learning in academic and other social settings. Moreover, training effects are generally found to be stronger, when training is applied at early stages of development (<xref rid="bibr38-1362361315617880" ref-type="bibr">Wass, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bibr42-1362361315617880" ref-type="bibr">Wass et al., 2012</xref>). This study examined the feasibility of targeted cognitive training aimed at improving visual attention control, delivered via a gaze-contingent interface. In gaze-contingent interfaces, participants view a screen that has an eyetracker attached, and different events take place contingent on where on-screen the participant is looking. There is no need to interface via a keyboard or mouse, and no verbal instructions are involved (<xref rid="bibr39-1362361315617880" ref-type="bibr">Wass and Porayska-Pomsta, 2013</xref>).</p><p>The training interfaces used in this study are based on those developed for typical infants and toddlers by <xref rid="bibr37-1362361315617880" ref-type="bibr">Wass et al. (2011)</xref>. In this previous study, a battery of gaze-contingent training tasks targeting the cognitive domains of interference resolution, inhibition, task-switching and working memory was administered to typically developing 11-month-old infants across four visits. Training effects were assessed relative to a control group. Immediately after training, improvements in attentional disengagement, saccadic reaction time (RT), cognitive control and visual sustained attention were observed (<xref rid="bibr37-1362361315617880" ref-type="bibr">Wass et al., 2011</xref>), as well as marginally non-significant changes in looking behaviour during free play. No changes were found in working memory. Ballieux and colleagues investigated whether these training effects could be replicated with typically developing infants (12-month olds) from low socio-economic status backgrounds (<xref rid="bibr3-1362361315617880" ref-type="bibr">Ballieux et al., in press</xref>). The training was administered in community settings. Significant transfer of training improvements was again observed on most but not all tasks.</p><sec id="section2-1362361315617880"><title>The present study</title><p>In this pilot study, we wished to evaluate the feasibility of applying gaze-contingent attentional control training paradigms, which previously had been used in both laboratory and community settings with infants, to children with ASD. To do this, we addressed three questions: (1) Are school-based training environments suitable for hosting this kind of repeat-visit training study? (2) Can sufficiently good quality data be collected in these settings, and with these populations? (3) Are training tasks sufficiently difficult and engaging to maintain interest over multiple sessions in children?</p><p>We recruited children with ASD aged 3&#x02013;9&#x02009;years &#x02013; including severely impaired as well as less severely impaired individuals. We used similar measures to those included in the original study (<xref rid="bibr37-1362361315617880" ref-type="bibr">Wass et al., 2011</xref>). A battery of four gaze-contingent training tasks targeting interference resolution, inhibition, visual search, online goal maintenance and task-switching was administered across a number of visits to the school. Before and after training, a battery of assessment tasks was administered to measure visual sustained attention, saccadic RT, attentional disengagement latencies and anticipatory saccades. The effect of training was assessed relative to a control group, also with ASD, who attended an equal number of sessions, but, instead of training, watched age-appropriate videos and animations while their gaze was monitored by the eyetracker. We expected that, consistent with previous research, training would lead to improvements in a variety of untrained aspects of attentional control. Specifically, we predicted (based on <xref rid="bibr37-1362361315617880" ref-type="bibr">Wass et al., 2011</xref>) that the trained group would show (1) a selective increase in looking time in the sustained attention task, (2) reduced attentional disengagement latencies, (3) faster saccadic RTs and (4) faster anticipatory saccades.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="section3-1362361315617880"><title>Methods</title><sec id="section4-1362361315617880"><title>Participants</title><p>Participants were recruited from three schools in South Wales (one mainstream, two special needs).

Of these, eight failed to complete the pre-testing battery at either the first or second attempt, and so were excluded from subsequent participation in the study. A further two children (one trained and one control) were subsequently excluded as they failed to complete more than 60&#x02009;min of training or control sessions.

If no look was registered within 4000&#x02009;ms, the trial ended with no reward sequence. RT was coded as the latency between the appearance of the target and the first saccade to the target. If an anticipatory saccade had taken place during the 1000&#x02009;ms ISI, this was recorded as a negative RT. Participants were excluded if fewer than eight usable trials were registered per condition.</p></sec><sec id="section10-1362361315617880"><title>Attentional disengagement latencies/saccadic RT</title><p>After fixating a CT (a cartoon flower, 4.5&#x000b0;), a lateral target (LT, a cartoon cloud, 3&#x000b0;) was presented to the left or right; when the participant fixated the LT, s(he) received a brief audio-visual reward. Two conditions were presented: baseline &#x02013; CT disappears concurrently with LT appearance; overlap &#x02013; CT remains on-screen with LT appearance. This task was presented in three blocks of 12 trials. The RT was the time elapsed between LT appearance and the reported position of gaze leaving the central fixation area (a 9&#x000b0; box around the CT). RTs less than 100 and greater than 2000&#x02009;ms were excluded. If the participant was still fixating the CT at the end of the 2000&#x02009;ms window, their response was coded as 2000&#x02009;ms. Participants from whom fewer than six usable trials per condition were obtained were excluded from further analyses. Of note, this threshold is lower than the threshold of 12 usable trials per condition that was used in previous research. Setting a lower threshold was necessitated by the high rates of data drop-out observed on this task (see Supplementary Materials). Disengagement latencies were calculated as the participant&#x02019;s average RT in the overlap condition subtracted from their average RT in the baseline condition (<xref rid="bibr10-1362361315617880" ref-type="bibr">Elsabbagh et al., 2009</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="section11-1362361315617880"><title>Training battery</title><p>The training battery consisted of four different training tasks, targeting a combination of interference resolution, inhibition, visual search, online goal maintenance and task-switching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1362361315617880">Figure 2</xref>). These were presented in rotation, in an order that was counterbalanced between visits and between participants.

A target (a butterfly) (subtending 6&#x000b0;) was presented on the screen. When the child fixated the target, the butterfly &#x02018;flew&#x02019; across the screen, and distractors (a house, a tree, clouds, 5&#x02013;15&#x000b0;) scrolled in the opposite direction. When the child looked to one of the distractors, they disappeared and only the target, now static, remained on-screen. Once the target was re-fixated, it re-commenced moving and the distractors re-appeared and continued scrolling. The salience of the distractors changed adaptively, including faster, larger and more densely packed objects. This task rewards a child for maintaining their fixation on one target, and suppressing the pre-potent response to look towards moving distractors in the periphery.</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Task 2 (FlyMe)</italic>. A target (a purple character) (subtending 6&#x000b0;) was presented on the screen. When the child fixated the target, the character &#x02018;flew&#x02019; upwards, and a number of distractors, such as clouds, appeared from the top of the screen. When the child looked to any of the distractors, the character began rapidly to sink towards the bottom of the screen and the distractors disappeared from the top of the screen. As the character &#x02018;flew&#x02019; higher, the background became darker and the distractors more salient, including rockets, planets and stars. At higher difficulty levels, a further one or two flying characters were presented concurrently (one purple and one red); each &#x02018;flew&#x02019; upwards only when the child looked directly at it. Therefore, the child had to shift their attention from looking towards one target to the other (looks to the distractors were never rewarded). At lower difficulty levels, this task therefore encourages a child to maintain their fixation on one target while suppressing the pre-potent response to look towards moving distractors in the periphery. At higher difficulty levels, it rewards shifting fixation between two or three targets while ignoring peripheral distractors.</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Task 3 (Stars)</italic>. One of five possible targets (a cartoon character placed within brightly coloured stars) (6&#x000b0;) was presented on-screen together with eight distractors (smaller stars, planets, clouds) (4&#x02013;8&#x000b0;) against a detailed still image as background. If the participant fixated the target within 3000&#x02009;ms, they received an animation as a reward. The target changed from trial to trial. The salience of the distractors changed adaptively; at lower difficulty levels, the eight distractors were smaller, static, identical to each other and dissimilar to the targets; at higher difficulty levels, they were more varied, moving, more brightly coloured and more similar to the targets. This task requires flexible search for changing targets, while ignoring distractors.</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Task 4 (Suspects)</italic>. One of two possible targets (either an elephant or a chicken) (subtending 4.5&#x02013;8&#x000b0;) was presented with one or more distractor items of the same size. When the child looked at the target within a time limit, (s)he received an animation as a reward. The same target was then re-presented with other distractor(s). The number of distractors varied adaptively with performance; at higher performance levels, more distractors were presented. Between blocks of 12 trials, the target changed &#x02013; where previously the child had received a reward for looking to the elephant, they now were rewarded for looking to the chicken. At higher difficulty levels, the target from the previous block was presented concurrently with the target from the current block (a conflict trial); at lower difficulty levels, only novel distractors were presented (non-conflict). This task requires flexible search for changing targets, while ignoring distractors.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec id="section12-1362361315617880"><title>Control group stimuli</title><p>Control sessions were conducted in the same room, with the same experimenter and using the same eyetracker as the training sessions, and had the same duration and spacing (yoked to a trained participant).

No significant changes were observed as a result of training, in either the two-object (F(16)&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.006, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.47) or four-object conditions (F(16)&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.11, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.37).</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="section20-1362361315617880"><title>Discussion</title><p>This pilot study assessed the feasibility of administering gaze-contingent training to children with ASD within school settings. We found that, of those children who were able to complete the pre-testing assessment (19 out of 27), all but two were able to complete the entire training protocol. Evidence of improvement within the training tasks was also identified. However, we also noted a number of ways in which training tasks were either too easy, too hard or insufficiently engaging for children in this population &#x02013; particularly given the heterogeneity of our present sample. This is frequently a problem in the provision of ASD interventions, but can be alleviated if enough time is available to develop more individually tailored tasks. Future work with larger sample sizes and more comprehensive assessment of ability levels will help to identify whether training had a larger effect on children with more, or less, severe general cognitive impairments (<xref rid="bibr31-1362361315617880" ref-type="bibr">Soderqvist et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>This feasibility study also noted a variety of practical challenges associated with delivering this training. Although conducting training in a school setting has the advantage of providing high-intensity training at relatively low cost, it was necessary to remove children, one by one, from their normal activities in order to partake in the study, which may have been disruptive. Of note, the quality of eyetracking data obtained was also markedly lower in this study relative to previous studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1362361315617880">Figure 3</xref>), which impacted both the responsiveness of the training tasks and the accuracy of the pre&#x02013;post assessments. Future technological development will, we hope, improve the accuracy of eyetracking in community settings, which will increasingly alleviate these problems.</p><p>Despite these challenges, however, evidence of some transfer of training improvements to non-trained tasks was also identified &#x02013; even given the limitations of this study (primarily the small sample size). We found significant transfer of training improvements to a non-trained assessment of visual sustained attention. This was observed to be selective, insofar as it consisted of changes in looking behaviour towards &#x02018;interesting&#x02019; targets but not to &#x02018;boring&#x02019; targets. This suggests that the effect of training has been not just to increase the amount of time that children look towards the images, but also to increase the attention that they pay to interesting but not to boring targets. Of note, we found strong relationships between this measure and MA at pre-test (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.52).</p><p>Although limited, this finding is encouraging insofar as the previous literature on cognitive training in ASD suggests that it is extremely difficult to demonstrate transfer of training effects following training (<xref rid="bibr39-1362361315617880" ref-type="bibr">Wass and Porayska-Pomsta, 2013</xref>). Studies that attempt directly to train social attention in ASD using computerised training have consistently found that training improvements within the training paradigm fail to generalise to other contexts (<xref rid="bibr11-1362361315617880" ref-type="bibr">Faja et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bibr12-1362361315617880" ref-type="bibr">Golan and Baron-Cohen, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bibr33-1362361315617880" ref-type="bibr">Swettenham, 1996</xref>; <xref rid="bibr34-1362361315617880" ref-type="bibr">Swettenham et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bibr35-1362361315617880" ref-type="bibr">Tanaka et al., 2012</xref>). The task that we used to assess visual sustained attention is cognitively dissimilar to the training tasks, so the demonstration of predicted transfer is encouraging.</p><p>However, it is other tasks, such as disengaging attention, that are widely considered to be more important within the cognitive phenotype of ASD (<xref rid="bibr4-1362361315617880" ref-type="bibr">Bedford et al., 2012</xref>). On these, we found no significant changes in our RT tasks following training. Trend (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.075) reductions were found for disengagement latencies, but saccadic RTs and anticipatory saccades did not show convincing evidence of training effects. This is in contrast to previous research, where training was found to lead both to changes in visual sustained attention <italic>and</italic> to changes on RT tasks (<xref rid="bibr3-1362361315617880" ref-type="bibr">Ballieux et al., in press</xref>; <xref rid="bibr37-1362361315617880" ref-type="bibr">Wass et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>There are four possible reasons for this. First, it could be that the gap-overlap and anticipation tasks were both subject to large amounts of data loss in this study, which obscured genuine training effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1362361315617880">Figure 3</xref>). Our findings of both a relatively small disengagement effect relative to previous research, and of relatively slow anticipatory RTs, are consistent with predictions of how eyetracker-based RT measures can be affected by high rates of data loss (<xref rid="bibr22-1362361315617880" ref-type="bibr">Lepp&#x000e4;nen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bibr40-1362361315617880" ref-type="bibr">Wass et al., 2014</xref>), and future work should investigate this area in more detail. Second, it could be that the mechanisms subserving performance on the visual sustained attention task are different to those subserving performance on the other tasks. In previous research, in which concomitant changes in visual sustained attention and RT tasks were observed, it could be that two separate mechanisms were being trained &#x02013; only one of which was improved in this study. Third, and possibly related, children in this study were markedly older than in previous studies, and increased age may be associated with increased fractionation of attention control mechanisms (<xref rid="bibr13-1362361315617880" ref-type="bibr">Johnson, 2010</xref>). Fourth, our relatively small sample size may have masked some training effects that were less pronounced. Children with ASD are known to be extremely heterogeneous, and it is possible the training is effective for some but not others. Indeed, looking at the data at a more descriptive individual level, some participants improved following training while others did not on the tasks where no overall group effect of training was observed. It may be important to explore these individual differences further, with the aim of predicting response to training in the future. Future work with larger sample sizes is required to investigate these important areas in more detail.</p><p>In addition to investigating whether our present findings can be replicated with a larger sample size, it will also be interesting to assess the wider transfer of training improvements. This study only evaluated transfer of training improvements to a battery of non-trained assessments of attention control. In future, it will be important additionally to assess whether training effects transfer to aspects of social attention in more naturalistic settings &#x02013; as initial findings with typical participants suggest (<xref rid="bibr37-1362361315617880" ref-type="bibr">Wass et al., 2011</xref>). Finally, it will be desirable to repeat this study with a larger and more homogeneous sample, to assess questions of whether training effects observed are stronger for some children (e.g. the more severely impaired) than for others.</p><p>Overall, the published literature suggests that it is desirable to try to apply cognitive training to individuals with ASD, in order to target &#x02018;hub&#x02019; cognitive domains such as attention control. However, virtually no previous research has attempted this. The present results are limited, given the small sample size. However, they suggest that it may be feasible to train some of these cognitive abilities in children with ASD using gaze-contingent technology. These techniques have potential practical advantages over clinician-mediated interventions &#x02013; insofar as they can potentially be applied to a wide range of children, providing intensive training interventions at relatively low cost. However, further work is required to replicate the effects observed in this study, to develop training paradigms that are better targeted towards maintaining engagement and motivation in this population (whose interests are often markedly different to those found in typical children), and also to investigate the effects of applying more extensive assessment of transfer training effects. To this end, the new eyetrackers currently coming onto the market, which cost as little as $100&#x02009;per unit, may be useful insofar as they open the possibility of home testing. If this work is successful, these technologies have the long-term potential to be integrated as a component of more traditional, clinician-mediated interventions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Supplementary material</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="AUT617880_Supplementary_file.pdf" orientation="portrait" id="d36e824" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank Angus Clarke for contributions to project planning and to all of the children who participated in testing.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding:</bold> This work was funded by a NISCHR/Wellcome Trust ISSF Seedcorn grant (PI: S.R.L.) and by a British Academy Postdoctoral Fellowship to S.V.W.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bibr1-1362361315617880"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
