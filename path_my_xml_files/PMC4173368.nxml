Role of anesthesiologists for premedication before induction of anesthesia is of vital importance. There is almost universal agreement on the need for some premedication, which forms an integral part of anesthetic management. However, surprisingly, despite the supreme importance of the subject, there are few established facts regarding facing anxious and apprehensive patients before anesthesia.</p><p>Premedication is more important in case of children because of the fear of painful and unpleasant procedures, separation from parents, and unwillingness to breathe through anesthesia face mask which may produce stormy anesthetic induction in unpremedicated patients.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] Because of this preanesthetic anxiety, sedation should be an integral part of pediatric anesthetic practice. Premedication in children can pave the way to achieve a smooth anesthetic and postoperative course. It is also an important adjunct to alleviate the stress and fear of surgery as well as to ease the child&#x02013;parent separation and promote a smooth induction of anesthesia.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>]</p><p>The present position of premedication and preoperative sedation in children is one of the most confusing and unsatisfactory aspects of pediatric anesthesia. Although most anesthetists agree that sedation is indicated, no two agree on what or how much should be given, or by what route it should be administered. Almost all the drugs currently available for preanesthetic medication of children either are administered as injection or as a pill or by nasal or rectal administration.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] Any of these methods could be difficult or traumatic for 1&#x02013;7 year old children. In addition, many of the currently used drugs like narcotics and benzodiazepines also cause respiratory depression and none provides a uniform balance of sedation, amnesia along with adequate safety. In various studies comparing midazolam, a newer fused ring benzodiazepine, with other drugs like diazepam, ketamine, morphine, fentanyl, sufentanyl, promethazine and pethidine, it was found to be very effective, short acting, safe, and also was found to have profound amnesic properties, hemodynamic stability, and lesser respiratory depression.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] As children dislike injections, other routes of premedication such as oral, rectal, intranasal and sublingual were found to be effective.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>After getting approval from the institutional ethical committee, the present study was carried out in randomly selected patients of both sexes and of ASA physical status of I and II from the routine lists. They were divided into two groups of 30 patients each.</p><p>There were no significant differences between the two groups regarding age, weight, sex ratio and surgical procedures and duration of anesthesia. All the patients were seen a day before surgery and screened for past history of convulsion, meningitis, congenital anomalies, upper respiratory tract infection (URTI), lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) fever, hemoglobin level less than 9%, drug allergy, etc. Routine investigations like hemoglobin, urine and blood sugar, blood urea, serum creatinine estimation and X-ray of chest were done to find if they were within normal limits. On the day of surgery, they were assessed for pulse rate, respiratory rate, SPO<sub>2</sub>, temperature, and a short history of any recent development of URTI and sore throat. The patients were instructed to roll their tongue and touch their upper teeth with the tongue. The premedication containing solution was administered from a 2-ml plastic dispovan. They were instructed not to spit or swallow the solution. Compliance with instruction was noted. The groupings were as follows.</p><p>Group I: Patients received premedication in the form of oral midazolam tablet 0.5 mg/kg</p><p>Group II: Patients received midazolam solution 0.5 mg/kg</p><p>Resuscitative equipment was immediately available at the bedside. Dose and time were noted in each of the cases. After administration of the drug to the patients, the response to drug administration was noted. It was noted whether the patient accepted the medication willfully, showed resistance or required assurance for administration. If the child accepted the premedication willfully, did not cry or cried for less than 1 min, did not spit the drug within 20 seconds, the response was called satisfactory. The patients were observed at an interval of 1, 2, 6, 10 and 15 min and the following observations were made. Vital parameters like pulse rate, respiratory rate, SPO<sub>2</sub>, level of sedation (sedation score by Niall C. Wilton),[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] onset of sedation, response to child-parent separation, venipuncture and ease of induction were assessed and graded according to the 4-point separation and induction score [Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>].</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Sedation score</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AER-5-43-g001"/></table-wrap><table-wrap id="T2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Separation and induction score</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AER-5-43-g002"/></table-wrap><p>Special observation was done during separation from parents (10 min) or attempting venipuncture (15 min) and on applying the mask (20 min), in addition to the above-mentioned parameters, using separation score.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>]</p><p>All the patients were induced with Thiopentone sodium 5 mg/kg and endotracheal intubation was done with appropriate sized portex tube facilitated by Inj. succinylcholine 1.5 mg/kg IV, after preoxygenation for 3 min. Pulse, blood pressure, SPO<sub>2</sub> at and after 1, 3, 5, 10, 20, 30, 45, and 60 min of induction and duration of surgery and anesthesia were noted. All the patients were reversed with Inj. Neostigmine 50 mcg/kg and Inj. Glycopyrrolate 8 mcg/kg. Pulse, respiratory rate, SPO<sub>2</sub>, and sedation score were noted at the time and various intervals after extubation. Time of awakening, presence of crying at extubation and postoperative complications like lethargy, excessive sedation, hypoxemia, nausea, and vomiting were also noted.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All the qualitative data were analyzed using the Chi-square test and Students&#x02019; unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test.

Each group was studied for the presedation behavior, onset of sedation, sedation and emotional score and cardiovascular changes. We studied the presedation behavior of all patients, to have a baseline trend of behavior, among pediatric surgical patients, using a 5-point sedation scale. The two groups were comparable to each other in the presedation scale of the patients. There was no significant difference in the trend of behavior of the pediatric surgical patients. The difference in mean sedation score between the two groups with regards to the basal presedation score was not statistically significant up to 10 min after premedication, but it was significant at 30 min (<italic>P</italic> value 0.0134) and 45 min (<italic>P</italic> value 0.0157) after medication.
