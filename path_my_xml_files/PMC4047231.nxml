males. [Subjects and Methods] Forty males in their 20s with low back pain were randomly
assigned to two groups. Tai chi was applied to one group, and stretching was applied to
the other group. The subjects conducted exercise for one hour, three times per week for
four weeks. They performed warm-up exercises for 10&#x02005;min at the beginning and end of the
sessions and conducted the main exercise for 40 minutes. Wireless surface electromyography
(sEMG) and a visual analogue scale (VAS) were employed to measure muscle activity and
pain, respectively. [Results] There were significant differences between the two groups in
pain and muscle activity. The tai chi group&#x02019;s VAS decreased from 3.1 to 2.1, and its
muscle activity decreased from 21.5% maximum voluntary isomeric contraction (MVIC) to
16.4% MVIC. The stretching group&#x02019;s VAS decreased from 3.4 to 2.8, and its muscle activity
decreased from 24.1% MVIC to 22.1% MVIC. [Conclusion] Tai chi is more effective for low
back pain in males in their 20s than stretching. Tai chi can be considered an effective
method to reduce low back pain in males in their 20s.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Tai chi</kwd><kwd>SEMG</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Low back pain may be regarded as a personal problem, but it may trigger time and economic
losses, thereby becoming a social problem. It is a serious disease that affects social
productivity and may influence society in a large sense<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. The principal cause of low back pain is poor posture. Other causes
include weakened muscles, obesity, which affects many people today, weakened muscle strength
resulting from insufficient exercise, and abnormal gait. Low back pain in the acute phase
may result from abnormality in the back, lumbar, and abdominal muscles associated with
problems with the ligaments, muscles, and intervertebral discs<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Imbalance between the trunk&#x02019;s extensor muscles and flexor muscles
is a common cause of low back pain. Those with chronic low back pain frequently have
abnormalities in the spinal erector muscles, which are extensor muscles, relative to the
trunk flexor muscles. Excessive movement and activity of the spinal erector muscles, which
play an important role in postural maintenance and balance, may impede normal balance
between the trunk extensor muscles and the trunk flexor muscles. Imbalance between the
spinal erector muscles and the trunk flexor muscles reduces flexibility. Such imbalance is a
cause of low back pain and may aggravate an existing problem<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Among the methods used to manage low back pain, physical therapy is
the most commonly used method. Usually, the therapy involves stretching and lumbar flexion
and extension exercises. In addition, exercise using a ball, aerobic exercise, yoga, and
Pilates are often used. Recently, lumbar stabilization exercise, which is intended to
strengthen the deep muscles of the trunk, has been frequently employed to manage low back
pain. Lumbar stabilization exercise is effective for low back pain patients because it
improves their muscle strength and range of motion<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Tai chi has also been employed
recently. Tai chi can be readily applied to improve postural balance in ordinary life. It
has been reported to be helpful in improving muscle strength and enhancing balance ability.
Tai chi, which originated from China, developed as a traditional military art for
self-defense and health preservation and was widely popularized among the public. In
addition to physical movements, tai chi places importance on normal elements to purify one&#x02019;s
mind by letting the hands fall, making the body upright, and putting the feet in order<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Due to tai chi&#x02019;s very slow and smooth
motions, many studies have included elderly subjects. According to one study, tai chi
improved gait ability and muscle strength in elderly males<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Another study found that it is helpful in enhancing flexibility,
muscle strength, and muscle endurance in middle-aged males<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Studies have investigated the effects of tai chi on specific
diseases, as well as on elderly people. In a study in which tai chi and stretching were
applied, tai chi was found to be effective for fibromyalgia<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. In another study where tai chi was applied to knee osteoarthritis
patients, they obtained better results than those who performed stretching exercises<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Previous studies have focused on elderly
people, middle-aged males, or patients with specific diseases. Research on the potential
benefits of tai chi for young adults is lacking. Therefore, this study compared changes in
the pain and muscle activity of males in their 20s who conducted tai chi and examined how
the exercise affected their bodies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The total number of subjects was 40. They were divided into two groups: one group conducted
tai chi, and the other group performed stretching. This study was conducted after obtaining
approval of all procedures, safety, and ethics from the Research Ethics Committee of
Kyungbuk University. All subjects agreed to participate in this research after receiving an
explanation of its purpose and methods. The subjects had been diagnosed with acute low back
pain by specialists and voluntarily consented to participate in this study. Those who had
problems other than low back pain were excluded. Their muscle activity was measured using an
MP150 (BIOPAC systems, Inc., Goleta, CA, USA), surface electromyography equipment, and
Ag-Ag/Cl electrodes. To examine the activity of the spinal erector muscles of the dominant
side, an active electrode was attached to the area 2&#x02005;cm away from the side of the spinous
process of vertebra L5 and slightly above the imaginary line connecting both anterior
superior iliac spines. The ground electrode was attached to an area not associated with
signals. Signals collected at a sampling rate of 1,000&#x02005;Hz were notch filtered at 60&#x02005;Hz after
full-wave rectification to remove electrical noise. Then, 30 to 500 band-pass filtering was
conducted. As muscle activity differed among individuals, %MVIC was employed for
standardization. A maximal isometric contraction test was carried out based on the manual
muscle test. The subjects walked on the spot for 10 sec, and their muscle activity for 6
sec, excluding the first and last 2 sec, was measured. Low back pain was measured with the
visual analogue scale (VAS). The degree of pain was measured by the subjects putting a mark
on a 100&#x02005;mm stick on which the numbers 0 to 10 were written. Both groups performed the
exercises three times per week, for one hour each time, for a total of four weeks. The two
groups performed warm-up exercise for the first 10&#x02005;min and cool-down exercise for the last
10&#x02005;min. During the intervening 40&#x02005;min period, each group carried out tai chi or stretching.
Regarding tai chi, the subjects performed all motions, which took 20 minutes. The tai chi
group performed the 20&#x02005;min of exercise twice. The exercise was composed of various motions,
including ya ma boon jong, boong ri je an, baek hak yang si, su whi bi pa, nu seul y obo, je
su sang se, and yeo bong sap ye. The stretching group repetitively stretched their lower
extremity joints, trunk joints, and upper extremity joints. SPSS was used for statistical
analysis. To examine differences between the two groups in accordance with the
interventions, a paired t-test was carried out. An independent t-test was performed to
compare the groups. The significance level was set at 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Pain and muscle activity decreased in both the tai chi group and the stretching group

pain than stretching did. In addition to the decrease in pain, the decrease in muscle
activity was greater in the tai chi group than in the stretching group. Different studies
have applied diverse therapeutic methods to treat low back pain. Various physical therapy
exercise methods have been employed, as well as physical manipulation. The application of an
isotonic lumbar stretching exercise program using Mdex waist extension equipment to increase
lumbar muscle strength in patients with chronic low back pain significantly improved their
muscle strength and decreased their pain<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Conducting hip muscle exercise and lumbar stabilization exercise
together enhanced lumbar stability in patients with chronic lumbar pain. The same study
found that it may be helpful to conduct lumbar stabilization exercise with other
exercise<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Lumbar stabilization
exercise appears to improve lumbar pain by improving muscle strength and balance ability.
However, in the case of the spinal erector muscles, which are important for postural
maintenance, efficient utilization of them is crucial, unless great power is required. In
contrast to previous studies, which focused on muscle strength, the present study
investigated the relationship between the degree of lumbar pain and muscle mobilization
after an appropriate tai chi exercise program. The present study also intended to examine
whether tai chi, which has been applied many times to elderly individuals, was helpful in
improving low back pain of males in their 20s when the exercise was used as an intervention
to treat low back pain. Tai chi was applied to elderly subjects in many previous studies due
to its slow and smooth characteristics, but in the present study, we established the
hypothesis that it would be effective for young adults in their 20s as well and performed an
experiment on them. In the present study, the degree of pain significantly decreased in both
groups when tai chi and stretching were applied. The tai chi group&#x02019;s VAS decreased from
3.1&#x000b1;0.6 to 2.1&#x000b1;0.5 after the intervention, which was a greater decrease than that in the
stretching group, the VAS of which decreased from 3.4&#x000b1;0.6 to 2.8&#x000b1;0.5 after the intervention
(p&#x0003c;0.05). The tai chi group&#x02019;s muscle activity decreased from 21.5&#x000b1;3.1%MVIC to
16.4&#x000b1;2.8%MVIC after the intervention, and the stretching group&#x02019;s muscle activity decreased
from 24.1&#x000b1;3.9%MVIC to 24.1&#x000b1;3.9%MVIC after the intervention. Muscle activity decreased in
both groups. These findings are likely due to stability affecting the muscle activity.
Reduction in pain minimizes muscle mobilization, thereby enabling efficient movement. In
previous studies, muscle activity decreased when stability was high. When subjects wearing a
back belt stood holding an object, the muscle activity of the spinal erector muscles was
lower in both anteversion and retroversion of the pelvis than when the subjects did not wear
a back belt<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. When subjects put on a
back belt, their muscle activity was 175.1&#x000b1;30.3%RVC, but when they did not, their muscle
activity was 190.0&#x000b1;31.7%RVC. When subjects move without wearing a back belt, their stability
is lowered, and this increases muscle mobilization. In contrast, when they move while
wearing a back belt, their stability increases, and therefore their muscle activity
decreases. Conducting the same motion increases their stability and decreases the activity
of their spinal erector muscles, which adjusts the body posture. Another study reported the
same outcome. When the correlation between stability and muscle activity was compared, the
higher stability was the lower muscle activity became<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Unlike the present study, research focusing on improvement in
muscle strength noted that low back pain may be managed by enhancing muscle strength. A
study of the direct effects of a tai chi intervention on males in their 40s with low back
pain reported that muscle strength, which was measured using Mdex equipment, elements of
physical strength, including balance at different angles (0&#x000b0;, 12&#x000b0;, 24&#x000b0;, 36&#x000b0;, 48&#x000b0;, 60&#x000b0;, and
72&#x000b0;), and lumbar muscle strength significantly increased. The study concluded that tai chi
was well suited to managing low back pain among males in their 40s<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. In that study, the subjects experienced maximal
improvement in muscle strength through tai chi. In contrast, in the present study, the
subjects had not efficiently used their muscles due to external factors, including pain, and
they were able to perform the motions by exerting their muscles greatly. It is considered
that because they were able to conduct motions with only a small amount of mobilization of
the muscles, muscle activity decreased. Here, the reduction in muscle activity is not the
same as a decrease in muscle strength. Muscle activity does not represent the degree of
muscle strength but the degree of muscle mobilization. Therefore, the decrease in muscle
activity should not be interpreted as a reduction in muscle strength. This study was
conducted to examine the effects of tai chi on low back pain in males in their 20s. To
determine the degree of the effect of tai chi, a stretching group was used as a control
group, and pain and muscle activity were compared between the control group and a group that
performed tai chi. Tai chi was effective in decreasing pain and muscle activity of males
with low back pain in their 20s. If tai chi is used as an intervention instead of stretching
for low back pain, it will become a very effective exercise program for males in their 20s
with low back pain.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Frymoyer</surname><given-names>JW</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Back pain and sciatica</article-title>. <source>N Engl J
