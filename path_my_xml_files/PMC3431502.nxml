Patients with abnormal renal or hepatic function, or an active systemic infection, were ineligible. Patients were enrolled by ten study groups between 2004 and 2009, and were classified as good risk or poor risk according to early response to induction treatment. Good-risk patients were randomly assigned by a web-based system with permuted blocks (size four) to receive post-induction imatinib with chemotherapy or chemotherapy only in a 1:1 ratio, while all poor-risk patients received post-induction imatinib with chemotherapy. Patients were stratified by study group. The chemotherapy regimen was modelled on a Berlin&#x02013;Frankfurt&#x02013;Munster high-risk backbone; all received four post-induction blocks of chemotherapy after which they became eligible for stem-cell transplantation. The primary endpoints were disease-free survival at 4 years in the good-risk group and event-free survival at 4 years in the poor-risk group, analysed by intention to treat and a secondary analysis of patients as treated.

Median follow-up was 3&#x000b7;1 years (IQR 2&#x000b7;0&#x02013;4&#x000b7;6). 4-year disease-free survival was 72&#x000b7;9% (95% CI 56&#x000b7;1&#x02013;84&#x000b7;1) in the good-risk, imatinib group versus 61&#x000b7;7% (45&#x000b7;0&#x02013;74&#x000b7;7) in the good-risk, no imatinib group (p=0&#x000b7;24).

Information about additional cytogenetic abnormalities was not recorded, because it was beyond the scope of the study. Patients with abnormal renal or hepatic function (grade 2&#x02013;3 toxic effects according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria [NCI CTC]) or active systemic infection at the end of induction treatment were ineligible. Written, informed consent was obtained from parents or legal guardians.</p><p>After induction treatment, patients were classified as good risk or poor risk. Good-risk patients were those who had both early response and complete remission at the end of induction. Early response was defined as blast cell count of less than 1000 cells per &#x003bc;L in peripheral blood after 7 days of treatment with prednisone and a single intrathecal dose of methotrexate, or 25% or less bone marrow blast cells at day 15, or less than 5% bone marrow blast cells at day 21, depending on national induction protocols. Complete remission was defined as less than 5% blast cells in bone marrow aspirate (with absolute neutrophil count &#x02265;1500 cells per &#x003bc;L and &#x02265;100&#x02008;000 platelets per &#x003bc;L) and absence of leukaemia in other organs.

Imatinib was given for 126 days, starting from the end of induction, concomitantly with chemotherapy during protocol IB and in an alternated regimen with the other protocols (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>), as done in contemporary studies of adults (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>).<xref rid="bib17 bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17,20</sup></xref></p><p>Resistance to protocol was defined as 5% blast cells or more in bone marrow aspirate at the end of the third consolidation block of treatment for those without previous complete remission.

Bone marrow relapse was defined as 25% blast cells or more in bone marrow, after remission.</p><p>Minimal residual disease was analysed in central laboratories (one for each study group) that agreed on standard procedures.

We applied the Cox model to estimate hazard ratios (HRs; tested according to Wald). For the regressor in the model we included the variables treatment and post-induction minimal residual disease (three categories: &#x0003c;5&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup> cells, &#x02265;5&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup> cells, and unknown) because of an unexpected imbalance of minimal residual disease in the randomised groups. Planned secondary analyses were by group at 2 years after censoring patients who had transplants at date of stem-cell transplantation, and as-treated analyses counting deviations from the assigned group and comparing patients who actually received imatinib with those who did not. We calculated the probabilities of relapse and of death in continuous complete remission with the cumulative incidence estimator, thus allowing for competing risks, and compared them with the Gray test. We used the &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test to assess the association between treatment group and severe adverse events. All tests were two sided. We did all analyses with SAS (version 9.2).

Infections were the most common serious adverse event.

However, this difference was not significant (p=0&#x000b7;07). Poor-risk patients had similar results (20 had minor and 25 had major delays). 13 of 31 (41&#x000b7;9%) patients in the good-risk, no imatinib group, 26 of 58 (44&#x000b7;8%) patients in the good-risk, imatinib group, and 40 of 70 (57&#x000b7;1%) patients in the poor-risk group had a dose decrease of more than 10% for chemotherapy and imatinib cumulative doses between the beginning of protocol IB and the end of HR3.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="cesec90"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study was designed to assess the efficacy and safety of imatinib when added to the Berlin&#x02013;Frankfurt&#x02013;Munster chemotherapy backbone in paediatric patients with Philadelphia-chromosome-positive ALL. Enrolment was stopped in 2009, because of the results of the COG study<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> and unwillingness of clinicians and families to enrol after numerous publications on data for adults.<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> Although the study is not powered to fully address the primary study aim, important conclusions can be derived.</p><p>All patients enrolled achieved complete remission, whereas previous reports of patients treated with the same chemotherapy backbone note that as many as 10% of patients were resistant to treatment.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> All poor-risk patients not in complete remission after induction had complete remission with imatinib during consolidation treatment. Disease-free survival was better in the good-risk, imatinib group than in the no imatinib group, despite the difference in minimal residual disease at baseline, which favoured patients not receiving imatinib. Only the as-treated analysis showed a better outcome for imatinib-treated patients after adjustment for differences in minimal residual disease (although with the caveat of potential selection bias). Additionally, toxic effects did not differ significantly between groups. Detailed, graded data for adverse events were not collected.</p><p>In a historical cohort of 286 patients, 4-year disease-free survival was 42&#x000b7;3% (95% CI 36&#x000b7;4&#x02013;48&#x000b7;2); less than in our study (<xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">table 4</xref>). In the same cohort, 61% of patients were transplanted in first complete remission. Mortality related to transplantation diminished with time, accounting for 14% in the historical data and 9% in our study. In the historical cohort, poor-risk patients who had early response assessed by peripheral blood had a worse outcome than those who were assessed by bone marrow early response.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> This finding is supported by data from the historical cohort and our study, although the difference was not significant in our study (<xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">table 4</xref>).</p><p>Our results are concordant with those of the COG study<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> and provide evidence of long-term benefit of treatment with imatinib for all patient groups (<xref rid="box1" ref-type="boxed-text">panel</xref>). However, EsPhALL has several differences from the COG AALL0031 study. COG reported that use of imatinib after induction negated the prognostic effect of end-of-induction minimal residual disease. In EsPhALL, early response to chemotherapy continued to be predictive&#x02014;poor-risk patients still have an unfavourable outcome compared with good-risk patients. Patients with poor response to monotherapy with steroids as measured by blast cell count in peripheral blood, compared with bone marrow assessment early in induction, have a worse outcome (<xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">table 4</xref>), supporting historical findings.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> In view of the different induction protocols used in each study, interpretation of this variation is difficult. The prednisone poor-response group might be characteristic of the most highly resistant group of patients with Philadelphia-chromosome-positive ALL. Whether starting imatinib (or a second generation tyrosine-kinase inhibitor) during induction would cancel the negative effect of poor early response with steroids is still unclear.</p><p>The central role of allogeneic stem-cell transplantation was established in a pre-imatinib large cohort of patients.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> However, COG reported<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> that allogeneic stem-cell transplantation provides no benefit compared with treatment with intensive continuous imatinib (cohort 5). This finding, albeit from a small number of patients, holds true with longer follow-up (Schultz K, COG, personal communication). In EsPhALL, about 80% of enrolled patients had allogeneic stem-cell transplantation, with the limitation that a common policy of administration of tyrosine-kinase inhibitors after transplantation was not adopted. We do not know whether transplantation or tyrosine-kinase inhibitors explain the improvement compared with historical controls. In both good-risk and poor-risk groups, the few patients who received imatinib but not stem-cell transplantation, excluding those who failed before the median time to transplantation, had a poorer outcome (three of nine good-risk patients and five of seven poor-risk patients relapsed). However, this finding is limited by the small number of patients who did not have a transplant. That concomitant use of tyrosine-kinase inhibitors earlier, more continuously, or for longer, might negate the requirement for myeloablative therapy should be investigated further. In this context, serial analysis of minimal residual disease might help to select patients who can be treated with intensive chemotherapy protocols including a tyrosine-kinase inhibitor but without allogeneic stem-cell transplantation.</p><p>Our data support further investigation of new tyrosine-kinase inhibitors in conjunction with the established chemotherapy backbone for treatment of children with Philadelphia-chromosome-positive ALL. The EsPhALL network is assessing the effect of earlier, continuous, and longer exposure to imatinib and use of a second generation tyrosine-kinase inhibitor. Possible next steps are assessments of whether exposure to tyrosine-kinase inhibitors can change the intensity of chemotherapy and the use of transplantation in first remission.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group
