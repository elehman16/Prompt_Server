Thus, the combination of the instrumentation associated with various root canal irrigation solutions and medicaments has been suggested.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Calcium hydroxide is commonly used because of its antimicrobial efficacy against most bacterial species identified in endodontic infections. Recently, antibiotic pastes have been used for root canal therapy and especially for regenerative endodontic treatment because infections of the root canal system are regarded as polymicrobial (i.e., consisting of different species of bacteria and other microorganisms).[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Triple antibiotic paste (TAP) containing metronidazole, ciprofloxacin, and minocycline is the most commonly used antibiotic paste.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Ruparel <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] stated that TAP had a detrimental effect on human stem cells in the apical papilla when it was used in regenerative treatment. Thus, TAP should be removed completely from the root canal to inhibit its detrimental effects on stem cells in apical papilla. In addition, TAP may cause tooth discoloration if not removed completely from the root canal. Kim <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] have demonstrated that the main reason for tooth discoloration after treatment was due to contact of the minocycline in TAP with coronal dentinal walls during treatment procedures. Various irrigating solutions, such as sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), and sterile saline in combination with ultrasonic, sonic, and laser devices were used in the removal of TAP from the root canal.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] However, none of the irrigation techniques completely removed TAP from the root canal.</p><p>The Vibringe (Vibringe B.V. Corp, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) is a relatively new device on the market that combines manual delivery and sonic activation of the solution. It is a cordless handpiece that fits into a specially designed disposable syringe, that is, compatible with every irrigation needle. It continuously delivers irrigant in a pulsating manner directly into the root canal via a standard needle. It uses sonic flow technology combined with acoustic streaming.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>There is no study evaluating the efficiency of Vibringe and an irrigation solution combination of NaOCl/EDTA in the removal of TAP from root canals. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficiency of different irrigation methods in the removal of TAP from artificial standardized grooves in the apical and coronal thirds of the root. The null hypothesis was that the removal of TAP is not affected by the irrigation technique used.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>Ethical approval was obtained from the Review Committee of the Research Foundation of Erciyes University of Medical Sciences in Kayseri, Turkey (2015/412), before investigation. One hundred and eighteen extracted human single-rooted maxillary canine teeth with similar root lengths measured from the cementoenamel junction to the root apex were selected for this study. Criteria for tooth selection included a single root canal, no visible root caries, fractures, or cracks, no signs of internal or external resorption or calcification, a completely formed apex, and a curvature &#x0003c;5&#x000b0;, in accordance with the protocol prescribed by Schneider.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Preoperative radiographs were taken in the buccolingual and mesiodistal directions to confirm the presence of a single canal without previous root canal treatment, resorptions, or calcifications. The teeth were stored in purified filtered water until use. To ensure standardization, the crowns of the selected teeth were partially removed to achieve a final 22 mm length for each tooth. Endodontic access cavities were prepared using diamond burs (Diatech, Coltene Whaledent, Altst&#x000e4;tten, Switzerland) with a high-speed handpiece under water-cooling. A size 15 K-file (Dentsply Maillefer, Ballaigues, Switzerland) was then placed in the canal until it was visible at the apical foramen. The working length (WL) was determined by substracting 1 mm from this measurement. The 118 roots were instrumented with the ProTaper rotary system (Dentsply Maillefer) up to size F5 (#50, 0.05 taper), which was chosen as the master apical file. During preparation, the root canal was irrigated with 2 mL of 2.5% NaOCl solution using a syringe and a 29-gauge needle (NaviTip; Ultradent, South Jordan, UT, USA) between each instrument change. After completion of the preparation, the root canals were irrigated with 5 mL of 17% EDTA for 1 min and 5 mL of 3% NaOCl for 1 min. The canals were finally rinsed with 10 mL of distilled water and then dried with sterile paper points.</p><p>After root canal preparation, the teeth were fixed in modified Eppendorf vials with silicone material (Coltene\Whaledent AG, Switzerland) [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. After removal from the impression material, all teeth were grooved longitudinally on the buccal and lingual surfaces with a diamond disk under copious water irrigation, avoiding penetration into the root canal. The teeth were then split into 2 halves with a small chisel. Each root was split longitudinally through the canal, forming two halves. A standard groove of 4 mm in length, 0.2 mm in width and 0.5 mm in depth was cut in one canal wall 2&#x02013;6 mm from the apex to simulate uninstrumented canal extensions in the apical third. Another longitudinal groove was created in the other half at a distance of 9&#x02013;12 mm from the apex in the coronal third.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Five teeth were left and served as the negative control group. These teeth were not filled with TAP. The grooves in the remaining 113 teeth were filled with TAP. Equal portions of metronidazole (Eczac&#x00131;bas&#x00131;, Istanbul, Turkey), ciprofloxacin (Biofarma, Istanbul, Turkey), and minocycline (Ratiopharm, Ulm, Germany) were mixed with distilled water, and TAP was packed into the apical and coronal grooves, using a plugger. Before reassembling, the apices were sealed with wax to prevent the overflow of the irrigation solution and to make a closed-end channel to create a vapor lock effect.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Then, the root halves were reassembled and the specimens were remounted in the Eppendorf vials [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. Access cavities were sealed temporarily with a cotton pellet and temporary filling material (Cavit; 3M ESPE, Seefeld, Germany). The specimens were stored in an incubator at 37&#x000b0;C in 100% humidity for 28 days. 5 of the 113 teeth served as the positive control group and no TAP removal procedure was carried out on those teeth.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>The experimental model system used to fix teeth before splitting</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JCD-19-323-g001"/></fig><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Experimental groups and removal of triple antibiotic paste</title><p>After removal of the temporary filling material, specimens were divided into nine experimental groups as follows:</p><sec id="sec3-1"><title>Group 1: Conventional syringe irrigation/sodium hypochlorite + ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (<italic>n</italic> = 12)</title><p>To remove TAP from the grooves, irrigation with 5 mL of 3% NaOCl followed by 5 mL of 17% EDTA was performed using a syringe and a 29-gauge side-vented needle (NaviTip; Ultradent, South Jordan, UT, USA) placed 1 mm short of the WL.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-2"><title>Group 2: Conventional syringe irrigation/ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (<italic>n</italic> = 12)</title><p>In this group, irrigation with 10 mL of 17% EDTA was performed using a syringe and a 29-gauge side-vented needle (NaviTip) placed 1 mm short of the WL.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-3"><title>Group 3: Conventional syringe irrigation/sodium hypochlorite (<italic>n</italic> = 12)</title><p>Irrigation with 10 mL of 3% NaOCl was performed using a syringe and a 29-gauge side-vented needle (NaviTip) placed 1 mm short of the WL.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-4"><title>Group 4: Passive ultrasonic irrigation/sodium hypochlorite + ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (<italic>n</italic> = 12)</title><p>In this group, 5 mL of 3% NaOCl and 5 mL of 17% EDTA were each passively agitated using an ultrasonic device (EMS, Le Sentier, Switzerland).

The advantage of the groove model is the standardized size and location of the grooves, allowing a standardized evaluation with high intra-examiner reproducibility and good inter-examiner agreement. The major disadvantage of this design is that the artificial standardized grooves do not represent the complexity of a natural root canal system. Therefore, it might be easier to remove TAP from artificial grooves than from isthmuses or oval extensions <italic>in vivo</italic>.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>Previous studies showed that TAP could be used clinically in the treatment of teeth with extensive periradicular lesions and as part of the endodontic regenerative technique.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] TAP should be removed from the root canal before final treatment procedures because it causes discoloration and has a detrimental effect on stem cells in the apical papilla.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Researchers evaluated the effect of various irrigants and irrigation methods in removing TAP from the root canal. It has been determined that varying the irrigant and/or the irrigation technique will not ensure that TAP is completely removed from the root canal system.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Furthermore, the findings of the current study show that it is difficult to completely remove TAP from the apical and coronal thirds of root canals. In the apical third, there was a significant difference between the experimental groups as to how much TAP was removed. Therefore, the null hypothesis was rejected. Berkhoff <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] determined that TAP was not completely removed from the root canal system, and they stated that this may be due to the apparent high diffusion and binding of TAP into root dentin. It has also been reported that minocycline in TAP binds to calcium ions via chelation to form an insoluble complex in the tooth matrix. Thakur <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] compared the effectiveness of Canal Brushing technique, sonic technique (EndoActivator), and master apical file for the removal of TAP and determined that none of the techniques completely removed TAP from the root canal. Additionally, they determined that Canal Brush and EndoActivator showed better result than master apical file in the cervical and middle third of canal. Arslan <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] compared the efficacy of various irrigation protocols (distilled water, 1% NaOCl, 2.5% NaOCl, 100% ethanol, 17% EDTA and PUI with 1% NaOCl) on the removal of TAP from artificial groove in the apical of root canal and determined that PUI with 1% NaOCl was more effective in removing TAP from artificial groove in root canal than other irrigating solutions.</p><p>In the current study, Vibringe and PUI exhibited performance similar to conventional syringe irrigation (CSI) in the coronal part, but Vibringe and PUI removed significantly more TAP in the apical part. A possible explanation is that the oscillation amplitude of the sonically activated irrigation needle or ultrasonically activated file is higher at the tip than at the attached end,[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] resulting in increased fluid velocity at that point. In the coronal part, the greater distance of the needle or file tips from the artificial groove seems to reduce the efficacy of the agitation of the irrigant.</p><p>When the type of irrigant is considered, in the coronal third, no difference was found between the NaOCl/EDTA combination, EDTA, and NaOCl irrigants in the removal of TAP. In the apical third, the sonic or ultrasonic agitation of the NaOCl/EDTA combination compared with CSI showed better removal of TAP from the artificial groove. In previous <italic>in vitro</italic> studies,[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] only one irrigant (NaOCl or EDTA) with or without agitation was used to remove TAP from the root canal. The present study is the first study to evaluate the NaOCl/EDTA combination in the removal of TAP from simulated root canal irregularities. An important finding of this study is that the use of the NaOCl/EDTA combination together with sonic or ultrasonic agitation in the apical third, where removal of TAP is difficult, is more effective than either EDTA or NaOCl alone. In a study by Akman <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] it was determined that agitation of NaOCl with PUI removes significantly more modified TAP medicament than the CSI group at the apical third. This is in agreement with the current study.</p><p>PUI is based on the principle of cavitation and acoustic streaming. Because of the microstreaming generated, more dentinal debris can be removed from the root canal system compared with syringe delivery of an irrigant.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] The same mechanisms are probably responsible for the more effective removal of TAP during PUI in comparison with CSI. The higher velocity of irrigant flow generated by PUI may explain its efficiency in TAP removal from artificial grooves in the apical part of a root canal.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Under the conditions of this <italic>in vitro</italic> study, it can be concluded that none of the irrigation methods completely removed TAP from the artificial standardized grooves in the apical and coronal root thirds. In the apical third, however, the sonic or ultrasonic agitation of the irrigation solution combination NaOCl/EDTA can improve the removal of TAP compared with CSI.</p><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Financial
