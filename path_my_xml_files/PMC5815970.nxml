The manufacturer of the ESWT device (Richard Wolf GmbH, Knittlingen, Germany) provided 3 identically looking gel pads that were specially designed for this study. In the 1st phase of treatment, a non-penetrable active gel pad was used. Pads were marked A or B, which corresponded to the sham or active group. In the 2nd phase of the trial, all patients received LLi-ESWT using another active gel pad. It had an outer design identical to those used during the 1st phase, allowing for concealed group allocation during the entire study period for investigator and patients. Participants received 5 weekly treatment sessions of LLi-ESWT or sham. After a 4-week break, the 2 groups received LLi-ESWT. We imitated the crossover design from pharmacologic studies. We chose to treat all subjects in the 2nd phase because we expected that treatment would have a prolonged effect.

The ESWT device was equipped with a piezoelectric linear therapy source (FBL10; Richard Wolf GmbH). Penetration depth in this device is adjusted by applying different gel pads. In our study we used a 0-mm gel pad that allowed treatment of an organ area 1 cm deep and 5 cm wide. The number of impulses used was chosen based on a previous trial reporting positive outcomes after applying focused Li-ESWT, taking into consideration that a linear probe delivers SWs to a wider area of the penis.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref></p><p id="p0065">Outcomes were assessed using questionnaires (IIEF-EF, EHS, and SQoL-M) at baseline and at 6 and 12 months.

Outcome measurements were summarized at baseline and 6 months and 12 months after completing the treatment protocol. We present our results as the number of subjects, means, SDs, and 95% CIs. The change from baseline to 12 months was compared between groups using linear regression adjusting for baseline measurements. Adherence to the normality assumption was checked by visual inspection of QQ plots. The change from baseline over time was analyzed by a mixed-effects linear regression with random effects given by the patients and interaction with time.

However, these results are seriously flawed by a very high dropout rate (58% and 42% in sham and active treated groups, respectively) and therefore should be interpreted with caution. Olsen et&#x000a0;al,<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> who initially reported positive short-term results of focused LI-ESWT in the EHS but not in the IIEF-EF domain, found no significant effects at 6 months for either outcome measure. Thus, the overall long-term clinical effects of Li-ESWT, whether focused or linear SW delivery, seem to be doubtful. Indeed, there is reason to doubt the short-term clinical effects of Li-ESWT, because results from randomized trials have been inconsistent, and only 1 of 3 systematic reviews and meta-analyses on Li-ESWT for ED has documented increases in IIEF-EF<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> to what is considered the minimal clinically important difference (&#x00394;IIEF-EF score &#x0003e; 4).<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> Whether repeated treatment sessions over a longer period might stimulate cellular and molecular mechanisms, which are believed to be involved in angiogenesis and nerve regeneration translating into significant clinical effects, still needs to be evaluated in controlled trials. Treatment with LLi-ESWT in 2 5-week sessions with a 4-week break (group B) did not result in any positive improvements in IIEF-EF, EHS, or SQoL-M scores. In fact, group A, which received only 5-week treatment, had a better outcome during follow-up, although not reaching the predefined clinically relevant end point (&#x00394;IIEF-EF &#x02265; 5), suggesting that extending treatment sessions beyond 5 weeks might not achieve superior results.</p><p id="p0125">There could be several reasons for the conflicting results on the effect of Li-ESWT in the literature. Among these are differences in SW technology (piezoelectric, electromagnetic, electrohydraulic), differences in SW delivery (focused, linear), and differences in number of SWs used, which potentially confuse comparison of studies and thus lower the validity of meta-analyses. In our study the number of SWs delivered with the linear probe was calculated based on data from a previous trial using focused ESWT<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> with an identical EFD (0.09 mJ/mm<sup>2</sup>).</p><p id="p0130">There are several reports of positive outcomes of LLi-ESWT for ED.<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> 3 trials applied an electromagnetic device (Renova, Direx Systems GmbH, Wiesbaden, Germany).<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Bechara et&#x000a0;al<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> and Reisman et&#x000a0;al<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> treated their patients with 3,600 SWs and an EFD of 0.09 mJ/mm<sup>2</sup> in 4 weeks, and Pelayo-Nieto et&#x000a0;al<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> applied the same energy level but their treatment protocol consisted of 4 treatments of 5,000 SWs. Motil and Sramkova<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> tested the same piezoelectric therapy source used in the present study. Their treatment protocol involved 4 weekly sessions of 4,000 SWs, an EFD of 0.16 mJ/mm<sup>2</sup>, and a penetration depth of 10 to 15 mm. Positive clinical effects were reported in all cited trials; however, only the study of Bechara et&#x000a0;al<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> was designed as a randomized controlled trial and the others were open-label trials.<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Considering those encouraging outcomes and absence of serious adverse effects, it seems safe to proceed with planning LLi-ESWT trials using a larger number of SWs. The advantage of linear ESWT is that usage of the linear probe delivers SWs to a wider area of the corpora cavernosa, thus limiting movements of the probe during treatment compared with focused ESWT, which could decrease user dependency.<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> However, before clinical trials on ESWT in ED are performed, dose-finding studies defining the right protocol settings for the specific device tested should be mandatory, which to a large extent has been neglected in previous trials including ours.

Furthermore, owing to our study design, we could assess only short-term effects of sham treatment, because all participants received active treatment in the 2nd phase. Results obtained 4 weeks after 5 simulated treatment sessions (sham) served as a control.</p><p id="p0145">In our short-term data we had a very low dropout rate (3%).<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> In the present report, 25% of patients were lost to follow-up, which might have introduced selection bias.<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> The difference in dropout rate between groups A (32%) and B (17%) might explain the better outcome in patients who received only 5 treatment sessions (group A), because an uneven dropout can introduce potential bias favoring positive outcomes.<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> Furthermore, a larger proportion of men in group B complained of peripheral artery disease, which could be indicative of more severe endothelial dysfunction, and thus they would be expected to have a poorer response.

The proportion of men using medication for ED during follow-up was comparable between groups.

Targets for future Li-ESWT research could be increasing the penetration depth and the number of SWs. Because the effect of Li-ESWT on ED is questionable, treatment of patients with ED with this therapeutic modality preferably should be confined to controlled clinical trials.</p></sec><sec
