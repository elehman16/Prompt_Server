The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) was a 3.2-year randomized clinical trial of preventing type 2 diabetes with a 10-year follow-up study, the DPP Outcomes Study (DPPOS). We evaluated baseline HbA<sub>1c</sub> as a predictor of diabetes and determined the effects of treatments on diabetes defined by an HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x02265;6.5% (48 mmol/mol).</p></sec><sec><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><p>We randomized 3,234 nondiabetic adults at high risk of diabetes to placebo, metformin, or intensive lifestyle intervention and followed them for the development of diabetes as diagnosed by fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and 2-h postload glucose (2hPG) concentrations (1997 American Diabetes Association [ADA] criteria). HbA<sub>1c</sub> was measured but not used for study eligibility or outcomes.

To compare these different diagnostic criteria and evaluate HbA<sub>1c</sub> as a risk indicator, we evaluated HbA<sub>1c</sub> as a predictor of diabetes and as an alternate outcome in the DPP and DPPOS.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Research Design and Methods</title><sec id="s3"><title>Participants, Treatment, and Follow-up</title><p>The methods and primary findings have been described (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>), and protocols are available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://dppos.bsc.gwu.edu/web/dppos/home">https://dppos.bsc.gwu.edu/web/dppos/home</ext-link>. The trial is registered as NCT00004992 (DPP) and NCT00038727 (DPPOS). The 3,234 nondiabetic participants had the following risk factors: BMI &#x02265;24 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, FPG &#x02265;5.3 mmol/L (95 mg/dL) and &#x0003c;7.0 mmol/L (126 mg/dL), and 2hPG &#x02265;7.8 mmol/L (140 mg/dL) and &#x0003c;11.1 mmol/L (200 mg/dL). There were minor exceptions to these criteria: FPG &#x0003c;7.8 mmol/L before this diagnostic level was lowered with the 1997 ADA criteria, no lower limit of FPG in the American Indian centers, and BMI &#x02265;22 kg/m<sup>2</sup> in Asian Americans (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>).</p><p>Participants were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups: placebo, metformin 850 mg twice per day, or ILS (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). A tentative diabetes diagnosis was made if FPG was &#x02265;7.0 mmol/L (126 mg/dL) at a semiannual examination or 2hPG during the annual 75-g oral glucose tolerance test was &#x02265;11.1 mmol/L (200 mg/dL), according to ADA criteria (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). A diagnosis required confirmation on a repeat of the same test (FPG or oral glucose tolerance test) as that triggering the tentative diagnosis (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Confirmed diagnoses were reported to the participants and their health-care providers, but study metformin or placebo was still provided unless hyperglycemia worsened to FPG &#x02265;140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L) during DPP or HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x02265;7.0% (53 mmol/mol) during DPPOS. At this point, the study drug was discontinued, and diabetes management, including metformin or other drug treatment, was transferred to the participant&#x02019;s own health-care provider. Otherwise, HbA<sub>1c</sub> results were not used for determining eligibility or outcomes.</p><p>Diabetes incidence rates during the DPP were 11.0 cases/100 person-years in the placebo group, 7.8 in the metformin group, and 4.8 in the ILS group, representing reductions in diabetes incidence of 31% and 58% with metformin and ILS compared with placebo (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Following drug unmasking and release of these results in 2001, all participants were offered lifestyle intervention (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Metformin was continued in the original metformin group, placebo was discontinued, and the original ILS group was offered additional lifestyle support. Of the original cohort, 2,766 (88% of those alive and enrolled at the end of the DPP whether or not they had developed diabetes) were enrolled in the DPPOS long-term follow-up (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). During the DPPOS, after all study participants had been offered lifestyle intervention, diabetes rates in the metformin and former placebo groups fell to rates similar to those of the original ILS group, which remained relatively stable (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p><p>HbA<sub>1c</sub> was measured at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months and then annually in the level 1 central laboratory at the University of Washington. The high-performance liquid chromatography method was aligned to the National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program. At the start of the study in 1996, analyses were performed using the Variant Classic instrument (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA) with an overall interassay coefficient of variance (CV) of 2.3%. In 1999, the Variant Classic was replaced by the Variant II instrument from the same manufacturer with an overall interassay CV of 1.7%. In 2004, the Variant II was replaced by the Tosoh G7 analyzer (Tosoh Bioscience, Inc., San Francisco, CA), with an overall interassay CV of 0.9%. Each transition was monitored by parallel measurements of patient and quality control samples to ensure no difference in the measurements among instruments. Additionally, to monitor for possible assay drift during the course of the study, five blood pools having HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels of 5%, 6%, 7%, 8%, and 9% (31, 42, 53, 64, and 75 mmol/mol, respectively) were prepared in the laboratory. The pools were aliquotted and stored under liquid nitrogen and analyzed for several days every month, and the mean values were plotted against their assigned values. There was consistently low variation around the target values with no evidence of assay drift over time. Some HbA<sub>1c</sub> assays are sensitive to hemoglobinopathies, of which HbS and HbF are especially common in African Americans, but the results are not affected by HbS. When a suspected S variant was detected, it was confirmed by an independent method. If HbF was above the instrument threshold, HbA<sub>1c</sub> results were not reported.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Analysis of HbA<sub>1c</sub> as a Predictor and as a Study Outcome</title><p>The current report includes the participants who did not have diabetes at baseline according to FPG, 2hPG, and HbA<sub>1c</sub> (2010 ADA criteria), that is, FPG &#x0003c;7.0 mmol/L, 2hPG &#x0003c;11.1 mmol/L, and HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x0003c;6.5% (48 mmol/mol). Of the 3,234 individuals randomized, we excluded 54 with FPG &#x02265;7.0 mmol/L (enrolled before the change in ADA diagnostic criteria), 7 with missing HbA<sub>1c</sub>, and 408 with HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x02265;6.5%, leaving an analysis set of 2,765 participants. The participants were grouped by baseline HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x0003c;5.5%, 5.5% to &#x0003c;6.0%, or 6.0% to &#x0003c;6.5% (&#x0003c;37, 37 to &#x0003c;42, or 42 to &#x0003c;48 mmol/mol, respectively) to determine the predictive value for diabetes development defined by glucose or HbA<sub>1c</sub>. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc14-0886/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. 1</ext-link> shows the follow-up of these participants. HbA<sub>1c</sub> results were not confirmed with repeat tests; therefore, for these analyses, a single HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x02265;6.5% was considered diagnostic.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Statistical Methods</title><p>The intention-to-treat analysis compared each intervention group with the placebo group on the modified product-limit life-table distribution using the log-rank test statistic. Treatment groups and study time periods were also compared with incidence rates in cases/100 person-years. Person-years were summed over all participants in a group of time to follow-up before a diagnosis or to end of follow-up if diabetes did not develop during the period of interest. Diabetes hazard rates were stratified by age, sex, and self-reported race/ethnicity, and the covariate effects were assessed by simultaneously evaluating indicator terms for each major group compared with a predefined comparison group with the likelihood ratio test. Risk reduction and interactions between treatment assignments and covariates were assessed by proportional hazards regression.</p><p>We present results for the 2,765 participants separately for the 3.0-year median (interquartile range 2.5&#x02013;3.7) follow-up in the DPP before the study results were announced and the protocol was modified and for the total follow-up period (DPP and DPPOS) from each participant&#x02019;s randomization until a common closing date of 27 August 2008 (median 9.9 years, interquartile range 9.0&#x02013;10.5). Statistical tests evaluating both periods must be interpreted while recognizing that they are not independent of each other (the first is contained in the second). Both periods are of interest: the DPP period because intervention effects on diabetes incidence were maximal in this period and it was the only double-blind period (for placebo and metformin) and the total follow-up period to assess effects for as long as possible.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s6"><title>Results</title><p>Baseline characteristics of the 2,765 participants are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>.

During the DPP period, the incidence of diabetes by glucose criteria was reduced by metformin versus placebo (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0013) and by lifestyle versus placebo (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001), and lifestyle intervention reduced it more than metformin (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0023).

By contrast, for incidence rates of HbA<sub>1c</sub>-defined diabetes, metformin and ILS resulted in nearly the same rate reductions as each other during the DPP period (44% and 49%, respectively) and during total follow-up (38% and 29%, respectively). During the DPP and total follow-up periods, the incidence of HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x02265;6.5% was reduced by metformin versus placebo (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001) and by lifestyle versus placebo (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001) but did not differ significantly between the metformin and lifestyle interventions.</p><fig id="F2" fig-type="figure" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Comparison of treatment effects on the incidence of diabetes diagnosed by glucose criteria or by HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x02265;6.5% (48 mmol/mol).

At the 1,059 examinations that led to a confirmed diabetes diagnosis based on glucose criteria during the total follow-up period, HbA<sub>1c</sub> was &#x0003c;6.5% in 779 (74%) participants, was &#x02265;6.5% for the first time in 105 (10%), and had been &#x02265;6.5% at a previous examination in 175 (17%). Conversely, at the first examination after baseline at which HbA<sub>1c</sub> was &#x02265;6.5% (750 occurrences), there was no confirmed glucose-based diagnosis of diabetes in 341 (45%), a confirmed glucose-based diagnosis triggered at the same visit in 105 (14%), and a previously confirmed glucose-based diabetes diagnosis in 304 (41%).</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s7"><title>Conclusions</title><p>HbA<sub>1c</sub> is recommended for identifying persons at high risk of developing diabetes and as a diabetes diagnostic criterion (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). In this report, we evaluated baseline HbA<sub>1c</sub> as a predictor of diabetes and analyzed the DPP and DPPOS as if HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x02265;6.5% had been the sole outcome. Baseline HbA<sub>1c</sub> predicted development of glucose- and HbA<sub>1c</sub>-defined diabetes during the DPP and total follow-up periods, confirming findings in other prevention trials (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) that HbA<sub>1c</sub> below the diagnostic level of 6.5% is directly associated with risk of developing diabetes. The risk relationship is continuous with baseline HbA<sub>1c</sub> as previously suggested (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), confirming that selection of high-risk cut points of 6.0% (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>) or 5.7% (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) is arbitrary. The optimal selection of high-risk characteristics for individuals offered diabetes prevention interventions will depend on available resources, health benefits of preventive measures, and their comparative effectiveness and costs.</p><p>In the DPP and DPPOS, diabetes was prevented or delayed with metformin or ILS aimed at weight loss and increased physical activity. The ILS was substantially more effective than metformin in preventing glucose-defined diabetes (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). By contrast, if HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x02265;6.5% had been the outcome, we would have concluded that both interventions were similarly effective. We would have also accrued fewer events, confirming that HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x02265;6.5% alone defines fewer persons as having diabetes than does the combination of FPG or 2hPG, as found in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) and the Finnish Diabetes Prevention Study (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). The HbA<sub>1c</sub> diagnostic cut point was purposefully chosen to favor specificity over sensitivity, recognizing that it would usually lead to fewer diagnoses compared with the 1997 glucose-based criteria (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).</p><p>These results add to previous DPP reports that metformin and ILS were similar in affecting FPG, whereas ILS was more effective for 2hPG-defined diabetes (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Metformin lowered FPG (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) consistent with its suppression of endogenous glucose production by the liver (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).</p><p>Do these results indicate that the two interventions will have equivalent health benefits in DPP participants; that is, is preventing diabetes defined by HbA<sub>1c</sub> as clinically important as preventing diabetes defined by FPG or 2hPG? HbA<sub>1c</sub> and FPG represent usual glycemia better than does 2hPG, which measures response to a nonphysiologic challenge. All three measures, however, have similar associations with microvascular disease (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Therefore, the relative importance for other health outcomes of these glycemic measures is not clear. The current analyses do not address the relative importance of reducing diabetes based on glucose or HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels. Better understanding of the relative long-term health effects of the two interventions should come from further follow-up, during which intervention effects on microvascular-neuropathic outcomes and cardiovascular disease risk factors will be assessed (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). The analyses performed to date of the treatment effects on other outcomes during DPP, including lipids, blood pressure, and hemostatic factors, suggest that ILS achieves better or similar results with less medication use (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Weight loss per se, which was greater with ILS, might have benefits beyond diabetes prevention. Neither the metformin nor the ILS had a significant interaction with a multigene diabetes risk score in predicting glucose-defined diabetes in the DPP (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), providing little support for considering genetic risk in choosing one of these treatment approaches. Evidence suggests that genotype at candidate loci influences success in weight loss intervention (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Such developments and more comprehensive research on the genetics of response to metformin and lifestyle interventions may ultimately lead to tools for selecting optimal interventions for diabetes prevention.</p><p>Not only did treatment effects on glucose-defined and HbA<sub>1c</sub>-defined diabetes differ, but the participants diagnosed by each criterion did not fully overlap. Only 26% of those diagnosed by FPG or 2hPG had a previous or simultaneous HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x02265;6.5%. Conversely, 55% of those first attaining an HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x02265;6.5% had a current or previous diagnosis of diabetes by glucose criteria. We cannot determine whether those diagnosed by FPG or 2hPG with HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x0003c;6.5% would have subsequently met this level had they not been diagnosed by glucose levels and diabetes management subsequently initiated.</p><p>There were significant treatment interactions with age and sex. We previously reported that the effects of the active DPP interventions differed by age, with ILS being exceptionally effective and metformin ineffective among participants &#x02265;60 years old at baseline (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Furthermore, among those developing diabetes during DPP, the older group was more likely than the young or middle-aged groups to be diagnosed by 2hPG, on which metformin may have less effect. In the current analysis of HbA<sub>1c</sub>-defined diabetes, the greater effect of ILS with older age was maintained, and metformin was effective in all age-groups, particularly in men. The apparent adverse effect of metformin on incidence of glucose-defined diabetes in older women was not observed for HbA<sub>1c</sub>-defined diabetes.</p><p>Racial differences in the relationships between HbA<sub>1c</sub> and FPG and 2hPG have been reported (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Other studies, however, suggested that interracial differences in HbA<sub>1c</sub> parallel differences in other measures of chronic glycemia (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) and that the relationships of HbA<sub>1c</sub> with retinopathy (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>) and macrovascular disease and death (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) are the same in American blacks and whites. Moreover, differences in HbA<sub>1c</sub> between races are not explained by ancestry-informative genetic markers (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) or by allele frequency differences in genes associated with HbA<sub>1c</sub> (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). In the current analyses over the total follow-up period, the incidence of diabetes in the African Americans was higher than in the other race/ethnicity groups whether diabetes was defined by glucose or HbA<sub>1c</sub>. In addition, treatment effects on HbA<sub>1c</sub>-defined diabetes were similar among the race/ethnicity groups. Despite potential race/ethnicity differences in HbA<sub>1c</sub>, these data suggest treatment efficacy in all the race/ethnicity groups.</p><p>There are three important limitations to these analyses. First, we cannot strictly compare the performance of the different tests for diabetes because by protocol, diagnoses made by FPG or 2hPG required confirmation and the HbA<sub>1c</sub> tests did not. Second, we cannot determine to what extent elevation of HbA<sub>1c</sub> to &#x02265;6.5% was prevented or delayed by the diagnosis of diabetes by glucose criteria and subsequent management or behavioral changes. Third, the eligibility criteria, including adults with BMI &#x02265;24 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, with elevated FPG and 2hPG but without limitations on HbA<sub>1c</sub>, limit generalizability. Among persons not selected by BMI and glucose criteria as in the DPP, it is not known to what extent HbA<sub>1c</sub> would predict diabetes or response to interventions. For example, persons with HbA<sub>1c</sub> in the range of 6.0&#x02013;6.4% who do not meet the other criteria may be at lower risk of diabetes than indicated herein. Given the uniformity of treatment effects according to baseline FPG and 2hPG reported previously (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>) and HbA<sub>1c</sub> in the current study, we suspect that the study interventions would reduce diabetes risk similarly regardless of these baseline factors but that the absolute risk reduction (or numbers of cases prevented per number treated) would be lower in persons with lower levels of risk factors. Because eligibility criteria in prevention trials have been so restricted, we do not know how best to select persons who should be offered preventive interventions (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>).</p><p>In summary, HbA<sub>1c</sub> measured at DPP entry predicted incidence of diabetes, and study treatment effects were uniform with respect to baseline HbA<sub>1c</sub> (i.e., there were no significant baseline HbA<sub>1c</sub> by treatment interactions). By contrast, although ILS was superior to metformin for preventing the development of glucose-defined diabetes, the effects of the two study treatments were similar in preventing diabetes defined by HbA<sub>1c</sub>. The health implications of these treatment and diagnostic differences await further assessment of long-term health outcomes.</p></sec>
