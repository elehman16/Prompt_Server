                    the greatest risk in elementary-age students occurring shortly after returning
                    to school following summer break. Recent research suggests that this seasonality
                    in children is primarily related to viral respiratory tract infections. Regular
                    hand washing is the most effective method to prevent the spread of viral
                    respiratory infections; unfortunately, achieving hand washing recommendations in
                    schools is difficult. Therefore, we designed a study to evaluate the effect of
                    hand sanitizer use in elementary schools on exacerbations among children with
                    asthma.</p><p><bold><italic>Purpose</italic></bold> To describe the process of redesigning the
                    trial in response to changes in the safety profile of the hand sanitizer as well
                    as changes in hand hygiene practice in the schools.</p><p><bold><italic>Methods</italic></bold> The original trial was a randomized,
                    longitudinal, subject-blinded, placebo-controlled, community-based crossover
                    trial. The primary aim was to evaluate the incremental effectiveness of hand
                    sanitizer use in addition to usual hand hygiene practices to decrease asthma
                    exacerbations in elementary-age children. Three events occurred that required
                    major modifications to the original study protocol: (1) safety concerns arose
                    regarding the hand sanitizer&#x02019;s active ingredient; (2) no substitute placebo hand
                    sanitizer was available; and (3) community preferences changed regarding hand
                    hygiene practices in the schools.</p><p><bold><italic>Results</italic></bold> The revised protocol is a randomized,
                    longitudinal, community-based crossover trial. The primary aim is to evaluate
                    the incremental effectiveness of a two-step hand hygiene process (hand hygiene
                    education plus institutionally provided alcohol-based hand sanitizer) versus
                    usual care to decrease asthma exacerbations. Enrollment was completed in May
                    2009 with 527 students from 30 schools. The intervention began in August 2009
                    and will continue through May 2011. Study results should be available at the end
                    of 2011.</p><p><bold><italic>Limitations</italic></bold> The changed design does not allow us to
                    directly measure the effectiveness of hand sanitizer use as a supplement to
                    traditional hand washing practices.</p><p><bold><italic>Conclusions</italic></bold> The need to balance a rigorous study
                    design with one that is acceptable to the community requires investigators to be
                    actively involved with community collaborators and able to adapt study protocols
                    to fit changing community practices.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1-1740774511403513"><title>Background</title><p>Poor asthma control in children is a well documented public health problem in the US

                physical environments has provided mixed results. A 1998 report of elementary school

                or insufficiently filled and 33% of automatic hand dryers were inoperable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1740774511403513">21</xref>]. A 2009 study of
                primary and secondary school restrooms in New Mexico reported that soap and hand

                        elementary-age students. To control for school variation and to minimize
                        cross-contamination, individual schools served as the unit of randomization.
                        Crossover between intervention and placebo schools occurred during the
                        summer break between the first and second year. There were two major
                        advantages of the crossover design. The first was the ability to control for
                        the strong seasonal variation in respiratory illnesses that was expected.
                        The second was the ability to maximize school support and participation
                        because all schools would eventually receive the intervention instead of

                    grant awards, we found new data indicating that benzalkonium chloride: (1)
                    induced moderate genotoxic effects in eukaryotic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1740774511403513">37</xref>], (2) produced histological changes
                    (hyperplasia, incomplete keratinization, loss of the granular layer,
                    acantholysis, and necrosis) in organ-cultured skin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1740774511403513">38</xref>], (3) induced biofilm formation (a
                    matrix of cells attaching to each other and a surface) of some bacterial species
                        [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1740774511403513">39</xref>], and (4)
                    possibly caused allergic contact dermatitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1740774511403513">40</xref>]. These concerns prompted a search
                    for another nonalcohol-based product but no substitute could be found. The only
                    viable option was to switch to an alcohol-based product. While this alleviated
                    many of the safety concerns related to benzalkonium chloride, it prevented the
                    use of a subject-blinded design because there was no placebo for an
                    alcohol-based product.</p><p>Between the time of the grant development and its award, the schools&#x02019; typical
                    hand hygiene practices changed substantially due in large part to changes in the
                    community&#x02019;s perceptions regarding disease risk. School principals, faculty, and
                    parents had become convinced that hand sanitizer was necessary for good hand
                    hygiene within the schools. There was considerable fear that hand washing alone
                    was not sufficient to prevent &#x02018;the spread of germs&#x02019;. This perception was
                    reinforced by a methicillin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>
                    (MRSA) outbreak in several schools prior to the study. Because of these
                    concerns, hand sanitizer use increased dramatically such that many schools
                    required parents to purchase personal hand sanitizer as a supply item. Despite
                    reassurance by the local health department that hand washing remained the best
                    option for hand hygiene, community perceptions were so strong that a hand
                    washing only arm was no longer a viable option.</p></sec><sec id="sec14-1740774511403513"><title>Revision process</title><p>The decision to change a study protocol after a grant award is a difficult one
                    that involves many important stakeholders. For this trial, important
                    stakeholders included the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) and
                    its designee (project officer), our Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB), our
                    Institutional Review Board, and the community as represented by school
                    administration, faculty and staff, and parents. Our goal was to maintain the
                    scientific integrity of the study while adapting to safety concerns and changes
                    in the community&#x02019;s preferences.</p><p>Chronologically, the first major decision involved the change from the original
                    hand sanitizer with its corresponding placebo to an alcohol-based product
                    without one. While the safety concerns that prompted this decision were mostly
                    theoretical, we agreed that ensuring participant safety, especially among
                    children, warranted erring on the side of caution. The principal investigator
                    and key study personnel made this decision in close collaboration with the NHLBI
                    project officer and DSMB over the course of multiple teleconferences. The
                    primary goal was to ensure that the redesigned study addressed an important
                    research question using a methodologically rigorous design without compromising
                    student safety. The school system administration (superintendent and chief
                    nursing officer) were appraised of the rationale for the proposed changes and
                    were asked to approve them prior to implementation.</p><p>Because there was no placebo for the alcohol-based product, it was no longer
                    possible to conduct a subject-blinded design for a direct test of the
                    effectiveness of hand sanitizer as a supplement to hand washing. Instead, we
                    chose to compare the effectiveness of a standardized two-step hand hygiene
                    process (hand washing plus hand sanitizer) with handwashing only. Schools would
                    be randomly assigned to use study-provided hand sanitizer and hand soap
                    (intervention arm) or to hand washing only (usual care arm). Crossover would
                    still occur after the first year.</p><p>When we met with school principals and parent advisory groups to discuss the
                    revisions, including randomization of some schools to hand washing only, we
                    learned that personal hand sanitizer use had become ubiquitous in many schools.
                    We asked schools to discourage personal hand sanitizer use (e.g., removing hand
                    sanitizer from their required supply lists) by arguing that hand washing was the
                    preferred method of hand hygiene. The local health department reinforced this
                    message on our behalf, but parents and school faculty countered that personal
                    hand sanitizer use was surmounting existing barriers to adequate hand washing
                    and that they were reticent to restrict its use. They also pointed out the
                    difficulty of enforcing restrictions against personal hand sanitizer use while
                    at school.</p><p>Unfortunately, we were unable to secure any restrictions which meant that instead
                    of the usual care arm being a hand washing only arm, it would now also include a
                    variable amount of personal hand sanitizer use as well. The unexpected increase
                    in personal hand sanitizer use presented a potential bias to the null effect; to
                    control for this possibility we developed instruments to monitor the schools&#x02019;
                    hand hygiene practices more carefully.</p><p>All of the revisions occurred prior to participant enrollment; therefore, no

                        included regular hand washing with soap and water supplemented by hand
                        sanitizer use. To overcome potential resource barriers to adequate hand
                        hygiene practices in intervention schools, the study provided intervention
                        schools with alcohol-based hand sanitizer, hand soap, and needed refills.
                        Hand soap dispensers were installed by study personnel and hand sanitizer
                        was made available in disposable bottles in all intervention restrooms,
                        health rooms, and classrooms with a sink.</p><p>To our surprise the installation of dispensers became an important issue.
                        Originally, we used the installation of permanent hand sanitizer dispensers
                        as an incentive for schools to participate. Since the hand sanitizer
                        dispensers would hold product with either an active ingredient or placebo,
                        installing them at the beginning of the study in all schools did not pose a
                        problem following crossover. After the redesign, the lack of a placebo
                        created the potential for a carry-over effect if Year 1 intervention schools
                        were to continue using the dispensers during Year 2 when assigned to usual
                        care. We proposed eliminating permanent dispensers altogether, but
                        discontinuation became an issue with the schools as they wanted us to honor
                        our original commitment.</p><p>A compromise was reached by installing hand soap dispensers, instead of hand
                        sanitizer dispensers, in each school prior to the start of their
                        intervention year. Schools were concerned that removing dispensers after the
                        intervention year was over might damage walls so we agreed to leave them in
                        place but we would no longer supply refills. We deemed that the potential
                        use of the hand soap dispensers during the usual care year posed less of a
                        carry-over/contamination risk than the use of hand sanitizer dispensers
                        would.</p><p>In the revised design, the &#x02018;Always Be Clean&#x02019; hand hygiene curriculum was
                        replaced with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&#x02019;s (CDC) School
                        Network for Absenteeism Prevention (SNAP) program (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.itsasnap.org/index.asp">http://www.itsasnap.org/index.asp</ext-link>) because the ABC program
                        was a branded program of Woodward Laboratories Incorporated, the company
                        which produces the benzalkonium chloride hand sanitizer. Hand washing with
                        soap and water was promoted after using the restroom and when visible dirt
                        was on the hands as recommended by the CDC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1740774511403513">30</xref>]. Hand sanitizer use was
                        promoted as a supplement to hand washing upon arrival at the classroom,
                        before lunch, after using the restroom, and after sneezing or coughing.</p><p>Only schools in the intervention arm received the annual training and monthly
                        refreshers; usual care schools did not receive any hand hygiene education or
                        any hand hygiene supplies. They were expected to maintain their customary
                        hand hygiene practices. These practices varied across schools and included
                        hand washing and personal hand sanitizer use of differing quality and
                        frequency. Some of this variation was attributable to the inconsistent
                        supply of hand hygiene resources among some schools. Because of this
                        variability, usual care schools might not be able to maintain the hand
                        hygiene practices necessary to minimize the spread of respiratory viruses
                        among the student population.</p></sec><sec id="sec21-1740774511403513"><title>Revised hand sanitizer/active ingredient</title><p>Ethyl alcohol (62% solution) in foam (Purell&#x000ae; instant hand sanitizer

                        instrument was used to conduct a one-time baseline assessment of each
                        school&#x02019;s &#x02018;fixed&#x02019; environmental facilities with regard to the availability,
                        type and working condition of sinks, soap dispensers, hand sanitizer
                        dispensers and hand drying devices (i.e., paper towels or air-dryers). The
                        availability of hot and cold water and type of faucet mechanisms available
                        (e.g., spring-loaded, automatic, manual-turn) was also recorded.</p><p>The second instrument was used for monthly monitoring of the availability of
                        hand hygiene resources at each school. The type of hand hygiene supplies
                        available at each school (usual care and intervention) and their
                        availability, that is, liquid or bar soap, hand drying mechanism, hand
                        sanitizer, and hand hygiene instructions are recorded. General cleanliness
                        and structural condition also were noted. Data were used to describe hand
                        hygiene resource availability in the usual care schools and to monitor
                        implementation of the two-step hand hygiene program in the intervention
                        schools.</p><p>Since hand sanitizer was recommended as a supplement to standard hand washing
                        in a setting of limited school resources, it was deemed important to
                        estimate the incremental value of hand sanitizer use. Therefore, an economic
                        analysis was added as a study aim to estimate the additional costs of hand
                        sanitizer use. A careful cost accounting of the usual care and intervention
                        activities is being conducted. Cost and effectiveness data will be combined
                        to conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing the two-step hand hygiene

                        during the first time period persists into the second time period. The
                        persistence of the effect may bias the measured effect of the second
                        intervention. It is possible that educational intervention could lead to
                        sustained changes in hand hygiene practices at interventions schools that
                        might persist into the second year; however, the presence of a summer break
                        provides a 10-week &#x02018;wash out&#x02019; period that should minimize any carryover
                        effect since no reinforcement is provided to original intervention schools
                        during the second year. Research has shown that changes in behavioral
                        practices typically decline by 40&#x02013;80% after 6 weeks without reinforcement

                time between study development, funding, and implementation. During this interval,
                key stakeholders, perceptions, and standard practices within the community can
                change, often in an unpredictable manner which is outside the control of the
                research team. At the same time, new scientific discoveries may emerge that render
                the original study assumptions obsolete. Because of this dynamic environment, the
                community-based researcher must be responsive to changes that may undermine the
                original study design or collaborations with community partners.</p><p>We have found that a study team with a broad range of skills, talents, and interests
                is well positioned to respond to a quickly changing environment. Not all team
                members are equally suited to serve as liaisons with community partners. In
                school-based research, team members with prior work experience in the schools (e.g.,
                former administrators, teachers, or coaches) often can establish more effective
                collaborations with school personnel than &#x02018;academicians&#x02019;. These team members can use
                their previous relationships to identify and gain access to the key stakeholders
                within the school system. Additionally, they can navigate a cultural work
                environment that is often quite different from the academic setting. Having team
                members with this background is critically important for school-based research.</p><p>In retrospect, the most crucial decision that impacted our original research design
                was the decision to abandon the nonalcohol-based hand sanitizer containing
                benzalkonium chloride. Without this product and its corresponding placebo, we were
                unable to conduct a subject-blinded design. Initially, we felt confident that the
                product was safe and effective; however, the <italic>in&#x000a0;vitro</italic> data that
                subsequently emerged cast doubts on the product&#x02019;s previously established safety
                record. The new data emerged at a point in the study cycle where little time was
                available to contemplate the decision without substantially delaying implementation.
                We also were sensitive to safety concerns given that we were working with a
                vulnerable population (children) in a challenging research setting (schools). We
                believed that a smaller body of <italic>in&#x000a0;vitro</italic> findings questioning the
                product's safety trumped a larger body of <italic>in&#x000a0;vivo</italic> findings
                demonstrating safety that were obtained through industry-funded, manufacturer-led
                research.</p><p>The impact of eliminating the subject-blinded design was magnified by the abrupt
                change in community hand hygiene practices within the schools. If personal hand
                sanitizer use had not been prevalent in usual care schools, the crossover design
                would have been a robust test of hand sanitizer as compared with hand washing alone.
                However, the ubiquitous nature of personal hand sanitizer use forced us to rely on
                what had been reported previously to be substandard hand hygiene practices within
                the schools due to significant structural barriers. By supplying the education and
                resources to ensure that the barriers to effective hand hygiene in the intervention
                schools were eliminated, we were able to evaluate the best possible hand hygiene
                practice (hand washing plus hand sanitizer use) against a variety of usual care
                practices. Unfortunately, the study no longer can measure the effectiveness of hand
                sanitizer use directly as a supplement to traditional hand washing practices. If the
                trial results are negative, the possibility of bias created by personal hand
                sanitizer within usual care schools may be the primary contributing factor.</p><p>Community-based clinical trials are needed to establish the effectiveness of
                interventions under real-world conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1740774511403513">43</xref>]. A methodologically rigorous study
                design is important to achieve this goal, but the community-based researcher must
                also respect community beliefs and practices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1740774511403513">44</xref>]. Failure to address them satisfactorily
                may compromise the ethical conduct of research, particularly in vulnerable
                populations. It also may be counterproductive as the community partners are vital to
                the translation of research knowledge into sustainable practices.</p></sec></body><back><sec id="sec27-1740774511403513"><title>Funding</title><p>This work was supported by a grant from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute
