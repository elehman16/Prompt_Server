The number of new infections declined 33% since 2001 to 2.3 (1.9&#x02013;2.7) million in 2012. The number of AIDS deaths had also declined to 1.6 (1.4&#x02013;1.9) million in 2012 from 2.3 (2.1&#x02013;2.6) million in 2005. These changes reflect an increased access of antiretroviral therapy globally. However, HIV antiretroviral treatment coverage in low-and middle-income countries amounted to only 34% (32&#x02013;37%) of the 26.8 million eligible for treatment in 2013 [<xref rid="pone.0131748.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Notwithstanding increased intervention efforts, a safe and effective HIV vaccine is still needed [<xref rid="pone.0131748.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0131748.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The ideal HIV vaccine would prevent acquisition of infection and control viral replication.</p><p>Pre-clinical studies in nonhuman primates and studies in HIV-infected individuals have suggested that both cell-mediated and antibody-mediated virus-specific immune responses would contribute to the efficacy of an HIV vaccine. Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) Env-specific antibodies exhibiting binding and functional properties were suggested to be critical for protection from virus acquisition in monkeys [<xref rid="pone.0131748.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells can mediate control of viral replication in HIV-infected individuals and SIV-infected monkeys [<xref rid="pone.0131748.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Furthermore, cytolytic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were shown to be important in both early viral control in acute HIV infection [<xref rid="pone.0131748.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and in attenuated SIV infection [<xref rid="pone.0131748.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>HIV-vaccine efficacy in humans was demonstrated in the RV144 trial in 2009. A canary pox (ALVAC) prime and an envelope protein (AIDSVAX) boost vaccine induced a modest 31.2% reduction of transmission in low-incidence Thai heterosexuals, without effects on HIV viral load or CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell counts in infected individuals [<xref rid="pone.0131748.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Ensuing immune-correlates analyses demonstrated that binding IgG antibodies to variable regions 1 and 2 (V1V2) of HIV-1 envelope proteins [<xref rid="pone.0131748.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0131748.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and IgG to linear epitopes in the V2 and V3 regions correlated inversely with the risk of HIV infection [<xref rid="pone.0131748.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Analysis of the T cell responses in the RV144 vaccinees confirmed HIV gp120 V2 specificity and revealed CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells exhibiting polyfunctionality and cytolytic capacity [<xref rid="pone.0131748.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Several HIV prime-boost vaccine concepts are being tested in phase I/II trials [<xref rid="pone.0131748.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In the majority of these clinical trials, plasmid DNA is being used for priming immunizations. The DNA vaccine is followed by boosting immunizations using either, envelope protein, a recombinant pox virus vector or a recombinant adenovirus vector. DNA vaccines have advantages over other vaccines since they allow for repeat administration due to lack of anti-vector responses, the focusing of immune response, stability over a wide range of storage conditions and their excellent safety profiles [<xref rid="pone.0131748.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. DNA vaccines on their own have been poorly immunogenic in humans. Nonetheless, we and others have shown that they are an effective priming modality in clinical HIV prime boost vaccine regimens [<xref rid="pone.0131748.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0131748.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>Strategies to increase plasmid DNA immunogenicity are being sought. In vivo electroporation (EP) is one such strategy that is being explored. EP enhances DNA uptake efficacy by the transient formation of pores in the cell membrane. It also results in an influx of APCs and other immune cells to the site of injection and causes a local inflammatory reaction, which will further enhance the immunogenicity of the gene product [<xref rid="pone.0131748.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0131748.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Non-human primate studies have shown that intramuscular EP increases the immunogenicity of SIV DNA vaccines [<xref rid="pone.0131748.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0131748.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Two phase I HIV vaccine trials using intramuscular EP have been performed. Findings in both trials show enhanced cellular immune responses when applying intramuscular EP for DNA vaccine delivery [<xref rid="pone.0131748.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0131748.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. However, there was considerable discomfort associated with the intramuscular EP [<xref rid="pone.0131748.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Since ID EP has been shown to be very effective in preclinical studies [<xref rid="pone.0131748.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0131748.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0131748.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], it might offer a more acceptable alternative, if shown to be effective also in humans.</p><p>In the present hypothesis-generating phase I clinical trial in Stockholm, Sweden we determined the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of an HIV-DNA prime HIV-MVA boost vaccine regimen. The priming plasmid DNA vaccine was delivered intradermally (ID) using a needle free device (ZetaJet) with or without intradermal EP applied with the Dermavax (Cellectis) device. Boosting vaccinations were performed with recombinant modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) expressing HIV-1 genes. A group of vaccinees was randomized to receive CN54 subtype C gp140 protein (without adjuvant) at the time of the HIV-MVA vaccinations in order to obtain preliminary toxicity and immunogenicity data.</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec id="sec008"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>The protocols and products were approved by Regionala Etikpr&#x000f6;vningsn&#x000e4;mnden i Stockholm (Regional Ethics Committee in Stockholm), and the Swedish Medical Products Agency.

The first volunteer was enrolled October 20, 2010 and the last follow-up visit was completed March 13, 2013. The trial aimed to recruit 36 participants, but was restricted to 30 participants due to recruitment difficulties (low remuneration and many visits) after consultation with the Medical Products Agency.</p><p>The volunteers were randomized into three different treatment arms (<xref rid="pone.0131748.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) to be injected three times with 0.6 mg of HIV-1 DNA plasmids or placebo intradermally (ID) given by a needle-free spring-driven ZetaJet device (Bioject Medical Technologies, Inc., Tualatin, OR, USA) followed by intramuscular (IM) boost injections with 10<sup>8</sup> pfu of HIV-MVA or placebo at weeks 24 and 40. Group 1 received &#x02018;standard&#x02019; immunization and the other two groups of volunteers received additional intradermal electroporation performed with the Dermavax device (Cellectis AS, Romainville, France) after each immunization with HIV-1 DNA or placebo. The randomization was performed by an independent consultant to the pharmacy, APL, in two steps. First an equal number of men and women were randomized to three groups by the computer program 'Design' from two blocks of 18. In each subgroup of 6 a single placebo was randomly assigned. The remainder in each group were allocated to vaccine. The allocation was kept in the pharmacy and only the group allocation was communicated to the clinic upon a written request for an enrolment. The laboratory was blinded to both group and placebo. Electroporation was performed by pressing an array of 2 rows of 6 needle electrodes of 2 mm in length spaced 4 mm apart against the skin on the outside of the upper arms, straddling the injection site, followed by two 0.05 millisecond pulses of 450 V and eight 10 millisecond pulses of 110 V during 0.3 seconds [<xref rid="pone.0131748.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. One group of vaccinees who received DNA with EP also received 100 &#x003bc;g of gp140 given IM in parallel with the HIV-MVA vaccinations in the opposite arm.

The HIV-DNA immunizations were followed by two boosts with recombinant modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA)-Chiang Mai double recombinant (CMDR) encoding HIV-1 Env of subtype E and Gag-Pol of subtype A from Thai isolates CM235 and CM240, respectively (HIV-MVA) [<xref rid="pone.0131748.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The vaccine was produced by the US Military HIV Research Program, Forest Glen, MD, USA. One group of vaccinees received in addition an immunization of Env gp140 of subtype C without adjuvant. The gp140 clade C envelope (gp120 plus the external domain (ED) of gp41), designated CN54gp140, was produced as a recombinant product in CHO cells (S. Jeffs personal communication), and the protein was manufactured to GMP specification by Polymun Scientific (Vienna, Austria). The Env gp140 protein is encoded by the CN54gp140REKR HIV-1 envelope gene cassette derived from the clade-C/B&#x02019; HIV-1 molecular clone p97CN54 of Chinese origin [<xref rid="pone.0131748.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Safety</title><p>Safety evaluations, which included physical examinations and laboratory tests, were performed before and 2 weeks after each vaccination, and 3 months after the last vaccination.

Clinical and safety laboratory data were entered in the computerized hospital patient registry system under the national identification code and full name. Study data were entered under study code and initials on clinical report forms. Specimens for immunological and virological studies were sent under study code to the Swedish Institute for Communicable Disease Control, which as of January 2014 is The Public Health Agency of Sweden, from where samples were distributed to IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy. The laboratories remained blinded to the randomization throughout the trial. The primary endpoint was safety and tolerability. This was assessed with standardized visual analogue scales (VAS) up to 30 minutes post injections, in a diary card during the first 7 days and with solicited adverse events and routine laboratory assays at 2 weeks post injections. Any grade 3 event was taken to indicate that the treatment is less tolerable which would lead to a study halt. Volunteer data and immunological data were analysed in SPSS 15.0 under study code. The secondary endpoint was IFN-&#x003b3; ELISpot reactivity 2 weeks after the last HIV-DNA immunization and after the HIV-MVA boosts. Group 1 served as the control group and corresponded to historical data. The addition of electroporation was assessed in groups 2 and 3. Group 3 was a descriptive assessment of additional gp140 given together with the HIV-MVA boost. Most data are presented without statistical analysis since this is a descriptive, hypothesis-generating study. The magnitudes of immune responses were compared using Mann-Whitney U-test. Fischer&#x02019;s Exact test was used for comparisons between groups. A p value of &#x0003c;0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec019"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec020"><title>Enrollment</title><p>A total of 275 individuals were contacted by telephone for possible participation.

A group of vaccinees were randomized to receive CN54 subtype C gp140 protein (without adjuvant) at the time of the HIV-MVA vaccinations. Thirty healthy volunteers were enrolled in the trial, of whom 19 volunteers (including three placebo recipients) received EP. The vaccinations were safe and very well tolerated.</p><p>Intradermal immunization with the Zetajet was well tolerated and addition of ID EP with the current device and settings added little discomfort. No volunteer hesitated to complete the study schedule. In a small series an increased electroporated ID volume, 3 mm needles with a gap of 6 mm with a corresponding increase in voltage, was feasible (Hejdeman and Sandstr&#x000f6;m, personal observation). This opens for further studies of needle-free administration of vaccines and evaluation of ID EP.</p><p>This is the first clinical report of intradermal EP used in combination with ID HIV-DNA (0.6 mg) vaccinations delivered using ZetaJet. After three HIV-DNA immunizations, IFN-&#x003b3; ELISpot response rates to Gag peptide pool stimulation were modest and not statistically different between vaccinees who received HIV-DNA with EP (5/15, 33%) compared to those receiving HIV-DNA without EP (1/7, 14%). HIV-Env-specific binding antibodies were not detected after the first HIV-MVA/gp140 vaccination, but after the second HIV-MVA/gp140 vaccination. Previous clinical HIV vaccine trials using EP have applied intramuscular delivery of the DNA vaccine in combination with intramuscular EP. Vasan et al reported a 63% ELISpot response rate in vaccinees receiving 1.0 mg ADVAX DNA and intramuscular EP (TriGrid delivery System) after two vaccinations, while none of the eight vaccinees receiving a higher ADVAX dose (4.0 mg) without EP developed ELISpot reactivity [<xref rid="pone.0131748.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The use of 3 mg PENNVAX-B DNA vaccine in combination with intramuscular EP with the CELLECTRA Adaptive Constant Current Electroporation device (Inovio Pharmaceuticals) induced HIV-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses to Gag and/or Env in 3/10 (30%) vaccinees after two vaccinations and in 4/9 (44%) after three vaccinations [<xref rid="pone.0131748.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Binding antibody responses to Env were rare in both trials [<xref rid="pone.0131748.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0131748.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>We have performed a small pilot study where a single vaccination of 10<sup>8</sup> pfu HIV-MVA was administered IM to ten healthy Swedish vaccinees. Two weeks after the vaccination, 3 (33%) of 9 evaluable vaccinees had a Gag-specific IFN-&#x003b3; ELISpot response. The magnitude of response in the three responders was 85, 130 and 75 SFC/10<sup>6</sup> PBMCs, respectively. The same vaccinees also had Env-specific responses of 95, 75, and 60 SFC/10<sup>6</sup> PBMCs, respectively (Biberfeld, Earl, Hejdeman, Nilsson, Robb, Sandstr&#x000f6;m, unpublished data). Here, after receipt of three HIV-DNA immunizations, the first HIV-MVA vaccination increased the overall IFN-&#x003b3; ELISpot response rate to 18/19 (95%) and response rates were similar across the vaccination groups. All IFN-&#x003b3; ELISpot responders exhibited broad reactivity, as seen by responses to multiple peptide pools and the magnitude of responses was high to both Gag and Env peptide pools (medians of 570 and 245 SFC/10<sup>6</sup> PBMCs, respectively). These findings are similar to those described in the HIVIS03 trial, where vaccinees received three HIV-DNA vaccinations of 1 mg ID or 3.8 mg IM delivered using a needle-free device (Biojector) followed by HIV-MVA. In that trial, using freshly prepared PBMCs for testing, an overall IFN-&#x003b3; ELISpot response rate of 100% was observed with a response to multiple peptide pools and median responses to Gag and Env of 625 and 267 SFC/10<sup>6</sup> PBMCs, respectively [<xref rid="pone.0131748.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>In the present trial, HIV-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses to Gag or Env peptides were seen in 17/18 (94%) vaccinees tested by ICS after the first HIV-MVA vaccination. A balanced response was seen with 78% responding in the CD4<sup>+</sup> compartment and 71% in the CD8<sup>+</sup> compartment. IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-2 dominated the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells responses to Gag and Env. A high degree of polyfunctionality, with co-expression of MIP-1&#x003b2; and/or the degranulation marker CD107 was also noted. The CD8<sup>+</sup> response to Gag was dominated by IFN-&#x003b3; and MIP-1&#x003b2;, combined with IL-2 and/or CD107. CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell reactivity to Env was rare and induced monofunctional cells mainly expressing MIP-1&#x003b2;. These findings are similar to those we reported previously when using the same vaccines, but with a delayed second HIV-MVA boost [<xref rid="pone.0131748.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Notably, no clear differences were seen between the vaccination groups. In the trial studying ADVAX DNA and intramuscular EP (TriGrid delivery System), EP delivery improved the quality of the T-cell response by inducing parallel secretion of IFN-&#x003b3;, IL-2, TNF&#x003b1; and MIP-1&#x003b2; [<xref rid="pone.0131748.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>Binding antibodies to subtype B gp160 and subtype C gp140 were detected in a high proportion (92% and 93%, respectively) of vaccinees&#x02019; sera four weeks after the second HIV-MVA vaccination. No difference in median titer to gp160 was seen, whether or not EP was used for priming. Notably, the vaccinees who received three HIV-DNA vaccinations in combination with intradermal EP prior to the two HIV-MVA vaccinations combined with gp140 protein boost (group 3) exhibited significantly higher gp140 binding ELISA titers than volunteers given HIV-DNA without EP and HIV-MVA vaccinations without gp140 (group 1, p = 0.0403). Nonetheless, the titers in HIV-DNA/EP plus HIV-MVA/gp140 recipients (group 3) were not significantly higher than in vaccinees who received HIV-DNA/EP and HIV-MVA alone (group 2), suggesting minimal influence of gp140 on boosting for binding antibodies.</p><p>Here we administered the Envelope protein without an adjuvant since a suitable adjuvant was not available and the purpose of including the gp140 protein boost in the present trial was primarily to assess the safety of the protein in preparation for a larger clinical trial. The Env gp140 subtype C boosts given in combination with HIV-MVA vaccinations did not notably enhance the Env-specific cellular immune responses as determined by ELISpot, LPA and ICS. Further studies are needed to determine whether administration of the protein given with an appropriate adjuvant will enhance antibody responses.</p><p>The limitation of this trial was the low number of participants, partly due to the low remuneration and the high visit requirements of the trial, which also caused some loss to follow-up. However, the number of electroporations that were given indicates the tolerability of this intervention. The lack of convincing effect of ID EP observed here has to be verified in a larger study.</p><p>We have thus demonstrated that ID EP is safe and highly tolerable in healthy volunteers. Strong cell-mediated and antibody-mediated immune responses were elicited by the HIV-DNA prime HIV-MVA boosting regimen, irrespective of ID EP use. A phase IIa trial where ID HIV-DNA delivery is administered using the ZetaJet device with or without EP and adjuvanted gp140 subtype C is given simultaneously with HIV-MVA vaccinations is ongoing in two African countries.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec028"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0131748.s001"><label>S1 CONSORT Checklist</label><caption><title>CONSORT checklist.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0131748.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0131748.s002"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses to Gag CMDR and Env CMDR peptide pool stimulation four weeks after the first HIV-MVA vaccination.</title><p>Eight-colour ICS was performed on cryopreserved PBMCs and expression of IFN-&#x003b3;, IL-2, MIP-1&#x003b2; and CD107a was assessed.
