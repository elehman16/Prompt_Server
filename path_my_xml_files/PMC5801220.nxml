Biphasic insulin aspart 30 (BIAsp&#x000a0;30) is one such analogue premix insulin, which contains a mixture of soluble insulin aspart (IAsp) 30% and protaminated IAsp 70%, and is recommended to be injected either once daily (OD), twice daily (BID), or three times daily (TID) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In insulin-na&#x000ef;ve patients with T2D who have poor glycemic control, initiation of BIAsp&#x000a0;30 has been shown to significantly reduce HbA<sub>1c</sub> and has been associated with a slight weight gain, but no increased risk of severe hypoglycemic episodes, compared with basal insulin only regimens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par9">Following failure of adequately titrated basal insulin and oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs) to maintain glycemic control, the American Diabetes Association (ADA)&#x02019;s recommended treatment algorithm is stepwise intensification with a rapid-acting prandial insulin added to a basal insulin OD regimen (&#x0201c;basal plus&#x0201d;), up to three injections of prandial insulin per day (&#x0201c;basal&#x02013;bolus&#x0201d;) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].

This model included treatment, region, and strata (two levels: pretrial metformin and SU, with/without other OAD) as fixed effects, HbA<sub>1c</sub> at baseline as covariate, and interactions between all fixed effects and visit, and between the covariate and visit.

Prandial PG increment for each meal (breakfast, lunch, main evening meal) was derived from the 7-point SMPG profile as the difference between prandial 90-min PG values and the PG value before meal in each separate profile. Mean 90-min postprandial glucose increments over all meals were derived as the mean of all corresponding meal increments.

Compared with BIAsp&#x000a0;30, basal&#x02013;bolus treatment resulted in a greater reduction in HbA<sub>1c</sub> from baseline, a higher proportion of patients achieving HbA<sub>1c</sub> below 7% (overall and without severe hypoglycemia during the last 12&#x000a0;weeks of treatment), along with a greater reduction in FPG. However, the estimated mean prandial PG increments were statistically significantly lower at breakfast and dinner for the BIAsp&#x000a0;30 arm compared with the basal&#x02013;bolus arm, whereas the difference at lunch was not statistically significant. The overall rate of severe or BG-confirmed hypoglycemic events was numerically lower for BIAsp&#x000a0;30 compared with basal&#x02013;bolus, with a post hoc analysis indicating that the overall rate of severe or BG-confirmed nocturnal hypoglycemia was statistically significantly lower with BIAsp&#x000a0;30 compared with basal&#x02013;bolus.

Furthermore, premix TID and basal&#x02013;bolus regimens are now viewed as having comparable efficacy and safety, where patients may switch between the two to achieve optimal glycemic control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. When appraising the results of the current trial within the patient-centered model of treatment of T2D, the importance of achieving optimal control of HbA<sub>1c</sub> may be overridden by the importance of preventing hypoglycemia for certain patients, with hypoglycemia having a number of deleterious physical and psychological outcomes that can significantly impair patient functioning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p id="Par34">When intensifying treatment with a patient who has failed to achieve glycemic control with basal insulin OD and OADs, a full basal&#x02013;bolus regimen provides a more flexible possibility to fine-tune dosing in relation to meals etc. However, many clinicians find that premix insulin has advantages over a basal&#x02013;bolus insulin regimen. For instance, current guidance suggests that premix insulin regimens may have greater simplicity, require fewer injections and self-measured blood glucose monitoring, and be more practical for patients with physical disabilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. A premix regimen may be more suitable for patients with regular meals and a large, consistent carbohydrate intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Premix insulin regimens require only one injection device and this has the potential to reduce the risk of mix-ups that can often be observed when patients have to manage multiple devices during basal&#x02013;bolus therapy.</p><p id="Par35">There are limitations of the current trial that should be discussed. For example, on the basis of our clinical experience, it is likely that achieving HbA<sub>1c</sub>&#x000a0;below 7% in 8&#x000a0;weeks with a premix regimen alongside metformin and SU, in the absence of hypoglycemia, would be a challenge for many patients with T2D. Further, although the A<sub>1</sub>chieve study in real-world clinical practice showed a significant reduction in HbA<sub>1c</sub> with a relatively low rate of hypoglycemia when patients began or changed to insulin analogue therapy and continued metformin and SU, the design of the current trial differed. Specifically, in A<sub>1</sub>chieve, the participant and physician determined the choice and starting dose of insulin, administration frequency, and any later changes to either dose or frequency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. An additional limitation could also be argued to be the open-label nature of the trial, which was required as blinding of the insulin interventions was considered inappropriate and would have resulted in a requirement for placebo injections. Lastly, because of the way that hypoglycemia was assessed in the current trial, episodes of nocturnal hypoglycemia may not have been recorded if the patient was asleep (i.e., nocturnal hypoglycemia unawareness).</p></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par36">Insulin intensification with BIAsp&#x000a0;30 and basal&#x02013;bolus showed an improvement in glycemic control; the change in HbA<sub>1c</sub> was statistically significantly lower for BIAsp&#x000a0;30 compared to basal&#x02013;bolus.
