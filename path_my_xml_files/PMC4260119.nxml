Intravenous tedizolid phosphate was administered in USP 0.9% sterile saline, and each dose of oral tedizolid phosphate 200&#x000a0;mg was administered with 240&#x000a0;ml water. For all IV infusions, the vein used for the infusion was recorded, and infusion-site pain and vein tolerance were monitored. Indwelling catheters were used for the multiple-dose and venous tolerability phases.</p></sec><sec><title>Pharmacokinetics</title><p>Plasma and urine tedizolid phosphate and tedizolid concentrations were determined by Covance Bioanalytical Laboratory Services using validated tandem mass spectrometry methods with a lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) of 5&#x000a0;ng/ml. Urine was collected on days 1 and 7: &#x02212;2 to 0 (predose; day 1 only), 0&#x02013;4, 4&#x02013;8, 8&#x02013;12, and 12&#x02013;24&#x000a0;hours after the start of infusion. Plasma samples were collected prior to the start of infusion (0&#x000a0;hr); 0.25 and 0.5&#x000a0;hours after the start of infusion; every 0.5&#x000a0;hour during infusion (as needed); immediately prior to the end of infusion; and 0.08, 0.17, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 48, and 72&#x000a0;hours postinfusion (relative to the end of infusion) for the single-dose portion and on day 7 of the multiple-dose portion. Samples were collected at these time points through the first 12&#x000a0;hours only for day 1 of the multiple-dose portion followed by predose sampling on days 2&#x02013;6. For analysis, plasma samples were extracted with acetonitrile and precipitated with hydrochloric acid, followed by low-speed (3800&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;<italic>g</italic>) centrifugation at room temperature for 5&#x000a0;minutes. Supernatants were evaporated to dryness and reconstituted in methanol/water (3:7, v/v). Tedizolid and tedizolid phosphate were separated by high-power liquid chromatography (1200 series; Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) with a Hypersil GOLD aQ column (50&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;3&#x000a0;mm, 5-micron particle size; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Samples were eluted using a gradient from 80% 20&#x000a0;mM ammonium phosphate (pH 9.0)/20% methanol to 80% methanol over 4.5&#x000a0;minutes at a flow rate of 0.5&#x000a0;ml/minute. The column eluent was directed to an API 4000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (AB SCIEX, Framingham, MA, USA) for compound quantification. Data were processed using the Analyst v.1.4.1 software package (AB SCIEX) and the Watson LIMS laboratory information management system (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The intra- and interassay precision relative standard deviations (SDs) were 3.3% or less (4.5% or less for LLOQ) and 2.2% or less (4.2% or less for LLOQ), respectively, for this method for tedizolid quantitation. The intra- and interassay mean accuracy ranged from 95.0&#x02013;103.3% and 98.2&#x02013;102.7%, respectively. Urine samples were diluted (in a 20-mM ammonium formate buffer, pH &#x0223c;9.0) and centrifuged to remove solids prior to sample analysis, which followed similar bioanalytic procedures as previously described.</p><p>Noncompartmental PK calculations were performed using WinNonlin (v.5.2; Pharsight Corporation, Cary, NC, USA) according to the model independent approach, using the observed plasma concentrations of tedizolid phosphate and tedizolid. Tedizolid parameters included area under the concentration-time curve (AUC, from t&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0 to the last quantifiable concentration [t], extrapolated to time infinity [<sub>&#x0221e;</sub>], or over the dosing interval [<sub>24</sub>], using the linear trapezoidal rule); maximum observed plasma concentrations over a single dosing interval (C<sub>max</sub>), time to C<sub>max</sub> over a single dosing interval (T<sub>max</sub>), apparent terminal phase half-life (t<sub>1/2</sub>), oral clearance (CL/F, calculated as dose/AUC<sub>0&#x02013;&#x0221e;</sub> for the open-label crossover third phase only), volume of distribution during the terminal phase (V<sub>z</sub>/F), linearity ratio (AUC<sub>0&#x02013;24, day 7</sub>/AUC<sub>0&#x02013;&#x0221e;, day 1</sub>), observed accumulation ratio (AUC<sub>0&#x02013;24, day 7</sub>/AUC<sub>0&#x02013;24, day 1</sub>), and predicted accumulation ratio (AUC<sub>0&#x02013;&#x0221e;, day 1</sub>/AUC<sub>0&#x02013;24, day 1</sub>).</p></sec><sec><title>Safety and Tolerability</title><p>The safety population comprised all randomly assigned subjects who received the study drug. Safety procedures included adverse event (AE) assessments, 12-lead ECGs, vital signs, physical examinations, and laboratory assessments. Venous tolerance at each infusion site and associated vein was assessed daily by monitoring for signs of peripheral infusion site&#x02013;related phlebitis using modified visual infusion phlebitis (VIP) scoring criteria,<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> that is, a rating scale of 0 (<italic>IV site appeared healthy; no signs of phlebitis</italic>) to 5 (<italic>all signs of thrombophlebitis evident and extensive</italic>). The VIP scores were recorded before, during, immediately after, and 6&#x000a0;hours after the end of the infusion or at the start of any infusion site&#x02013;related AE. Catheters were removed at the first sign of early-stage phlebitis (VIP score 2 or higher). In all study phases, infusion-site pain was assessed on a scale of 0 (no pain) through 10 (worst possible pain).</p></sec><sec><title>Data Analysis</title><p>The sample size chosen for this study was based on precedent set by other PK studies of a similar nature and was not based on power calculations. There were no formal sample-size determinations for tolerability comparisons.</p><p>Descriptive statistics were calculated for PK parameters of tedizolid phosphate and tedizolid. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to determine the absolute bioavailability between the oral formulation and IV formulation of tedizolid phosphate. The ANOVA model included log-transformed AUC as the dependent variable; study period, route of administration, and sequence as fixed factors; and a random subject effect. The 90% confidence intervals (CIs) of the oral formulation group PK parameter means relative to the IV formulation group PK parameter means were obtained by taking the antilog of the corresponding 90% CIs for the differences between the means on the natural log scale.</p><p>Safety data were summarized by study phase and treatment route. Venous tolerability was assessed by regular monitoring of the subject's infusion site and checked for evidence of phlebitis before the start of each dose administration, during infusion (30&#x000a0;min into infusion), at the end of infusion, and 6&#x000a0;hours after end of infusion (or at the start of an IV-related AE). The VIP scores were analyzed based on the worst (highest) VIP score for each day; the difference between the worst VIP score while receiving tedizolid phosphate and while receiving placebo was calculated for each subject for each day, and the distribution of resulting scores was summarized by day and over all study days. The time to the worst score was determined using Kaplan-Meier curves created for tedizolid and placebo.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>A total of 78 of 90 enrolled subjects completed the study including all four subjects enrolled in the pilot phase.

A greater number of AEs (mostly infusion site&#x02013;related) occurred in the multiple-dose study, leading to the discontinuation of the IV 300-mg multiple-dose phase of the study after the IV 200-mg multiple-dose phase had been completed.</p><p>Infusion site&#x02013;related AEs were the most common AEs in the study. In the crossover venous tolerability study, VIP scores were similar between treatment and placebo. Five of 10 subjects had at least 1&#x000a0;day on which total daily VIP scores indicated that placebo was less well tolerated than tedizolid phosphate, compared with 4 of 10 subjects who had at least 1&#x000a0;day on which tedizolid phosphate was less well tolerated than placebo based on the same measure. In the venous tolerability phase, nine subjects receiving IV tedizolid phosphate 200&#x000a0;mg every day reported infusion site&#x02013;related AEs, compared with six subjects receiving placebo. In the IV tedizolid phosphate group, these AEs comprised six subjects with pain, six with erythema, three with swelling, two with hematoma, one with anesthesia, one with coldness, and one with paresthesia. Infusion site&#x02013;related AEs reported with IV placebo were five subjects with erythema, four with pain, and two with swelling.</p><p>Overall, 56 of the 90 study subjects reported at least one AE, most of which (seven subjects) were mild or moderate; one severe AE (vomiting) occurred. Infusion site&#x02013;related AEs were the most frequently reported AEs for all groups including among subjects receiving placebo. The percentage of subjects reporting at least one infusion site&#x02013;related AE, as well as the number and severity of infusion-site examination findings, increased with multiple dosing/duration of indwelling catheter use.</p><p>AEs not related to infusion site reported by more than one subject were observed only in the multiple-dose phase of the study. These AEs occurred in both the 200-mg and the discontinued 300-mg groups, and they comprised vessel puncture-site hematoma (two subjects with multiple-dose tedizolid phosphate 200&#x000a0;mg and four with multiple-dose tedizolid phosphate 300&#x000a0;mg), two with headache (300&#x000a0;mg), and three with abnormal dreams (200&#x000a0;mg). Eight subjects withdrew from the study because of AEs (one with influenza, seven with infusion site&#x02013;related AEs) and four subjects discontinued when the tedizolid phosphate 300-mg multiple-dose study was discontinued. One serious AE of appendicitis occurred in a subject who received seven doses of IV tedizolid phosphate 200&#x000a0;mg; the investigator classified this event as mild in severity and unrelated to study treatment. No clinically significant changes in vital signs, physical examination findings, ECG results, or laboratory findings were observed in any of the subjects enrolled in this study. No deaths occurred during the study.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The PK of IV and oral tedizolid phosphate were similar in this group of healthy volunteers. Daily IV administration of tedizolid phosphate 200&#x000a0;mg once/day for 7&#x000a0;days resulted in minimal tedizolid accumulation, and the PK profile of tedizolid was similar after single and multiple (daily) doses. The data presented here suggest linear PK for tedizolid validating previously reported results.<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> The short t<sub>1/2</sub> with tedizolid phosphate 300&#x000a0;mg was likely because of limitations of the sampling schedule, which was stopped at 24&#x000a0;hours. The absolute bioavailability of tedizolid following oral tedizolid phosphate 200&#x000a0;mg was 91%, indicating similar exposure with IV and oral administration. These results suggest that the efficacy and tolerability of oral and IV tedizolid phosphate 200&#x000a0;mg should be similar, and there is no need for dose adjustments when switching between IV and oral formulations of the drug.</p><p>After 7&#x000a0;days of IV tedizolid phosphate 200&#x000a0;mg once/day, there was a minimal and predictable tedizolid accumulation of &#x0223c;30%, a finding that is consistent with previously reported studies using oral tedizolid phosphate.<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> The clearance and volume of distribution of tedizolid on days 1 and 7 were generally similar, indicating dose independence. Based on the minute amounts of tedizolid detected in the urine, urinary excretion does not appear to be a noteworthy clearance pathway for tedizolid.</p><p>Single doses of up to 400&#x000a0;mg of tedizolid phosphate were well tolerated, and venous tolerance in the single-dose phase did not appear to vary with infusion rate or drug concentration. Infusion site&#x02013;related AEs were the most common AEs and increased with multiple dosing, likely because of the longer residence time of the IV catheter. An apparent reduction in tolerability was also seen at the highest multiple dose tested (300&#x000a0;mg), believed to be the result of some subjects' intolerability to the combination of multiple injections and multiple blood draws, rather than the effect of tedizolid. The placebo-controlled IV tolerability portion of the study was added to assess whether this reduction in tolerability was a true safety finding using a standardized assessment. The crossover venous tolerability phase of the study showed no differences in VIP score between placebo and the 200-mg study drug. These observations are consistent with results from a large phase III study in patients with ABSSSIs, in which IV tedizolid phosphate was generally well tolerated.<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p><p>Tedizolid phosphate, the inactive and short-lived polar prodrug, is rapidly converted to tedizolid, the biologically active moiety.<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> In this study, 200&#x000a0;mg IV tedizolid phosphate had a short t<sub>1/2</sub> (&#x0223c;10&#x000a0;min) and was generally only detectable in plasma for less than 1&#x000a0;hour after the end of infusion. The volume of distribution of tedizolid phosphate was &#x0223c;10&#x000a0;L, a volume slightly smaller than extracellular body fluid, indicating that tedizolid phosphate does not penetrate into tissues. The absolute bioavailability of tedizolid phosphate could not be determined due to the lack of quantifiable tedizolid phosphate plasma concentrations after oral administration. This is consistent with a previous study, in which only one of six subjects in the highest dose group tested (i.e., single dose of 1200&#x000a0;mg) had quantifiable tedizolid phosphate plasma concentrations following oral administration.<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Comparison with the IV results in this study indicates that the bioavailability of the tedizolid phosphate prodrug is less than 0.25%.</p><p>The microbiologically active moiety tedizolid is a lipophilic drug that readily penetrates tissue but has limited absorption when administered orally. Phosphate prodrugs improve solubility and dissolution rates of parent compounds and are thus useful to improve the bioavailability of lipophilic drugs.<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> However, the aqueous solubility of such a prodrug limits the intestinal permeability of the parent compound. Thus, absorption of tedizolid after oral administration of the tedizolid phosphate prodrug likely occurs following dephosphorylation by apical alkaline phosphatase, a nonspecific enzyme that cleaves a wide range of esters and is found on a variety of cell membranes.<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> The finding that tedizolid phosphate was not detected in plasma following oral administration is consistent with this hypothesis.</p><p>In summary, this phase I study conducted in healthy volunteers demonstrated that IV and oral tedizolid phosphate had similar PK profiles. Only modest plasma tedizolid accumulation occurred with IV tedizolid phosphate when administered at 200&#x000a0;mg once/day over 7&#x000a0;days. The intravenous tolerability profile of 200-mg IV tedizolid phosphate was generally similar to that of placebo, which suggests that this agent can be safely administered via the IV route. These results support once/day dosing of tedizolid phosphate 200&#x000a0;mg with both the oral and IV formulations in the treatment of gram-positive infections, without the need for dose adjustment when switching administration routes and no requirement for a loading dose.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was sponsored by Cubist.
