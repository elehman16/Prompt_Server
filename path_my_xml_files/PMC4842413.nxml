activation ratio related to trunk stabilization to compare the effects between the
abdominal drawing-in maneuver and lumbar stabilization exercises on an unstable base of
support. [Subjects and Methods] Study subjects were 20 male and 10 female adults in their
20s without lumbar pain, who were equally and randomly assigned to either the abdominal
drawing-in maneuver group and the lumbar stabilization exercise group. Abdominal muscle
activation and ratio was measured using a wireless TeleMyo DTS during right leg raise
exercises while sitting on a Swiss ball. [Results] Differences in rectus abdominis,
external oblique abdominis, and internal oblique abdominis muscle activation were observed
before and after treatment. Significant differences were observed between the groups in
the muscle activation of the external oblique abdominis and internal oblique abdominis,
and the muscle activation ratio of external oblique abdominis/rectus abdominis and
internal oblique abdominis/rectus abdominis. [Conclusion] Consequently trunk stability
exercise enhances internal oblique abdominis activity and increases trunk stabilization.
In addition, the abdominal drawing-in maneuver facilitates the deep muscle more than LSE
in abdominal muscle. Therefore, abdominal drawing-in maneuver is more effective than
lumbar stabilization exercises in facilitating trunk stabilization.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Muscle activation</kwd><kwd>Abdominal drawing-in maneuver</kwd><kwd>Lumbar stabilization exercise</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Trunk stabilization regulates body alignment while the proximal part is moving and causes
co-contraction of trunk muscles for the maintenance of posture. That is, it provides the
overall body stability and the foundation for functional movement in the normal range.
Therefore, changing trunk activation with stabilizing exercise may increase motor control
ability and trunk stability<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. These
exercises are important exercises for increasing the deep abdominal muscles and improving
stability<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Among the many exercises for trunk stabilization, clinicians commonly apply drawing-in and
lumbar stabilization exercises. The abdominal drawing-in maneuver (ADIM) is introduced to
increase separated activation of the deep muscles. It is a voluntary exercise without
movement of the pelvis and vertebra. It is more efficient for improving the cross-section of
the deep muscles than general lumbar stabilization exercises<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Lumbar stabilization exercises (LSE) can cause thickening of the vertebra including a
combination of muscle activation while performing a functional task. Highlighting
superficial muscles as well as deep ones is a potential factor in the production of the
longer moment arm and greater power, and increases perseverance against a pressure
force<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Suni et al.<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup> obtained a better result in
reducing back pain and improving the capacity for work when the vertebra moved on a neutral
line during LSE.</p><p>Koumantakis et al.<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup> attempted to evaluate
the clinical effect of three different types of training, which were similar to bridge
exercises. This study applied specific techniques for the activation of deep muscles such as
the transverse abdominis and multifidus compared to a third group who performed a similar
type of exercise. In the result, subjects recovered slowly, and deep muscle training did not
provide adequate efficiency, indicating that subjects should perform not only selective
exercises to strengthen deep muscles but multiple ones. Thus selective deep muscle exercise
is not always efficient to patients who suffer from back pain.</p><p>There are many studies describing exercises that isolate certain muscles, such as the
transverse abdominis (TA) and multifidus. However, research on muscle activation and the
muscle activation ratio of ADIM to facilitate deep muscles and LSE to induce co-contraction
of the trunk muscles is lacking.</p><p>Accordingly, the purpose of this study was to indicate muscle activities related to trunk
stabilization for comparison of the effects between the ADIM and the LSE.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>Informed consent was provided by the subjects before participating in this study. This
study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Daegu University, following the
ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. The subjects of this study were 30
healthy adults in their 20s (males: 20, females: 10) from B University, located in Daegu
Metropolitan City. The criteria for exclusion were a history of lumbar pain in the past
six months, congenital malformation of the limbs, or orthopedic or neurological disease.
The subjects were equally and randomly assigned to either the ADIM group (mean age,
23.4&#x000b1;3.3&#x02005;years; mean height, 169.8&#x000b1;5.9&#x02005;cm; mean weight, 63.5&#x000b1;9.3&#x02005;kg; mean BMI,
22.0&#x000b1;2.5&#x02005;cm/kg) or the LSE group (mean age, 24.5&#x000b1;3.4&#x02005;years; mean height, 169.5&#x000b1;8.1&#x02005;cm;
mean weight, 63.2&#x000b1;10.0&#x02005;cm/kg; mean BMI, 21.9&#x000b1;1.90&#x02005;cm/kg), and they performed their
respective exercises in 30 minute sessions four times per week for five weeks.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Electromyographic (EMG) data were collected using a wireless TeleMyo DTS (Noraxon Inc.,
Scottsdale, AZ, USA) and Myo-Research Master Edition 1.06 XP software was used for
analysis of the EMG data. Disposable Ag/AgCl surface electrodes were attached 2&#x02005;cm apart
to each muscle, based on the &#x02018;Surface EMG for Non-Invasive Assessment of Muscles (SENIAM)&#x02019;
guidelines<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. The EMG signals were
sampled at 1,500&#x02005;Hz and band pass filter was used between 40 and 400&#x02005;Hz with the notch
filter preset to reject 60&#x02005;Hz. The raw data were processed into the root mean square
(RMS). Normalization of EMG data collected from each muscle was determined by calculating
the RMS of a 5-s maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) for the muscles at manual
muscle-test-position suggested by Kendall et al<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The preparation of EMG attachment sites was performed using the method suggested by
Stevens et al<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. The electrode sites
were shaved and cleaned with scrubbing gel and alcohol to reduce skin resistance. For EMG
data collection subjects were instructed to maintain a sitting position on a Swiss ball
with no support and trunk muscle activation was measured while he/she performed a
single-leg-lift for ten seconds. Except both initial and last 2 seconds signals were
collected for 6 seconds and analyzed. A randomized-control study was conducted to exclude
the cross-over effect and subjects were informed of the specific contents regarding
exercises, with each exercise repeated three times. To minimize muscle fatigue which can
be caused by repetition subjects rested for one minute after each exercise.</p><p>The ADIM was performed lying down with the knee joints flexed at 90&#x000b0;. The pressure
biofeedback device was located under the lumbar vertebrae of the subjects during the ADIM.
The subjects watched the pressure gauge connected to the pressure biofeedback device and
were trained to increase the pressure from 40 mmHg to 50 mmHg and then maintain the
pressure at 50 mmHg. Then, the examiner instructed the subjects to maintain the position
by pulling the navel upward and posteriorly (in the direction of the lumbar vertebrae) so
that the abdominal area was slightly hollow during expiration. They were instructed to
maintain the abdominal drawing-in for ten seconds, and they rested for five seconds after
each rep. One set consisted of ten repetitions and 5&#x02013;7 sets were performed in each
session.</p><p>The LSE consisted of a curl-up (raising the head and the thorax), side bridge (raising
the trunk in a side-lying position), and bird-dog (alternately raising one hand and one
leg in a quadruped position) exercise.</p><p>For the curl-up, the subjects lay in a supine position with their left knee joints flexed
at 90&#x000b0;, and placed both hands behind their head. Then they raised their head and shoulders
from the mat, maintained the position for ten seconds, and then rested for five seconds.
They repeated this motion five times.</p><p>For the side bridge, the subjects adopted a side-lying position on their left side on the
mat, supporting their weight with their left elbow and leg and then raising the hips. They
maintained this posture for 12 seconds and rested for five seconds. They repeated this
motion five times. They were then instructed to repeat the motion in a side-lying position
on their right side.</p><p>For the bird-dog, the subjects adopted a quadruped position, and maintained a drawing-in
position. Then they raised the left arm and the right leg until they were parallel with
the floor and held this position for 12 seconds. After the task, they rested for five
seconds. They repeated this task five times. Then they repeated the task, raising the
right arm and the left leg. The subjects performed all exercises on both sides, with three
to four sets in ten minutes performed on each side</p><p>SPSS 20.0 was used for statistical processing. The differences in abdominal muscle
activation between pre and post treatment were analyzed using the paired t-test.
Differences in the abdominal muscle activation, the activation ratio of EO/RA and IO/RA
between the two groups were analyzed using the independent t-test, and the
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was performed as a normality test for the measured values. The
significance level was chosen as &#x003b1;=0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>There were significant differences in the muscle activation of RA, EO, and IO in both

Muscle activation
increased on the RA and EO but decreased on the IO. An accurate exercise with deep muscle
contraction causes selective contractions of deep muscles such as IO and TA during soft
contraction of superficial muscles such as RA and EO<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Both groups showed a significant difference in the EO and IO but not on the RA. ADIM group
did not show a significant difference in RA. These differences may be because this exercise
is a specific stabilization training technique designed to make selective contractions for
the IO and TA, and the RA and EO contract together during this exercise. This result is the
same as that of Drysdale et al<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The muscle activation ratio is an important index used to check the change of recruitment
pattern, making it easy to understand the phases of trunk muscle performance during various
movements in daily activities<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Both groups showed a significant difference in the EO/RA ratio and the IO/RA ratio;
particularly during the ADIM, the IO/RA ratio showed a higher ratio than EO/RA. To increase
trunk stability superficial muscle activation should be decreased in contrast to activation
of the deep muscles to make a proper activation ratio by co-contraction<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. The contraction of superficial muscles should be reduced
to a minimum while the IO and TA are activated<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The limitations of this study are as follows. The training was inadequate. In addition, the
changes in the TA, multifidus, and pelvic floor muscles that participate in trunk
stabilization were not checked. Thus another study should be conducted to accurately assess
the performance of maintaining a neutral position with longer duration and to determine a
method for directly assessing changes in deep muscles. This study compared the differences
between the ADIM and the LSE in the RA, EO, and IO muscle activation and the EO/RA and IO/RA
ratios. Between the two groups, EO muscle activity decreased significantly, and IO
activation increased significantly, and the EO/RA and the IO/RA ratios increased
significantly. These findings indicate that both exercises decrease the RA and EO, and
increase IO activation. These changes enhance IO activity and increases trunk stabilization.
In addition, the ADIM facilitates the deep muscle more than the LSE in abdominal muscles.
Therefore, the ADIM is more effective than the LSE in facilitating trunk stabilization.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Ferreira</surname><given-names>JP</given-names></name><name><surname>Chatzisarantis</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><name><surname>Gaspar</surname><given-names>PM</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Precompetitive anxiety and self-confidence in athletes
