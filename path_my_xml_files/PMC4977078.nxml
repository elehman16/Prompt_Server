The healthy control (HC) group (30 persons with normal health condition) served as control. All groups were subject to examination of 24-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and Hamilton Anxiety Scale, mismatch negativity (MMN), and sensory gating potential P50 (SG-P50) of event-related potentials. Data were collected at three different time points: baseline (before treatment) and week 2 and week 6 post treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>At baseline, all electrophysiological parameters of patients with MDD were significantly higher than those of HCs. After treatment, in the Esc group, MMN latency, S2-P50 amplitude, and S2-P50/S1-P50 amplitude ratio decreased; however, the decrements were not statistically significant compared to either baseline or the HC group. Also, no significant changes were observed in the percentage of individuals whose S2-P50/S1-P50 &#x02265;0.5 in the Esc group. On the other hand, in the JK group after a 6-week treatment, MMN latency (206.35&#x000b1;32.14 ms) was significantly shorter than that of the Esc group (219.57&#x000b1;36.51 ms), S2-P50 amplitude (7.27&#x000b1;4.85 &#x003bc;V) reduced significantly compared with the baseline level (10.21&#x000b1;4.10 &#x003bc;V), the percentage of individuals whose S2-P50/S1-P50 &#x02265;0.5 in the JK group greatly decreased and this was not significantly different compared to that of the HC group (<italic>P</italic>&#x02265;0.05).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Neuroplasticity of patients with MDD is apparently disturbed, characterized by aberrant MMN latency and SG-P50-related event-related potential parameters.

It is associated with high morbidity and mortality as well as disability and disease burden with lifetime prevalence estimated as 13%&#x02013;16% in adults.<xref rid="b1-ndt-12-1935" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b3-ndt-12-1935" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> The important pathological processes in the onset, progress, and prognosis of the disease include disruption of neuroplasticity, reduction in neuropil, dysfunction of brain structures related to emotional feedback loop, and reductions in the total volume and atrophy and loss of neurons in the hippocampus.<xref rid="b4-ndt-12-1935" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="b5-ndt-12-1935" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Among these, neuroplasticity is a fundamental process by which human brain acquires information and makes adaptive responses to changes in both inner and outer environments. Neuroplasticity plays a critical role in brain function such as neural development, learning and memory, and recovery after brain injury. The key molecules such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) have critical roles in stabilizing synaptic change and neuroplasticity in depression.<xref rid="b6-ndt-12-1935" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Dysfunction of neuroplasticity could contribute to the pathophysiology of mood disorders, and induction of appropriate plasticity of the brain could exert therapeutic effect on the diseases.<xref rid="b7-ndt-12-1935" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b9-ndt-12-1935" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Antidepressant treatment may block or reverse disruption of neuroplasticity by chronic stress, enhance patients&#x02019; cognitive function, and even reverse functional defection.<xref rid="b10-ndt-12-1935" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p><p>Neuroplasticity involves coordination of both Long-Term Potentiation (LTP) and Long-Term Depression.<xref rid="b9-ndt-12-1935" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Previous investigations show that characteristics of brain LTP and long-term depression can be evaluated using auditory-evoked potential-related mismatch negativity (MMN) and sensory gating (SG) potential.<xref rid="b11-ndt-12-1935" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> In the human body, neuroplasticity of the central nervous system (CNS) can be indirectly represented by the characteristics of cerebral cortex excitatory and inhibitory functions. In the level of neuroelectrophysiology, through the measurement of single pulse and pair pulse stimuli, we can determine intracortical facilitation/inhibition and evaluate neuroplasticity of the CNS.<xref rid="b12-ndt-12-1935" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> As postsynaptic potential, MMN reflects automatic processing of information gathered from outer environment and implies precognitive processing.<xref rid="b13-ndt-12-1935" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="b14-ndt-12-1935" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> MMN is a negative wave obtained using event-related potentials induced by low probability event (deviant stimuli) to minus event-related potentials induced by high probability event (standard stimuli) when brain is not under active attention. It is widely recognized that MMN is one of the most important functional indexes reflecting early process of information by cerebral cortex<xref rid="b15-ndt-12-1935" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> and involves neural mechanism of LTP during learning and memory.<xref rid="b16-ndt-12-1935" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> MMN latency period reflects information processing speed of the brain. On the other hand, SG-P50 belongs to SG mechanism of the CNS and reflects individual&#x02019;s ability to selectively filter complex sensory information and inhibit nonrelevant information of the cerebral context. Abnormal SG function is related to aberrant pathophysiological function of patients with mental disorders.<xref rid="b17-ndt-12-1935" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="b18-ndt-12-1935" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> SG status can be evaluated using auditory-evoked potential P50 paradigm measurement, which is a positive phase wave appearing between 30 ms and 90 ms after condition (S1)&#x02013;test (S2) stimulation. In normal individual, S2-P50 decreases at least 50% compared to S1-P50. Therefore, these electrophysiological parameters were measured to characterize neuroplasticity of MDD patients in this study.</p><p>Jiuweizhenxin-keli is a commercially available traditional Chinese compound commonly used to treat general anxiety disorder. Owing to its therapeutic effects on anxiolytic symptoms and advantages in drug tolerance and drug safety, Jiuweizhenxin-keli can be applied in adjuvant or potentiation therapeutic regimen of depressive patients.<xref rid="b19-ndt-12-1935" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> The active ingredients of Jiuweizhenxin-keli include a variety of phytochemicals such as ginsenosides, <italic>Rehmannia</italic>-related polysaccharides, jujube seed alcohol, poria sugar, and deoxyschizandrin.

<italic>Rehmannia</italic>-related polysaccharides inhibit glutamate level and decrease <italic>N</italic>-methyl-D-aspartate receptor expression.<xref rid="b23-ndt-12-1935" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Jujube seed alcohol downregulates calmodulin expression, inhibits intracellular calcium overload, and protects neurons from apoptosis.<xref rid="b24-ndt-12-1935" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Taken together, it is suggested that Jiuweizhenxin-keli can potentially improve neuroplasticity of the CNS. To test this hypothesis, we utilized neuroelectrophysiology measurements described earlier as indirect indicators of patients&#x02019; neural plasticity and investigated effects of Jiuweizhenxin-keli on neuroelectrophysiology function in patients with MDD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods|subjects"><title>Patients and methods</title><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Patients</title><p>Sixty patients (18&#x02013;60 years of age) were recruited at Mental Health Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, from January 2010 to August 2011. They were patients with either the first onset of MDD or the relapse of MDD after discontinuing treatment with antidepressants for at least 3 months. All patients were in accordance with the diagnostic criteria of depressive episodes in the <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic>, Fourth Edition, Text Revision.<xref rid="b25-ndt-12-1935" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> They all had 24-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-24) &#x02265;20 points and Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA) &#x02264;14 points. In order to eliminate potential influences from comorbidity of depressive disorder and anxiolytic disorder, we adopted HAMA threshold value of &#x02264;14, which is the critical value used to determine whether there is anxiety in the Chinese norm.<xref rid="b26-ndt-12-1935" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Patients with one or more of the following criteria were excluded from the study: patients with severe disease such as heart, liver, or kidney disease; women in gestation or who are breastfeeding; and patients who had received repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation or electroconvulsive treatment within 1 year. The patients were then randomly assigned into two treatment groups: Esc group (30 patients) receiving only escitalopram treatment (a serotonin selective reuptake inhibitor [SSRI]) and JK group (30 patients) who were treated with a combination of escitalopram and Jiuweizhenxin-keli. The healthy control (HC) group included 30 volunteers without any neuropsychiatric diseases, with HAMD-24 scores &#x02264;8 points and HAMA scores &#x02264;7 points. All patients were right handed with normal hearing and verbal communication capabilities and provided their written informed consent before being enrolled in the study.</p><p>The methods were designed in accordance with the approved guidelines.

In the JK group, the patients received combination therapy with escitalopram (5&#x02013;20 mg/d) and Jiuweizhenxin-keli (6&#x02013;12 g/d). Initially, each patient was given a lower dose of medicine, and then, psychiatrists participating in this study made adjustment to reach the therapeutic dose within the first week of treatment according to the clinical conditions of patients. When a patient suffered from insomnia, a small dose of alprazolam was prescribed temporarily to relieve the symptoms.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical evaluation</title><p>Examinations through HAMD-24 scales, HAMA scales, and brain-evoked potentials were employed in this study. For HC group, all examinations were performed only once upon admission into the study (ie, baseline). For two treatment groups, examinations were carried out at three time points: baseline and after a 2-week or 6-week treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Examination of brain-evoked potentials</title><p>Electromyography/evoked potential system (MEB-9200; Nihon Kohden, Tokyo, Japan) was employed to record MMN and P50. MMN electrode placement was carried out according to the 10&#x02013;20 International System of electroencephalogram. Recording electrodes were placed on central zero (Cz) and frontal zero (Fz), reference electrodes were placed in parallel on the mastoid bones of both left and right sides of the skull, and the grounding electrode was placed on Frontal Polar site. Using auditory oddball mode, we randomly gave each subject a series of deviant stimuli (2,000 Hz audio frequency, 80 dB) at a low frequency (20%) mixed with a series of standard stimuli (1,000 Hz audio frequency, 60 dB) at a high frequency (80%). The characteristics of stimuli were as follows: stimulation rate 1 Hz, analysis time 100 ms/div, sensitivity 20 &#x003bc;V/div, record passband 0.1&#x02013;100 Hz, and deviant stimuli superposition 40 times. The patients were not required to react to any stimulus during the examination. Negative wave was obtained by using waveform induced by deviant stimuli to minus waveform induced by standard stimuli. The biggest negative wave obtained was defined as MMN. The MMN latency of Cz lead was determined with reference to the MMN waveform of Fz lead. P50 was examined using condition (S1)&#x02013;test (S2) paired acoustic stimulation with short wavelength and sound pressure set at 105 dB. The interval between the two stimuli S1 and S2 was 500 ms, and the interval between two paired stimuli was 10 seconds. The rest of the parameters were as follows: analysis time 30 ms/div, sensitivity 10 &#x003bc;V/div, filter passband 0.1&#x02013;1,000 Hz, and S1 and S2 stimuli superposition 16 times. The patients were not required to react to any stimulus during the examination. The S1-P50 amplitude, S2-P50 amplitude, S2-P50/S1-P50 amplitude ratio, and percentage of aberrant P50 inhibition (S2-P50/S1-P50 &#x02265;0.5) of Cz lead were recorded during the examination. Previous investigation showed that MMN latency is consistent for healthy people over time.<xref rid="b27-ndt-12-1935" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Thus, we only measured it once for the HC group at baseline and at all three time points for the Esc and JK groups.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>SPSS software 12.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used for statistical analysis.

Both monotherapy with escitalopram alone and combination therapy with escitalopram and Jiuweizhenxin-keli exhibited distinguished therapeutic effects from week 2 of treatment and lasted to week 6 after treatment. Monotherapy with escitalopram was able to partially restore patients&#x02019; neuroplasticity, by decreasing MMN latency, S2-P50 amplitude, and S2-P50/S1-P50 amplitude ratio. However, monotherapy treatment failed to lead to statistically significant improvement. In contrast, combining escitalopram with Jiuweizhenxin-keli showed distinct effects on MMN latency, S2-P50 amplitude, S2-P50/S1-P50 amplitude ratio, and percentage of individuals with S2-P50/S1-P50 &#x02265;0.5. Downregulation of the parameters in patients was observed after a 2-week treatment, and further decrease was found after a 6-week treatment. Six-week treatment in the JK group resulted in significantly reduced MMN latency and S2-P50 amplitude compared to the baseline level, whereas the percentage of individuals with S2-P50/S1-P50 &#x02265;0.5 were not statistically significant from the HC group. Taken together, these data suggested that combination therapy showed better effect in the reduction of MMN latency and enhancement of P50 inhibition and improved patients&#x02019; capability of processing and reaction to novel auditory stimuli, inhibition of interference of unrelated information, and enhancement of SG function. Therefore, compared to monotherapy of SSRI, combining SSRI with Jiuweizhenxin-keli could be a more beneficial solution for MDD patients, as demonstrated by the improvement.</p><p>Jiuweizhenxin-keli is a well-known traditional Chinese medicine with active ingredients such as ginsenosides, <italic>Rehmannia</italic>-related polysaccharides, and jujube seed alcohol.

Therefore, it is of great importance to investigate correlation between electrophysiological data and molecular basis of these events, so as to assess key molecules, including BDNF and NGF, which are more direct indexes of neuroplasticity. Also, our future work will aim to investigate effects of Jiuweizhenxin-keli on clinical symptoms and other clinical parameters. Although treatment with Jiuweizhenxin-keli showed significant improvement in electrophysiological parameters of MDD patients, the study period of this work was relatively short; thus, it is difficult to predict its long-term effect. Studies with longer observation period could clarify this question.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Neuroplasticity of patients with MDD is apparently disturbed, characterized by aberrant electrophysiological measurements such as MMN latency and SG-P50-related event-related potential parameters. Compared with monotherapy with escitalopram alone, combination treatment with escitalopram and a traditional Chinese medicine Jiuweizhenxin-keli showed significant effects in restoring these neuroelectrophysiological features of MDD patients. Taken together, our study suggested that this combination therapy could be a novel therapeutic solution for improving the impaired neuroplasticity of MDD patients.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclosure</bold></p><p>The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref
