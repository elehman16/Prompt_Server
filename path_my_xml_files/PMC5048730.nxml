anxiety, as pregnancy and the postpartum period involve many physical, hormonal,
psychological and social changes that can have a direct impact on mental health<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>1</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>Furthermore, women with high-risk pregnancies are vulnerable to emotional changes, as
they experience feelings of guilt and/or inadequacy, which can lead to feelings of
uneasiness regarding their lives and the lives of their children<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>2</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>Depression is currently the most common mental disorder during pregnancy and the
postpartum period. Approximately one in five pregnant women experience depression, but
most are not diagnosed with or adequately treated for depression<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>3</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>The literature shows that some studies have focused on postpartum depression, but
depression during pregnancy is also an important public health issue and a significant
risk factor for postpartum depression, indicating the need for interventions before
delivery<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>4</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>Depression during pregnancy appears to be more prevalent during the third trimester,
with an incidence of approximately 20% in developing countries and between 10% and 15%
in developed countries. Depression levels are higher in high-risk pregnancies, and
depression is also associated with the following risk factors: a prior history of
depression, financial difficulties, unemployment, a low educational level, a lack of
social support, substance abuse, stressful events and domestic violence<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>5</sup>
</xref>. Symptoms of gestational depression have been correlated with other factors,
including maternal anxiety, life stress, a prior history of depression, a lack of social
support, domestic violence, an unwanted pregnancy and relationship factors<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>6</sup>
</xref>. The magnitude of these psychological changes will depend on biological,
familial, conjugal, social and cultural factors and on the pregnant woman's
personality<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>7</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>Studies have shown that depression has significant adverse effects on maternal and
foetal health. In a systematic review of studies published from 1999 to February 2008 on
the perinatal consequences of depression during pregnancy on the mother and the child,
gestational depression was found to be a risk factor for postpartum depression,
preeclampsia and premature labour, especially in pregnant women from low socioeconomic
classes<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>8</sup>
</xref>. The main effects of depression on the foetus were associated with low birth
weight<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">

<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>10</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>An analysis of the use of relaxation techniques to relieve pain during oncological
treatment through progressive muscle relaxation, guided images, biofeedback, hypnosis
and meditation concluded that these techniques reduced pain perceptions, nausea, stress
and insomnia and that they acted as a coadjuvant for medications<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>11</sup>
</xref>. Yoga has also been used as an intervention. Indeed, yoga has been shown to
reduce blood pressure in patients with arterial hypertension, and it can potentially be
used as a non-pharmacological resource to aid patients with hypertension<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>12</sup>
</xref>. A study of patients in the postpartum period used the Benson relaxation
technique described in this study and found a significant increase in the intervention
group's immunoglobulin A (IgA) levels<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>13</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>Given the scientific evidence that pregnancy can lead to symptoms of depression that
affect maternal and foetal health and that women with high-risk pregnancies are more
vulnerable to these changes, the study reported here is necessary to aid nurses and
healthcare teams in developing care plans for these pregnant women. Accordingly, we
sought to analyse the effects of relaxation on depression levels in hospitalised women
with high-risk pregnancies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>This randomised clinical trial was performed in the maternity ward of the Cassiano
Antonio Moraes University Hospital in the city of Vit&#x000f3;ria (Esp&#x000ed;rito Santo, Brazil),
which is recognised as a reference centre for high-risk pregnancies. The data were
collected in 2013.</p><p>The author randomly assigned the pregnant women to the control and intervention
groups when they were admitted, and no previous contact had been made with these
women.</p></sec><sec><title>Population and sample</title><p>The sample consisted of fifty hospitalised women with high-risk pregnancies at any
gestational age. All were 18 years old or older and had been hospitalised for more
than 24 hours in the maternity ward of the hospital. There were 25 women in the
control group and 25 women in the intervention group. The following exclusion
criteria were applied: a hearing or speech disability, a mental disability or
dementia that might interfere with the interview or the intervention, and a hospital
stay of less than five days.</p><p>The sample size was calculated for both groups by assuming the significance level to
be 5% and the power of the test to be 80%. The minimum difference in the depression
levels that we wanted to detect was 4, and the standard deviation in both groups was
5. Thus, an adequate size was obtained, with 25 pregnant women in each group. These
data were generated with the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS),
version 18.0, with a random list of controls and interventions according to the
spontaneous demand of the pregnant women. These women were then assigned to groups in
that order. To avoid the Hawthorne effect, i.e., to avoid contaminating the subjects
in the control group with those in the intervention group, some steps were taken; for
example, patients in different groups were not allowed to be hospitalised in the same
ward.</p></sec><sec><title>Data collection</title><p>Every day, the records relating to the women with high-risk pregnancies who were able
to participate in the study were selected. The researcher performed a random draw,
and, to participate in the study, all the women who agreed to participate received
informed consent forms and were guaranteed confidentiality. The researcher performed
the interview, which included a signed form with sociodemographic and clinical
variables, and applied the instrument and the intervention.</p><p>To measure the signs and symptoms of depression, the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression
Scale (EPDS) was used. In Brazil, the EPDS is known as a self-evaluation scale for
postpartum depression, and it is suggested to be better at identifying depressed
individuals<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>14</sup>
</xref>. The EPDS is a self-administered instrument composed of ten items that are
answered on a scale ranging from 0-3 based on the presence and intensity of the
symptom. The statements cover the psychological symptoms of a depressed mood,
including feelings of sadness, guilt, self-deprecation, thoughts of suicide or death,
physiological symptoms (e.g., insomnia or hypersomnia) and changes in behaviour
(e.g., crying spells). The total possible score is 30, with a score of 12 or higher
indicating depression. Santos, Martins and Pasquali translated and validated the EPDS
for Brazil<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>15</sup>
</xref>. It does not establish a formal diagnosis of depression but allows the
intensity of depressive symptoms to be identified in order to refer individuals for
evaluation and, if necessary, for treatment. The EPDS can be used during pregnancy or
during the postpartum period. The author used this scale with the control and
intervention groups during the first visit and five days later. The intervention
groups were trained to use the Benson relaxation technique<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>16</sup>
</xref>, which includes four essential elements: a peaceful environment, a mental
device, a passive attitude and a comfortable position. The six steps are as follows:
(1) Sit quietly in a comfortable position. (2) Close your eyes. (3) Deeply relax all
your muscles, beginning at your feet and progressing up to your face. Keep them
relaxed. (4) Breathe through your nose. Become aware of your breathing. As you
breathe out, say the word "one" silently to yourself. Breathe easily and naturally.
(5) Continue for 10 to 20 minutes. When you finish, sit quietly for several minutes,
at first with your eyes closed and later with your eyes opened. Do not stand up for a
few minutes. (6) Do not worry about whether you are successful in achieving a deep
level of relaxation. Maintain a passive attitude and permit relaxation to occur at
its own pace. When distracting thoughts occur, try to ignore them by not dwelling on
them and return to repeating "one."</p><p>Based on a previous study that used the Benson technique, which was adapted for a
rehabilitation programme for women with mastectomies in Vit&#x000f3;ria (Esp&#x000ed;rito Santo,
Brazil), this technique was chosen for use in this study<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>17</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>In the adapted technique, the following instructions were included between steps 5
and 6: "Now try to take a trip in your mind to a place where you have been and would
like to return to or a place where you have never been and would like to go someday".
This technique was individually taught to each pregnant woman for five days, such
that they could learn and perform it twice a day, once upon waking and once before
going to sleep.</p></sec><sec><title>Variables</title><p>The following variables were assessed: age, marital status, educational level,
spiritual support, occupation, social support, trait and state anxiety, smoking,
alcoholism, gynaecological/obstetric history (number of births, the type of labour
during previous pregnancies, and complications during previous pregnancies) and the
current pregnancy (whether the pregnancy was planned and how many hospital admissions
had occurred during the current pregnancy). These variables were collected using a
specifically designed form, and they were controlled during the intervention study to
achieve homogeneous groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Data analysis</title><p>The SPSS, version 20.0, was used, and a significance level of 5%, corresponding to
p&#x0003c;0.05 (95% confidence interval), was adopted. The chi-square test was used to
measure the correlation between the control variables and the groups studied; the
Mann-Whitney and unpaired t-tests were used to evaluate the relationship between the
groups; and the Wilcoxon and paired t-tests were used to evaluate the depression
level between the two timepoints. The McNemar test was used to analyse the
differences in depression severity before and after the intervention using
categorical data.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethical considerations</title><p>This study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the Health Sciences
Centre at the Federal University of Esp&#x000ed;rito Santo (Universidade Federal do Esp&#x000ed;rito
Santo - UFES) under No. 237,302. After approval of the Ethics Committee, the data
were collected and the instrument and relaxation technique applied from April 2013 to
June 2013. In addition, each participant was told about the study goals and data
collection procedure before they signed the written informed consent form. They were
assured that anonymity and confidentiality would be guaranteed, along with the right
to withdraw from the study at any time without being penalised. No pressure or
inducement of any kind was applied to encourage the women to participate in the
research. After the study ended, the women who were assigned to the control group
were allowed access to the intervention.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The main causes of hospitalisation were hypertension, diabetes and haemorrhagic
syndromes. The differences between the control and intervention groups were not
significant for age, marital status, educational level, religion, occupation, social
support, smoking, alcoholism, gynaecological/obstetric history and current pregnancy,
demonstrating homogeneity between the groups, except in the case of labour type
(p&#x0003c;0.05).</p><p>The control and intervention groups consisted largely of women who were younger than 29
years old (48% and 64%, respectively). Most lived with their partner in a stable
relationship (96% in the control group and 92% in the intervention group).</p><p>Regarding educational level, 56% of the intervention group and 72% of the control group
had somewhere between incomplete primary education and incomplete secondary education.
Most reported that they were homemakers (48% in the control group and 76% in the
intervention group). The study was conducted in the maternity ward of a public
institution that mainly attends to low-income patients, which may explain the
predominance of homemakers with low educational levels.</p><p>Most of the women did not consume alcohol or smoke cigarettes at that time - 96% for the
two variables in the intervention group and 84% for the two variables in the control
group. In both groups, the most common religion was evangelical (68% in the control
group and 76% in the intervention group).</p><p>The pregnancy was not planned for most of the women (76% in the intervention group and
56% in the control group). Seventy-two per cent of the intervention group and 57% of the
control group had complications during their previous pregnancies, likely because the
sample comprised women with high-risk pregnancies. Vaginal childbirths were most common
(65% in the intervention group and 40% in the control group), and most women had six or
more prenatal visits during their current pregnancies. The women had had multiple
pregnancies, with an average of 3.4 pregnancies in the control group and an average of
3.3 pregnancies in the intervention group. The mean number of births was 2.1 for the
control group and 1.7 for the intervention group, while the mean number of abortions was
0.6 in both groups.</p><p>Overall, the gynaecological/obstetric data showed that the sample consisted of
multiparous women with unplanned pregnancies who had experienced complications during
their previous pregnancies. At the first timepoint, when admitted to the public
maternity ward, the median level of depression measured by the EPDS was similar
(p&#x0003e;0.05) in the control (11.4&#x000b1;6) and intervention (10.3&#x000b1;5.9) groups, indicating
homogeneity between the groups. At the second timepoint, five days after hospital
admission, there was no difference in the median EPDS score in the control group (9.9 &#x000b1;
5), while the intervention group displayed a significant decrease (4.5 &#x000b1; 3, p&#x0003c;0.05)
compared with the median score at the first timepoint, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>.</p><p>

</p><p>Using a score of 12 as the cut-off for depression, the cases and controls were
categorised into a non-depressed group (&#x0003c;12) and a depressed group (&#x02265;12). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref> shows the results for the first and second
timepoints for both the control and intervention groups. According to the McNemar test,
there was no change in the depression level of the control group between the first
(n=13) and second timepoints (n=10). However, the relaxation technique decreased
(p&#x0003c;0.05) the symptoms of depression in hospitalised pregnant women between the first
(n=13) and second timepoints (n=0).</p><p>

</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study has shown that relaxation as a nursing intervention was effective at
significantly decreasing the levels of depression of hospitalised women with high-risk

<sup>11</sup>
</xref>
<sup>-</sup>
<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>12</sup>
</xref>, but few studies have examined the effects of relaxation on women with high-risk
pregnancies. Patients in the control group and intervention group had an EPDS score of
greater than or equal to 12 at the first timepoint. This rate is high, possibly because
this study collected data on hospitalised women with high-risk pregnancies and because
the sample consisted mainly of multiparous women with unplanned pregnancies and
complications in their previous pregnancies. In a study on quality of life, depression
and anxiety in 120 primary care patients with high-risk pregnancies in the city of
Campinas (S&#x000e3;o Paulo, Brazil), 32.5% exhibited symptoms of depression<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>18</sup>
</xref>. Another study analysed the incidence of depression in women with high-risk
pregnancies and found that 50% of the women presented with symptoms of depression<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>19</sup>
</xref>. Another study analysed 712 pregnant women using the Primary Care Evaluation of
Mental Disorders (PRIME-MD) instrument and found that 41.7% of the women probably had
mental disorders<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>20</sup>
</xref>. These data are consistent with the results found in this study.</p><p>In a literature review investigating the prevalence of gestational depression in
developing countries, including Brazil, a mean of 20% was found<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>5</sup>
</xref>, but none of the studies reviewed included women with high-risk pregnancies. In
developed countries, the mean is slightly lower. In the United States, a cohort study
found a 9% prevalence rate<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>21</sup>
</xref>; in an analysis of 2,430 prenatal patients in Switzerland, the rate was
13.7%<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>22</sup>
</xref>. The prevalence of depression tends to increase in women with high-risk
pregnancies<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>5</sup>
</xref>; thus, diagnoses and early interventions after depressive symptoms are detected
in these women is essential for reducing maternal and foetal risks.</p><p>Benson (1993) applied the relaxation technique to hypertensive patients and was able to
reduce anxiety, blood pressure, nervousness and depression<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>16</sup>
</xref>. Additionally, anxiety decreases, and maternal-foetal attachment increases in
primigravid women<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>23</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>As a limitation of this study, we highlight the small sample size due to our exclusion
criteria, which excluded women with who were hospitalised for fewer than five days.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Based on these results, relaxation as a nursing intervention is an important healthcare
technology to help women with high-risk pregnancies reduce their depression symptoms. It
is a simple practice that can be performed during hospitalisation, strengthening the
nurse-patient bond and contributing to quality care. Therefore, it should be included in
the daily nursing routine. Healthcare professionals, especially nurses, play an
important role in recognising the diversity and intensity of the needs of women with
high-risk pregnancies who seek integral care and the prevention of maternal and foetal
complications.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other" id="fn1"><label>1</label><p>Paper extracted from Master's Thesis "Effects of relaxation on depression levels in
