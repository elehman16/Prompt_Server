Probiotics are one the various preventive methods to reduce dental caries. The aim of this study is to compare the effectiveness of probiotic ice cream and drink on salivary <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic> levels in children of 6-12 years age group.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>A three phase study was carried out in children (<italic>n</italic> = 50) of 6-12 years age with zero decayed missing filled teeth (dmft)/DMFT. They were randomly divided into two equal groups. Saliva samples were collected before the consumptions of probiotic ice cream and probiotic drink. Colony count obtained was recorded as baseline data. For both groups probiotic ice cream and drink was given randomly for 7 days and a washout period of 90 days were given and then the saliva samples were collected and colony counting was done.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>Statistical analysis was performed using Student&#x02019;s paired <italic>t</italic>-test and multiple comparisons by Tukey&#x02019;s honest significant difference test which showed, there is a significant reduction in salivary <italic>S. mutans</italic> level in both groups after 7 days period. However, after washout period only probiotic ice cream showed reduction whereas drink did not. Also, there was no significant difference between probiotic ice cream and drink.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Conclusion:</title><p>Probiotic organisms definitely have a role in reducing the salivary <italic>S. mutans</italic> level and ice cream would be a better choice than drink. However, the prolonged use of the agents and their effects on caries is still to be determined.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Dental caries</kwd><kwd><italic>Lactobacillus casei</italic> shirota</kwd><kwd>probiotics</kwd><kwd>saliva</kwd><kwd><italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic></kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Since the introduction of caries by Miller, over the past 115 years there has been remarkable changes in understanding dental caries.<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Traditional approaches to management of caries like extraction, restoration, and modern methods like fluorides, minimal invasive dentistry, remineralizing agents has been tried.
