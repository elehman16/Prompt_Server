While drug treatments are important at alleviating some symptoms, there is increasing evidence of the benefits of exercise in enhancing quality of life and health outcomes. Walking is an inexpensive and accessible form of exercise. To our knowledge, no studies have investigated whether a walking intervention is sufficient to enhance quality of life and alleviate symptoms in people with recurrent or metastatic cancer across a range of tumor types. This paper describes the CanWalk study protocol, which aims to assess the feasibility and acceptability of undertaking a randomized controlled trial of a community-based walking program to enhance quality of life and well-being in people with recurrent or metastatic cancer.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A mixed methods feasibility study includes an exploratory two-center randomized controlled trial and qualitative interviews. A minimum of 60 participants will be recruited from two London NHS Trusts and randomized 1:1 between the walking intervention and standard care using minimization. The walking intervention consists of the initial provision of written/online information followed by a short motivational interview. Participants are instructed to walk for 30 min on alternate days and attend an organized volunteer-led walk once a week. Half of all participants will be asked to use a pedometer. Postal questionnaires will be completed at baseline (pre-randomization) and at 6, 12 and 24 weeks. A subsample of participants and stakeholders will be interviewed at the end of the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Primary outcomes will be the acceptability and feasibility of the intervention and trial. A range of secondary outcome assessments needed to design a main study, including estimates of recruitment, adherence and variability in quality of life, will be evaluated.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Data from this study will be used to refine the walking intervention, investigate the acceptability of the intervention and study design, and determine the most appropriate outcome measures thereby providing estimates of the factors needed to design the main study.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN42072606">ISRCTN42072606</ext-link>.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Randomized controlled trial</kwd><kwd>Feasibility studies</kwd><kwd>Qualitative evaluation</kwd><kwd>Metastatic cancer</kwd><kwd>Recurrent cancer</kwd><kwd>Secondary cancer</kwd><kwd>Walking</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Two million people are living with cancer in the UK today [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], and it is predicted that the number will increase to four million over the next 30&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The precise number of people living with recurrent cancer (the cancer has returned after treatment has ended) or metastatic cancer (the cancer has spread from the place where it first started) is unknown, although there is some evidence that the life expectancy of this group is also increasing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Nevertheless, people with recurrent or metastatic cancer face a number of health challenges including psychological disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and physical symptoms, including pain, fatigue, and appetite loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. While drug treatments are important at alleviating some of these symptoms, two recent systematic reviews identified the important potential contribution of exercise in enhancing the quality of life (QoL) in those with recurrent or metastatic cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Specifically, programs that include regular walking for more than 30&#x000a0;min may generate improvements in QoL, physical functioning, and fatigue and are acceptable and well tolerated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. However, many of the interventions reviewed included different types of physical activity, were supervised, and required attendance at specialist exercise facilities, which may limit their acceptability or economic sustainability in the long term.</p><p>While many people with cancer may be hesitant to exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], research from primary care demonstrates the effectiveness of brief advice, supported by written materials, at increasing physical activity levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Walking is an inexpensive form of exercise, it can be undertaken alone or in a group, and has demonstrated significant health benefits - including for cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. An additional advantage of walking is that it is not restricted to a specific facility or setting and has been shown to be associated with longer-term changes in behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Preliminary results from a randomized pilot walking intervention in Sweden among men with prostate cancer suggest that regular group walking has positive effects on both quality of life and inflammatory and metabolic biomarkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. However, no studies to date have investigated whether a walking intervention on its own is sufficient to enhance the physical and psychological well-being of people with recurrent or metastatic cancer across a range of tumor types.</p><p>Here, we describe the protocol of the CanWalk study, which aims to assess the feasibility and acceptability of undertaking a randomized controlled trial of a community-based walking program to enhance quality of life in people with recurrent or metastatic cancer. The study will promote a walking intervention, assess whether participants find it acceptable and evaluate whether a full randomized controlled trial is warranted and feasible.

Health-care professionals or researchers will describe the study to those identified during a clinic attendance and where appropriate provide a study information pack comprising an invitation letter, information sheet, permission to contact form, a unique study identification number, and postage paid envelope. Those identified via hospital records will be sent the study information pack by post by their health-care professionals.

Those who can, and are still interested in the study, will be sent a consent form, general practitioner (GP) form (to ascertain the details of their family doctor and permission for the researchers to write to inform their GP of their participation in the study), and a baseline questionnaire (T0). Possible outcomes are (1) eligible and willing to participate, (2) eligible and unwilling to participate, and (3) ineligible. Again, wherever possible, reasons for declining participation and ineligibility will be recorded.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>The intervention</title><p>The intervention comprises a brief (approximately 10-min) telephone or face-to-face session, based on the UK&#x02019;s National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidance on promoting physical activity in primary care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The study will utilize the preexisting Walking for Health program, a network of UK-wide, freely available walking groups provided by MacMillan Cancer Support and The Ramblers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Participants in the intervention group will be asked to participate in at least one Walking for Health group activity per week and undertake walking for at least 30&#x000a0;min on alternate days over 3&#x000a0;months, either independently or with Walking for Health groups. Walking for Health&#x02019;s volunteers lead more than 3,000 short walks (lasting approximately 30&#x000a0;min to 1&#x000a0;h) throughout the UK every week. The researcher will assess the patient&#x02019;s readiness to adhere to the walking intervention and, using motivational interviewing techniques, stimulate their use of study materials as a means to increase physical activity. Increasingly used in health-care settings, motivational interviewing is a patient-centered, counseling style that augments an individual&#x02019;s motivation to change behavior and move toward a specific goal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. It explores the person&#x02019;s own reasons for change and focuses on their strengths, not just the obstacles and weaknesses associated with change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Study materials will be provided in print and online formats to reinforce the intervention. Information on local Walking for Health groups will be provided, including details of the seven Walking for Health coordinators in South East London and how to find out about walks elsewhere. The intervention will be delivered by researchers trained in motivational interviewing. An expert in motivational interviewing will provide supervision to the researchers during this process to ensure adherence to operational procedures and the principles of motivational interviewing. Using random selection, intervention sessions will, with consent, be audio recorded to ensure fidelity to the intervention manual.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Comparator group</title><p>Participants in the comparator group will be asked to continue their activities as usual during the study (standard care).</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Assessments</title><p>Participants will complete postal questionnaires at baseline (T0) and at 6 (T1), 12 (T2), and 24 (T3) weeks following recruitment to the study. Two postal reminders will be sent to non-responders. Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> provides an overview of the questionnaires that will be completed at each assessment with a rationale for their use. Additionally, those in the intervention group will be asked to record their Walking for Health participation - including date and location of walks attended - on a simple form. Semi-structured telephone interviews will be conducted with ten participants (five per study group) to assess the acceptability of the intervention, randomization, and evaluation of the study methods. At the end of the intervention, a maximum of ten stakeholders (that is, community group coordinators/walk leaders, clinical nurse specialists, research nurses and hospital doctors) will be interviewed by the study researchers (JH, VT) to explore the acceptability of the walking intervention from a professional perspective.<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Walking intervention for people with recurrent or metastatic cancer: questionnaire measures by assessment point</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr valign="top"><th>Measures included in the study questionnaire</th><th colspan="4">Assessment point</th></tr><tr valign="top"><th>

Any serious adverse events deemed to be related to the intervention or due to participation in the study will be reported to the chief investigator within 24&#x000a0;h of the team learning of its occurrence.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Project management</title><p>The management of the feasibility study will be the responsibility of the research management group, comprising of the chief investigator, all co-applicants, and all research staff. Operational management will be the responsibility of the research team comprising of the chief investigator and research staff, meeting once a week to ensure adherence to planned timescale, adherence to the intervention and detailed plans for data management and analysis. An independent steering committee including health-care professionals, academic researchers, and service users will provide, oversee, and facilitate the study and will meet at least twice a year. This study was also adopted on to the UK National Cancer Research Network Portfolio (UKCRN ID 16236), which provides research infrastructure resources, including Clinical Trial Officer support for recruitment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>This study has received ethical approval from the National Research Ethics Service (NRES) Committee North West - Lancaster and Health Research Authority NRES Centre - Manchester, and research and development governance approval from two London National Health Service (NHS) hospital trusts. Any planned changes to the study design will be submitted for further approval by NRES and relevant research and development committees. We will present study findings at conferences and publish them in peer-reviewed journals. Only individuals who fulfill the authorship criteria will be included as authors on final publications.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study will explore the feasibility and acceptability of a community-based walking program in enhancing QoL outcomes in people with recurrent or metastatic cancer. To date, this is the first study investigating whether a brief walking intervention on its own is sufficient to enhance the health and well-being of these people. This is particularly important because although the number of people living with cancer continues to increase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] people with recurrent or metastatic disease report reduced QoL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p>Despite being the first of its kind, the intervention will only be available in English and therefore the uptake/views of minority ethnic groups may be underrepresented. Also, eight tumor types are included in the trial sample, which means that findings cannot be generalized to all tumor groups.</p><p>Findings from this study will determine whether recruitment to a full-scale trial is feasible and provide initial data for future sample size calculations. It will collect information on the acceptability of the walking intervention and permit refinement where necessary. Furthermore, the study will assess whether the outcomes being used are acceptable, appropriate and sensitive to change in this population. Finally, the study will investigate the acceptability of the use of pedometers and their influence on walking behavior.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Trial status</title><p>Recruiting was closed on the 30th November 2014.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>QoL</term><def><p>quality of life</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NHS</term><def><p>National Health Service</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NRES</term><def><p>National Research Ethics Service</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NICE</term><def><p>National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>VT and JH recruited participants and are responsible for day-to-day study coordination, delivery of the intervention, and draft of the manuscript.
