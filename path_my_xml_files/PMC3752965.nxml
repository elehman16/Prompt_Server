The absolute contribution of postprandial glucose to excess hyperglycaemia in type 2 diabetes appears to be fairly constant across differing levels of glycaemic control; however, in relative terms, its contribution becomes increasingly relevant as glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) decreases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Thus, targeting fasting plasma glucose (FPG) alone may be insufficient and additional attention to postprandial hyperglycaemia could increase the chances of achieving, rather than simply approaching, recommended HbA1c targets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. Further evidence also suggests that targeting postprandial glucose (PPG) has the potential to have an independent beneficial impact on the risk of diabetes-related complications <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. Consequently, current treatment guidelines provide targets for postprandial glucose, with the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists/American College of Endocrinology (AACE/ACE) and the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) recommending that 2-h PPG should not exceed 7.8 mmol/l (140 mg/dl), and the American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommending a more modest target of 10.0 mmol/l (180 mg/dl) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>.</p><p>Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists provide significant improvements in HbA1c, and this class of drugs may help to decrease the risk of hypoglycaemia and promote weight loss <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. However, they have widely differing pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>, and the available evidence suggests that individual GLP-1 receptor agonists differ in their ability to target PPG throughout the day when administered using typical dosing regimens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. Shorter-acting GLP-1 receptor agonists (such as lixisenatide) appear to have a marked effect on PPG levels, which is likely due to substantial slowing of gastric emptying, whereas longer-acting GLP-1 receptor agonists (such as liraglutide) appear to affect mainly fasting glucose and do not have any notable effect on gastric emptying in the long term <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>.</p><p>Liraglutide is currently the only once-daily GLP-1 receptor agonist approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. In the phase III programme [Liraglutide Effect and Action in Diabetes (LEAD)] trials, liraglutide (1.2 or 1.8 mg doses) provided absolute decreases of &#x02212;0.6% to &#x02212;1.5% in HbA1c and &#x02212;0.7 to &#x02212;2.4 mmol/l in FPG when used as monotherapy or in combination with metformin, sulphonylureas and/or thiazolidinediones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>.

Phase II/III data show that lixisenatide 20 &#x000b5;g once daily significantly lowers HbA1c and also has a consistent pronounced impact on postprandial hyperglycaemia, with reductions in 2-h glucose excursions of approximately 5 mmol/l relative to placebo during a standardized liquid meal test <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. Here, we present the results of a 28-day, randomized, open-label, two-arm, parallel group, multicentre, pharmacodynamic study (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov">http://ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> number: NCT01175473) comparing the effects of lixisenatide versus liraglutide during a standardized solid breakfast test on PPG and other metabolic parameters in patients with type 2 diabetes insufficiently controlled on metformin.</p></sec><sec><title>Research Design and Methods</title><p>Male and female individuals aged 37&#x02013;74 years with type 2 diabetes currently receiving a stable dose of metformin (&#x02265;1.5 g/day) and with HbA1c between 6.5% and 9.0%, inclusive, were included in this study. Key exclusion criteria were body mass index (BMI) &#x02264;20 or &#x02265;37 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, serious co-morbidities or abnormalities in laboratory tests [including alanine aminotransferase (ALT) more than three times the upper limit of normal (ULN), calcitonin &#x02265;20 pg/ml, amylase and lipase more than three times ULN], clinically relevant history of gastrointestinal disease, use of other oral or injectable glucose-lowering agents other than metformin within 3 months prior to screening and previous treatment with lixisenatide or liraglutide. Owing to the use of background metformin, patients with renal impairment (creatinine clearance &#x0003c;60 ml/min) were also excluded.</p><p>This was a randomized, open-label, two-arm, parallel-group study conducted in seven centres in Germany and consisting of a 2-week screening period, followed by a 28-day treatment period. The study was approved by the ethics committees and was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice guidelines. All patients gave written informed consent to participate in the study.</p><p>Participants were randomized in a 1 : 1 ratio to receive once-daily treatment with either lixisenatide (n = 77) or liraglutide (n = 71) stratified by study site. Doses of both study drugs were increased to the maintenance dose over 2 weeks and administered subcutaneously 30 min before breakfast. Lixisenatide doses were 10 &#x000b5;g once daily for the first 2 weeks and 20 &#x000b5;g once daily for the last 2 weeks. Liraglutide doses were 0.6 mg once daily for the first week, 1.2 mg once daily for the second week and 1.8 mg once daily for the last 2 weeks. Participants continued treatment with their established dose of metformin.</p><p>At baseline (day &#x02212;1) and day 28, all participants received a standardized breakfast solid test meal (60.6% carbohydrates, 12.4% protein, 26.9% fat, 451 kcal in total, consumed within 15 min; corresponding to a typical European breakfast) 30 min after study drug administration. On the night preceding the breakfast test meal, participants also received a standardized medium glycaemic index dinner (55% carbohydrates, 14% protein, 31% fat, 674 kcal in total) in order to reduce PPG variability the following morning.</p><sec><title>Endpoints and Assessments</title><p>Blood sampling for measurement of pharmacodynamic parameters was performed at prespecified timepoints (prior to the standardized breakfast and over a 24-h period following breakfast) on day &#x02212;1/day 1 and on day 28/29 (after the last dose of study medication). The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline to day 28 in the area under the plasma glucose concentration&#x02013;time curve in the 4-h period after the start of the standardized breakfast test meal (AUC<sub>0:30&#x02013;4:30h</sub>; 0:30 h = start of meal). The AUC was calculated using the linear trapezoidal rule and corrected relative to the premeal glucose concentration. Secondary efficacy measures included changes (baseline to day 28) in maximum PPG excursion in the 4-h period after the start of the standardized breakfast test meal, premeal-corrected AUC<sub>0:30&#x02013;4:30h</sub> for serum insulin, serum C-peptide and plasma glucagon levels (6-point profile, including premeal value), 24-h plasma glucose (15-point profile) and mean HbA1c.</p><p>Safety and tolerability were assessed based on systematic adverse event and serious adverse event reporting and other specific safety information, including symptomatic hypoglycaemia [clinical symptoms with blood glucose &#x0003c;3.3 mmol/l (60 mg/dl) or prompt recovery after oral carbohydrate administration if no plasma glucose measurement was available]. The safety evaluation for vital signs, ECG and clinical laboratory parameters was based on the review of individual values using potentially clinically significant abnormalities criteria and descriptive statistics. Heart rate and systolic/diastolic blood pressure (SBP/DBP) were measured after 10 min rest in the supine resting position on day &#x02212;2 (baseline), before injection on days 3, 13 and 29, and at the end of study visit (day 35 &#x000b1; 2). Heart rate was also obtained from ECG measurements under the same conditions on the same days.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analyses</title><p>The primary pharmacodynamic analysis was performed on the modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population, which included all patients who received at least one dose of open-label study drug, and had both a baseline assessment and at least one postbaseline of any primary or secondary pharmacodynamic variable. A linear fixed-effects model was used to assess the difference between the lixisenatide and liraglutide groups for change from baseline in corrected glucose AUC<sub>0:30&#x02013;4:30h</sub> determined on day 28, with fixed terms for treatment and study site and with the baseline measurement as covariate. The least square (LS) mean estimate [with corresponding two-sided 95% confidence intervals (CI)] of comparison between lixisenatide and liraglutide was obtained using linear contrasts within the model framework. Secondary pharmacodynamic parameters were analysed using a similar model to the primary analysis.</p><p>A sample size of 120 participants (60 per group) was calculated as sufficient to detect a difference of 8.3 h&#x000b7;mmol/L (150 h&#x000b7;mg/dL) in the absolute change from baseline in glucose AUC<sub>0:30&#x02013;4:30h</sub> between lixisenatide and liraglutide with a power of 90%. This assumed a common standard deviation (s.d.) of 13.9 h&#x000b7;mmol/L (250 h&#x000b7;mg/dL) at a 5% significance level.</p><p>All safety analyses were based on the on-treatment phase defined as the time from the first injection up to 3 days after the last injection. The safety population comprised all randomized patients exposed to at least one dose of open-label study drug. Results are presented as mean &#x000b1; standard error of the mean (s.e.m.) or LS mean &#x000b1; standard error (s.e.), unless otherwise specified.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Demographic and baseline characteristics were comparable between the two study groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). The majority of patients (97% in both the lixisenatide and liraglutide groups) completed the 28-day treatment period (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>, Supporting Information). Four patients (two in each group) discontinued prematurely, all due to adverse events. In addition, one patient in the liraglutide group was excluded from the pharmacodynamic analysis due to a protocol deviation (premeal blood sampling was delayed until after the start of the meal). The compliance rate in both treatment groups was greater than 99%.</p><table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Demographics and baseline characteristics (safety population)</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Variable</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Lixisenatide (n = 77)</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Liraglutide (n = 71)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Gender (male/female), %</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">64/36</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">70/30</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Race (Caucasian/Black), %</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">99/1</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">100/0</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age, years (mean &#x000b1; s.d.)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">60.5 &#x000b1; 7.5</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">59.7 &#x000b1; 8.5</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Duration of diabetes, years [median (range)]</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6.7 (1.1, 30.8)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6.7 (1.1, 25.6)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Weight, kg (mean &#x000b1; s.d.)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">91.2 &#x000b1; 15.3</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">92.9 &#x000b1; 16.6</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">BMI, kg/m<sup>2</sup> (mean &#x000b1; s.d.)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">31.2 &#x000b1; 3.9</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">31.3 &#x000b1; 4.1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">HbA1c, % (mean &#x000b1; s.d.)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7.20 &#x000b1; 0.63</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7.41 &#x000b1; 0.81</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Duration of metformin treatment, years [median (range)]</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5.0 (0.3, 16.6)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.7 (0.3, 16.8)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>BMI, body mass index;HbA1c, glycated haemoglobin; s.d., standard deviation.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><sec><title>Pharmacodynamics</title><p>From baseline to day 28, lixisenatide provided a significantly greater reduction in PPG (glucose AUC<sub>0:30&#x02013;4:30h</sub> corrected for premeal value) compared with liraglutide (&#x02212;12.6 vs. &#x02212;4.0 h&#x000b7;mmol/L, respectively; p &#x0003c; 0.0001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>).

The PPG-lowering effect of lixisenatide was associated with significantly greater reductions in postprandial insulin, C-peptide and glucagon compared with liraglutide.</p><p>Previous evidence indicates that the glucose-lowering actions of GLP-1 receptor agonists relate to a combination of reduced endogenous glucose production (via insulinotropic and glucagonostatic effects) and reduced appearance of ingested glucose in the systemic circulation (via slowing of gastric emptying), with the latter predominating in the postprandial period <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. In healthy non-diabetic individuals, glucagon secretion is typically suppressed in response to a meal leading to reduced plasma levels, whereas in type 2 diabetes this suppression is typically impaired <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>, as demonstrated by the inappropriately increased glucagon observed before the start of study treatment with lixisenatide or liraglutide.</p><p>Insulin secretion was decreased with lixisenatide and relatively unchanged with liraglutide, but this needs to be considered in the context of markedly lower PPG levels with lixisenatide, and these observations would be consistent with glucose-dependent insulinotropic effects and previous observations with exenatide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. The decreased insulin secretion seen with lixisenatide in this study would also be consistent with slowing of gastric emptying.</p><p>As noted above, the PPG-lowering effects observed with some GLP-1 receptor agonists (lixisenatide and exenatide, but not liraglutide) appear to be due primarily to slowing of gastric emptying <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. Interestingly, recent data indicate that the delay in gastric emptying by GLP-1 is reduced during continued exposure, probably due to tachyphylaxis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. Such observations suggest that shorter acting GLP-1 receptor agonists, such as lixisenatide and exenatide may have greater potential to reduce PPG due to less tachyphylaxis, and it is possible that such a mechanism also contributed to the greater PPG-lowering effect seen with lixisenatide relative to liraglutide in this study.</p><p>Hyperglycaemia associated with the morning meal has been shown to be a fundamental defect that is especially marked in patients with HbA1c levels between 7% and 8% <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. Furthermore, this significant component of overall glycaemia appears to be particularly resistant to glucose-lowering drug therapy, in general <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. Postbreakfast glucose excursions, thus represent an important target of glucose-lowering therapy that can be addressed specifically with lixisenatide.</p><p>Both lixisenatide and liraglutide were well tolerated and, typical of GLP-1 receptor agonists, the most frequent adverse events were gastrointestinal in nature. However, lixisenatide was associated with a lower incidence of adverse events overall (58% vs. 73% for liraglutide). As the preferred term &#x02018;decreased appetite&#x02019; (which was more frequently reported with liraglutide) could be construed as a beneficial effect rather than an adverse event, the tolerability data were also analysed after excluding this term. For this modified total, lixisenatide remained associated with a lower incidence of adverse events overall (55% vs. 65% for liraglutide). In particular, there were fewer gastrointestinal events overall with lixisenatide (36% vs. 46% for liraglutide), and the difference was most notable for diarrhoea, which was five times less frequent with lixisenatide (3% vs. 15% for liraglutide). Gastrointestinal events represent one of the key tolerability issues associated with GLP-1 receptor agonist therapy and can be a major cause of treatment discontinuation in clinical trials, despite their transient nature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. It remains unclear whether a difference of the magnitude reported in this study would translate into any clinically meaningful advantages, such as improved compliance. However, it is notable that, in a study of patient-reported tolerability issues with oral agents, diarrhoea/constipation was one of only two factors (the other being hypoglycaemia) found to be significantly associated with increased likelihood of self-reported medication non-adherence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>.</p><p>Interestingly, mean supine heart rate (measured 24 h after dosing) decreased with lixisenatide, but increased with liraglutide. As both agents provided similar changes in blood pressure, this difference is unlikely to be related to a compensatory mechanism. The increase in heart rate with liraglutide is consistent with previous observations with liraglutide and has also been reported with the weekly formulation of exenatide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. This observation may warrant further investigation.</p><p>Both lixisenatide and liraglutide lowered HbA1c (liraglutide &#x02212;0.51% vs. lixisenatide &#x02212;0.32%; p &#x0003c; 0.01) and body weight over 28 days, despite the short study duration. The 24-h profiles showed an overall reduction in plasma glucose in both treatment groups. Specific patterns of coverage appeared to reflect the distinct pharmacokinetic profiles of lixisenatide and liraglutide, with lixisenatide providing particularly good coverage of breakfast-associated glycaemia, as clearly showed in the standardized breakfast meal test, and liraglutide providing better fasting control and PPG coverage beyond the morning meal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. Notably, lixisenatide allowed over twice as many patients to achieve the 2-h PPG target of &#x0003c;7.8 mmol/l (as recommended by the AACE/ACE and the IDF) at breakfast compared with liraglutide. A 2-h postchallenge glucose level of 7.8 mmol/l has generally been recognized as the limit of normal glucose tolerance in healthy individuals and is considered both a reasonable and achievable goal in patients with type 2 diabetes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. In this study, this goal was achieved by over two thirds of patients on lixisenatide and, importantly, this was possible without any cases of hypoglycaemia. However, lixisenatide also appeared to provide some coverage up to the evening meal, which is consistent with previous observations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. With respect to clinical reality, a limitation of this study is the relatively short observation time of 28 days. Indeed, direct conclusions with regard to long-term metabolic control should not be made. However, at least with liraglutide, one can expect that the treatment was long enough to reach steady-state conditions, and that in consequence, the full PPG-lowering effect could be achieved <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>.</p><p>The pronounced PPG-lowering effect of lixisenatide may provide several potential clinical benefits in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Foremost, lixisenatide would appear to provide a particularly appropriate option for improving glycaemic control in patients with marked postprandial hyperglycaemia. In particular, lixisenatide may represent an alternative option to other PPG-targeting therapies, such as rapid-acting insulin. Notably, lixisenatide's improved control of postprandial hyperglycaemia occurred without increased risk of hypoglycaemia, which can be an issue with rapid-acting insulins. Previous observations also show that lixisenatide itself provides significant improvements in FPG in addition to PPG (e.g. as monotherapy in treatment-na&#x000ef;ve patients; [27]). Alongside adequate attention to FPG, targeting PPG with lixisenatide has the potential to allow more patients to achieve (rather than just approach) recommended HbA1c goals. Support for this comes from the prospective interventional study by Woerle et al., who showed that when FPG (but not PPG) was at target, only 64% of patients achieved HbA1c &#x02264;7%, whereas when both FPG and PPG were at target, 94% achieved HbA1c &#x02264;7% <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. Furthermore, targeting FPG with basal insulin in patients insufficiently controlled (HbA1c &#x0003e;7%) on oral agents has been shown to increase markedly the relative contribution of PPG to overall hyperglycaemia from 20&#x02013;24% to 59&#x02013;69% across the range of achieved HbA1c (including patients with HbA1c remaining &#x02265;8%), highlighting the need to target PPG on top of FPG if further improvements are to be achieved <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. Epidemiological studies suggest that, even in the absence of fasting hyperglycaemia, elevated postprandial glycaemia increases the risk for cardiovascular disease and death in both diabetic and non-diabetic populations and may also be associated with microvascular complications <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. Thus, specifically targeting PPG may have the potential to reduce the risk of diabetes-related complications <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. Although this has not been confirmed in outcome trials, the benefits of targeting PPG have been demonstrated for surrogate markers of cardiovascular disease (e.g. progression of carotid intima media thickness) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>.</p><p>In conclusion, 28 days of treatment with once-daily prebreakfast lixisenatide provided a significantly greater reduction in PPG (AUC) during a morning test meal versus prebreakfast liraglutide. The PPG-lowering effect of lixisenatide was accompanied by significant decreases in postprandial insulin, C-peptide and glucagon, and a better gastrointestinal tolerability profile compared with liraglutide, especially with respect to diarrhoea.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Dr Christoph Kapitza acts as guarantor and takes responsibility for the content of the article.
