This includes increases in mood and self-esteem, faster recovery from surgery, and physiological and psychological stress relief.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup> While the positive impact of being in nature or the visual perception of it is well established, much less is known about the effect of simply listening to natural sounds.</p><p>The few existing studies that applied natural sounds in different settings, that is, during an operation,<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup> before<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> or after a stressful task in the laboratory<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> report meaningful stress-reducing effects. In the study by Arai et al,<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup> the patients underwent an operation under epidural anesthesia. They were assigned to either listening to natural sounds or they had no acoustic stimulation intraoperatively. It was reported that the activity of salivary alpha-amylase, a surrogate marker for the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) (e.g. <sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup>) was significantly lower in the condition with natural sounds as compared to the nonacoustic condition. Alvarsson et al<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> examined whether listening to natural sounds, as compared to noises, after a stress-provoking task was effective in reducing stress, as measured via skin conductance level (SCL) and high frequency heart rate variability (HF HRV). The authors found a faster recovery in the natural sounds condition in SCL, but not in HF HRV. It was concluded that listening to natural sounds after stress exposure is facilitating sympathetic, but not parasympathetic, recovery.<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> Annerstedt et al<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> examined stress recovery processes of natural sounds in combination with a virtual green environment (VGE). Increased parasympathetic activity was found in individuals who were listening to natural sounds in the condition with VGE after stress induction, but not in those individuals who were in the condition with VGE without sound or in control individuals who were neither exposed to VGE nor natural sounds. Finally, in an experimental study conducted by our own research group, we found that listening to water sounds before a major stress situation significantly reduced the subsequent cortisol response, an indicator for the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis activation.<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> Together, these studies suggest a stress-reducing effect of natural sounds, as reflected by changes in the endocrine and the autonomous nervous system. This implies that listening to natural sounds may be a simple and easily accessible intervention that is capable of positively affecting the major human stress systems.</p><p>Given the fact that only little is known about the effect of natural sounds, it remains unclear whether the stress-reducing effect of natural sounds is universal (i.e., biophilia hypothesis) or whether it depends on interindividual differences, as is the case for music (e.g., <sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>). The biophilia hypothesis posits that human beings subconsciously feel attracted to and seek nature,<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup> which would imply that natural stimuli have a comparable, most likely inherent effect on all human beings. However, it is also assumed that mental or somatic conditions that affect perception, cognitive or emotional processing, or functioning of the stress systems, such as chronic stress (e.g., <sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup>), depressive symptomatology (e.g., <sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup>), or rumination (e.g., <sup>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup>) may moderate the stress-reducing effect of natural sounds. Of particular interest in this regard are somatic complaints, as they increase attention to one's own body,<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup> in the form of an attentional or cognitive bias,<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup> which might impede attention or concentration on the potentially relaxing stimulus. For instance, in a study by Eccleston et al<sup>[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup>, it was found that pain patients with high somatic awareness showed more attention deficits compared to those with low somatic awareness. Given that natural sounds are applied in health-related contexts, the knowledge of whether individuals with more somatic complaints benefit less from natural sounds would be of practical relevance.</p><p>To test whether somatic complaints moderate the stress-reducing effect of natural sounds, we conducted a secondary analysis of an existing data set<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> comparing healthy female participants who benefited more from the water sounds (as indicated by a lower cortisol sensitivity to the stress task) with those women who benefitted less. We hypothesized that those participants who benefited less from the stress-reducing effect of listening to water sounds are also those reporting more somatic complaints. To test whether this effect is specific to the stress-reducing effect of water sounds, exploratory analyses were computed for a music and a silence condition.</p></sec><sec><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec><label>2.1</label><title>Characteristics of participants</title><p>Participants were considered eligible for the study if they met the following inclusion criteria: female gender, healthy body mass index (BMI), age (20&#x02013;30 years), language (native Swiss German), and having a regular menstruation cycle.

Depending on the assigned experimental condition, they either listened to water sounds, music, or rested in silence prior to the stress induction. For the induction of a strong psychobiological stress response, all participants were subjected to the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST).<sup>[<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup> After arrival, participants were informed orally and in writing about the purpose and procedure of the study. After providing informed consent, a first saliva sample was taken (baseline measurement of cortisol, 30 minutes prior the onset of the TSST, t1, &#x02212;30&#x0200a;minutes). Further samples were taken after the participants were placed in separate rooms (-20&#x0200a;minutes) where they listened to water sounds, music, or rested in silence for ten minutes (t2, &#x02212;5&#x0200a;minutes); samples were taken again after the actual stress task (t3, +10&#x0200a;minutes), as well as 15&#x0200a;minutes (t4, + 25&#x0200a;minutes), 30&#x0200a;minutes (t5, + 40&#x0200a;minutes), 45&#x0200a;minutes (t6, + 55&#x0200a;minutes), and 60&#x0200a;minutes (t7, + 70&#x0200a;minutes) after the TSST.</p><p>All participants provided written informed consent.

The frequency of 55 somatic complaints (e.g., &#x0201c;do you have pain in the legs?&#x0201d;) was rated on a frequency scale comprised of 5 categories (&#x0201c;almost every day,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;about 3&#x0200a;times/week,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;about 2&#x0200a;times/month,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;about 2&#x0200a;times/year,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;hardly ever&#x0201d;). In addition, 25 somatic complaints (e.g., &#x0201c;are you sensitive to cold?&#x0201d;) were rated on an intensity scale. For the statistical analyses, sum scores for the ten syndromes and a total score of somatic complaints (= sum of all ten scores) were calculated.</p><sec><label>3.1</label><title>Biological assessment</title><p>Small cotton rolls (Salivettes, Sarstedt, Sevelen, Switzerland) were used for the collection of stimulated saliva for the analysis of salivary free cortisol. Until biochemical analysis, samples were stored at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C. A commercial chemiluminescence immunoassay (LIA) (IBL, Hamburg, Germany) was used to determine cortisol. Inter- and intra-assay coefficients of variation were below 10%. All samples from each participant were analyzed in the same run.</p></sec><sec><label>3.2</label><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS Statistics 23 for Mac OSX (IBM, Chicago, IL). A measure for area under the curve with respect to increase (AUC<sub>I</sub>) was calculated for cortisol to receive an index for cortisol stress sensitivity, which will be referred to as <italic>AUC</italic><sub><italic>I</italic></sub> sensitivity from now on. The AUC<sub>I</sub> was calculated according to the formula provided by Pruessner et al.<sup>[<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup> The AUC<sub>I</sub> typically includes several time points and is calculated with respect to the first value (= difference between the baseline and subsequent measures) and is thus a measure that is indicative of a system's sensitivity.<sup>[<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup> We included the four measurement time points from T1, &#x02212;30&#x0200a;minutes (= baseline), to T4, +25 (= peak) to receive an index that is particularly sensitive to the reactivity of the system, in analogy to cortisol reactivity, which is a delta measure (peak minus baseline values) (e.g., <sup>[<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</sup>). We observed a pattern of high versus low-reactive individuals. We interpreted a negative cortisol response, that is, a decrease in cortisol relative to the baseline (= AUC<sub>I</sub> with a negative value, index of decrease) (see <sup>[<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup>), as the low cortisol responding group (LOW CORT); and a positive cortisol response, that is, an increase in cortisol relative to the baseline (= AUC<sub>I</sub> with a positive value), as the high cortisol responding group (HIGH CORT).</p><p>To test whether LOW and HIGH CORT groups significantly differed with regard to cortisol stress sensitivity, univariate analyses were conducted. Independent <italic>t</italic> tests were computed for the assessment of differences in the FBL scores between groups. To test whether somatic complaints were predictive for cortisol AUC<sub>I</sub> sensitivity, a binary logistic regression was computed.

Only recently, some studies have shown that the mere act of listening to natural sounds is capable of inducing a state of relaxation via stress relieving effects within the endocrine and autonomous nervous system.<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> It is yet unknown whether all individuals do respond to natural sounds equally, as can be assumed based on the biophilia hypothesis, or rather individually different, such as in the case of music. On the basis of current results from a secondary analysis, we were able to preliminary demonstrate that the stress-reducing effect of water sounds, as indicated by a reduced cortisol output after stress induction, depends on the occurrence of somatic complaints. Healthy individuals with more somatic complaints benefited less from listening to water sounds when compared to individuals with fewer somatic complaints. Exploratory analyses revealed that while the moderating effect of somatic complaints was not found in either the music or the silence condition, analyses of specificity do not suggest a meaningful effect of the experimental condition.</p><p>This study provides the first, preliminary evidence for a differential effect of listening to water sounds in healthy female individuals depending on reported somatic complaints. Given the limited number of studies examining the stress-reducing effect of natural sounds, we are left speculating about the reason for this finding. It may be that the increased attention towards somatic complaints<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup> may impede attention or concentration on the potentially stress-reducing effect by the natural sounds. However, given the fact that the current study is a re-analysis of an existing data set, we did not control, manipulate or measure attention or concentration on the acoustic stimuli. Future studies have to use a study design that help to answer the differing effect of natural sounds.</p><p>Our findings suggest the importance of acknowledging even minor somatic complaints when giving medical advice or treating individuals seeking care for somatic complaints, which is a common phenomenon in primary care practices.<sup>[<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</sup> Around 30%<sup>[<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</sup> to 64%<sup>[<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</sup> of the presented somatic complaints are idiopathic, that is, medically unexplained. The impact of medically unexplained complaints is comparable to complaints with a medical explanation.<sup>[<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</sup> Given the increasing risk for mental disorders, such as depression and anxiety, with a higher number of somatic complaints,<sup>[<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</sup> it is of utmost importance to find adequate treatment for those individuals. While we still know little about the phenomenon of somatic complaints,<sup>[<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]</sup> stress relief interventions may be effective in the treatment of somatic complaints. Our results suggest that individuals with more somatic complaints may not benefit from the use of natural sounds as relaxation stimulation. It might be the case that these individuals need alternative stimuli in order to induce stress reduction. These alternative stimuli should be designed in a way that would allow subjects not to focus too intensively on their bodily symptoms. This might be achieved by combining an auditory stimulus with additional visual stimulation in form of a corresponding virtual stimulation of the natural environment, as a bimodal stimulation may enhance effects (e.g., <sup>[<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]</sup>).</p><p>Limitations of our study include the relatively small size of our subgroups that prevented controlling for multiple-testing and the influence of co-varying factors in the statistical analyses and the very homogeneous sample (only young women in the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle not taking oral contraceptives) which limits generalization and findings cannot be transferred to men. In addition, we chose a between-subjects as compared to a within-subjects study design. Although comparable to other stress studies, cortisol levels at baseline, that is, prior to the actual stress induction, were higher than normally expected in a (nonlaboratory) resting situation. The waiting for an anticipated stressor, in combination with being in a new and unfamiliar environment may be a stressor by itself, which may have accounted for the slightly increased cortisol levels at baseline. However, this applied to all participants in all three conditions. Finally, a limitation of our study is the categorization of participants into 2 groups (HIGH vs LOW), which resulted in smaller subsamples and consequently reduced power. Clearly, our observations should be corroborated in a bigger sample, ideally using dimensional measures of cortisol responses. We hope that our current preliminary findings will inform future research endeavors in this area.</p></sec><sec><label>6</label><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, with this work we were able to show for the first time, preliminary evidence that the stress-reducing effect of listening to water sounds may dependent on the presence of somatic complaints.
