This is also in line with economic arguments about health. The existing structure of day-care services for the elderly can be used to achieve this. Due to the current lack of empirical evidence in this field, most day-care centres do not offer a scientifically evaluated, structured intervention, but instead offer a mixture of individual activities whose efficacy has not yet been established. Informal caregivers of people with dementia use day-care centres primarily to relieve themselves of their care tasks and as a support service.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p id="Par2">The present study therefore investigates the effectiveness of a combination of a multicomponent activation therapy for people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or mild to moderate dementia at day-care centres and a brief telephone intervention for their informal caregivers. The study is conducted as a cluster-randomised intervention trial at 34&#x000a0;day-care centres in Germany with a 6-month treatment phase. The centres in the waitlist control group provide &#x0201c;care as usual&#x0201d;. A power analysis indicated that 346 people should initially be included in the study. The primary endpoints of the study include the ability to perform activities of daily living (ADL) and cognitive capacities on the side of the day-care centre users and the subjectively perceived burden and well-being of the informal caregivers. The total duration of the study is 3 years, during which data are collected both by the psychometric testing of the people with cognitive impairment and by telephone interviews with informal caregivers.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">The project has three distinctive quality features. First, it is embedded in real care situations since the day-care services have already been established for this target group. Second, due to the large number of cases and the fact that the participating day-care centres are spread across the entire country, the results can be expected to be generalisable. Third, the interventions can be assumed to be implementable as they required only a one-day training event for the staff already working at the centres.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par4">

In addition to the personal needs of the individuals in question, the healthcare system also has an interest in the economic advantage of keeping elderly people with MCI and dementia at home [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par23">In order to achieve this in people with MCI or dementia, it is necessary to help them remain independent for as long as possible and to reduce the burden experienced by their informal caregivers. To date, no effective interventions have been developed, evaluated, or implemented in the existing outpatient care services.</p><p id="Par24">One institution that is already in place in the current healthcare system and in a position to reach dyads consisting of informal caregivers and people with MCI or dementia is the day-care centre. In Germany, these centres have already been established as providers of services for people requiring care, thus relieving the burden on informal caregivers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. They also receive funding from the statutory care insurance.</p><p id="Par25">Services provided by day-care centres in Germany are currently used by only a small percentage (approx. 4%) of people needing care who are cared for at home [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The majority of the day-care centre users are elderly people with varying levels of cognitive deficits &#x02013; from MCI to severe dementia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In people with Alzheimer&#x02019;s dementia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], there is an association between the attendance of a day-care centre and the transition to institutionalised care.</p><p id="Par26">If a person requiring care attends a day-care centre, this directly relieves the care burden on their informal caregiver. It also reduces depressive mood in the caregivers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Moreover, the people requiring care who attend a day-care centre experience an increase in well-being [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par27">However, the results of a recent review revealed that, to date, there is no scientifically tested, established intervention concept [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] with concrete goals and a structured manual for people with cognitive impairment who attend day-care centres. Such a development could transform these centres into a form of specific intervention rather than just care as usual. This means that in the past, day-care centres have not fully exploited their capabilities to promote attendees&#x02019; independence and to contribute to stabilising the attendees&#x02019; abilities to live at home. It is possible for day-care centres to carry out a non-drug group therapy with only minimal additional effort, using their existing staff and premises. It is also less expensive than an individual intervention at home.</p><p id="Par28">The fact that the nursing staff of day-care centres can reach both people with cognitive impairment and their caregivers, a multicomponent intervention that supports both would be useful. Multicomponent interventions are also more effective than single interventions, for both people with dementia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and their caregivers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par29">The scientific evidence on non-drug treatments for dementia is mixed, and it is therefore not possible to make an unreserved recommendation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The evidence on the therapeutic benefit of pharmacotherapeutic treatment options for Alzheimer&#x02019;s dementia is also limited, particularly with regard to the duration of effect, adverse effects, and clinical relevance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. There are indications that occupational group training improves ADL, but it has no significant effect on cognitive abilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. These results clearly indicate the need to develop and test effective interventions and especially multicomponent interventions in order to achieve effects in several domains of function.</p><p id="Par30">In this situation, the non-drug multicomponent treatment &#x0201c;MAKS&#x0201d; (standing for <bold>m</bold>otor stimulation, <bold>a</bold>ctivities of daily living, and <bold>c</bold>ognitive and <bold>s</bold>ocial functioning) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] was developed and tested in a randomised-controlled intervention study in an inpatient setting for a duration of 12&#x000a0;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. It resulted in a statistically significant and clinically relevant therapeutic effect in which the capacities of the people with dementia were stabilised in the domains of ADL and cognitive function. The treatment effect was also sustained over a follow-up period of 10&#x000a0;months.</p><p id="Par31">Caregiver burden also results from a progressive decline in the capacity to perform ADL in people with dementia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Thus, an intervention that has a favourable influence on the ability to perform ADL also has an indirect effect on the burden experienced by caregivers by slowing down the increase in activities they have to take on for the person requiring care.</p><p id="Par32">&#x0201c;Unexplainable&#x0201d; or challenging behaviours of people with dementia also play a special role in the burden experienced by informal caregivers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Telephone support for caregivers of people with dementia can be helpful because it improves their emotional health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. A combination of day-care for people with cognitive impairment and telephone support for their informal caregivers may be more effective than separate interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p id="Par33">Thus, we combine a non-drug therapy for people with cognitive impairment in the day-care setting with caregivers&#x02019; support by offering a low-threshold counselling service. For this purpose, the MAKS treatment, which has already demonstrated effectiveness in the nursing home setting, was adjusted for the day-care setting.</p><p id="Par34">The acceptance of both approaches &#x02013; the multimodal, non-drug MAKS therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and the telephone interventions for caregivers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] &#x02013; has been demonstrated in previous studies and can be considered high.</p><p id="Par35">The objective of this paper is to describe the study protocol of the cluster-randomised DeTaMAKS (<bold>De</bold>menz &#x02013; <bold>Ta</bold>gespflege &#x02013; <bold>MAKS</bold>; engl. <bold>de</bold>mentia &#x02013; <bold>da</bold>y-care &#x02013; <bold>MAKS</bold> therapy) study and to serve as a reference for forthcoming papers reporting the results of the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Aims and hypothesis</title><p id="Par36">The main aim of the DeTaMAKS study, which began in October 2014, is to assess whether a combined intervention can promote and sustain abilities to perform ADL and cognitive capacities and thus independence in people with MCI or mild or moderate dementia, which should also provide some relief for the informal caregiver.</p><p id="Par37">There is also the hope that combining the MAKS therapy in day-care centres with a brief telephone intervention for informal caregivers will make it easier for the caregivers to reconcile the home care they are providing with their work, thus delaying the transition to institutional care and decreasing the costs for the healthcare system.</p><p id="Par38">Research hypotheses:<list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>i.</label><p id="Par39">The MAKS therapy leads to a statistically significantly greater improvement in abilities to perform ADL and cognitive capacities over time in people with MCI and dementia as compared with &#x0201c;care as usual&#x0201d; in the control group.</p></list-item></list>

</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study design and setting</title><p id="Par42">A cluster-randomised, controlled, multicentre, prospective longitudinal study with a waitlist control group design was conducted to test the above research hypotheses.</p><p id="Par43">All day-care centres participating in the study (cluster) were randomly assigned to the intervention or control group at baseline (random selection). The cluster was stratified by region (the Northeast, the Southeast, and the West). In order to guarantee that the sequence would be concealed until the intervention and control groups were assigned, all day-care centre staff were trained on the study protocol, instruments, and screening before the randomisation. The informed consent of the day-care users and their caregivers were also collected before the randomisation (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Day-care centres were informed of their group allocation in written form by the study headquarters. During the 6-month intervention phase, the day-care centres in the intervention group carry out the MAKS treatment after their staff receive training. The caregivers receive a brief telephone intervention by counsellors with training in psychotherapy. The day-care centres in the control group do not carry out any additional project-specific treatment but continue providing &#x0201c;care as usual&#x0201d;. This is the accepted standard of care in day-care centres. Because we are investigating a non-pharmacological intervention, neither the staff carrying out the MAKS therapy nor the people with cognitive impairment are blinded. Six months after baseline, the day-care centres&#x02019; staff in the control group will also undergo training in MAKS therapy. At the end of the 6-month intervention phase, the day-care centres in both the intervention and control groups will freely decide whether or not to continue the MAKS treatment or to introduce the treatment, respectively, including the level of intensity. The observation period is 2 years with a total of four measurement points (baseline and after 6, 12, and 24&#x000a0;months). Data are collected by means of psychometric tests, the day-care centres&#x02019; documentation, and computer-assisted telephone interviews (CATIs) with the caregivers. All procedures were approved by the Friedrich Alexander University Erlangen-Nuremberg Ethics Committee. The external GKV Spitzenverband was closely informed of the progress of the study and achieved milestones as determined in the trial application. The study design is presented in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. In the case of important protocol modifications, we will inform the Ethics Committee, the funders, the day-care centres, and the platform for the trial registry.

</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Sample size estimation</title><p id="Par44">A power analysis was computed on the basis of the authors&#x02019; previous experience with the MAKS study in nursing homes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In contrast to the procedure in the MAKS study in nursing homes, the intervention in the DeTaMAKS project had a lower treatment intensity and a shorter duration, and therefore the effect was expected to be markedly lower. We conservatively set an expected effect size of f<sup>2</sup>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.06 for the primary outcome and alpha error of 0.05 and a statistical power of 0.80 and obtained a total sample size of approximately 270 people attending a day-care centre for at least 6 months. Based on pilot study we assumed fluctuation in day-care centre users of 22% over 6 months. Therefore, we concluded that a total of 346 people should initially be included in the study.</p><p id="Par45">The results of the MAKS study in nursing homes also showed that 69% of eligible candidates were willing to take part in the study. The pilot study showed that 56% of the day-care centre users who were screened fulfilled the required criteria for inclusion. This means that a total pool of 1086&#x000a0;day-care centre users was needed to achieve the required sample size. If we assumed approximately 33 users per week, we needed to recruit at least 32&#x000a0;day-care centres.</p><p id="Par46">These day-care centres were large enough to have the space and staff required to carry out the project in accordance with the prescribed conditions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Recruitment strategies</title><p id="Par47">Day-care centres from all regions of Germany were identified by means of their websites or entries in information systems and were contacted by telephone. If they met the required size (no fewer than 15 places) and expressed interest, they were sent basic written information about the project. A co-operation contract was signed with the day-care centres that decided to participate in the study. We stopped recruiting further day-care centres after the contract with the 34th day-care centre had been signed. Before the screening phase, all participating day-care centres were given one day of training by the study team on the study protocol (2 trainees per day-care centre) and one day on the recruitment instruments (1-2 trainees per day-care centre).</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Eligibility of participants</title><p id="Par48">All users of the 34&#x000a0;day-care centres and their caregivers were included in the screening process. All dyads (consisting of a day-care centre user and caregiver) that fulfilled the criteria for inclusion were informed about the study and asked to take part in the project.</p><sec id="Sec8"><title>Day-care centre users</title><p id="Par49">All day-care centre users underwent a two-step standardised screening process to determine their suitability for the project. In the first step of the screening process, all day-care centre users who had been documented by their day-care centre as fulfilling at least one of the following criteria were excluded: blindness, deafness, lacking a caregiver, lacking the ability to communicate, more than 1 stroke, severe depression, schizophrenia, an addictive disorder, concrete plans for institutionalisation, and attendance at the day-care centre of less than once a week. The day-care centres&#x02019; documentation contained all medical diagnoses and doctors&#x02019; prescriptions known to the informal caregivers. In a second step, the day-care centre users who remained after the first step of the screening process underwent psychometric testing of their cognitive performance.</p><p id="Par50">The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) were administered in combination to screen the day-care centre users for MCI, mild dementia, and moderate dementia. The MMSE was administered first in order to differentiate between non-dementia and dementia on the basis of the cut-off score of 23 points [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. However, as the MMSE is not sensitive enough to be able to detect MCI in the range of non-dementia cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], the MoCA was also administered when the MMSE values ranged from 24 to 30 points. Freitas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] suggests using a cut-off score of 22 points to discriminate between normal cognition and MCI. The criteria for day-care centre users who were positively screened for MCI or mild to moderate dementia are shown in Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>.<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Definition of positively screened day-care users</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th>Normal cognition</th><th>MCI</th><th>Mild or moderate dementia</th><th>Severe dementia</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Step 1: MMSE</td><td>30-24</td><td>30-24</td><td>23-10</td><td>9-0</td></tr><tr><td>Step 2: MoCA<sup>a</sup>

When there were several informal caregivers, as a rule, the caregiver who currently was not yet retired was asked to take part in the study.

Examples of the contents of these activity sessions are household activities (cooking, baking), shopwork (e.g. making a key rack), gardening (e.g. growing radishes, planting spring flowers), social activities (e.g. celebrating current festivals, for example, New Years or Carnival), and crafts (e.g. making greetings cards or table decorations) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Implementation of the MAKS therapy in the DeTaMAKS project</title><p id="Par58">The day-care centres in the intervention group committed themselves to carrying out the therapy in accordance with the manual every morning from Monday to Friday for 6 months. On each day of the therapy, all study participants attending the day-care centre on that day take part in the MAKS therapy. This results in average &#x0201c;doses of therapy&#x0201d; of one to five therapy days per week. The MAKS therapy is carried out by no less than two trained therapists. At least one of the two therapists is a qualified healthcare professional (geriatric nurse, nurse, or occupational therapist). The one-day training event for the staff of the day-care centres and the material used in the therapy were given to the day-care centres in the intervention group at baseline and will be given to the centres in the control group 6 months later. Study headquarters&#x02019; staff members are available to answer questions by phone or by e-mail on all weekdays.</p><p id="Par59">The project does not exert any influence on the usual services of any of the 34&#x000a0;day-care centres, the pharmacotherapy of the study participants, or the frequency of attendance. Day-care users were free to choose their day-care centre and were free to decide whether to participate in the MAKS therapy. However, all changes in the frequency of attendance of the day-care centre are documented for all study participants.</p><p id="Par60">A precursor to the intervention was implemented in nursing homes in a randomised-controlled trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] to record serious adverse events (falls resulting in injury, other types of serious injury and deaths), which did not increase over a period of 12&#x000a0;months. This is why we forwent the recording of serious adverse events (except death) and why no stopping guidelines were necessary. For this reason, we expect that the benefits of the MAKS therapy will far outweigh any possible harm. Also, because the intervention was implemented within the care of the day-care centres, participants did not need additional accident insurance.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Brief telephone intervention for informal caregivers</title><p id="Par61">In addition to the MAKS therapy provided by the day-care centres, all caregivers in the intervention group receive three brief outreach telephone interventions. The task of the counsellors is to support the caregivers through three manualised phone calls, each lasting roughly 1 h. The goal is to work with the caregivers to develop strategies for self-management, to reduce the stress involved in providing home care, and to deal with challenging behaviours in order to &#x0201c;empower&#x0201d; the caregivers by improving their skills. The intervention includes tried and tested procedures from stress psychology, adjusted to fit the informal caregivers&#x02019; situations. Specifically, elements of the following procedures are employed: stress inoculation training as described by Meichenbaum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], time structuring for the day, selection and prioritisation of goals, and development of positive activities. The procedure follows the self-management approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], that is, the aim is to enable the caregivers to use the strategies they have learned as fast as possible and to apply them in a beneficial manner.</p><p id="Par62">&#x0201c;Challenging behaviours&#x0201d;, which occur in dementia in particular, are frequently experienced as especially stressful by caregivers. The intervention therefore includes information on the reasons for behaviour that is outside of the norm and the teaching of strategies that can be applied to reduce the occurrence of challenging behaviours, especially including references to the established Need-Driven Behaviour model to understand challenging behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. The counsellor&#x02019;s basic attitude is client-centred [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] and solution-oriented.</p><p id="Par63">The phone calls are made at the beginning of the 6-month intervention phase, after about 2&#x000a0;months, and towards the end of the intervention phase. The intervention is carried out by two counsellors with training in psychotherapy who were given special training beforehand and regular supervision. The first phone call begins by determining the specific stress triggers and the behaviours that the caregiver identifies as challenging, followed by an explanation of some initial possible coping modes and information about the challenging behaviours the caregiver has experienced. The telephone counsellors help the informal caregivers develop concrete changes in their own behaviour. When necessary, the counsellors suggest that the caregiver might wish to take advantage of support services in their area. In the second phone call, the behaviour changes proposed in the first phone call and their effects are discussed. The third phone call serves as a booster session and is made towards the end of the 6-month intervention phase. Jointly developed &#x0201c;homework&#x0201d; tasks are intended to support learning and to help caregivers work on their issues during the periods between the phone calls.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Measures</title><p id="Par64">The measures employed at the different measurement occasions are shown in Table <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>.<table-wrap id="Tab5"><label>Table 5</label><caption><p>Timeline of measurements</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12913_2017_2422_Tab5_HTML" id="MO3"/><table-wrap-foot><p>

The effects on the users&#x02019; informal caregivers who receive a brief telephone intervention are also investigated.</p><p id="Par100">Two conditions must be fulfilled to allow people with cognitive impairment to remain at home, which is desirable from both an economic perspective and the perspectives of the people with cognitive impairment and their caregivers. People with cognitive impairment need to sustain their cognitive capacities and their abilities to perform activities of daily living at as high a level as possible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Their informal caregivers need to learn how to deal with the situation in a helpful way so as to keep their physical and mental burden as low as possible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. This study addresses both of these conditions, first by providing an evaluated multimodal intervention for day-care centre users and second by supporting their caregivers through counselling that is oriented specifically towards caring for people with cognitive impairment.</p><p id="Par101">The day-care centres have the advantage that they are in a position to combine two helpful approaches. Time is freed up for the caregivers, and the people with cognitive impairment can be offered an effective, non-drug group treatment.</p><sec id="Sec27"><title>Strengths and limitations of the study design</title><p id="Par102">Strengths of the study design are the cluster randomisation, the long follow-up period of 2 years, the use of a manualised treatment that has already been evaluated in nursing homes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], the naturalistic setting in care institutions which are already part of the German health care system, and the focus on the dyad consisting of both the person with cognitive impairment and his/her informal caregiver.</p><p id="Par103">Moreover, due to the recruitment of day-care centres throughout Germany and the balanced ratio of urban to rural day-care centres run by a wide variety of organisations (local authorities, non-profit, and private), the external validity of the study is high. The naturalistic design &#x02013; in which the study has no influence on the number of days the people with cognitive impairment attend the day-care centres (days of treatment in the intervention group) &#x02013; also makes it possible to analyse subgroups in order to determine the necessary intensity of the treatment.</p><p id="Par104">We decided on cluster randomisation rather than randomisation on the participant level for two reasons. If two groups that are separate in terms of rooms and staff &#x02013; one treatment group and one control group &#x02013; were to take place at the same day-care centre, only a very few very large day-care centres would have the necessary capacity. These day-care centres are not representative of the general healthcare situation and would thus markedly reduce the external validity. In addition, implementing two study groups simultaneously in the same institution would be associated with a risk of halo effects by which the treatment might influence the control group.</p><p id="Par105">The possible disadvantage of a systematic difference between the arms of the study arising by chance from the cluster randomisation is offset both by the large number of 34 randomised day-care centres and by the stratification by region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>].</p><p id="Par106">Overall, it can be assumed that the control group consists of day-care centres that tend to be quite active and not only accept the extra work involved in the study but also receive the study-specific therapy 6 months after baseline. Differences between the groups will therefore tend to be under-estimated rather than over-estimated. Since the study requires extra work by the day-care centres, offering the treatment to the control group is necessary to motivate them to participate in the study in the first place. As the control group was also trained in the MAKS treatment after a delay of 6 months but did not get the supervision that the intervention group did, important hints for implementation can be drawn from the comparison between the two &#x0201c;intervention&#x0201d; phases, that is, between the regular, controlled intervention phase in the intervention group during the first 6 months and the less structured, independent implementation in the control group, which begins after 6 months of waiting.</p><p id="Par107">In order to be able to replicate and implement any treatment, a good manual is needed, particularly in the case of non-drug therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. For the MAKS therapy, in particular, this is ensured by the compilation of 125 structured days of therapy in the 6-month controlled intervention phase. For each day of the study, the contents of each of the four MAKS components are carried out as stated in the study manual by all day-care centres. A manual was also created for the intervention for the caregivers. This makes both treatments easy to implement because only one training is required, and thus the necessary personnel and space are usually present on site.</p><p id="Par108">One basic problem with non-drug therapies is the fact that they cannot usually be blinded. We try to protect the collection of the data on the primary outcomes for the day-care centre users as much as possible from a data collection bias. The trained testers are not allowed to be involved in the care of the day-care centre users and have to come from outside the centres to carry out their tasks.</p><p id="Par109">As far as we know, this is the first time that the effectiveness of an evaluated non-drug therapy has been tested in people with cognitive impairment (including some with diagnosed dementia) in combination with outreach counselling for their caregivers in a sample in a real healthcare environment.</p></sec></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ADL</term><def><p id="Par5">Activities of daily living</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BIZA-D</term><def><p id="Par6">Berlin Inventory of caregivers&#x02019; burden with dementia patients</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BSFC-s</term><def><p id="Par7">Burden Scale for Family Caregivers short</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CATI</term><def><p id="Par8">Computer-assisted telephone interview</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DeTaMAKS</term><def><p id="Par9">a cluster-randomised, controlled intervention study examining MAKS therapy for people with cognitive impairment in day-care centres</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EQ-5D-5L</term><def><p id="Par10">EuroQol five dimensions questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ETAM</term><def><p id="Par11">Erlangen test of activities of daily living in people with mild dementia or mild cognitive impairment</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FIMA</term><def><p id="Par12">Questionnaire for the use of medical and non-medical services in old age</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IADL</term><def><p id="Par13">Instrumental activities of daily living</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICF</term><def><p id="Par14">International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MAKS</term><def><p id="Par15">Multicomponent group therapy for people with cognitive impairment (motor stimulation, activities of daily living and cognitive stimulation in a social setting)</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MMSE</term><def><p id="Par16">Mini-mental state examination</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MoCA</term><def><p id="Par17">Montreal Cognitive Assessment</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NOSGER</term><def><p id="Par18">Nurses&#x02019; Observation Scale for Geriatric Patients</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NPI-Q</term><def><p id="Par19">Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RUD</term><def><p id="Par20">Resource Utilization in Dementia</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WHO-5</term><def><p id="Par21">Well-Being Index</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to extend our heartfelt thanks to the 34&#x000a0;day-care centres that cooperated with us in implementing the study and the 453 study participants and their caregivers who provided data.
