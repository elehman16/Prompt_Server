However, several large-scale studies, including the American Women&#x02019;s Health Initiative (WHI)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and the British Million Women Study (MWS),[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] have recently challenged this benefit/risk ratio by showing that women taking HRT have an increased risk of breast cancer (odds ratio = 1.25 in the WHI study). This has led to a large number of women discontinuing or not wanting to take HRT. In the US, the number of prescriptions for HRT, which was 91 million in 2001 (treating approximately 15 million women per year) prior to publication of the WHI study in 2002, fell to 56.9 million in 2003.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] In France, the WHI findings prompted the health authorities to carry out and publish the results of a public hearing on the place of HRT in the menopause.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] Faced with the increased risk of breast cancer with HRT, there has been new interest in non-hormonal treatments from medical bodies and from women themselves.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]</p><p>The development of non-hormonal treatments has evolved in two ways: first, toward existing drugs such as selective serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs/SNRIs) or antiepileptics such as gabapentin, which have been shown to have some benefits against hot flashes; and second, toward &#x02018;natural medicines&#x02019; ranging from phytotherapy to acupuncture, although the evidence base for such complementary therapies remains weak.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]</p><p>Homeopathic medicines have a place among these non-hormonal treatments, and several of them are indicated for the treatment of hot flashes, following their traditional use by homeopathic practitioners.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] The efficacy of these homeopathic medicines in the management of hot flashes has been described in large-scale observational studies.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] In France, the agent BRN-01 (Acth&#x000e9;ane&#x000ae;) is commercially available as a homeopathic combination for this indication.

Investigators were randomly selected from a French database of private gynecologists and were contacted by mail and telephone. The principal objective of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of BRN-01 versus placebo on the reduction of the hot flash score (HFS) in menopausal women. The study was authorized by a regional French ethics committee (Comit&#x000e9; de Protection des Personnes EST I) and by the French Medicine Agency (on February 19, 2010), and was conducted in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines. The study was registered with the EU Clinical Trials Register (EudraCT no.: 2009-016959-21).</p><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study Sample</title><p>Women going through the menopause were enrolled in the study if they were aged &#x02265;50 years; if they had experienced amenorrhea for &#x0003e;12 months; and if, during a routine gynecologic consultation, they had spontaneously complained of hot flashes that had started &#x0003c;2 years previously and had significant repercussions on their social and/or professional life of &#x02265;40 mm on a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) ranging from 0 to 100 mm, with a mean frequency of &#x02265;5 hot flashes per day during the 48 hours preceding study enrollment. Women were excluded if they were receiving or had ever received HRT; if they were receiving or had received (within 2 weeks prior to enrollment) &#x003b2;-alanine (Abuf&#x000e8;ne&#x000ae;), food supplements (phytoestrogens, etc.), vitamin E, or courses of acupuncture aimed at relieving hot flashes; or if they were receiving or had received (within 1 week prior to enrollment) other homeopathic treatments aimed at relieving hot flashes. Other exclusion criteria included menopause induced artificially by surgery, chemotherapy, or radiotherapy; hot flashes that could be iatrogenic in origin or could be caused by an associated pathology; receiving treatments that could reduce the frequency of hot flashes, such as antihypertensive treatment with clonidine, antidepressant treatment with SNRIs (venlafaxine), SSRIs (citalopram, paroxetine), mirtazapine (a noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant), or antiepileptic treatment with gabapentin; and a risk of not complying with the protocol. All patients were able to understand, read, and write French, were affiliated with a social security plan, and gave their written informed consent to participate in the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Study Treatments</title><p>The treatment evaluated in this study, BRN-01 (Acth&#x000e9;ane&#x000ae;, a homeopathic medicine registered in France for menopausal hot flashes and manufactured by Laboratoires Boiron, Sainte Foy-l&#x000e8;s-Lyon, France), was in the form of tablets consisting of dilutions of the following five homeopathic medications: <italic>Actaea racemosa</italic> (4 centesimal dilutions [4CH]), <italic>Arnica montana</italic> (4CH), <italic>Glonoinum</italic> (4CH), <italic>Lachesis mutus</italic> (5CH), and <italic>Sanguinaria canadensis</italic> (4CH). The placebo tablets were identical in appearance to the active tablets but included only saccharose (75%), lactose (24%), magnesium stearate E572 (1%), and purified water without any homeopathic dilutions. All treatments were in the same packaging. Laboratoires Boiron provided BRN-01, its matching placebo, and financial support for the study.</p><p>Randomization and allocation were carried out centrally by Laboratoires Boiron and generated using the random function of SAS (version 9.2) software. Patient allocation was equilibrated by blocks of six in that each investigator/center was allocated three active treatment units and three placebo treatment units assigned in a double-blind, randomized fashion. In practical terms, each center received a randomization list containing the numbers of six patients and the treatment they should receive, indicated by the letter &#x02018;A&#x02019; or &#x02018;B&#x02019;, and treatments were dispensed according to the randomization list. Laboratoires Boiron held the key to the randomization list in a sealed envelope, which was not opened until the end of the study. The key was used only after freezing of the database and finalization of the statistical analyses. Both treatments (BRN-01 and placebo) were dispensed by Laboratoires Boiron in strictly identical (primary and secondary) packaging.</p><p>Treatment was not started until the morning of the third day after enrollment in the trial, in order to allow collection of baseline data for the patients over the preceding 2 days, using a self-administered questionnaire. Treatment was then started for 12 weeks at a dose of 2 tablets per day (taken at least 15 minutes before or after food). Patients were informed that they had the possibility to increase intake to a maximum of 4 tablets per day as needed, depending on the severity of vasomotor symptoms &#x02013; for instance, when hot flashes were the most bothersome (in terms of the daily number, intensity, or duration).</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Primary Evaluation Criterion</title><p>The primary evaluation criterion was the effect of BRN-01 on the HFS, compared with placebo. The HFS was defined as the product of the daily frequency and intensity of all hot flashes experienced by the patient, graded by the women from 1 to 4 (1 = mild; 2 = moderate; 3 = strong; 4 = very strong). These data were recorded by the women on a self-administered questionnaire, assisted by a telephone call from a clinical research associate. Data were collected (i) during the first 2 days after enrollment and before any medication had been taken; (ii) then every Tuesday and Wednesday of each week until the 11th week of treatment, inclusive; and (iii) finally, every day of the 12th week of treatment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Secondary Evaluation Criteria</title><p>The secondary objectives were to evaluate variations between enrollment and after 12 weeks of treatment in (i) QoL, measured using the Hot Flash Related Daily Interference Scale (HFRDIS);[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] (ii) severity of symptoms, measured using the Menopause Rating Scale (MRS);[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] and (iii) the effect of hot flashes on the professional and personal life of the patients, measured using a VAS ranging from 0 to 100 mm. Compliance with treatment was measured using the Morisky-Green score, taken at the end of week 12. This score measures treatment adherence on a 4-item self-reported &#x02018;yes/no&#x02019; questionnaire: (i) Do you ever forget to take your medicine? (ii) Are you careless at times about taking your medicine? (iii) When you feel better, do you sometimes stop taking your medicine? (iv) Sometimes if you feel worse when you take the medicine, do you stop taking it? One point was scored for every affirmative answer, and compliance was graded as follows: 0 points = high adherence; 1&#x02013;2 points = intermediate, moderate adherence; 3&#x02013;4 points = low adherence or non-adherence.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Safety</title><p>All adverse events (AEs) occurring during the study were recorded, and their possible link to the study treatment was assessed.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>The statistical analysis was carried out on the intent-to-treat (ITT) population, defined as all patients who took at least one dose of the study treatment and had a least one post-enrollment evaluation. In the case of missing data, the analysis took into account the last evaluation available according to the last-observation-carried-forward (LOCF) technique. The safety analysis was carried out on all patients who took at least one dose of the study treatment.</p><p>The sample size for the primary outcome was calculated on the basis of data from previous hot flash studies, as described by Sloan et al.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] In these, data from the placebo arms showed differences in hot flash activity (between baseline and the end of the first treatment period) of a standard deviation (SD) of two hot flashes and 5 score units per patient per day. From this, it was shown that 50 patients per group provided 80% power to detect differences in average hot flash activity of 0.58 SDs, and that 50 patients per treatment arm provided 80% power to detect an average shift of 1.2 hot flashes per day or an HFS of 3 units per day.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] With this approach and our hypothesis that there would be a (clinically relevant) difference of 3 points in the HFS in favor of the active (BRN-01) arm and an SD of 5, sample size estimates were calculated using nQuery Advisor (version 6.01) software. We found that a sample size of 49 in each group was required to show this outcome with an &#x003b1; error rate of 5% in a unilateral situation and with a power of 90%.</p><p>Quantitative data are described as the number, mean, and SD. Qualitative data are described as the absolute and relative frequencies with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Comparisons of means were carried out by analysis of variance (ANOVA) or by using the Kruskal-Wallis test if the distribution was not normal. Comparisons of percentages were carried out using the &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test or Fisher&#x02019;s exact test if the conditions for use of the &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test were not fulfilled. Where appropriate, comparisons over time were performed using the Student&#x02019;s t-test. The evolution of the HFS in the two groups was assessed by analysis of the area under the curve (AUC) of the mean scores recorded weekly from each patient in each group over the duration of the study, including those at enrollment (before any treatment). From these data, the mean AUC for each group was calculated for each week (using the rectangular method, which draws non-overlapping rectangles down from the data points) and used as follows, where Sc is the score for any given week (ranging from 1 to 12):

Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used for comparisons adjusted for the baseline HFS between the two groups.</p><p>Secondary evaluation criteria were compared by ANOVA on series matched for two factors: time and treatment, and also their interaction. A comparison with baseline values was carried out using the Student&#x02019;s t-test. The percentage of patients who presented with at least one AE was compared between the two groups, using Fisher&#x02019;s exact test. The Morisky-Green score was compared between the two groups at the end of the 12 weeks of treatment, using the &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test, and the number of tablets remaining in the boxes returned by the patients (as a measure of treatment compliance) was compared using the Student&#x02019;s t-test.</p><p>All statistical analyses were carried out using SAS (version 9.2) software, with a level of statistical significance fixed at alpha = 0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Study Protocol</title><p>One hundred and eight patients were enrolled in this study between June 2010 and July 2011: 54 in each group (BRN-01 and placebo).

The characteristics of these women were also similar to those described in other studies of the management of menopausal hot flashes.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] We chose to carry out a comparison of the evolution of the HFS in the two groups, using AUC analyses. This allowed quantification of the evolution of hot flashes over the duration of the study rather than limited estimations, which are subject to important fluctuations from one day to another, and may be particularly relevant, as the prevalence of vasomotor symptoms in menopausal women varies according to the climate, diet, and way of life.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] In contrast to a comparison of limited daily values, the AUC method can provide an overall view of the evolution of individual patients&#x02019; symptoms over a given period. A similar approach is used in the research of pain,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] where sequential measurement is subject to similar fluctuations. Our results show that, in terms of the reduction in the HFS, the evolution of the HFS over the period of the study was significantly better in the BRN-01 group than in the placebo group.</p><p>The mean reduction in the HFS observed with BRN-01 was 56.7%, or around three-quarters of that obtained with HRT, described as being between 75% and 79% in a review of the Cochrane database.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] While the reported reductions in the frequency and intensity of hot flashes obtained with BRN-01 are less than those obtained with HRT, they are comparable to the reductions obtained with SSRIs and noradrenaline, evaluated at between 50% and 60% in a meta-analysis by Nelson et al.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] In this context, BRN-01 has a place in the therapeutic management of hot flashes in women who do not want or are unable to take HRT.</p><p>As demonstrated in the literature, the placebo effect is important in the treatment of hot flashes. In our study, the mean reduction in hot flashes with placebo was 46.4% (without adjustment for baseline values), which is less than the 57.7% reduction reported in the Cochrane database,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] but well within the range of 20&#x02212;50% established by Kelley and Carroll.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] The close similarity in the MRS results between BRN-01 and placebo in our study could be due to the fact that this scale includes clinical elements of menopausal symptoms that BRN-01 is not thought to act on.</p><p>This is the first randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the efficacy of BRN-01 to be performed. However, two observational studies have supported the use of homeopathic medicines in women experiencing menopausal hot flashes. In 2004, the National Health Service in Sheffield, UK, carried out an observational study in menopausal women who did not want or were unable to receive HRT. Homeopathic treatment was proposed. Among the 124 patients aged 53 years who were included in the study, 83 (67%) described an improvement in their vasomotor symptoms.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] In 2008, a prospective observational study was carried out by 99 doctors in eight countries to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of homeopathic treatments prescribed in daily practice for hot flashes and their impact on QoL of menopausal women. That study, carried out on 438 patients with a mean age of 55 years, showed decreases in the frequency and number of daily and nightly hot flashes (p &#x0003c; 0.001) between the enrollment visit and the follow-up visit 2-6 months later. Among those women, 19.4% reported the disappearance of their hot flashes and 70.3% felt an improvement from the first 15 days of treatment onward. They also described a decrease in their daily discomfort and sleep disturbances (p &#x0003c; 0.001).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] Most of the components found in the composition of BRN-01 were present in the different homeopathic treatments described in those studies, at different homeopathic dilutions: <italic>A. racemosa</italic>, <italic>A. montana</italic>, <italic>Glonoinum</italic>, <italic>L. mutus</italic>, and <italic>S. canadensis</italic>. <italic>L. mutus</italic> is traditionally used for its effects in vascular phenomena such as hot flashes, metrorrhagia, palpitations, and throbbing headaches; <italic>Glonoinum</italic> is traditionally used for its effects on hot flashes with redness of the face, palpitations, sweating, and congestive headaches; <italic>S. canadensis</italic> is used for its effects against hot flashes predominantly of the face, with blushing and congestive headaches with throbbing pain; <italic>A. racemosa</italic> is used in menstrual cycle dysfunction with pelvic heaviness, mastodynia, and sleep problems (as observed in the perimenopause); <italic>A. montana</italic> is used for its general action on the vascular system and in hemorrhagic manifestations such as metrorrhagia. In these observational studies, some degree of a placebo effect, as discussed earlier, must be considered. However, our results with BRN-01 (which contains these agents in combination) show a greater reduction in the activity of hot flashes compared with placebo, and suggest that BRN-01 is effective in reducing the severity of hot flashes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study shows that the homeopathic medicine BRN-01 had a greater effect than placebo on the frequency and intensity of hot flashes experienced over a 12-week period, as quantified by AUC analysis. The reductions in the HFS and other measures observed with BRN-01 were smaller than those reported for HRT or, to a lesser extent, antidepressant therapy. However, it remains that BRN-01 could be a new therapeutic option for climacteric syndrome, with an interesting benefit/risk profile, notably in women who do not want or are unable to receive HRT (because of a history of breast cancer, perimenopause, etc.) or other recognized treatments for this indication. Further investigations, which could include controlled and observational studies with BRN-01, would be welcome, to further validate these promising findings.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank all active investigators and patients for their participation in the study.
