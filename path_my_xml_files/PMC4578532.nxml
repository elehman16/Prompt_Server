Isoxsuprine relaxes the uterine smooth muscles and is used for treatment of pre-term labor and dysmenorrhea.

After arresting the contractions with intravenous magnesium sulfate, the patients were randomized into two groups, with the treatment group receiving oral isoxsuprine until 34 weeks of gestation. Response to treatment was assessed by the progression of the pregnancies in both groups.

In the United States, the incidence is one in every ten births accounting for about 75% of neonatal mortality unrelated to congenital malformations. Unfortunately, the incidence hasn&#x02019;t decreased during the past 40 years. Neonatal morbidity in pre-term labor is expected to decrease with early definite diagnosis and interventions in order to postpone the delivery, including corticosteroid administration and suitable perinatal care (<xref rid="b2-epj-07-1144" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Neonatal morbidity and mortality are affected significantly by gestational age and fetal maturity. Death and severe morbidity are associated with births before 26 weeks of gestation, and they occur almost universally in births before 24 weeks. Another important issue after survival is overcoming the physical and mental disabilities in extremely low birth-weight neonates (<xref rid="b3-epj-07-1144" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p></sec><sec><label>1.2.</label><title>Statement of problem</title><p>Many medications are used for preventing pre-term labor, but their effectiveness is not clearly known, and recent studies do not support some of the medications being used for this purpose (<xref rid="b4-epj-07-1144" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="b5-epj-07-1144" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Beta-agonists, such as ritodrin, terbulin, isoxsuprine, salbutamol, and phenotrol, have long been used in the prevention of pre-term labor with better neonatal outcomes, but further studies are needed for evaluating their efficacy and side effects (<xref rid="b5-epj-07-1144" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="b6-epj-07-1144" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>).</p><p>Beta-agonists act via beta 2-adrenergic receptors, and they increase intra-cellular cAMP in the myometrium and decrease myometrial contraction (<xref rid="b4-epj-07-1144" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Isoxsuprine (Vasodilan) is a beta-adrenergic that directly affects vascular smooth muscle and results in peripheral vascular dilation. Isoxsuprine relaxes the uterine smooth muscles and is used for treatment of pre-term labor and dysmenorrhea. It is absorbed in the gastrointestinal system and is excreted in urine. Its effect is seen within 10 minutes after intravascular use and one hour after oral administration. It is contraindicated in patients who have cardiovascular disease (especially arrhythmias), hyperthyroidism, chorioamnionitis, bleeding, and eclampsia or severe pre-eclampsia (<xref rid="b7-epj-07-1144" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Few studies have reported its efficacy and safety in pre-term labor (<xref rid="b8-epj-07-1144" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), but it is used extensively in hospitals and private clinics in Iran. This may be due to the easier accessibility of this agent in Iran and because the physicians are more familiar with its effects and side effects.</p></sec><sec sec-type="intro"><label>1.3.</label><title>Objectives</title><p>The general objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of isoxsuprine as a maintenance therapy in preventing pre-term labor.

Patients with a negative fern test and uterine contractions present at a frequency of four contractions every 20 minutes or eight contractions in 60 minutes, or dilatation of the cervix exceeding 1 cm or effacement equal to or more than 80% with the diagnosis of pre-term labor and intact membranes were included in the study (<xref rid="b1-epj-07-1144" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>).

Patients who didn&#x02019;t respond to the initial Ringer&#x02019;s solution and pethidine administration received 4 g of magnesium sulfate as a loading dose, which was continued at the rate of 1g/min and then intravenous infusion of 2 g/hr of magnesium sulfate for 12 hr after discontinuation of the contractions. Patients were excluded from the study if the contractions did not stop 2 hr after the administration of magnesium sulfate.

This study was designed to assess the efficacy of oral isoxsuprine as a maintenance therapy after acute pre-term labor was control by magnesium sulfate for the prevention of pre-term birth. This study showed that isoxsuprine is not effective in reducing pre-term births or increasing the delivery rate after 34 weeks of gestation. Although many studies have compared beta-agonists with no treatment or with other tocolytics, few studies have assessed isoxsuprine as a maintenance therapy for preventing pre-term labor. This agent is still widely used in Iran for maintenance therapy of pre-term labor.</p><p>Our findings provided evidence to physicians in Iran of the ineffectiveness of isoxsuprine as maintenance therapy for pre-term labor. Often, studies on the efficacy of beta-agonists in preventing pre-term births have focused on the acute phase of pre-term labor; however, in this study, we used this oral beta-agonist for maintenance therapy after acute pre-term labor was controlled. Previous studies on the efficacy of terbutalin for treatment of pre-term labor haven&#x02019;t found any significant difference in pregnancy outcomes between the terbutalin and placebo groups (<xref rid="b9-epj-07-1144" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="b10-epj-07-1144" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Our study had a smaller sample size than these studies, but we also did not find any significant difference in pregnancy outcomes between the two groups with or without the administration of beta-agonists. Raymajhi et al. showed that nifedipine was more effective in the treatment of pre-term labor than isoxsuprine (<xref rid="b11-epj-07-1144" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Researchers in this study reported that isoxsuprine was safe for treating acute pre-term labor and also as a maintenance therapy. Also, it was shown that prophylactic oral isoxsuprine does not lower the risk of pre-term labor in high-risk, single pregnancies (<xref rid="b12-epj-07-1144" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). As in our study, other studies have reported the safety of isoxsuprine in pregnant women (<xref rid="b13-epj-07-1144" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), but our results do not show that this beta-agonist is an effective treatment for pre-term labor. Studies on the treatment of acute-phase pre-term labor have shown that these drugs can postpone the delivery for 24 to 48 hr, but the difficulty in distinguishing between true and false labor may have biased their results.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><label>5.</label><title>Conclusions</title><p>Based on the results of our study, despite the safety, availability, and low price of isoxsuprine, we do not recommend its use as a maintenance therapy after stopping the acute phase of acute labor with magnesium sulfate. Larger studies are still needed to identify the best treatment for pre-term labor.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This article was extracted from a thesis prepared by Dr. Armaghan Faghihi to fulfill the requirements required in his residency course for earning his degree in obstetrics and gynecology.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Funding:</bold> This study was conducted with financial support provided by the Hormozgan University of Medical Sciences.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Clinical Trial Registration:</bold> The study is registered in the Iranian Clinical Trial Registry Center (IRCT201101115591N1).</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold></p><p>There is no conflict of interest to be declared.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions:</bold></p><p>All authors contributed to this project and article equally.
