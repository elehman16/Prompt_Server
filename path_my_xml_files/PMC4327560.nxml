Approximately 65% of patients present with unresectable or metastatic disease.<sup><xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Pancreatic NET may secrete bioactive peptide hormones.

Since the approval of streptozocin for pNET, an increasing number of treatment options have become available. Data are limited, however, regarding which treatment should be used as first-line therapy.

Adverse events reported in the classic study by Moertel et al<sup><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> include vomiting (experienced by approximately 80% of patients on streptozocin), stomatitis, diarrhea, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, nephrotoxicity (using creatinine elevation criteria), and renal insufficiency (reported by 4%&#x02013;7% of patients in all treatment groups). Modern supportive care can alleviate some, but not all, of these toxicities.</p><p>Although they have not been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration or the European Medicines Agency, temozolomide-based chemotherapies have also been explored in patients with pNET.<sup><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> In a retrospective series evaluating temozolomide-based therapy, Kulke et al<sup><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> reported a partial response rate of 34% (18/53 patients) for patients with pNET with the use of the RECIST criteria.<sup><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> In a recent phase II study by Chan et al,<sup><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> temozolomide in combination with bevacizumab demonstrated a response rate of 33% for pNET patients with the use of the RECIST criteria. Because the number of pNET patients (n = 15) was small and the study did not require radiographic progression of disease before study entry,<sup><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> it is not possible to directly compare the findings with those of RADIANT-3. The use of temozolomide as a single agent has not been prospectively evaluated in pNET, and it is unclear whether activity with temozolomide-based regimens in pNET is attributable to temozolomide alone or to the agent used in combination. Therefore, its use in patients with advanced pNET remains undefined until evidence from multicenter, randomized trials is available.<sup><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup></p><p>To date, it is impossible to directly compare results from chemotherapy studies with results from the targeted therapies because most of the studies with chemotherapy were retrospective and most did not use modern response criteria such as RECIST to report efficacy.<sup><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> The greatest advantage of recently approved targeted molecules, including everolimus and sunitinib, for the therapeutic management of advanced pNET is that they have been studied in large, prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trials before being entered into the treatment paradigm. In addition, the pivotal trials evaluating the efficacy of these agents used RECIST version 1.0 criteria, facilitating objective evaluation of efficacy of the targeted agents. The phase III study that reported the efficacy of the oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor sunitinib in patients with advanced pNET did not stratify patients according to prior chemotherapy use<sup><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>; therefore, it is not possible to compare efficacy between the 2 targeted therapies.</p><p>Given the lack of evidence-based guidance and the heterogeneous nature of the disease, an individualized approach to the treatment of patients with NET has been recommended.<sup><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> The use of chemotherapy in the first-line setting is limited according to the patient&#x02019;s clinical and pathological characteristics. Streptozocin-based chemotherapy is an appropriate choice as first-line therapy in patients with rapidly progressive disease, or with high tumor burden (in whom further progression may be life threatening), or in symptomatic patients, whereas the combination of etoposide-cisplatin is a preferred therapeutic option for patients with poorly differentiated pNET.<sup><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup></p><p>There is a strong need for evidence from robust, well-conducted, randomized, phase III studies to optimize the treatment paradigm of patients with well-differentiated, advanced (unresectable or metastatic) pNET. A phase III trial comparing everolimus versus streptozocin and crossover after progression or toxicity is planned (randomized, open-label study to compare the efficacy and safety of everolimus followed by chemotherapy with streptozocin&#x02013;5-fluorouracil upon progression or the reverse sequence in advanced progressive pNET [SEQTOR]; NCT02246127). In addition, smaller phase II studies are exploring chemotherapy and everolimus combination therapy in pNET with the use of recent RECIST criteria and modern safety reporting. These include an ongoing randomized, phase II study using capecitabine and streptozocin with or without cisplatin in patients with pNET (NCT00602082). Phase II studies evaluating temozolomide in patients with advanced pNET (with capecitabine and bevacizumab, NCT01525082; with everolimus, NCT00576680) and in patients with well or moderately differentiated, metastatic NET (with capecitabine, NCT00869050) are also underway. To our knowledge, no trials are exploring the position of sunitinib within the treatment paradigm of combinations of chemotherapy and targeted agents.</p><p>The results presented here, together with the results from RADIANT-1,<sup><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> confirm the efficacy of everolimus in the postchemotherapy setting and suggest that everolimus may also be efficacious as first-line therapy in patients with advanced pNET. In addition, everolimus has demonstrated long-term efficacy and tolerability. Some patients enrolled in RADIANT-3 have been treated with everolimus for more than 4 years but have stable disease and manageable AEs.<sup><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> Importantly, the safety of everolimus was consistent with previous reports, regardless of patient history of chemotherapy exposure.<sup><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup></p><p>Prospective stratification of RADIANT-3 contributed to the statistical robustness of the present analysis. A few limitations deserve mention. First, imbalance in terms of baseline characteristics across study groups (WHO performance status, prior SSA use, and time since initial diagnosis) could have confounded the study outcomes. Second, in the prior chemotherapy group, the type of chemotherapy received by patients varied; however, previously mentioned ongoing studies, such as SEQTOR, will clarify study results in terms of individual agents. Lastly, the RADIANT-3 study enrolled patients who demonstrated disease progression before study entry but did not mandate progression while they received chemotherapy. Therefore, the patients in the prior chemotherapy group might have had tumors sensitive to chemotherapy at the time of enrollment. Nevertheless, the efficacy of everolimus in patients who experienced disease progression while on chemotherapy has been demonstrated in the phase II RADIANT-1 study.<sup><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup></p><p>In conclusion, the selection of specific subgroups of patients who would best respond to chemotherapy or everolimus in first-line treatment is an ongoing challenge for the treatment of patients with pNET. The present RADIANT-3 subgroup analysis demonstrates that patients with pNET benefit from everolimus regardless of prior chemotherapy use and suggests the potential for first-line use of everolimus in patients with advanced pNET.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>The authors thank Jennifer M.
