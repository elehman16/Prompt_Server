The retraction of four incisors following canine retraction is accepted as a method to minimize the mesial movement of the posterior teeth, whereas en masse retraction of six anterior teeth may create anchorage problems.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>The conventional approach involved placing the rigid wires into brackets and ligating it using ligature wires or elastomeric ties during retraction phase. Many studies that had been carried out describing the various types of ligation and their role in friction had proved that the elastomeric ligation method produced more friction when compared to that of stainless steel (SS) ligation.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>Years of constant trial and clinical experimentation had led the orthodontic professionals to realize that the probable answer to efficient en masse retraction lies in an optimal bracket system (CB), one that could do away with the need to utilize conventional ligating methods. This view point laid the foundation for the emergence of self-ligating CB.</p><p>A resurgence in the popularity of self-ligation occurred in the 1990s, reflecting further refinement, with many self-ligating systems having since been patented. Active self-ligating appliances may allow better torque control with undersize arch wires than can be achieved with passive appliances; storage of potential energy in a spring clip may also enhance the potential for labiolingual alignment. The resistance to sliding is thought to be lower for passive appliances, however, which may improve the aligning capability of these systems.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>A newer advanced version, the interactive self-ligating brackets (SLBs) by American Orthodontics (AO), featured a familiar twin bracket in a low profile design, facilitating an easy transition to self-ligation. It had unique features that were unavailable with other brackets or system. Most importantly, it was very special due to its versatility. The interactive self-ligating system offered the benefits of less friction at the initial stages of treatment and more control in the later stages to assist with final torque and rotation. This advantage was unavailable with other SLBs, and often can be utilized to the benefit of the clinicians.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Thus, a clinical study was conducted to compare the clinical efficiency of the interactive brackets in the rate of space closure with that of the standard conventional brackets (CBs). Assessment of molar anchor loss and the movement of permanent incisors when using interactive systems and CBs constituted the second part of the clinical study. The null hypotheses of the study state that there is a significant difference regarding the clinical efficiency between conventional and interactive SLBs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>It was conducted on patients who reported to the Department of Orthodontics who were willing to undergo orthodontic treatment. Ethical approval for the study was obtained from the concerned University Scientific Committee. The study sample size comprised twenty patients.</p><p>Only adolescent and young patients between the age group of 18 and 25 years were selected for this study as the alveolar bone become denser with age and this could alter the rate of tooth movement. Sample size was determined using n-master software (version 1.0 CMC, Vellore, India) with the power of 80% and &#x003b1; error as 5% by which the sample size as 10 per group was derived.</p><p>All the patients were treated under the same protocol adopted by the institution with the following wire sequence, nickel titanium 0.016 inch, 0.016 &#x000d7; 0.022 inch, 0.017 &#x000d7; 0.025 inch, 0.019&#x000d7; 0.025 inch, and SS 0.019 &#x000d7; 0.025 inch in brackets with 0.022 &#x000d7; 0.028 inch slot.</p><p>The first group of CB system consisted of ten patients treated with conventional double width brackets (AO Master Series) tightly ligated with SS 0.009-inch ligatures. The second group of SLBs system consisted of ten patients treated with SLBs (AO Empower Interactive) of 0.022&#x0201d; slot with MBT prescription. To avoid any problem of standardization, the MBT prescription was selected in both the bracket system types. En masse space closure was done using an elastomeric module with SS 0.025-inch ligature wire tied from the first molar hook to the anterior soldered hook placed between the canine and lateral incisor in both the SLB and CB groups. Elastomeric modules were stretched twice the size (2&#x02013;3 mm) for delivering 250 g of force for retraction, measured using dontrix gauge. The activations were done on a monthly appointment basis.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>Patient's case notes were utilized to extract demographic information, treatment duration, appointments, and clinical information for inclusion and exclusion criteria. Pre- and post-treatment dental casts were assessed for treatment outcome variables.</p><p>The requirements for inclusion in this study were patients needing extraction of four first premolars, without transverse discrepancies, use of conventional first molar anchorage, and no previous history of orthodontic or orthognathic surgery.</p><p>Cases excluded were based on the lack of data required for our research and use of additional anchorage reinforcement (mini-implant, head gear, trans-palatal arch, lingual arch, intermaxillary elastics, pendulum, twin block, and Nance and any removable appliances during active treatment).</p><p>Two implants were placed distal to the first permanent molars palatally using intraoral periapical X-ray as a guide, on either side of the arch before placing the posted arch wire. Implants with a diameter of 1.3 mm and a length of 8 mm were positioned between the roots of the first molar and the second molar from the palatal aspect in the upper arch. It was placed before upgrading to 0.019 &#x000d7; 0.025 SS posted arch wire. These implants were used as stable markers during the study. According to a study by Liou <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] microimplants do not remain stationary when orthodontically loaded, it moves in some patients depending on the loading characteristics. Hence, these implants were not loaded during the study. Impressions were made with the implants in place and models were poured. Preretraction records consisting of models and photos were taken [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>].

The data represented in CBs were comparatively lesser than that of SLBs which indicated that there was more amount of retraction in the right side in SLBs when compared with that of conventional system. Krishnan <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] in their study stated that retraction is more on the left side of the patient when compared to that of the right side owing to the habitual mastication. The study by Singh and Shetty (1999)[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] also reinforced the concept of more movement of teeth on the side where the masticatory function was more. This could be attributed to the fact that the right-handed persons chew more on the right side [<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] leading to trampoline effect.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>There was no significant difference in the left side between the two groups. According to Fleming and O'Brien (2013),[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] there was a slight benefit with respect to the rate of space closure using SLB system when compared with the CB system which concurred with this study, i.e., rate of space closure was slightly faster in SLB system when compared with CB system.</p><p>In comparison of incisor movement at the end of 5 months between CB and SLB, there was a significant difference observed between the two groups. This indicated that there was a difference in the efficiency of incisor movement in SLB, i.e., interactive brackets. According to Chen <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] there was a good torque control and more bodily movement of incisors commencing from alignment to the retraction phase while using self-ligating system.</p><p>In comparison to the amount of anchor loss (mean indices and standard deviation) at the end of 5 months between CB and SLB, there was a significant difference in the right side between the two groups. The data indicated that there was more amount of anchor loss in the right side in CB than in the SLB. There was no significant difference in the left side between the two groups. There were many studies which stated that there was no significant difference of anchor loss between self-ligating and CB system, which was not concordant to this study.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p><p>According to Muguruma <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] SLBs produced less static friction when compared with CBs, which might lead to better anchorage control in SLB system, and Chen <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] stated that there was better anchorage control in interactive SLB system when compared with CB system, which concurred with the study, i.e., anchor loss was less in interactive SLB system when compared with CB system.
