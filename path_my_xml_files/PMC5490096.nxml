One of the peculiarities of neuroanesthesia is smooth emergence which is much as important as smooth induction to allow early neurological assessment.</p><p>Dexmedetomidine, an imidazole compound, is the pharmacologically active dextroisomer of medetomidine that displays selective dose-dependent &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptor agonist. Dexmedetomidine is a highly selective &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-agonist that has been shown to have sedative, analgesic, and anesthetic-sparing effects without significant respiratory depression.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] It acts at both spinal and supraspinal sites, modulates the transmission of nociceptive signals in the central nervous system. Even peripheral &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-adrenoreceptors may mediate nociception.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Numerous studies have shown that dexmedetomidine blunts the stress response, but these studies are mostly done in patients undergoing general or gynecological procedures,[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] studies pertaining to neurosurgical procedures are less. In addition, almost all studies have noted the effect of bolus dose of dexmedetomidine along with the infusion of the drug continuing after the bolus dose.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Hence, this study was undertaken to see the effect of dexmedetomidine infusion without giving its bolus dose on hemodynamics and its ability to act as anesthetic adjuvant in patients undergoing supratentorial tumor surgery.</p><p>The primary aim of this study was to compare the hemodynamics during laryngoscopy, intubation, skull pin application, in the perioperative period, and extubation in patients who received dexmedetomidine infusion with control group, and secondary aims were to compare the dose of thiopentone required for induction, intraoperative analgesic requirement and time to rescue analgesia, and postoperative sedation score.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>S<sc>UBJECTS AND</sc> M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><p>This prospective, randomized double-blind study was undertaken in fifty patients undergoing supratentorial tumor surgery in a tertiary care center from July 2013 to June 2014 after obtaining approval from the Institutional Review Board as well as written and informed consent from all the patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria of age between 20 and 65 years with a Glasgow Coma Scale score 14 or 15 and the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) I and II, scheduled for elective intracranial surgery under general anesthesia. The exclusion criteria were pregnant or nursing mothers, patients who were on antihypertensive medications, patients with preoperative heart rate (HR) &#x0003c;60 beats/min, morbidly obese patients, any cardiovascular disease, renal, or hepatic diseases.</p><p>Balanced randomization was done using random computer-generated table. Patients were divided into two groups: Group C patients received saline infusion during surgery and 4 &#x003bc;g/kg of fentanyl intravenously (i.v.) at induction and at the time of pin head application. Group D patients received continuous infusion of dexmedetomidine at rate of 0.4 &#x003bc;g/kg/h during surgery and 2 &#x003bc;g/kg of fentanyl i.v. at induction and at the time of pin head application. Both the teams were blinded to the drugs by supplying prefilled syringes with same volume of normal saline and dexmedetomidine in saline. In addition, two syringes (one to be given 3 min before induction and other to be given 3 min before the application of Mayfield three-pin head holder) each containing 2 &#x003bc;g/kg fentanyl diluted into a volume of 10 ml were prepared for those patients who received dexmedetomidine. Similarly, two syringes each containing 4 &#x003bc;g/kg fentanyl diluted into a volume of 10 ml were prepared for those patients who received the normal saline infusion.</p><p>When the patient arrived in the operating room, a large bore i.v. catheter was inserted for drug and fluid administration. Baseline recordings of systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), HR, and oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) were taken. The study drug infusion was commenced approximately 20 min before the induction of anesthesia. During the infusion, SBP, DBP, MAP, HR, and SpO<sub>2</sub> were recorded at every 5 min interval.</p><p>The patients received injection glycopyrrolate as premedication 0.2 mg i.v. The patients randomized to Group C received injection fentanyl 4 &#x003bc;g/kg i.v. and those randomized to the Group D received injection fentanyl 2 &#x003bc;g/kg i.v. in a double-blind manner 3 min before induction. Then, the patients were induced using thiopentone. Thiopental 25 mg/ml was injected at the rate of 10 ml/min until the loss of eye lash reflex. The dose of thiopental was recorded. Vecuronium in the dose of 0.1 mg/kg i.v. was used to provide neuromuscular blockade, and the patients were ventilated by mask for 4 min using 100% oxygen. Thirty seconds before laryngoscopy, the patients were given additional 50 mg of thiopental. During the induction period SBP, DBP, MAP, HR, and SpO<sub>2</sub> were recorded at 3 min intervals until 9 min after intubation. Again 3 min before pin head application, Group C received injection fentanyl 4 &#x003bc;g/kg i.v. and Group D received injection fentanyl 2 &#x003bc;g/kg i.v. in a double-blind manner. At the time of pin head application SBP, DBP, MAP, HR, SpO<sub>2,</sub> and end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> (EtCO<sub>2</sub>) were noted and then after every 3 min till 9 min and then at time of craniotomy and at every 30 min thereafter. EtCO<sub>2</sub> was recorded immediately after intubation and at regular interval thereafter.</p><p>After intubation, controlled mechanical ventilation was done to maintain EtCO<sub>2</sub> between 30 and 35 mmHg. A urinary catheter was inserted for monitoring of urinary output. Thereafter, 1 g/kg of mannitol was administered i.v. Anesthesia was maintained with nitrous oxide and oxygen (60%:40%), isoflurane (gradually increased to 1% concentration). Neuromuscular block was maintained with 0.02 mg/kg i.v. boluses of vecuronium. Bolus doses of injection fentanyl 1 &#x003bc;g/kg were given if HR and MAP &#x0003e;20% of baseline. If still, the hypertension was persisting injection labetalol was given in 10 mg increments titrating to HR &#x0003e;60/min. Atropine (0.6 mg i.v.) was given in case HR decreased below 50/min. Mephentermine (6 mg i.v.) was given in case when SBP &#x0003c;90 mmHg or DBP &#x0003c;50 mmHg.</p><p>The numbers of interventions occurring when hemodynamic variables were outside the predetermined window were recorded. Isoflurane administration and the study drug infusion were discontinued at the time of skin closure.</p><p>At the end of surgery, the neuromuscular block was antagonized with i.v. neostigmine (0.05 mg/kg) and glycopyrrolate (0.2 mg/mg of neostigmine). Nitrous oxide was discontinued after skin closure. The patient was extubated when patient's respiration was adequate and neuromuscular block was reversed, and the patient was able to follow simple commands. Again SBP, DBP, MAP, HR, and SpO<sub>2</sub> were recorded from the time of suctioning until 9 min after extubation at interval of 3 min.</p><p>The pain was assessed on a 10 point visual analog score immediately after surgery then at 15, 30, 60, and 90 min. At any time when the score was 5, the patient was given rescue analgesic in the form of diclofenac (2 mg/kg i.v.) and if still not relieved tramadol (2 mg/kg i.v.) was given. Time of giving rescue analgesic was noted.</p><p>Patient's sedation was assessed by the Ramsay Sedation Score [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>] after extubation and at 30 min, 1 h, and 2 h later. Scoring was stopped when the patient had a sedation score of 1 or 2.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Ramsay sedation score</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AER-11-309-g001"/></table-wrap><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The statistical analysis was done using Statistical Package for Social Sciences, version 15.0 (IBM, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India) statistical analysis software.

In the present study, none of the patients in Group D required antihypertensive medication, but in Group C 4 (16%) patients needed intraoperative labetalol.</p><table-wrap id="T3" position="float"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Complications in study population</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AER-11-309-g005"/></table-wrap><p>Time to extubation was found to be significantly higher in Group C (8.60 &#x000b1; 1.61 min) as compared to Group D (5.32 &#x000b1; 1.46 min) (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001).

In control group, it was observed that at the time of intubation and pin head application rise in HR and MAP from baseline were not significant, but these values were found to be significant at the time of extubation. Gurulingappa <italic>et al</italic>. also observed that fentanyl in a dose of 4 &#x003bc;g/kg before intubation provides the similar results.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Although studying the effect of fentanyl was not the aim of the study but it became apparent in the results. The dose of fentanyl in control group was twice that in dexmedetomidine group as giving ineffective analgesia to the patients would be unethical.</p><p>In our study, it was also observed that infusion of dexmedetomidine reduces the amount of thiopentone required for induction. Yildiz <italic>et al</italic>., Basar <italic>et al</italic>., and Keniya <italic>et al</italic>. also observed the same.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Dexmedetomidine is the drug with opioid-sparing effect, and it has been observed in various studies in humans.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] It was also evident in our study as only a few patients required intraoperatively supplementation with fentanyl and time to rescue analgesia was also delayed in Group D.</p><p>The most frequently observed adverse events in patients receiving dexmedetomidine for the Intensive Care Unit sedation include hypotension, hypertension, bradycardia, atrial fibrillation, and hypoxia.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Usually, the bolus dose is associated with such complications,[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] so in our study, we used continuous infusion only, and we have observed that continuous infusion without giving bolus dose is also effective in attenuating the stress responses during surgery. In the previous studies in which both bolus with continuous infusion was used the incidence of bradycardia was 5&#x02013;10% and of hypotension was 20&#x02013;40%,[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and in our study, the incidence of bradycardia was 8%, and hypotension was 20% which is comparable. Hence, further studies can be done to compare dexmedetomidine infusion with dexmedetomidine bolus plus infusion.</p><p>One of the main goals after craniotomy is rapid awakening from anesthesia to allow neurosurgical assessment of the patient and early detection of cerebral complication. Dexmedetomidine is the drug which has been studied for awake craniotomy, and it has been found that use of dexmedetomidine infusion is associated with shorter arousal time as compared to propofol without causing any respiratory depression.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Ilhan <italic>et al</italic>. and Tanskanen <italic>et al</italic>. also observed that the dexmedetomidine infusion results in faster recovery after general anesthesia without causing any respiratory depression.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Similar to these studies, we also reported that mean time to extubation was less in Group D as compared to Group C. This indicates that dexmedetomidine does not cause significant respiratory depression and also patient remain alert and conscious after stopping infusion and so, neurologic assessment can be done early.</p><p>However, there are certain limitations of our study, the depth of anesthesia could not be measured. Bispectral index (BIS) technique itself has some technical problems in intracranial surgery such as after scalp elevation; the montage system loses brain contact resulting in poor signal transference.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] In addition, the sympathetic response to lighter plane of anesthesia (increased HR and blood pressure) are masked by continuous dexmedetomidine infusion. Another major drawback was that the effect of dexmedetomidine on cerebral perfusion and intracranial pressure was not studied. Neuroprotective effect of dexmedetomidine is controversial. Some studies have favored the neuroprotective effect after cerebral ischemia by reducing the sympathetic outflow, thus decreasing the systemic catecholamine levels.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] On the other hand, few have observed its direct vasoconstrictor action which overcomes the cerebral autoregulation.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] In our study, we cannot comment on neuroprotective or detrimental effect of dexmedetomidine. Further studies need to be done to observe if any neuroprotection is provided by dexmedetomidine.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSION</sc></title><p>Thus, it can be
