There is little evidence about effective ways to increase adherence to physical activity. Therefore, interventions are needed that produce sustained increases in adherence to physical activity and are cost-effective. The purpose is to assess the effectiveness of a primary care physical activity intervention in increasing adherence to physical activity in the general population seen in primary care.</p></sec><sec><title>Method and design</title><p>Randomized controlled trial with systematic random sampling. A total of 424 subjects of both sexes will participate; all will be over the age of 18 with a low level of physical activity (according to the <italic>International Physical Activity Questionnaire</italic>, IPAQ), self-employed and from 9 Primary Healthcare Centres (PHC). They will volunteer to participate in a physical activity programme during 3 months (24 sessions; 2 sessions a week, 60 minutes per session).</p><p>Participants from each PHC will be randomly allocated to an intervention (IG) and control group (CG). The following parameters will be assessed pre and post intervention in both groups: (1) health-related quality of life (SF-12), (2) physical activity stage of change (Prochaska's stages of change), (3) level of physical activity (IPAQ-short version), (4) change in perception of health (vignettes from the <italic>Cooperative World Organization of National Colleges, Academies, and Academic Associations of Family Physicians</italic>, COOP/WONCA), (5) level of social support for the physical activity practice (<italic>Social Support for Physical Activity Scale</italic>, SSPAS), and (6) control based on analysis (HDL, LDL and glycated haemoglobin).</p><p>Participants' frequency of visits to the PHC will be registered over the six months before and after the programme. There will be a follow up in a face to face interview three, six and twelve months after the programme, with the reduced version of IPAQ, SF-12, SSPAS, and Prochaska's stages.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The pilot study showed the effectiveness of an enhanced low-cost, evidence-based intervention in increased physical activity and improved social support. If successful in demonstrating long-term improvements, this randomised controlled trial will be the first sustainable physical activity intervention based in primary care in our country to demonstrate long-term adherence to physical activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>A service of the U.S. National Institutes of Health.

The regular practice of physical activity (PA) has a positive effect in reducing obesity and preventing cardiovascular pathologies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], reducing the risk of stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], reducing the deterioration of the pulmonary function and the risk of suffering EPOX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], prevents diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], increases HDL cholesterol and decreases triglycerides and total cholesterol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. It is also important in preventing falls in the elderly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], generates a sensation of well-being, reduces anxiety and symptoms of depression, increases self-esteem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], and improves the perception of quality of life related to health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has published a report in which physical inactivity is cited as one of the principle risk factors in the development of chronic illness and cause of death, especially in industrialised countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Even so, only 18% of the European population claims to practice moderate physical activity on a daily basis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. According to the National Health Survey of 2001, 46.6% of the Spanish population over the age of 15 does not exercise in their free time and only 8.5% exercise on a regular basis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Furthermore, data from the Catalan Health Survey of 2006 indicate that less than 48% of the Catalan population exercises sufficiently to improve their health, a percentage which has increased since the surveys of 1994 and 2002 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The virtual absence of a public health practice infrastructure for the promotion of PA at a local level presents a critical challenge to control policy for chronic disease, particularly obesity. Translating the increasing evidence of the value of PA into practice will require systemic, multilevel, and multisectorial intervention approaches that build individual capability and organisational capacity for behaviour change, create new social norms, and promote policy and environmental changes that support higher levels of energy expenditure across the population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>In 2005, the Spanish Ministry for Health and Consumption designed the Strategy for Nutrition, Physical Activity and Prevention of Obesity (NAOS) with the aim of promoting a healthy lifestyle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. To the same end, in Catalonia, the Department of Health of the Catalan Government launched an integrated plan for the Promotion of Health through Physical Activity and Healthy Diet (PAAS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>Within this plan, encouraging PA promotion in PHC is outlined as a priority [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], as in Spain the high proportion of inactive primary care patients (at least 70%) justifies the need to develop a targeted strategy for physical activity promotion in general practices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. There is contradictory evidence about the effectiveness of including the usual advice on the practice of regular physical activity in the consulting rooms of PHC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], and it is not certain if it is even applicable in our country [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>In Catalonia, Puig-Ribera, McKenna and Riddoch (2005) indicated that medical recommendations for physical activity were limited, basically due to lack of time, unfavourable working conditions in healthcare centres and lack of knowledge on the part of the healthcare professionals, making it clear that the task of promoting physical activity was not seen as effective; concluding with the importance of establishing working protocols for consultants to integrate the promotion of physical activity in their work on a daily basis in the clinical practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>Several types of intervention for the promotion of PA in Primary Care have been reported. It has been demonstrated that those which combine written instructions, an exercise programme and strategies to change behaviour, and which are accompanied by several training sessions, are more effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Thus it appears that the highest success rate is seen in those interventions which are not limited to professional advice given at the PHC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. In the same way a systematic review concluded that advice in routine primary care consultations was not an effective strategy means of producing sustained increases in physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><p>Various authors have indicated the importance of referring patients to professionals specialised in the design of healthy exercise programmes outside the healthcare environment, making use of the local resources available in each area as a strategy for effective integration of the promotion of exercise in Primary Care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. In this context, a recent systematic review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] assessed whether exercise-referral schemes were effective in improving exercise participation in sedentary adults. These schemes showed a small effect on increasing physical activity in sedentary people, partly due to poor rates of uptake and adherence to the exercise schemes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Therefore, further studies are required to find strategies to increase long-term adherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] by addressing the participation barriers such as lack of social support, intimidating environments to practice a regular physical activity and inadequate supervision [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p><p>A systematic review of interventions based on the promotion of walking found only two studies in which there was a significant increase in the time spent walking and which improved the clinical risk indicators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Finally, a Cochrane review (2005) showed moderate but positive utility regarding the interventions based on self informed physical activity, such as the effect on the cardio respiratory state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. The effect of the interventions in achieving a predetermined threshold of physical activity was not significant with an odds ratio of 1.30 (Confidence interval 95%: 0.87 to 1.95) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. In better quality studies, exercise was self directed with some professional guidance and with constant professional support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><p>In 2006, Gin&#x000e9;-Garriga and Martin developed a pilot study in Barcelona (with a control group) of the Programme for the Promotion of Physical Activity in the PHC in which they offered patients the possibility of participating for a three month period in an exercise programme carried out in their own healthcare centre [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Patients were recruited in the healthcare centres, and physical activity specialists designed programmes which were specifically aimed at the patients' needs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. The sessions were carried out together with nurses and physical therapists from the centre. The programme was carried out in the centre itself, making use of nearby outdoor public spaces in order to offer the patients convenient and familiar surroundings. During the last sessions of the programme all the participants were given information about the nearest municipal facilities and the activities offered, and a visit to these facilities was organized. Thus, the programme acted as a means for incorporating participants in local facilities once they had experienced the benefits of doing regular exercise and at the same time used behavioural strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], accompanied by people from the same neighbourhood with similar needs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p><p>In order to achieve this objective, establishing a link between the PHC and the central offices of the various municipal districts was considered essential, as was contact with local sports centres, civic centres and other health centres, in order to facilitate the incorporation of the patient in a programme or exercise session, either individual or group, outside the environment of the healthcare centre. Facilitating access to the existing local resources in the area would contribute considerably to the continuity of the initiatives and programmes being developed by Primary Care. Furthermore, it would encourage a greater number of citizens to establish a common protocol of action [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Method and design</title><sec><title>Aim</title><p>This randomised controlled trial was designed to assess the effectiveness of a primary care physical activity intervention, which considered community strategies coordinated with municipal resources and the incorporation of various professional disciplines, in increasing adherence to physical activity in the general population seen in primary care.</p></sec><sec><title>Study population</title><p>Inclusion criteria will include (a) adult patients (over the age of 18) of both sexes who will be seen at the PHC for whatever reason; (b) with a low level of physical activity as established by the shortened version of the questionnaire <italic>International Physical Activity Questionnaire </italic>(IPAQ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]; (c) with a diagnosed chronic pathology; (d) who will be willing to participate in an exercise programme; and (e) who will have minimum physical aptitudes to follow the programme (being able to walk and stand up from a chair independently).</p><p>Exclusion criteria will be based on certain medical conditions which could result in unwanted effects in older adults, such as the presence of unstable angina, uncontrolled congestive heart failure, unstable arrhythmia or heart valve disease, progressive or debilitating medical conditions, and severe hypertension (systolic &#x02265; 200, or diastolic &#x02265; 120) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].</p><p>Written informed consent will be obtained from all subjects of both intervention (IG) and control group (CG). This trial was approved by the Clinical Investigation Ethics Committee of the IDIAP Jordi Gol, located in Barcelona.</p></sec><sec><title>Recruitment process</title><p>Recruitment will take place in 9 PHC in different regions of Catalonia during the first three months of 2009. Until August 2008, 63 PHC in Catalonia were informed and the trial has been presented to the 54 centres which showed interest in participating. Of these, the first nine centres which volunteered to participate will undergo the trial. Two health professionals, who were selected on a voluntary basis from each of the participating centres, were trained. During the recruitment period, the opportunity to participate in the study will be offered daily to all patients with a chronic pathology, who by systematic random sampling will be previously identified in the doctors' lists: a total of 50 subjects per centre will be recruited. The patients who meet the inclusion criteria and agree to participate will be contacted to inform them about how the project will be carried out. A record of demographic and health data, as well as attendance at the sessions, will be kept of those who agree to participate in the intervention.

All the subjects who meet the inclusion criteria must sign a consent form, carry out an initial evaluation and following this they will be randomly selected to form part of the IG or the CG. Random sequence generation will be computer-generated by an independent researcher, guaranteeing that the allocation groups remain confidential.</p></sec><sec><title>Control group</title><p>Subjects assigned to the control group will be asked to continue their routine daily activities and will receive their usual care from their primary care practice. They will be given information and requested to give their informed consent.

As is indicated by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) Clinical Guideline, local strategies which coordinate municipal resources with PHC are needed in order to promote physical exercise, especially in vulnerable groups. At the same time, the incorporation of professionals from different disciplines should be considered in order to increase the practice of long term physical exercise (grade of evidence C) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>].</p><p>It should be considered that the evidence is still insufficient in key areas and it is necessary to broaden the investigation in the following: (a) evaluating whether an intervention based on practical exercise sessions along with written material provided by PHC is more effective than the usual advice given, in increasing levels of physical activity in the short, medium and long term, as well as evaluating the attitude of the population towards regular exercise; (b) evaluating whether an intervention which includes community strategies which coordinate municipal resources with those of the primary healthcare centre, and also consider involving professionals from various disciplines, is effective in increasing the levels of physical exercise in the general population; and (c) evaluating the effect that current intervention with social support has in the short, medium and long term in maintaining physical exercise, using the Social Support for Physical Activity Scale (SSPAS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>].</p><p>High demand is one of the current problems facing primary healthcare in our country. In a study carried out in Sweden, it was concluded that encouraging exercise from primary healthcare is cost effective in terms of reducing the utilisation of healthcare resources, the number of admissions to hospital and visits to healthcare centres, especially when the intervention is addressed to elderly people with more than one cardio-vascular risk factor (sedentary lifestyle, hypertension, diabetes, obesity, among others) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>].</p><p>A recent systematic review of exercise-referral schemes showed only a small effect on increasing physical activity in sedentary people partly due to poor rates of uptake and adherence to the exercise schemes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. The design of the current study (PPAF) uses the advantage of direct contact and accessibility to primary healthcare with patients. Twenty-four sessions are carried out by a specialist in physical exercise in the same primary healthcare centre where the individuals are listed, taking advantage of patient familiarity with the space, and in conjunction with a group of people from the same neighbourhood and with similar characteristics. Upon finalising the intervention, all participants will be offered access to the most appropriate resources in the district after a programmed appointment.</p><p>To ensure the quality of this randomised clinical trial the guide developed by the CONSORT statement (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>] has been followed.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>All authors contributed to the study design and development of the trial protocol.
