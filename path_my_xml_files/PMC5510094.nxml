study designs because the results it generates, have minimum bias and avoids confounders
by virtue of the randomization and blinding technique which it employs. It has the
potential to generate a Level B evidence on its own or even a Level A evidence when a
pooled meta-analysis or a systematic review of several RCTs is conducted. The results a
RCT generates occupy the top of hierarchy of evidence and if the trial is a large
multicenter placebo controlled double blind one, people will have a hard time critically
appraising it as it&#x02019;s; statistically speaking, the strongest possible study
design.</p><p>The inception of RCT dates back to World War II when in an effort to impose an objective
and scientific discipline onto the extraordinary postwar expansion of medical research,
the components of the double-blind RCT were adopted and coalesced together for the first
time.<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> These included blind assessment
(usually meaning a placebo control), random assignment to comparable groups, and
inferential statistics as a surrogate for determinism.<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Back then, Placebo was not considered to offer much help in bringing a
measureable change in objectively recordable outcome variables or in improving
patient&#x02019;s health in general. On the contrary, Physicians used it routinely in
their practice as for example; in 1807, Thomas Jefferson (1743&#x02013;1826) penned a
description of what he called the &#x0201c;pious fraud&#x0201d; and noted that,
&#x0201c;one of the most successful physicians I have ever known has assured me that he
used more bread pills, drops of colored water, and powders of hickory ashes, than of all
other medicines put together&#x0201d;.<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p><p>It was not until late 1955 that for the first time someone elucidated that placebo could
have healing potential with Henry K. Beecher publishing his most famous work &#x0201c;The
Powerful Placebo&#x0201d;<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> in JAMA highlighting
this mysterious powerful force never described before. It was soon to become the
standard control group of the randomised controlled trial. Instead of an inert sham
given to individual patients, the placebo became the emblem for all the healing
occurring in the disguised &#x0201c;no- treatment&#x0201d; arm of an RCT. The
&#x0201c;placebo effect&#x0201d; encompassed all &#x0201c;nonspecific effects&#x0201d; that
did not depend on the treatment in the active arm. The &#x0201c;powerful placebo&#x0201d;
became a hodge-podge of nonlinear, difficult to quantify, remnants collected under the
rubric of the dummy control of an RCT. Anything that threatened the fastidious detection
of a predictable cause and effect outcome was conveniently disposed of in a repository
labelled the &#x0201c;placebo effect&#x0201d;. This new concept of placebo was much larger
both in meaning and power than its predecessor.<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p><p>Soon Randomized controlled trial became the standard of medical research and placebo
became its integral component. Any new drug which came into the market had to undergo
rigorous experimentation under the umbrella of randomised controlled trial and the drug
had to perform better than the placebo arm in order to be considered significantly
efficacious.</p><p>Though Beecher gave us a very rigorous way of experimentation but all his work was
backed by an audacious yet simple assumption which the medical community ignored
altogether. The rationale behind this was the &#x02018;additive&#x02019; model which was
first described by Beecher in his influential explicit assumption of an additive
relation between placebo and drug effects<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
&#x02018;The placebo effect of active drugs is masked by their active effects&#x02026; The
total &#x02018;drug&#x02019; effect is equal to its &#x02018;active&#x02019; effect plus its
placebo effect&#x02019; (quotes in the original).<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> It assumes that the placebo effect is constant and additive in nature. The
improvement seen in the experimental arm of RCT is simple summation of that seen in the
placebo control arm and the improvement caused by the intervention itself. This
assumption is a big one yet randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials
continue to be considered as the gold standard to demonstrate the clinical efficacy of
any drug or intervention.</p><p>Time and time again, numerous studies have shown that the model of additivity
doesn&#x02019;t necessarily holds true. Placebo effects are not supposed to be a constant
phenomenon rather they depend on various neurobiological, genetic and epigenetic factors
and hence vary from person to person. Moreover placebo can&#x02019;t be attributed to the
dummy pill alone rather it&#x02019;s a collective healing effect which results from
empathy, doctor-patient interaction and the ritual of medicine itself. Medicine has
traditionally used placebos as a tool to challenge, debunk, and discard ineffective and
harmful treatments. But placebo effects are another story; they are not bogus<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> rather placebo is a complex neurobiological
phenomenon and hence the assumption made by beecher model of additivity is way too
simplistic. Given that the evaluation of drug treatments in RCTs is based on the
assumption of additivity, its violation has far-reaching consequences. Therefore there
is a need for novel study designs enabling researchers to consider the complex interplay
of drug-specific and unspecific effects as noted recently by Kube et al.<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Lilienfeld</surname><given-names>AM</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Ceteris paribus: the evolution of the clinical trial</article-title><source>Bull Hist Med</source><year>1982</year><volume>56</volume><issue>1</issue><fpage>1</fpage><lpage>18</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">7046852</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Kaptchuk</surname><given-names>TJ</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Intentional ignorance: a history of blind assessment in
