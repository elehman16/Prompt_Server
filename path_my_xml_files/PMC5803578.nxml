Formal education in biostatistics and research methodology during residency training is lacking. In this pilot study, we addressed these issues by evaluating a novel method of teaching residents about biostatistics and research methodology using peer review of standardized manuscripts. We hypothesized that mentored peer review would improve resident knowledge and perception of these concepts more than non-mentored peer review, while improving review quality.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">A partially blinded, randomized, controlled multi-center study was performed. Seventy-eight neurology residents from nine US neurology programs were randomized to receive mentoring from a local faculty member or not. Within a year, residents reviewed a baseline manuscript and four subsequent manuscripts, all with introduced errors designed to teach fundamental review concepts. In the mentored group, mentors discussed completed reviews with residents. Primary outcome measure was change in knowledge score between pre- and post-tests, measuring epidemiology and biostatistics knowledge. Secondary outcome measures included level of confidence in the use and interpretation of statistical concepts before and after intervention, and RQI score for baseline and final manuscripts.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Sixty-four residents (82%) completed initial review with gradual decline in completion on subsequent reviews. Change in primary outcome, the difference between pre- and post-test knowledge scores, did not differ between mentored (&#x02212;8.5%) and non-mentored (&#x02212;13.9%) residents (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.48). Significant differences in secondary outcomes (using 5-point Likert scale, 5 = strongly agree) included mentored residents reporting enhanced understanding of research methodology (3.69 vs 2.61; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.001), understanding of manuscripts (3.73 vs 2.87; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.006), and application of study results to clinical practice (3.65 vs 2.78; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.005) compared to non-mentored residents. There was no difference between groups in level of interest in peer review (3.00 vs 3.09; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.72) or the quality of manuscript review assessed by the Review Quality Instrument (RQI) (3.25 vs 3.06; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.50).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">We used mentored peer review of standardized manuscripts to teach biostatistics and research methodology and introduce the peer review process to residents.

Through the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) Consortium of Neurology Program Directors, we sent an e-mail invitation to Program Directors of ACGME-accredited adult neurology residency programs in the USA to participate. Participation interest was high with 38 sites expressing preliminary interest. Nine sites were chosen based on the size of residency program (to maximize the number of resident participants) and the sites at which study investigators were affiliated. Study sites included the Montefiore Medical Center, Albert Einstein College of Medicine; Baylor College of Medicine; Brigham and Women&#x02019;s Hospital and Massachusetts General Hospital (Partners); Cleveland Clinic; Columbia University; Oregon Health &#x00026; Science University; University of Michigan; University of Pennsylvania; and Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center. We recruited adult neurology residents in their post-graduate years (PGY) 3 and 4 from the nine chosen study sites. Volunteer mentors were recruited locally from existing faculty at each site. An outline of the curriculum and brief guidelines were provided to each faculty mentor.

The RQI assesses whether reviews cover major important points in a research article using a 5-point Likert scale, including importance of the research question, originality, strengths and weaknesses, and interpretation. It also assesses whether the reviewer made comments on organization and writing, referenced examples within the paper, and provided constructive criticism. The first seven questions of the RQI encompass each of these points, while the eighth question assesses the overall review quality.</p><p id="Par18">The RQI was used by two of the study authors (VSSW, MSVE) to assess review quality of manuscript 1 (baseline measure) and manuscript 5 (post-intervention assessment); study authors were blinded to group and identity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Outcome measures</title><p id="Par19">The primary outcome measure was the change in knowledge between the pre-test and the post-test performed after review of all manuscripts. Secondary outcome measures included level of confidence in the use and interpretation of statistical concepts before and after the intervention, as well as the RQI score for the baseline (manuscript 1) and final (manuscript 5) manuscripts. Both manuscript 1 and manuscript 5 were randomized controlled trials, allowing for comparison of review quality.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="Par20">Demographics and educational experiences at enrollment were compared using chi-square tests for categorical measures and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests for continuous measures. Results were summarized as means (&#x000b1; standard deviation) and proportions (%) as appropriate. Primary and secondary outcome measure scores were compared using ANCOVA or Wilcoxon rank-sum tests as appropriate for the two groups (with and without mentorship). For the primary outcome of the change in knowledge based on pre- and post-test scores, the change was calculated only among those with both tests completed and compared accounting for pre-test scores. We also tested whether pre-test score was dependent on missing the post-test using logistic regression with indication of missingness (1 for post-test not done and 0 for post-test done) as a dependent variable and pre-test as an independent variable. For other outcomes, we analyzed all available data. The average score of two reviewers was used for the RQI outcome. The inter-rater reliability of the RQI between the two reviewers was tested using the intra-rater correlation coefficient (ICC). Software used for analysis was SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec13" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p id="Par21">A total of 78 residents from 9 neurology programs were enrolled and randomized to the mentored (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;39, 50%) and non-mentored (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;39, 50%) groups.

Mentoring did not impact either the quality of peer review or knowledge of biostatistics, though it impacted perceived knowledge and confidence in understanding of research methodology, scientific manuscripts, and application of scientific data to clinical practice and patient care.</p><p id="Par30">Peer review quality was assessed in this study using the RQI. No difference in review quality was found between the baseline and final manuscript review. Numerous prior attempts at training peer reviewers, including the use of training workshops [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], self-taught training packages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], and written feedback from journal editors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], have not yielded sustained improvements in peer review quality. To our knowledge, this is the first study using the RQI to evaluate review quality in a trainee population (i.e., residents). Further studies will be needed to test whether more structured approaches to mentoring, training of mentors, or supplementing with a formal curriculum on biostatistics for residents can improve peer review quality.</p><p id="Par31">Residency training is an important time to teach, develop, and reinforce skills in critical appraisal of medical literature and implementation of scientific data to patient care. Numerous curricula have been explored to teach the important principles underlying biostatistics, research methodology, and evidence-based medicine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Our novel approach integrates clinically relevant studies which impact neurologic patient care with an exposure to peer review of manuscripts. Curricula of this type which include formal training in peer review are lacking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p id="Par32">The impact of mentoring in this study was uncertain. The role of mentorship in promoting career advancement, increasing scholarly activities, encouraging professionalism, enhancing personal growth, and improving career satisfaction is well recognized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. However, in our current study, mentoring did not appear to impact knowledge acquisition or performance. Potential explanations include the high prevalence of faculty mentoring and reading of scientific articles at baseline, as well as the trend toward higher baseline mentoring in the non-mentored group. While a general curriculum outlining goals and pertinent topics as well as an introductory epidemiology and biostatistics text was provided to each program involved in the study, formal training for mentors and a structured resident curriculum was not incorporated into our pilot study and could be considered in future studies, particularly given evidence from other studies on the positive impact of mentor training on mentoring quality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p id="Par33">Our data provide evidence that there may be positive and negative aspects to mentorship. Qualitative comments provided by participants suggested that residents in the non-mentored group expressed disappointment about not being assigned a mentor. However, residents in the mentored group were no more likely to have completed manuscript reviews compared to the non-mentored group. For those residents who were assigned a mentor, obstacles to meeting with the mentor did exist and difficulties in finding time to meet may have led residents in the mentored group to forgo review completion altogether if they felt that they would not be able to arrange a meeting.</p><p id="Par34">Our study has limitations. Formal training for volunteer faculty mentors was not included and, while a curriculum of suggested topics was provided, instruction provided to each resident was not standardized. There is also an inevitable variability in mentorship quality and style, as well as variation in number of mentors across sites. Participating residents had high baseline rates of reading of scientific journals and mentorship, possibly reducing the effect size of the intervention. Mentor-mentee meetings were mandated, but compliance was not enforced, potentially diluting an effect of the study intervention. The time given to complete each manuscript may have been insufficient, resulting in reduced completion rates mid-way through the study. This mirrors real world peer review limitations, with time constraints sited as the primary reason for refusing to complete peer reviews [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Lastly, the sample size was small in this pilot study focusing only on neurology residents, and future consideration should be made to a wider scale study including trainees in other specialties, allowing for a greater degree of generalization.</p><p id="Par35">Our study also had strengths. We incorporated a novel hands-on teaching tool in a multi-center study to address a known knowledge gap in residency training. The use of standardized manuscripts representing different study designs with systematically introduced errors provided a broad scope of teaching points, so that the residents could learn more about different aspects of biostatistics and research methodology. Additional long-term follow-up data on the impact of this novel educational design on future resident scholarship are ongoing. Future directions to improve the benefit of using peer review as a teaching tool include increased guidance of faculty mentors, use of more specialized but remote mentors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] (e.g., established editors of scientific journals with an interest in peer review), focus on a more formal curriculum, web-based tutorials, fewer manuscript assignments, and the potential use of live submitted manuscripts rather than standardized ones to provide a more realistic review experience. These changes may pique resident interest and encourage continued participation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par36">In conclusion, we used mentored peer review of standardized manuscripts to introduce the concept of peer review and to teach the principles of biostatistics and research methodology to neurology residents. Although primary outcome measure of content knowledge did not increase, mentored residents had an enhanced perception in their abilities to understand research methodology and scientific manuscripts as well as their ability to apply study results to clinical practice and explain these to patients. Future studies with a larger sample size, incorporating formal mentoring training and a more detailed curriculum, may enhance the impact of this education intervention and its application to both the peer review process and patient care.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec18"><p>
