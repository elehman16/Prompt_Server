[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The number of people travelling rapidly to higher altitudes for work or recreation is rising. As a result of improvements in transportation to these high-altitude regions, AMS has become a significant environmental health issue
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The most effective preventive method for AMS&#x02014;gradual ascent&#x02014;is usually difficult or impractical for modern international travelers to locations such as Lhasa in Tibet (3650&#x000a0;m) and La Paz in Bolivia (3740&#x000a0;m)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The pathophysiology of AMS is not totally understood but it is apparent that administration of prophylactic treatments is helpful. Historically acetazolamide has been used as a gold standard in treatments to prevent malaise symptoms at high altitudes
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. However, acetazolamide requires a prescription and has side effects such as paresthesia, dysgeusia, and diuresis
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Some over-the-counter herbal supplements such as <italic>Rhodiola</italic> species, <italic>Ginkgo biloba</italic> and Coca leaf products are widely used
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>Genus <italic>Rhodiola</italic> (family Crassulaceae) has been a valuable medical plant in European countries for thousands of years
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. There are more than ninety species worldwide and they are well known for their high antioxidant activities. Different species of <italic>Rhodiola</italic> differ in their content of bioactive components and medicinal use in indigenous regions. To date, most studies focus on the efficacy of <italic>Rhodiola rosea</italic> in treating physical and mental fatigue. Of all the known <italic>Rhodiola</italic> species, <italic>Rhodiola crenulata</italic> (<italic>R. crenulata</italic>) is particularly described in the Pharmacopoeia of China
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] and is considered as the highest in quality. Also, it has been used for treating acute mountain sickness in Tibet since ancient times
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>Pulmonary alveolar hypoxia, a common phenomenon for non-acclimatized individuals who abruptly relocate to a high altitude, is thought to contribute to the impaired trans-alveolar fluid transport. The excessive fluid that subsequently accumulates in alveoli exaggerates alveolar hypoxia and obstructs the gas exchange process, leading to the pathological progression of high altitude pulmonary edema, the most lethal form of high-altitude illnesses
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. In a rodent model, <italic>R. crenulata</italic> extract exhibited a high antioxidant activity and attenuated pulmonary edema induced by hypobaric hypoxia
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Recent studies have shown that Na/K-ATPase plays a key role in alveolar fluid clearance. Both inhibition and knockdown of Na/K-ATPase expression significantly reduced the alveolar fluid clearance in rodent models
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Two bioactive components of <italic>R. crenulata</italic>, salidroside and tyrosol, were shown to hold antioxidant, anti-depression, anti-fatigue, and anti-inflammatory activities
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Therefore, the capabilities of <italic>R. crenulata</italic> in preventing the hypoxia-mediated Na/K-ATPase endocytosis and maintaining the integrity of alveolar-capillary barrier and pulmonary sodium transport might be the underlying mechanisms of its effect against pulmonary edema in rodent models
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p><p>Although <italic>R. crenulata</italic> is widely used to prevent AMS in the Himalayan areas and in Tibet
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], but no scientific studies have examined its effectiveness in humans. We conducted a controlled study to investigate the efficacy of <italic>R. crenulata</italic> in AMS prevention. In the clinical trials for <italic>Rhodiola</italic>, most studies were conducted to investigate whether <italic>Rhodiola</italic> could improve the endurance exercise performance or protect against fatigue. The daily dosage of <italic>Rhodiola</italic> extract tested was mostly under 500&#x000a0;mg (ranged between 100&#x02013;972&#x000a0;mg)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Regarding the duration of prophylactic medication for AMS, chemical drugs such as acetazolamide could elicit a quick response and were usually administered on the day before or prior to the ascent. In the trials on AMS prevention using prophylactic herbal medication, <italic>Ginkgo biloba</italic> was the one mostly studied. It was often administered for one to five days prior to the ascent
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Considering the onset of AMS after ascent and the compliance of prophylactic medication, a high dose of <italic>R. crenulata</italic> (800&#x000a0;mg daily) was chosen in this study and the subjects were administered with <italic>R. crenulata</italic> for seven days prior to the ascent.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Ethics statement</title><p>This study has been approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Chang Gung Medical Foundation, Linkou Medical Center, Taoyuan, Taiwan.

After baseline assessment, the subjects were randomly assigned into either sequence.</p></sec><sec><title>Study design, randomization and blinding</title><p>This study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled and crossover trial. Subjects were randomized to 2 treatment sequences, receiving either the <italic>R. crenulata</italic> or the placebo, and then crossed over to the alternate treatment after a 3&#x000a0;month wash-out period. Random numbers were generated by using the computer, using block randomization with a block size of 2 or 4. The random numbers were placed in sealed envelopes, and a serial number was assigned to each envelope according to the sequence of allocation of the randomized number. Each envelope was then opened sequentially, according to the admission sequence of the participants at the study center. The number inside the envelope determined the treatment sequence that each participant was allocated to (<italic>Rhodiola</italic>-placebo or placebo-<italic>Rhodiola</italic>). Both investigators and participants were blinded. One investigator, who was not responsible for any assessment, enrolled all participants and allocated them to treatment. Blinding was maintained until the data analysis was complete.</p></sec><sec><title>Medications</title><p>Commercial pharmaceutical grade <italic>R. crenulata</italic> and placebo were packed by Kaiser Pharmaceutical &#x00026; Biotanico (Tainan, Taiwan). Both were pink soft gelatin capsules (400&#x000a0;mg/capsule) in identical containers and there were no differences in the taste or smell of the capsules. The standardized <italic>R. crenulata</italic> extract (with 2.38% salidroside and 0.44% <italic>p</italic>-tyrosol) was manufactured from the same batch of raw materials
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. The origin of the herb was authenticated by microscopic identification and sequence analysis of the internal transcribed spacer regions. The material was examined for microorganisms, heavy metals, and pesticide according to the accepted standards (good manufacturing practice, GMP) of Taiwan. Each participant received a high dose (800&#x000a0;mg) of <italic>R. crenulata</italic> or placebo (800&#x000a0;mg) daily for 9&#x000a0;days. Beginning 7&#x000a0;days before an ascent, participants were required to inform the investigators by email or telephone every day about the study capsule supply or any adverse effects. If the investigators were not contacted before noon, they would follow up by phone to obtain this information. Moreover, the participants were requested to take capsules every morning of their 2-day mountaineering trip.</p></sec><sec><title>Ascent</title><p>To control the ascent rate, participants were transported by bus from an altitude of 250&#x000a0;m to 3100&#x000a0;m (the training camp) within 4&#x000a0;h (Figure&#x000a0;

On the second day, all participants were transported by bus to the entrance (3200&#x000a0;m) of the main peak of Hehuan Mountain, and they went hiking along the easy trekking path to the peak (3416&#x000a0;m). After that, they returned to the entrance of the main peak and traveled back to Linkou by bus. There were 10 checkpoints for assessment, namely, Linkou (250&#x000a0;m), Cingjing Farm (1743&#x000a0;m), Yuanfeng parking lot (2756&#x000a0;m), training camp (3100&#x000a0;m), the East Peak (3421&#x000a0;m) of Hehuan Mountain, training camp in the evening and morning, the Main Peak (3416&#x000a0;m) of Hehuan Mountain, Cingjing Farm, and Linkou. During the mountaineering trips, the following variables were controlled: rate of ascent, path, food type, and sleep altitude/environment. The training camp could not accommodate all subjects at once. Thus, the participants were divided into 2 groups in each period, and they ascended separately in less than 10&#x000a0;days apart. The usual snow season of the Hehuan Mountain is between early January and early March. We chose early and mid-December 2010, late March, and early April 2011 as our 4 mountaineering dates.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].</p><p>The AMS grade, Lake Louise self-report questionnaire, and pulse oximetry (SpO<sub>2,</sub> NPB 40, Nellcor, Pleasanton, CA, USA) were completed at 10 checkpoints along the route. Four emergency physicians, familiar with the management of AMS, took care of any discomfort of the participants during the whole course of mountaineering. Participants were not permitted to self-treat their AMS symptoms. Instead, they were told in advance that investigators would provide oral acetaminophen (500&#x000a0;mg) or ibuprofen (400&#x000a0;mg) for headache, meclizine (25&#x000a0;mg) for dizziness or intramuscular prochlorperazine (5&#x000a0;mg) for nausea and/or vomiting.</p><p>All subjects had their own mountaineering health passport.

Statistical analyses showed that there was a period effect but no carry-over effect. AMS occurred significantly less frequently on the second mountaineering trip (65.7% vs. 55.9%; <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.040), regardless of treatment. Since most participants (58%) had no high-altitude mountaineering experience prior to the first trip, the first trip experience helped them adapt to conditions on the second trip in period 2. Inadequate high-altitude mountaineering experience was proven to be an independent risk factor for AMS
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. In Gaillard&#x02019;s study, the understanding and awareness of AMS among trekkers reduced the incidence of AMS
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Also, Vardy et al. suggested that AMS is less likely to take place with a correct awareness of its symptoms and prevention
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. In our study, the participants filled the Lake Louise self-report questionnaire at 10 checkpoints during mountaineering, so they had a comprehensive awareness of high altitude experience and AMS symptoms after the first period of mountaineering. They also shared experiences and methods on AMS prevention, such as avoiding high impact activity at high altitude. Therefore, the participants had a significantly superior awareness of symptoms and prevention for AMS in the second period than in the first period of mountaineering. Also, no period effect was observed among the experienced participants in our study. Thus, this phenomenon could be classified as a learning effect. The weather, warmer during period 2, could be the other explanation for the period effect. Our trial was designed conservatively to avoid any possible bias against <italic>R. crenulata</italic>: we used a high dose of this agent, a longer period of drug preloading, and a steep ascent profile from the sea level. During the mountaineering trips, the following variables were controlled: rate of ascent, path, food type, and sleep altitude/environment.</p><p>In the present study, the environmental and medical resources available to study AMS were limited. We designed our study as a crossover trial for a key reason. Because each participant serves as his or her own control, it skillfully controls for the inherent individual susceptibility to AMS. Each person has his or her own personal tolerance for altitude change, and consequently, we calculated the percentage change of outcomes from his or her baseline to evaluate the effect of intervention or association with possible factors in parallel design. Using crossover design enabled us to measure the effect of intervention exactly, regardless of individual susceptibility. This design also had the benefits of increasing statistical power, given the limited sample size, and efficient control of the influence of confounding covariates.</p><p>Our study had several limitations. First, only 102 of the original 125 participants completed both trips. However, the statistical analyses were still adequately powered for three reasons: (1) the incidence of AMS was higher than what we had hypothesized using data generated in our previous survey
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. This was because most of our participants were inexperienced mountaineers, and their rate of controlled ascent was significantly higher than that in the previous study (4&#x000a0;h vs. 1&#x02013;2&#x000a0;days). The participants were requested not to take acetazolamide or other possible prophylactic medications used by trekkers before mountaineering in previous surveys. (2) The sample size was estimated using the assumption that <italic>Rhodiola</italic> would reduce the incidence of AMS by 11% (36% to 25%) compared to placebo, but the results showed no difference between taking <italic>Rhodiola</italic> and placebo. Based on the data obtained in the present study, a sample of infinite size would be required to prove that <italic>Rhodiola</italic> had a significant prophylactic effect. (3) The sensitivity analysis showed that <italic>Rhodiola</italic> was not effective in preventing AMS regardless of the scenarios proposed (Figure&#x000a0;
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). The second limitation is that half of the participants had a rescheduled second trip and they therefore took the study medication (or placebo) for 7&#x000a0;days before ascent and then on the first morning of ascent, for 8&#x000a0;days. Although they did not reach an altitude where AMS might be expected, they took study medication for 8 out of 9&#x000a0;days, and then they began medication once again 4&#x000a0;weeks later. Although these participants took double dosage of <italic>Rhodiola</italic>, their AMS incidence was not reduced. The third limitation is that the <italic>Rhodiola</italic> extract purified from the rhizome of <italic>R. crenulata</italic> was used to assure high concentration of active ingredients (2.38% salidroside and 0.44% <italic>p</italic>-tyrosol) in this study. However, the active ingredients for preventing AMS could have been lost during extraction and purification. Many Chinese tourists drink a decoction of <italic>Rhodiola</italic> rhizome to prevent AMS. The results of the present study do not exclude the possibility that this <italic>R. crenulata</italic> decoction may have a preventive effect on AMS. Last, only one dosage and one <italic>Rhodiola</italic> species were tested. Higher dosage or extracts from other species, such as <italic>Rhodiola rosea</italic>, <italic>Rhodiola kirilowii</italic>, <italic>Rhodiola sachalinensis,</italic> and <italic>Rhodiola algida,</italic> might be effective.</p><p>Studies have investigated different pharmacologic interventions to prevent AMS. Acetazolamide is effective for the prevention of AMS but it may be associated with paresthesias. Sumatriptan and gabapentin are beneficial but require further study
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Antioxidants magnesium, <italic>Ginkgo biloba</italic> and Coca leaf products were not efficacious
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In the Himalayan region, China, and Andean region of South America, using traditional applications of herbs for anti-high altitude illness is more common than using doctor prescription. For example, Coca leaf products were used more often among 62.8% of the surveyed travelers than acetazolamide prophylaxis (16.6%) for prevention, or other non-pharmacologic measures
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Similar in China, 7% of 247 Chinese travelers on Qinghai-Tibet railroad took <italic>Rhodiola</italic> as a prophylaxis for AMS, but none used acetazolamide or dexamethasone, except one who had asthma
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. It was shown that coca leaf products did not prevent AMS, but increased the chance of AMS occurrence. Therefore, complementary and alternative medicines are omnipresent and popular, and should not be dismissed as "non-medications".</p><p>Our study is the first randomized, double-blind and controlled study of <italic>R. crenulata</italic> extract for AMS prophylaxis in humans though the current data does not demonstrate any prophylactic effects. Further studies will be needed to demonstrate the efficacy of <italic>R. crenulata</italic> decoction or other <italic>Rhodiola</italic> species in AMS prevention.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This randomized double-blind placebo control crossover trial demonstrated that the <italic>R. crenulata</italic> extract was not effective in reducing the incidence or severity of AMS. <italic>R. crenulata</italic> extract should not be recommended as a prophylactic for AMS.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>All authors have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>TFC is responsible for the study design, performing research, data interpretation and drafting of the article.
