Non-pharmacological approaches, including breathing retraining, are therefore of great interest to patients. However, clinicians rarely advocate breathing retraining and access to this intervention is restricted for most patients due to the limited availability of suitable physiotherapists and poor integration of breathing retraining into standard care. We aimed to assess the effectiveness of a digital self-guided breathing retraining intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In this randomised controlled trial, we recruited patients from 34 general practices in the UK. Eligibility criteria for patients with asthma were broad, comprising a physician diagnosis of asthma, age of 16&#x02013;70 years, receipt of at least one anti-asthma medication in the previous year, and impaired asthma-related quality of life (Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire [AQLQ] score of &#x0003c;5&#x000b7;5). We developed a self-guided intervention, which was delivered as a DVD plus a printed booklet (DVDB). Participants were randomly assigned to receive either the DVDB intervention, three face-to-face breathing retraining sessions, or standard care, in a 2:1:2 ratio, for 12 months. Randomisation was achieved using the Southampton Clinical Trials Unit telephone randomisation service by use of random number generators. The primary outcome was the AQLQ score in the intention-to-treat population at 12 months. The trial was powered to show equivalence between the two active intervention groups, and superiority of both intervention groups over usual care. Secondary outcomes included patient-reported and physiological measures of asthma control, patient acceptability, and health-care costs. This trial was registered with International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number registry, number ISRCTN88318003.</p></sec><sec><title>Findings</title><p>Between Nov 5, 2012 and Jan 28, 2014, invitations to participate in the study were sent to 15&#x02008;203 patients with general practitioner-diagnosed asthma, of whom 655 were recruited into the study. AQLQ scores at 12 months were significantly higher in the DVDB group (mean 5&#x000b7;40, SD 1&#x000b7;14) than in the usual care group (5&#x000b7;12, SD 1&#x000b7;17; adjusted mean difference 0&#x000b7;28, 95% CI 0&#x000b7;11 to 0&#x000b7;44), and in the face-to-face group (5&#x000b7;33, SD 1&#x000b7;06) than in the usual care group (adjusted mean difference 0&#x000b7;24, 95% CI 0&#x000b7;04 to 0&#x000b7;44); AQLQ scores were similar between the DVDB group and the face-to-face group (0&#x000b7;04, 95% CI &#x02212;0&#x000b7;16 to 0&#x000b7;24). There were no significant differences between the randomisation groups in FEV1 or fraction of exhaled nitric oxide. 744 adverse events occurred in 272 patients: 101 (39%) of 261 patients in the DVDB group, 55 (42%) of 132 patients in the face-to-face group, and 132 (50%) of 262 in the usual care group, with patients reporting one or more event. 11 (4%) patients in the DVDB group, four (3%) patients in the face-to-face group, and 20 (8%) patients in the usual care group had a serious adverse event.</p></sec><sec><title>Interpretation</title><p>Breathing retraining programmes improve quality of life in patients with incompletely controlled asthma despite having little effect on lung function or airway inflammation.

However, in National Health Service (NHS) practice, these methods are rarely used because of insufficient access to suitably trained physio therapists. There is clear evidence for the effectiveness of self-management education in asthma management, although current programmes focus mainly on pharmacological strategies and do not include breathing retraining. Self-guided digital programmes have the potential to be accessed easily, conveniently, and inexpensively by large numbers of people with asthma and to deliver standardised interventions.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref></p><p id="para20"><boxed-text id="cetextbox10"><caption><title>Research in context</title></caption><p id="para30"><bold>Evidence before this study</bold></p><p id="para40">Asthma is a complex, heterogeneous condition that affects patients in many ways; physically, psychologically, as well as affecting quality of life. Pharmacological treatments are effective, yet most patients continue to have ongoing symptoms and quality of life impairment despite the use of drug treatment. Many patients are interested in non-pharmacological treatment approaches, but the evidence base for most non-pharmacological interventions is inconclusive, with existing studies often underpowered or methodologically flawed. However, breathing retraining exercises have promising supportive evidence and are advocated as an add-on option in several evidence-based asthma guidelines. We identified two extensive recent systematic reviews of breathing retraining in asthma, which have differed in their conclusions; we therefore did not complete a systematic literature search ourselves. The 2012 US Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality analysis study concluded that non-pharmacological techniques can improve asthma symptoms and reduce the need for reliever medication, and the 2013 Cochrane review reported that trends for improvement were encouraging, and advocated further studies. Current National Health Service breathing retraining programmes involve face-to-face attendance with a suitably trained physiotherapist, but access is limited because of the scarcity of therapists and the logistical and financial challenges of making treatment available in routine care.</p><p id="para50"><bold>Added value of this study</bold></p><p id="para60">We report the largest trial of breathing retraining in asthma to date, which used a pragmatic randomised controlled trial design. The main finding of this study is that asthma-related quality of life impairment is improved by a self-guided programme of physiotherapy-based breathing training delivered by a DVD and booklet, as an alternative model of delivery to the routine face-to-face method, with a magnitude of effect similar to that produced by increasing asthma medication. Patients perceived benefit from the self-guided programme despite little improvement in airway physiology or inflammation. We confirm reports from previous smaller studies that improvements in quality of life were seen with face-to-face physiotherapist-taught programmes compared with usual care. Additionally, we also showed that the DVD and booklet programme resulted in equivalent clinically relevant benefits more conveniently and inexpensively. In keeping with current evidence and meta-analysis, no adverse effects of either intervention were found.</p><p id="para70"><bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold></p><p id="para80">Our findings imply that the self-help intervention can be offered conveniently and cost-effectively as an adjuvant non-pharmacological treatment to many patients with asthma in routine care who have persisting impairment in quality of life despite standard pharmacological management.</p></boxed-text></p><p id="para90">We hypothesised that breathing retraining delivered as a digital, audiovisual, self-guided programme to patients with mild and moderate asthma, but with persisting symptoms, would improve asthma-related quality of life above usual care, be equivalent to face-to-face physiotherapist instruction, be cost-effective, and be an acceptable intervention for patients.</p></sec><sec id="cesec20"><title>Methods</title><sec id="cesec30"><title>Study design and participants</title><p id="para100">This was a pragmatic 3-group, 12-month, observer-blinded, parallel-group randomised trial comparing the use of a DVD and booklet (DVDB) intervention with face-to-face physiotherapy or with a control group receiving usual care, in adults with asthma who were recruited from 34 UK general practices.

To be included in the study, participants had to be aged 16&#x02013;70 years, be registered at a medical practice for at least 12 months, have asthma diagnosed by a physician, have been prescribed at least 1 asthma medication in the previous year, achieve an Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ)<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> score of less than 5&#x000b7;5, and to provide written informed consent.

This randomisation schedule was used because the face-to-face group was the most financially and logistically challenging to deliver to patients. Randomisation was done after eligibility assessment and informed consent; the research nurse telephoned the randomisation service provided by Southampton Clinical Trials Unit, where staff trained in registration and randomisation procedures accessed the web based Tenalea randomisation system. The research nurse then provided the participant with the appropriate materials and follow-up arrangements for the relevant study group. The research nurses who completed the exit assessments and medical record review were different from those completing the baseline assessment, and had no information about group allocations, with patients requested not to disclose their own treatment group. All analyses were completed by researchers masked to treatment allocation and without access to unmasked data.</p></sec><sec id="cesec50"><title>Procedures</title><p id="para130">We developed an evidence-based, self-guided intervention delivered via a DVD plus a printed supporting booklet, which was based on an existing breathing retraining programme taught by physiotherapists and shown to be effective in poorly controlled asthma.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> The DVDB materials were developed by a multidisciplinary team including physicians, physiotherapists, health psychologists, communications technology specialists, and patient representatives, with extensive iterative qualitative patient input to optimise acceptability and effectiveness, and consisted of three elements. First, the DVDB intervention provided a detailed explanation and illustration of how to complete the breathing exercises, with footage showing a physiotherapist teaching these exercises to patients. The exercises comprised an illustration of, and training in, diaphragmatic breathing, nasal breathing, slow breathing, controlled breath holds, and simple relaxation exercises. Second, the DVDB intervention provided motivational components, explaining the rationale and addressing common concerns. Finally, supportive features (such as a daily planner and progress charts) were included for practicing and implementing the techniques in daily life.</p><p id="para140">The materials were piloted and finalised with 29 members of the target population, purposively sampled for diversity of age, gender, education, and symptom profile, by use of the person-based think aloud methods<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> to elicit reactions and modify the materials based on the feedback received.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> The content of the DVD and the supporting booklet have been transferred to an internet-based version, and is freely available through the Breathe Study <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.breathestudy.co.uk" id="interrefs10">website</ext-link>.</p><p id="para150">Potentially eligible patients, identified by computer searches of routine clinical records from general practices, received the study information and the AQLQ by mail.

Participants randomly assigned to the DVDB intervention group were provided with the DVD and the booklet. Participants randomly assigned to the face-to-face group also received the booklet and worked to a standardised intervention schedule and were seen by a respiratory physiotherapist who was trained and skilled in providing breathing retraining for three one-to-one sessions, each of about 40 min duration, approximately once every 2 weeks after randomisation. The same physiotherapist, working to a structured protocol, delivered all the face-to-face sessions for all patients. Fidelity to treatment delivery was identified by use of a physiotherapist-completed checklist at every session, and a direct observation checklist completed by one author (AB) of a random sample of 5% of sessions. Protocol adherence was predefined as conforming to 90% of the checklist, and was 100% on both the physiotherapist and the observation checklists.</p><p id="para170">A pre-specified health economic assessment was done by assessing the intervention provision costs, and mean health service use cost per patient by treatment group, aggregated from the costs of asthma-related prescriptions, consultations, and hospital admissions, and is reported in full elsewhere.<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref></p></sec><sec id="cesec60"><title>Outcomes</title><p id="para180">The primary outcome measure was the 12-month AQLQ score adjusted for the baseline values of prespecified covariates during statistical analysis.

Spirometry (FEV<sub>1</sub>, FVC, and FEV<sub>1</sub>:FVC ratio) was missing in 26 (4%) of 655 participants randomly assigned to treatment and FENO in 49 (8%) of 655, with similar proportions between groups (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>). 21 (3%) of 655 participants withdrew from the study (13 [5%] of 261 in the DVDB group, 3 [2%] of 132 in the face-to-face group, and 5 [2%] of 262 in the usual care group). The AQLQ was returned at 12 months by 556 (85%) of 655 participants, but all patients submitted a questionnaire at one or more of the follow-up points over the course of the study.<fig

Current access to breathing retraining therapy within the NHS is limited by the availability of suitably trained physiotherapists and the logistical and economical challenges to providing face-to-face therapy to a wider population.</p><p id="para350">To our knowledge, we report the largest trial of breathing retraining in asthma to date. A pragmatic trial design was used, which aimed to recruit a representative patient population (with minimal exclusion criteria) and to minimally disrupt the process of normal care, to maximise generalisability of the results. The main finding of this study is that asthma-related quality-of-life impairment is equivalently improved by the routine face-to-face delivery method for breathing retraining and our alternative intervention of a digital self-guided programme of physiotherapy-based breathing retraining. We confirmed improvements in quality-of-life scores over usual care previously reported in smaller studies for face-to-face physiotherapist-taught programmes, and additionally showed that the DVDB programme results in equivalent clinically relevant benefits more conveniently and less expensively. To show that a new intervention is as effective as an established one, an equivalence margin must be specified for the primary outcome, and the 95% CI for the difference in effect between treatments contained within this margin. Our predefined equivalence margin was &#x02212;0&#x000b7;3 to 0&#x000b7;3 AQLQ units, on the basis of a previously reported equivalence study.<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> We actually observed a small numerical difference favouring the DVDB intervention over face-to-face treatment (0&#x000b7;04), with the 95% CIs being well within our predefined margin (&#x02212;0&#x000b7;16 to 0&#x000b7;24), giving us confidence that we have demonstrated equivalence.</p><p id="para360">In agreement with previous studies,<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> no significant changes in airway obstruction (as assessed by measures of respiratory physiology such as FEV<sub>1</sub> and PEFR) or inflammation (by assessment of FENO) were observed, suggesting that breathing retraining provides a technique for coping better with the consequences and ongoing effects of having asthma, but is not disease-modifying. Therefore this intervention is unlikely to reduce the need for anti-inflammatory medication, so acts as adjuvant rather than replacement for pharmacotherapy. The programme was accepted well and engaged with by patients and could be implemented into routine care with low resource investment.</p><p id="para370">The importance of a pragmatic trial design to assess the real-world effectiveness of an intervention is recognised.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> Therefore, this randomised trial aimed to recruit a typical asthma population reflecting the heterogeneity of routine practice, and allowed normal care to proceed as much as possible. It was not possible to mask participants to intervention allocation, but observations and analyses were done by researchers masked to group allocation. A limitation of the study is that of the individuals invited to participate, only 10% were enrolled, with a slightly older age profile than the overall UK adult asthma population, and thus might represent an atypical population that might be more prepared to consider breathing retraining. We recruited patients aged 16&#x02013;70 years, and the median age of participants in the trial was 57 years. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://tinyurl.com/ybc4meo8" id="interrefs20">UK survey data</ext-link> from 2016 report that the prevalence of asthma in England in the 25&#x02013;49 year age group is 10%, 11% in the 50&#x02013;64 year age group, and 13% in the over 65 year age group. There was a modest over-representation of older people in our trial, probably reflecting the fact that people aged over 60 years are more likely to agree to participate in a clinical trial; therefore, further work is required to confirm effectiveness in younger age groups. The requirement to attend study-related visits and to complete questionnaires might have put some people off participating in the study, but preceding qualitative work indicates that the intervention itself would be widely acceptable.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref></p><p id="para380">The mean improvement from baseline AQLQ scores was 1&#x000b7;1 for both the DVDB and face-to-face groups, and 0&#x000b7;8 in the usual care group, with 0&#x000b7;5 equating to a clinically important improvement and 1&#x000b7;0 to a large improvement,<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> suggesting that, on average, participants in all groups had clinically relevant improvements in quality of life over the study period. A previous pragmatic active comparator clinical trial in a population of adult patients with suboptimally controlled asthma, reported within-group improvements from baseline in AQLQ scores similar to those observed in our study by the addition of either a long-acting &#x003b2; agonist (mean difference from baseline 1&#x000b7;0) or of a leukotriene receptor antagonist (0&#x000b7;8).<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> In our study, there was also a marked improvement from baseline in the usual care group, which is likely to relate to regression to the mean and trial involvement effects, but significant improvements remained in both intervention groups compared with the usual care group.</p><p id="para390">The qualitative and quantitative process assessments indicated that most participants engaged with breathing retraining, whether it was delivered face-to-face or via DVDB. In the 3-month postal questionnaires, there was an overall response rate of 388 (99%) of 393 patients in the two intervention groups, with high proportions reporting positive engagement with the active interventions and at least some level of practice (256 [98%] of 261 in the DVDB group and 132 [100%] of 132 in the face-to-face group). The amount of practice reported by patients was variable, and higher in the face-to-face group than in the DVDB group, although this was not associated with improved outcomes and there was no apparent evidence of a dose-response association between the amount of practice in the techniques and clinical benefit. The aim of breathing retraining is to teach patients how to adjust their behaviour so that they can embed the techniques into their daily lives. Whether there is a minimum amount of practice required to learn and benefit from the breathing retraining techniques, and whether repeated training is needed at some future time, is not clear from this study and requires future investigation.</p><p id="para400">Although the significant group mean improvements that we report in both breathing retraining groups are below the minimum clinically important difference for an individual patient, the developers of the AQLQ instrument explicitly state that even if the mean difference between a treatment and a control is appreciably less than the smallest change, treatment might have an important effect on many patients.<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> Similarly, one networked meta-analysis of pharmacological randomised trials assessing the magnitude of treatment effects on AQLQ,<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> stated that the established within-patient minimum clinically important difference for ACQ and AQLQ is not achievable as a group-wise efficacy threshold between treatment groups in clinical studies. This meta-analysis reported that the mean improvements from the addition of a long-acting &#x003b2; agonist compared with control were 0&#x000b7;35 (95% CI 0&#x000b7;27 to 0&#x000b7;43), 0&#x000b7;20 (0&#x000b7;13 to 0&#x000b7;27) from the addition of leukotriene receptor antagonists, 0&#x000b7;01 (&#x02212;0&#x000b7;20 to 0&#x000b7;22) from the addition of theophylline, and 0&#x000b7;31 (0&#x000b7;20 to 0&#x000b7;41) from the addition of omalizumab.<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> By comparison, improvements in our study from the DVDB intervention compared with usual care were 0&#x000b7;28 (95% CI 0&#x000b7;11 to 0&#x000b7;44), and 0&#x000b7;24 (0&#x000b7;04 to 0&#x000b7;44) for face-to-face physiotherapy compared with usual care. From a patient perspective, the quality of life improvements achieved from both physiotherapy-based programmes in this randomised trial were, therefore, of similar magnitude to those associated with commonly used pharmacological step-up strategies, and could be considered either in addition to, or instead of, increases in drug treatment.

Additionally, we are in the process of producing a web-optimised version of the intervention for online use, in collaboration with our partner patient charity, Asthma UK, and we anticipate that this material will be freely available to patients and professionals in 2018. The low cost of providing an internet-based intervention, the ease of access of content and the absence of adverse outcomes using such approaches indicate that this evidence-based non-pharmacological intervention can now be offered to people with asthma with persisting quality-of-life impairment despite current asthma medication. There is a need to stress to patients that this intervention is in addition to, not instead of, current medication, and that it does not cure asthma, but rather is a means to improve quality of life.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="bibl10"><title>Reference</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="other" id="sbref10"><comment>No authors listed</comment><article-title>Global Initiative for Asthma: global strategy for asthma management and prevention</article-title><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ginasthma.org/2017-gina-report-global-strategy-for-asthma-management-and-prevention/" id="interrefs40">http://ginasthma.org/2017-gina-report-global-strategy-for-asthma-management-and-prevention/</ext-link><year>2017</year><comment>(accessed March 6, 2017).</comment></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref20"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bateman</surname><given-names>ED</given-names></name><name><surname>Boushey</surname><given-names>HA</given-names></name><name><surname>Bousquet</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Can guideline-defined asthma control be achieved?
