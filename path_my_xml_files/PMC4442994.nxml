In this present era of laparoscopic surgery, virtually all open urological procedures have been reproduced laparoscopically. Laparoscopic pyeloplasty is no exception, and results equivalent to open surgery were reported <xref rid="b0015 b0020" ref-type="bibr">[3,4]</xref>. This enthusiasm for the laparoscopic approach is mainly fuelled by the significant reduction in the morbidity resulting from the flank incision of open surgery.</p><p>Although there are many reports of transperitoneal laparoscopic pyeloplasty, few authors report the results of laparoscopic retroperitoneal pyeloplasty (LRP) <xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. This might be due to the very confined retroperitoneal space that makes the retroperitoneal approach less appealing. Here we report the long-term results of LRP and use this experience as a background to discuss the technical issues.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s0010"><title>Patients and methods</title><p>From January 2003 to December 2008, 30 patients underwent LRP for primary PUJO at our institution. Patients were evaluated before LRP with excretory urography, ultrasonography and/or diuretic renography. The reconstruction used in each patient was most often an Anderson&#x02013;Hynes dismembered pyeloplasty, but two were judged as suitable for a non-dismembered pyeloplasty because of a high ureteric insertion in the pelvis, so a Foley Y&#x02013;V pyeloplasty was used. A retroperitoneal approach was used in all patients.</p><p>Patients were reviewed at 1&#x000a0;month after LRP, for stent removal, and then at 6 and 12&#x000a0;months routinely with excretory urography.</p><p>We evaluated patient demographic data, the results of preoperative investigations, operative details, hospital course, and complications for all patients. Objective success was determined by the absence of symptoms and the absence of obstruction on excretory urography.</p><sec id="s0015"><title>Technique</title><p>All patients were assessed using cystoscopy and a 6&#x000a0;F open-tip ureteric catheter was placed immediately before LRP. The catheter facilitated the identification and dissection of the ureter during surgery. Its extremity was kept plugged and sterile for the retrograde insertion of a guidewire to facilitate placing a JJ stent. The patient was then turned into a full-flank position with the side ipsilateral to the PUJ uppermost, and the surgery was carried out as described previously by Nouira et al. <xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. The trocar placements are shown in <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>.</p><p>The ureter was located, dissected and traced to the PUJ. Complete mobilisation of the PUJ and the pelvis is necessary before excision. The PUJ was then excised and the anastomosis made with 3&#x02013;0 polyglactin running sutures. After completing the posterior wall anastomosis, a JJ stent was placed antegradely on a guidewire pushed through the previously placed open-tip ureteric catheter, according to our technique reported previously <xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Once the JJ stent was secured in the pelvis, the anterior wall of the PUJ anastomosis was completed. A peri-renal suction drain was left in place and removed when producing &#x0003c;50&#x000a0;mL daily.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s0020"><title>Results</title><p>All patients had primary PUJO, and <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> summarises all the demographic and operative results. Because of infection, two patients needed preoperative decompression of the pelvicalyceal system with a nephrostomy. Six patients had concomitant stone disease and so required stone extraction at the time of pyeloplasty. In three patients conversion to open surgery was mandated by dense adhesions secondary to previous pyelonephritis, and in one because of difficulty in suturing, early in our experience. There were minor postoperative complications in three patients, consisting of pyelonephritis in two, and one with a urinoma requiring percutaneous drainage. There were no major complications during or after LRP in this series. The intraoperative blood loss was &#x0003c;50&#x000a0;mL in all patients. The mean (range) operative duration, measured from the initial cystoscopy to completion of the procedure, was 228 (190&#x02013;280)&#x000a0;min.</p><p>There was a crossing vessel in 11 patients and it was not transposed with the PUJ in any patient. The peri-renal drain was removed at 2 or 3&#x000a0;days after LRP. The mean hospital stay after LRP was 4.2&#x000a0;days. All patients had their JJ stents removed by 1&#x000a0;month after LRP. The mean (range) follow-up was 60 (29&#x02013;106)&#x000a0;months.</p><p>Of the 26 patients who had complete LRPs, 23 had no evidence of obstruction on IVU and/or diuretic renography. Three patients had a very dilated renal pelvis with persistent obstruction detected on renography, although they were asymptomatic. In one patient the kidney was eventually destroyed and she had a nephrectomy. The other two had no further procedures, as the ipsilateral renal function did not decline excessively.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s0025"><title>Discussion</title><p>Laparoscopic pyeloplasty was initially reported by Kavoussi and Peters in 1993 <xref rid="b0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. It has been shown to be safe and effective for treating PUJO. The reported success rate can be up to 95% after robotic or laparoscopic procedures <xref rid="b0045 b0050 b0055 b0060" ref-type="bibr">[9&#x02013;12]</xref>. In the present study the 5-year success rate for LRP was 88%, and this is equivalent to the results from the open technique. Our success rate was less than for other laparoscopic procedures probably because of bias in the selection of our patients. We used LRP in some young adults who could have had a nephrectomy rather than pyeloplasty, because of significant dilation, had they been older.</p><p>The laparoscopic approach can be transperitoneal or retroperitoneal, with a good success rate, and lower morbidity and shorter convalescence than after open surgery <xref rid="b0015 b0020" ref-type="bibr">[3,4]</xref>. The retroperitoneal approach has the advantage of direct access to the urinary system, an easier detection of crossing vessels, and a lower morbidity if there is urinary leakage. However, because this approach has a limited working space that makes dissection and especially suturing more difficult, it is less appealing than the transperitoneal approach, and only a few series have been reported to date.</p><p>The first prospective randomised study comparing the transperitoneal and retroperitoneal approach was reported in 2007 by Shoma et al. <xref rid="b0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Those authors found that both approaches had comparable outcomes, with no significant difference in the success rate, but the retroperitoneal approach was associated with a longer operation (189 vs. 149&#x000a0;min). A recent report <xref rid="b0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> showed that both the transperitoneal and retroperitoneal approaches can be used for laparoscopy as a minimally invasive treatment for PUJO, and both are is associated with a high success rate and a low complication rate, although the transperitoneal approach provides a quicker operation and a lower conversion rate.</p><p>In our department we have used laparoscopic surgery since 2002, and the retroperitoneal approach was always used for PUJO. We started the transperitoneal approach later and used it for adrenal tumours or nephrectomies.</p><p>Some authors reported that right-sided retroperitoneoscopic pyeloplasty is easier for right-handed surgeons because of a better working angle <xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. In our series, although we operated on 13 left-sided cases, we did not notice any difference between the sides.</p><p>Laparoscopic Anderson&#x02013;Hynes pyeloplasty is the preferred technique, as it provides better results. In the present series we tried to use that technique, but due to per-operative difficulties we used the Y&#x02013;V procedure in some patients. A recent report compared these two procedures, finding that laparoscopic Anderson&#x02013;Hynes pyeloplasty gave a higher success rate than Y&#x02013;V pyeloplasty, but the difference was not statistically significant <xref rid="b0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.</p><p>Ureteric stent insertion is a time-consuming step in LRP. To reduce this duration we inserted the JJ stent antegradely on a guidewire pushed through the previously placed open-tip ureteric catheter, as reported previously <xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Some would prefer to place the stent retrogradely at the beginning of the procedure, but this would deflate the pelvis, and thus we prefer to take advantage of the dilated pelvis during dissection. Also, other authors argue that previous stent placement would hinder the trimming of the ureter and might be the cause of postoperative obstruction <xref rid="b0080" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p><p>In the present series we found crossing vessels in 11 patients and we did not transpose them in any. This had no effect on the outcome in these patients. In a recent series of robot-assisted laparoscopic dismembered pyeloplasty, the success rates were similar in terms of the change in symptoms and renal function in patients with or without transposition of the anterior crossing vessels. Crossing vessels should only be transposed when the anatomical relationship dictates, and it should be an intraoperative decision <xref rid="b0045 b0085" ref-type="bibr">[9,17]</xref>.</p><p>In conclusion, LRP in experienced hands combines the high functional success rate of open pyeloplasty and the minimally invasive morbidity of laparoscopy. It is a feasible and reproducible procedure, and is effective, with excellent long-term success rates.</p></sec><sec id="s0030"><title>Conflict of interest</title><p>None.</p></sec><sec id="s0035"><title>Source of funding</title><p>None.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="b0005"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="h0005"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Brooks</surname><given-names>J.D.</given-names></name><name><surname>Kavoussi</surname><given-names>L.R.</given-names></name><name><surname>Preminger</surname><given-names>G.M.</given-names></name><name><surname>Schuessler</surname><given-names>W.W.</given-names></name><name><surname>Moore</surname><given-names>R.G.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Comparison of open and endourological approaches to the obstructed ureteropelvic junction</article-title><source>Urology</source><volume>46</volume><year>1995</year><fpage>791</fpage><lpage>795</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">7502417</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="b0010"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="h0010"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>O&#x02019;Reilly</surname><given-names>P.H.</given-names></name><name><surname>Brooman</surname><given-names>P.J.</given-names></name><name><surname>Mak</surname><given-names>S.</given-names></name><name><surname>Jones</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name><name><surname>Pickup</surname><given-names>C.</given-names></name><name><surname>Atkinson</surname><given-names>C.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The long-term results of Anderson&#x02013;Hynes pyeloplasty</article-title><source>BJU Int</source><volume>87</volume><year>2001</year><fpage>287</fpage><lpage>289</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">11251517</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="b0015"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="h0015"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bachmann</surname><given-names>A.</given-names></name><name><surname>Ruszat</surname><given-names>R.</given-names></name><name><surname>Forster</surname><given-names>T.</given-names></name><name><surname>Eberli</surname><given-names>D.</given-names></name><name><surname>Zimmermann</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name><name><surname>M&#x000fc;ller</surname><given-names>A.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Retroperitoneoscopic pyeloplasty for ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO): solving the technical difficulties</article-title><source>Eur Urol</source><volume>49</volume><year>2006</year><fpage>264</fpage><lpage>272</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16439056</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="b0020"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="h0020"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Soulie</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name><name><surname>Salomon</surname><given-names>L.</given-names></name><name><surname>Patard</surname><given-names>J.J.</given-names></name><name><surname>Mouly</surname><given-names>P.</given-names></name><name><surname>Manunta</surname><given-names>A.</given-names></name><name><surname>Antiphon</surname><given-names>P.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Extraperitoneal laparoscopic pyeloplasty.
