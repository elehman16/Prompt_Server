After dropout of 16 patients, the remaining 24 patients were randomly divided into two groups; that is, group A for squaric acid dibutylester and group B for diphenylcyclopropenone.

Percentage of hair loss in any of these areas is percentage hair loss multiplied by percent surface area of the scalp in that area.
