It is a dominant cause of disability [<xref rid="pone.0172003.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], long-term sickness absence and early retirement in economically developed countries [<xref rid="pone.0172003.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0172003.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In respect of back pain experienced at work, relevant guidelines promote a biopsychosocial approach that seeks to accommodate workers with LBP rather than removing them from work [<xref rid="pone.0172003.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0172003.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. This transition to a biopsychosocial perspective on LBP presents a difficulty for healthcare professionals when they are unable to respond to patients&#x02019; expectations of a biomedically-based diagnosis. This leads to an inability to effectively explain the condition, which in turn can lead to patients having unhelpful feelings of uncertainty, worry and even helplessness or hopelessness [<xref rid="pone.0172003.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. This suggests that there will be some benefit from providing a novel biological explanation for why the person is experiencing the pain; a simple explanation that is believable, non-threatening, and consistent with the notion of continuing to participate in activity and work.</p><p>A plausible biological component behind non-specific LBP, based on human and porcine studies on the spinal neuromuscular function, has been suggested: LBP can result from a temporary functional disturbance involving abnormal paraspinal muscle activation [<xref rid="pone.0172003.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Termed a &#x02018;functional disturbance&#x02019;-model (or in most studies: the &#x02018;non-injury&#x02019;-model), this explanation was consistent with the emerging concepts present in clinical guidelines that most LBP is not due to permanent spinal damage or disc degeneration [<xref rid="pone.0172003.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0172003.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and that leisure time physical activity and work exposures explain only a small part of degenerative conditions [<xref rid="pone.0172003.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0172003.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Thus, the &#x02018;functional disturbance&#x02019;-model suggests that natural muscle use during leisure and work activities, which is necessary for movement and postural support, will rarely impart harmful spinal loads. Furthermore, the model is based on the studies showing altered muscle activity in persons with LBP (e.g. paraspinal muscles) [<xref rid="pone.0172003.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0172003.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0172003.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and that these alterations are somewhat influenced by a persons&#x02019; beliefs about the association between movement and occurrence of pain [<xref rid="pone.0172003.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0172003.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Therefore, an important element in intervention studies based on the model has been information addressing peoples&#x02019; beliefs about pain and movement [<xref rid="pone.0172003.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0172003.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>Arguably, a simple non-threatening explanation for the pain may contribute to reduce the uncertainty of engaging in physical activity and thus creating a positive circle of movement and pain reduction. In that way the model is consistent with, and supplementary to, other positive messages around spinal strength, resumption of activity, and early return to work, which form the basis of modern information and advice intended to promote helpful beliefs about LBP [<xref rid="pone.0172003.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0172003.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>The delivery of information and advice about LBP can be implemented in various ways, at various times, focused on different outcomes. Population-level delivery through a wide-ranging public health campaign has been shown to improve beliefs of both the general population [<xref rid="pone.0172003.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0172003.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0172003.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and health professionals [<xref rid="pone.0172003.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0172003.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], and can influence medical management and reduce disability and workers&#x02019; compensation costs [<xref rid="pone.0172003.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0172003.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Delivery of that same set of messages has been delivered at the workplace through a simple pamphlet broadcast to the entire workforce, which showed a positive effect on beliefs and a modest reduction in extended absence [<xref rid="pone.0172003.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The same messages have also been delivered just to patients with LBP (as distinct from a mixed population), and showed positive results on clinical outcomes such as pain, fear, beliefs, and disability [<xref rid="pone.0172003.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0172003.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0172003.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The information and advice in all these studies was based around the modern positive approach, but did not include the plausible biomedical explanation for the pain (&#x02018;functional disturbance&#x02019;) proposed by Indahl [<xref rid="pone.0172003.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Evidence from three intervention-studies using the &#x02018;functional-disturbance&#x02019;-model have also shown significant improvement in peoples&#x02019; back beliefs and reduction in LBP-related disability, including sickness absence [<xref rid="pone.0172003.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0172003.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0172003.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Subsequent follow-up studies have argued for long-term effects as well [<xref rid="pone.0172003.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0172003.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. So, it would seem that a common set of messages giving positive information and advice about LBP can have beneficial effects on numerous clinical and participation outcomes, including behaviors as well as beliefs, when delivered in a variety of ways both to patients consulting with back pain, and to populations that include people with and without current back pain. The delivery methods have involved public media, pamphlets, booklets, and talks. However, the unique contribution of the &#x02018;functional-disturbance&#x02019;-message remains unconfirmed. Previous studies have tested the effects of either clinical (three) or workplace (one) interventions combining patient information based on the &#x02018;functional-disturbance&#x02019;-model with other elements (e.g. clinical examination or workplace peer-support) [<xref rid="pone.0172003.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0172003.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>The aim of this study was to test the isolated effect that information based on a &#x02018;functional-disturbance&#x02019; model might have on beliefs and LBP-related behavior, including work participation, in a public workplace setting. The delivery method was in the form of talks to all workers, irrespective of whether they had back pain or not. Thus, the intention of the experimental intervention was to change beliefs and behavior (activity and occupational outcomes), not to influence symptoms or clinical outcomes. The target population for the study was public sector workers, predominantly manual workers, known to be at relatively high risk of sickness absence [<xref rid="pone.0172003.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The hypothesis was that the intervention would result in improved back beliefs across the target population, along with improved LBP-related behavior in those workers who experienced LBP during the year following the intervention.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec007"><title>Methods</title><p>This was a cluster randomized controlled trial, with a 12-months follow-up period. Technical and environmental centers from five municipalities localized in the Eastern part of Denmark agreed to participate in the study. A-priori criterion for municipality participation was that their technical end environmental department was organized in at least two separate centers (a fixed group of employees of varying size performing a unique set of duties) with minimal daily communication or cooperation but with about the same working tasks to enable an intervention and a control group.</p><p>In total, approx. 900 employees, across 11 centers (five municipalities participating with two or in one case three centers each), were invited to recruitment meetings of which 505 consented to participate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0172003.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Only the research team had access to the names of the attendees who had agreed to participate. The primary investigator (PF) performed all tasks related to recruiting municipalities and participants, and arranging follow-up. Recruitment and baseline assessments took place step-wise between 19<sup>th</sup> of November 2012 and 23<sup>rd</sup> of September 2013 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0172003.g002">Fig 2</xref>) as we realized that more municipalities needed to be included to reach the necessary number of participants.

Locally, the disturbance resembles muscle cramps and should be treated the same way (light activity, normal movement patterns, stretching, cold/heat, massage etc.) until the disturbance has resolved and the person has recovered.

Also, examples of situations where pain are often ignored or easily dealt with because it is believed to be non-threatening (e.g. headache, leg cramp))&#x02014;to highlight that pain is not necessarily a sign of danger/injury and that our thoughts/ideas about and attention on pain highly influences the pain experience</p></list-item><list-item><p><underline>Causation</underline>: The unpredictable nature of LBP, the immediate &#x02018;good&#x02019; prognosis for most cases of LBP and theories of what has been proposed to be the main causes for initial and persistent or recurrent LBP; disc degeneration, excessive overload, temporary muscular dysfunction (the &#x02018;functional-disturbance&#x02019;-model) combined with excessive attention on pain, and unhelpful beliefs and behavior.

They were told that they might experience the exercises as helpful in term of relieving pain and if so, could choose to continue doing them.

At baseline, information on demographic factors, job-related factors, lifestyle, self-rated health, LBP history, back beliefs and LBP-behavior was collected from participating workers using a questionnaire. Important baseline items and items on primary and secondary outcomes came from previously validated questionnaires: Core Outcomes Measure Index (COMI), Back Beliefs Questionnaire (BBQ), Work Ability Index (WAI), and Subjective Health Complaints Inventory (SHCI) [<xref rid="pone.0172003.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0172003.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].

Nine items from the baseline questionnaire constituted the items used in follow-up assessments (see &#x02018;Outcomes&#x02019; section).</p><p>The 12-month follow-up period involved monthly data-collections using text messaging (SMS-tracking).

At follow-up, the groups showed no differences in the reports of the number of LBP days. However, the intervention group reported significantly more days of work participation, higher overall workability, fewer visits to healthcare professionals, lower levels of bothersomeness and reduced sadness/depression were found in the intervention group during the follow-up-year. Furthermore, the intervention group reported more positively on back beliefs compared with the controls, when measured six months after attending the talks. Some between-group baseline differences were found, which were most likely caused by the fact that the proportion of manual workers was uneven in the two groups, with higher proportions in the control group. However, we adjusted for baseline reports on most of them: gender, age, smoking, and type of work to control for their influence on the between-group comparison. Thus, it seems reasonable to attribute the between-group differences at follow-up to the intervention. Indeed, the concomitant finding that the intervention group reported more positively on back beliefs compared with the controls six months after having attended the talks, supports that conclusion.</p><p>In general terms, this trial supports those previous studies that provided evidence-informed psychosocial information and advice to groups of people, irrespective of whether they were experiencing back pain [<xref rid="pone.0172003.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0172003.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The primary intentional difference in the present study was the content of the information and advice. While previous psychosocial information has specifically avoided delivering biomedical information on anatomy/physiology and avoided providing a specific biological explanation for the pain, this intervention included both, with a focus on a believable non-threatening explanation for the pain. This approach to information and advice, the &#x02018;functional disturbance&#x02019;-model, has been shown to be effective in other settings [<xref rid="pone.0172003.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0172003.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], and was apparently effective when delivered to groups of workers in educational talks. Also, this approach was seemingly was no worse than the &#x02018;non-bio&#x02019; approach that has been used previously.</p><p>There is, though, an interesting inconsistency in the findings for the primary outcomes. While cut-down days did not differ significantly between groups, days of work participation did differ. Although the two variables seem conceptually somewhat similar, they may be measuring different things, which may represent perceptual or real differences. The message in the talks concerning activity was that light activity during an episode of LBP seems advantageous. However, the perception of &#x02018;light&#x02019; will depend on what is the norm for a given group. If, for instance, the participants usually remain active during LBP episodes, one could hypothesize that the talks may in fact have influenced some participants to reduce their non-work activity as some sort of compensation for continuing work activities. If so, this would potentially mean that even if a proportion became more active, this would not be shown in the present results. In addition, although it could appear from the month-to-month replies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0172003.g003">Fig 3</xref>) that the intervention group had fewer cut down days than the controls, this was not statistically significant. A previous study on the effect of information based on the &#x02018;functional-disturbance&#x02019;-model also using self-reported activity limitations as an outcome, found non-significant trend towards an positive effect of the intervention (information and one stretching exercise) on activity limitations [<xref rid="pone.0172003.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>In terms of the finding on work participation, the previous studies investigating the effect of information on the &#x02018;functional-disturbance&#x02019; model have shown significantly positive effects on work participation [<xref rid="pone.0172003.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0172003.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0172003.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. However, the previous studies all incorporated other elements into their interventions, whereas the present study has tested the isolated effect of the information. Thus, it adds new evidence about the model and indicates that the &#x02018;functional-disturbance&#x02019; information element may be effective. This conclusion is supported by two studies, one qualitative and one quantitative study, both investigating the influences from the information-based workplace intervention tested by Odeen et al. (2013) [<xref rid="pone.0172003.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] on workers&#x02019; behavior/ability to cope with their pain. The qualitative study found that being provided with an explanation to the pain and reassurance that the pain was not a sign of danger helped workers cope with their pain and encouraged them to exceed their previous physical limits due to reduced fear [<xref rid="pone.0172003.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. The quantitative study showed that pain-related fear was a predictor of the effect shown in the study [<xref rid="pone.0172003.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Reducing pain-related fear was mainly addressed in the information-element of the intervention.</p><p>In general, the population-based studies testing simple information-based interventions have been more effective at altering beliefs about back pain than back pain-related behavior outcomes such as work participation [<xref rid="pone.0172003.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0172003.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0172003.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0172003.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Thus, it is notable that four of five studies, including the present, using the model proposed by Indahl (1999) [<xref rid="pone.0172003.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] have shown consistent positive results on both beliefs and work participation, irrespective of their &#x02018;nature&#x02019; as either clinical studies involving LBP patients or population-based studies involving workers with varying LBP status and experience [<xref rid="pone.0172003.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0172003.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0172003.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The fifth study using the model did not measure work participation [<xref rid="pone.0172003.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>The increased work participation in the intervention group coincided with a positive influence on the secondary outcome of work ability. It seems likely that the two outcomes are related as Hagen et al. (2005) suggested, based on an intervention study including patient education, where they showed that reduced self-reported work ability was a predictor for not returning to work [<xref rid="pone.0172003.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. However, contrary to the scale used by Hagen et al. (2005), the WAI used in the present study is not condition specific. Thus, our respondents rated their overall work ability, not solely their work ability related to LBP.</p><p>Another secondary outcome that might have been influenced by the intervention was the frequency of healthcare visits. The use of health care-outcomes has not been part of the previous studies of the &#x02018;functional-disturbance&#x02019;-model, but a recent systematic review concluded that a range of information-based or education-based interventions did not produce significant reductions in the use of health care [<xref rid="pone.0172003.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>].</p><p>There were only slight differences between the results from the per-protocol and the ITT analyses. Thus, the p-values were either lower or higher depending on which variable were assessed. The general picture is that the results from the ITT (main analyses) and per protocol (supplementary analyses) were similar.</p><p>The item &#x02018;Bothersomeness&#x02019; has been shown to be a valid single item for measuring pain severity [<xref rid="pone.0172003.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. The present finding on this outcome indicates that the reassuring information made participants perceive their LBP as less severe, an effect that was also significant in per protocol analyses. Two previous studies testing the effect of information-based interventions also reported positive effects on self-reported severity of symptoms [<xref rid="pone.0172003.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0172003.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], whereas Cherkin et al. (1996) did not find effect of a similar intervention on perceived symptom reliefs [<xref rid="pone.0172003.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Since these studies delivered somewhat different messages in different ways, perhaps the effect on pain depends partly on the nature, style and consistency of the messages, a feature that has been considered previously to be important [<xref rid="pone.0172003.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>].</p><p>Reporting feelings of sadness/depression was reduced by the reassuring information as well. This is something of an unexpected finding since it is difficult to see why (positive) information about back pain, delivered generically outside a healthcare setting, should influence sadness/depression. Indeed one of the previous studies involving information on the &#x02018;non-injury&#x02019;-model found no effect on depression level in patients with subacute LBP [<xref rid="pone.0172003.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. In addition, two studies have explored the effect of self-management programs on chronic pain patients and found contradictory results on the effect of the programs on self-reported depression [<xref rid="pone.0172003.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0172003.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>].</p><p>The results of the present study indicate that the actual information component might, in fact, be the more important part of brief intervention studies such as the former ones on the &#x02018;functional-disturbance&#x02019; model [<xref rid="pone.0172003.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0172003.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. More importantly, perhaps, it adds to the discussion on how simple an effective intervention can/should be. Previous studies have indicated that simple or brief interventions are equally effective as the more complex multidisciplinary interventions in terms of improving various clinical and work-related outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0172003.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0172003.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. In addition, a recent review evaluating the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of most community- and workplace-based interventions to manage musculoskeletal-related sickness absence and job loss suggested a future focus on simple interventions [<xref rid="pone.0172003.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. There is also need to determine the long-term effects of simple interventions. It seems that there can be a long-term effect in terms of belief-change [<xref rid="pone.0172003.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>], but the longer-term effect on behavioral variables is less certain. Nevertheless, two of the previous studies using information on the &#x02018;functional-disturbance&#x02019;-model showed that intervention has the potential to produce longer-lasting effects on work participation [<xref rid="pone.0172003.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0172003.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. A third study based on the model showed that the effect was limited to six months, though, and the authors concluded that perhaps their findings indicate that when providing people with group-based information as the main intervention, the messages needs frequent repetition [<xref rid="pone.0172003.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. In the present study, analyses (12-month means) did not allow us to say anything about how long-lasting the effect might be, but <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0172003.g003">Fig 3</xref> (monthly means of the primary outcomes during the 1-year follow-up) it seems that the effect is not limited to the first six months. Another issue to consider is that of individual versus population intervention. The present study confirms that simple educational interventions can have an influence on work participation for those workers who experience LBP. However, there is a considerable literature supporting the concept of providing individual workplace support (such as transitional work arrangements) to facilitate early return to work (or work retention) for workers experiencing work-relevant back pain [<xref rid="pone.0172003.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0172003.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Furthermore, in recent qualitative studies, workers themselves have suggested that such things as having adjustment latitude/leeway at the workplace improves their possibilities for coping with LBP at work [<xref rid="pone.0172003.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0172003.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>] while low &#x02018;job control&#x02019; has been suggested as a predictor for poor occupational outcomes such as return-to-work [<xref rid="pone.0172003.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. Some of these issues are discussed in detail elsewhere [<xref rid="pone.0172003.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>], but for the present discussion it is, perhaps, sufficient to say that there is seemingly good reason to combine population and individual biopsychosocial educational approaches if work participation behaviors are the target outcomes.</p><p>Since 80% of the participants in our study population were manual workers with half or full day physical work, the findings are highly generalizable to a manual worker population and less generalizable to a general working population.</p><sec id="sec023"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>Risk of bias was markedly reduced by the high response-rates. Thus, the low drop-out rates (&#x0003c;5%) between baseline and follow-up would not be able to influence results notably. It seems plausible that our data collection method (SMS service combined with telephone interview), the manageable number of questions in follow-up data-collections, and the fact that the primary investigator (PF) conducted all steps of the study involving participants contributed to this. Macedo et al. (2012) showed that combining SMS service with telephone interviews improved response rates quite substantially compared to using SMS service alone and concluded that the combination is a feasible way to collect simple data [<xref rid="pone.0172003.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>].</p><p>The choice of a cluster-randomization brought strength to the study by reducing &#x02018;contamination&#x02019; between intervention and control group. Furthermore, ensuring that all five municipalities were represented in both groups reduced potential bias from geographical/cultural differences between clusters.</p><p>The study also had some obvious design-related limitations. The fact that some participants may be have &#x02018;learned&#x02019; that by reporting &#x0201c;0&#x0201d; LBP days they would not have to answer on any more questions is a potential weakness in the design of data-collection. This may have involved bias from the non-detectable proportion of people responding &#x0201c;0&#x0201d; LBP days, when they in fact had days with LBP. However, this factor would equally affect the intervention and control groups, and thus not represent a systematic bias. The randomization resulted in unequal proportions of manual and sedentary workers across the two groups; however we adjusted for these baseline differences (as well as for differences in gender, age, smoking, and type of work) in the statistical analyses. The fact that our data, particularly regarding LBP-related work participation, solely relied on self-report may have produced inaccurate reports, due, for instance, to recall bias of sickness absence days. However, it is notable that our findings on the work participation outcome were in line with those of the previous studies on the &#x02018;functional-disturbance&#x02019;-model, which all used register-based data. This could indicate that such bias was not a big issue in our data. Furthermore, due to municipalities&#x02019; data policies, we were not able to extract information on non-participating employees in order to assess if our population was representative for municipality workers in general. Another limitation is that all outcomes were self-reported and that participants could not&#x02013;due to the nature of the intervention&#x02013;be blinded to group allocation. Thus, placebo effects and reporting bias cannot be ruled out. Finally, the fact that we had to make a guess on the MCID used for power calculation (due to lacking evidence in the existing literature) could be regarded as a limitation as it introduced uncertainty about the precision of our selected sample size. However, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0172003.t001">Table 1</xref>, the SD was 1.2, whereas we had estimated it to be 1.3. Using an SD of 1.2 in a post hoc statistical power calculation the required sample size of each group would be 91 instead of 107. This indicates that we seemingly did include sufficient numbers of participants for the two groups.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec024"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The findings from the present study, and from a similar previous study using educational information on the &#x0201c;functional-disturbance&#x0201d;-model, indicate that providing workers with this kind of information, whether or not they are experiencing back pain, can produce significant alterations in both beliefs and behavior during subsequent back pain episodes. This is analogous to the similar results when the model is delivered to patients in a clinical setting. Future studies should focus on: testing how thorough the information should be; how the long-term effect is; and if the information-based interventions should be added to other relevant elements to be more effective. The results add to the discussion of how little is best when designing interventions with the purpose of reducing the risk of pain-related disability and work loss.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec025"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0172003.s001"><label>S1 Appendix</label><caption><title>S1 CONSORT checklist.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0172003.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0172003.s002"><label>S2 Appendix</label><caption><title>S2 Study_protocol_v24082012_ENGLISH.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0172003.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0172003.s003"><label>S3 Appendix</label><caption><title>S3 Study_protocol_v24082012_ENGLISH.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0172003.s003.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0172003.s004"><label>S4 Appendix</label><caption><title>S4 Corrections study protocol June 2016.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0172003.s004.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We owe great thanks to the participating municipalities and employees for their engagement and great contribution to the study.
