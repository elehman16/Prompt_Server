Predominantly, CR programs include continuous moderate intensity aerobic training (CAT) such as cycling and walking. CAT has been found to be effective in reducing all-cause and cardiac mortality rates [<xref rid="pone.0188551.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0188551.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In contrast, patients were advocated against strenuous physical activity as it may be risky for the heart [<xref rid="pone.0188551.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, recently, more intensive aerobic interval programs (80%-90% of pick aerobic capacity) tested for cardiac patients and were proven safe and more effective than CAT in improving patient's cardiac outcomes and (QoL) [<xref rid="pone.0188551.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Unlike aerobic training, until the early 1990s, resistance training was not included in the physical activity guidelines for individuals with heart conditions [<xref rid="pone.0188551.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, more recent guidelines do acknowledge the possible value of resistance training in CR [<xref rid="pone.0188551.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. More specifically, research shows that resistance training for individuals with cardiovascular diseases (e.g., ischemic heart disease) has numerous beneficial effects on different aspects of health (e.g., metabolic risk factors, functional capacity, psychosocial well-being) [<xref rid="pone.0188551.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0188551.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, these beneficial effects may not be accountable to the central physiological mechanisms involved in left ventricle (LV) recovery post myocardial infarction (MI). Namely, during resistance training, the recruitment of large muscle groups increases vascular peripheral resistance, LV after load and local metabolic anaerobic stress. Consequently, resistance training may reduce LV wall compliance and restrict cardiac function [<xref rid="pone.0188551.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Furthermore, animal studies and research conducted on athletes preforming moderate to high intensity exercise demonstrated enhance LV wall fibrosis and dis-synchrony [<xref rid="pone.0188551.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0188551.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Thus, despite the accomplishment of several studies demonstrating improved LV mechanical remodeling with aerobic training alone, combining resistance training did not demonstrate such benefits [<xref rid="pone.0188551.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>A novel type of circuit training program involves a combination of the two aforementioned training modalities, namely, resistance training set followed immediately by an aerobic exercise interval (a simultaneous aerobic-resistance training method). This type of exercise regimen commonly referred to as super-circuit training (SCT) [<xref rid="pone.0188551.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Physiologically, SCT modality increases global metabolic and hemodynamic demand simultaneously to the anaerobic phase [<xref rid="pone.0188551.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Thus, we presumed, it may produce favorable physiological environments during the resistance phase. Combining a sequence of resistance exercise simultaneously with aerobic exercise (i.e., SCT) is a well-established training modality in healthy athletes [<xref rid="pone.0188551.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0188551.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, the use of SCT in individuals with cardiac conditions (e.g., LV dysfunction) has not been thoroughly investigated, and may favorably induce gains in muscular endurance, strength, and cardiovascular endurance [<xref rid="pone.0188551.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of SCT versus CAT on cardiac mechanical function (using echocardiography) in postMI patients with reduced left ventricular function (RLVF). The secondary aim was to evaluate the different effect of the two programs on non-cardiac clinical outcomes, such as aerobic functional capacity, strength, and QoL. Finally, to assess the feasibility and safety of the SCT modality. We hypothesized that in comparison to the CAT, the SCT modality will yield greater improvements in cardiac function, aerobic functional capacity, strength and QoL. Moreover, the SCT will be feasible and safe.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec007"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec008"><title>Study participants</title><p>Forty-eight consecutive post-MI male patients (aged 47&#x02013;69 Years old) were referred to the CR center at Hadassah Mt.

In the first two weeks of the program, the training intensity was light [(30% of one-repetition maximum (1RM)] and progressively increased to 50% of 1RM. Throughout the training sessions, participants were instructed to maintain appropriate lifting technique, to avoid Valsalva maneuver and to carefully change positions in order to adapt to blood pressure orthostatic changes. Each of the eight aerobic interval included three minutes of: either star trek treadmill, Star trek bike or ThechnoGym hand cycle. Aerobic intensity was designed to be 75%-85% of heart rate reserve. Similar to the CAT group, participant's blood pressure and rate of perceived exertion was monitored. Resting periods between the resistance set and the aerobic interval and between the aerobic interval and the resistance set were monitored and gradually decreased from two minutes in the first two weeks to one minute in weeks seven-to-12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188551.g002">Fig 2</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Outcome measures</title><p>Demographic and clinical background information was collected via patient's interview and from the patient's medical record. In addition, at baseline and post 12-weeks of training, participants completed a battery of tests which evaluated their cardiac function (primary outcome measures), and aerobic functional capacity, strength, and QoL (secondary outcome measures). In addition, factors related to the SCT feasibility and safety were recorded. All outcome measures were established by a blinded technician. Following is a description of the various outcome measures used in this study.</p><sec id="sec014"><title>Primary outcome measures&#x02013;cardiac function</title><p>Cardiac function was evaluated using echocardiography. Echocardiography was performed by experienced cardiologists and technician blinded to the patients&#x02019; group assignment. Participants were examined at rest in the left lateral supine position with a Vingmed Vivid 7 scanner with B-mode ultrasound at a frame rate of 50 Hz. The LV ejection fraction (EF) was calculated by Simpson&#x02019;s biplane method of discs [<xref rid="pone.0188551.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. A pulsed wave Doppler was used in the apical 4-chamber view to obtain mitral inflow velocities to assess LV filling. Peak early and late diastolic transmitral flow velocities (E and A respectively) and the early diastolic wave deceleration time of the transmitral flow was measured, and the ratio of early to late transmitral flow velocities (E/A) calculated. An apical four-chamber image of the color tissue Doppler technique was acquired at a frame rate of69.8&#x02013;147.7 frames/s. The peak early diastolic velocity at the mitral annuli of the interventricular septum (Se&#x02032;), lateral wall (Le&#x02032;) sides and IVRT were measured. Mitral inflow E velocity to tissue Doppler Le&#x02032; ratio was calculated (E/e&#x02019;). The mean value of measurements was used.</p></sec><sec id="sec015"><title>Secondary outcome measures&#x02014;Non-cardiac clinical outcomes</title><p>Aerobic fitness was assessed by using Bruce graded exercise tolerance treadmill protocol (GE Marquette CASE 8000 Exercise Testing System). From the graded exercise tolerance test the participant's pick aerobic capacity and maximal heart rate were determined. Throughout the test, blood pressure, rate of perceived exertion (Borg 1&#x02013;10 scale) and 12-lead electrocardiograph were monitored. The graded exercise tolerance test was terminated if the patient presented a moderate-to-severe angina, a &#x0003e; 10 mmHg decrease in systolic blood pressure with increasing workload, evidence of significant arrhythmia&#x02019;s (such as &#x0003e; 3 premature ventricular contractions in a row), evidence of poor perfusion, unusual or severe shortness of breath, equipment's mal function, or if the patient requested to stop the test. Reasons for patient-initiated termination of the test were leg fatigue, dyspnea, dizziness, or angina. In the current study, only the participant's maximal metabolic equivalent (MET) and rate pressure product (RPP) (RPP = heart rate X systolic blood pressure) are reported.</p><p>Handgrip strength was evaluated using a mechanical dynamometer. During the measurement, the palm faced inward, toward the body. The total palmar hand surface grasped the dynamometer's handle that ran parallel to the knuckles. The dynamometer faced away from the participant, such that the participant could not see and read the gauge [<xref rid="pone.0188551.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Grip strength was used in this study as studies show that decreased grip strength is linked to a higher risk of dying from any cause, dying from heart disease, having a stroke, and a higher risk of heart attack [<xref rid="pone.0188551.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].

The SF-12 contains 12 items representing eight subscales covering the domains of physical functioning, role functioning, bodily pain, general health vitality, social functioning, role-emotional and mental health. Individual subscale scores as well as two composite scores, called the physical component summary score (PCS) and mental component summary score (MCS) can be computed. In this study only the composite scores are reported, with scores ranging from 0 (the lowest level of health) to 100 (the highest level of health).</p></sec><sec id="sec016"><title>Super-circuit training feasibility and safety</title><p>In order to evaluate the feasibility and safety of the SCT, data regarding the program's major and minor adverse events (e.g., hospitalization, syncope, arrhythmia, muscle ache) were recorded.

Moreover, resistance training was not associated with demonstrable benefit in LV remodeling; indeed, the favorable role of aerobic exercise was not established when it was combined with resistance training [<xref rid="pone.0188551.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. This may be because of the heightened systolic and diastolic pressure loading that occurs with resistance training [<xref rid="pone.0188551.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>In our study, echocardiographic measurements demonstrated significant improvements in ventricular mechanical function (i.e., LV EF) only in the SCT group, not in CAT group. The SCT group also significantly improved their diastolic function (i.e., a significant reduction in E/e'). The novelty in this finding is that an improvement in LV mechanical function was achieved by the practice of resistance training circuit, despite the possible LV pressure, associated with resistance training. Our results may be explained by the distinctive hemodynamic interaction of the aerobic intervals with the resistance training sets in SCT: synchronized with the peripheral vasodilatation induced by the aerobic interval, during the resistance set there is an abrupt reduction in systemic peripheral resistance and LV after load. Consequently, we assume, resistance training pressure load remodeling effect is prevented and LV compliance may increase. However, among patients limited by RLVF who were engaged in CAT, it seems likely that the increase in preload did not induce normal Frank-Starling response, suggesting that the increase in ventricular filling do not increase contractility [<xref rid="pone.0188551.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. It is also notable that compared with apparently healthy participants, vascular resistance did not decrease in response to increase in metabolic demand. This may be associated with elevated sympathetic activation [<xref rid="pone.0188551.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Consequently, training effect in CAT may be limited, since hemodynamic responses do not engage in a concurrent increase in stroke volume. In contrast with CAT, the intermittent moderate to high intensity aerobic intervals in SCT may increase stroke volume due to intermediate decrease in peripheral resistance, and farther enhanced by skeletal muscles relaxation at the end of the resistance set.</p></sec><sec id="sec025"><title>Non-cardiac clinical outcomes</title><p>During pre-test the functional capacity for CAT or SCT was similar except for MET, in which the SCT group presented higher values. Despite these differences during pre-test, it is not reasonable to conclude that the overall functional level of the SCT group during pre-test was better than this of the CAT group as no other significant between-group differences were observed.</p><p>Participants in the CAT group did not significantly improve in both MET and RPP. In contrast, the SCT group presented grand significant changes from pre- to post- test in both MET and RPP. These improvements were expected as the SCT group engaged in a aerobic exercise intervals. Accordingly, it has been reported that in comparison to lower intensity training, exercise performed at higher relative intensities elicit a greater increase in aerobic capacity [<xref rid="pone.0188551.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Moreover, the SCT group also engaged in lower extremity strength exercises. It has been suggested that peripheral factors are of special importance in cardiac patients' exercise capacity [<xref rid="pone.0188551.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that a combination of aerobic and lower extremity strength program in the SCT group elicited peripheral changes that in turn impacted positively the participants' aerobic capacity.</p><p>Both CAT and SCT groups significantly improved their strength performance from pre- to post-test. CAT group has improved strength although it did not perform resistant training exercises. This could be attributed to CR induced recovery of patients' physical condition as seen in the parameters measured including muscle strength. Moreover, strength performance measurements were made using the handgrip dynamometer, which is also a non-specific common index for general well-being physical state [<xref rid="pone.0188551.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. However, at post-test the SCT group strength was significantly greater than that of the CAT group. The greater mean strength in the SCT group was not surprising as SCT group engaged not only in aerobic training but also in resistance training. Nonetheless, CAT group strength ES was greater than that observed in the SCT group (Tab. <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0188551.t002">2</xref>). These results may be related to the greater strength performance variability in the SCT group as compared to the CAT group. The improvement in muscular strength is of clinical relevance as patients with cardiac diseases exhibit impaired muscular strength and skeletal muscle atrophy [<xref rid="pone.0188551.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0188551.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p><p>In the current study both training groups CAT and SCT, significantly improved their physical and mental QoL from pre- to post-test. Similarly, within the cardiac disease population, numerous investigators reported significant improvements in patient&#x02019;s QoL following physical exercises [<xref rid="pone.0188551.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0188551.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. However, in post-test, PCS of the SCT group was significantly higher than that observed in the CAT group. The SF-12 items may help in understanding this between groups difference. The SF-12 includes questions pertaining to the degree in which one's health limits the ability to engage in activities such as moving a table and pushing a vacuum cleaner. Accordingly, an increase in both muscle strength and maximal MET is expected to improve the aforementioned SF-12 items. As compared to the CAT group the SCT group exhibited greater improvement in both strength and MET, such improvement may be accountable to the greater physical QoL observed in that group.</p></sec><sec id="sec026"><title>Super-circuit training feasibility and safety</title><p>High level of physical activity is associated with low risk of mortality and cardiovascular disease [<xref rid="pone.0188551.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0188551.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. However, it is advocated that vigorous activity may increase the risk of sudden cardiac death in susceptible persons. As in the current study no exercise related adverse events occurred in the SCT program, we concluded that the training regimen was safe. Similarly, in a study which evaluated the effects of aerobic and resistance exercise training on patients with heart conditions Maiorana et. Al, [<xref rid="pone.0188551.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] reported that no significant adverse events occurred during training sessions. In a more recent study by Rognmo et al., [<xref rid="pone.0188551.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], it has been reported that in a large sample of patients with coronary heart disease (n = 4,846), the risk of a cardiovascular event is low after both high and moderate-intensity exercise. Likewise, the results of our current study suggest that SCT is feasible and safe. Therefore, such program should be considered among patients with coronary heart disease.</p><p>In conclusion, this study showed that men with RLVF, post MI stand to benefit from both aerobic training alone (CAT) and SCT. However, in comparison to aerobic training alone, SCT may yield greater benefits to the LV mechanical function as well as to the patient's aerobic function, and physical QoL. Moreover, despite the moderate to high intensity used in the SCT, it was found to be feasible and safe.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec027"><title>Limitations</title><p>Our current study was subjected to several limitations. Due to a limited budget, we had to limit the number of participants in the study. We therefore chose to focus on one gender group in order to maintain the homogeneity of the results. Hence, the generalizability of the results might be questioned owing to the small sample size in each study group.</p><p>In addition, central cardiac and physiological peripheral hemodynamics, were not measured for participants during the training sessions and thus should be farther examined to substantiate the mechanisms associated with SCT training affect</p><p>Last, our study was limited in time (12-weeks of CR), in which CAT did not improve cardiac function. Although number of previous studies showed that a longer period of training (6-month of CAT) could induce an improvement in left ventricular function [<xref rid="pone.0188551.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0188551.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. However, in our study, no significant change in LV chamber&#x02019;s size was noticed. We did not detected changes in the diastolic volume whereas end systolic volume showed a tendency of improvement that was not significant. However, it is possible that in a longer period of CR exercise training, this tendency would have become significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec028"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0188551.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Consort checklist done.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0188551.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0188551.s002"><label>S2 File</label><caption><title>Consort chart flow.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0188551.s002.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0188551.s003"><label>S3 File</label><caption><title>Helsinkidata 440 original protocol Hebrew.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0188551.s003.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0188551.s004"><label>S4 File</label><caption><title>Protocol translated to English.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0188551.s004.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0188551.s005"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Data plos.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0188551.s005.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0188551.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Shephard</surname><given-names>RJ</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Balady</surname><given-names>GJ</given-names></name>. <article-title>Exercise as cardiovascular therapy</article-title>. <source>Circulation</source>. <year>1999</year>; <volume>99</volume>: <fpage>963e72</fpage>.<pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">10027821</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0188551.ref002"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Adachi</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Koike</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Obayashi</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Umezawa</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Aonuma</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Inada</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name>, <etal>et al</etal>
