Diseases of the digestive system have been found to contribute to a higher symptom burden in a population of Swedish free-living older adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Acute and chronic diarrhea is frequently observed often resulting in an aberrant stool pattern restricting the older adults&#x02019; everyday life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. A well functioning gastrointestinal tract is essential for older adults to experience life-satisfaction and meaningfulness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Today, little is known about the mechanisms behind age-associated gut problems and few treatment options designed only for older adults exist. Hence, therapeutic strategies able to treat gastrointestinal discomfort might impact the overall health status and personal integrity among the oldest old.</p><p id="Par8">The diversity of the gut microbiota has been identified as a major contributor to gut health and is known to influence the intestinal barrier function (e.g. the capacity of the intestine to act as a wall against bacterial products and food antigens and yet being able to take up nutrients), as well as being vital for a well-functioning immune system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Moreover, the gut microbiota has recently been identified as an important player in the gut-brain axis, linking emotional and cognitive centers of the brain with peripheral intestinal functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Therapies able to beneficially affect the gut microbiota composition, such as probiotic bacteria (e.g. live bacterial strains expressing beneficial health effects on the host), might alleviate gastrointestinal discomfort and increase overall health status among older adults.</p><p id="Par9">The probiotic species <italic>L. reuteri</italic> is an endogenous organism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] able to modulate the gut microbiota through the production of reuterin, a potent antibacterial compound, capable of inhibiting a wide spectrum of microorganisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. <italic>L. reuteri</italic> has been identified as a promising therapy in various gastrointestinal disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], including functional chronic constipation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Here, we aim to conduct a double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled study with the aim to investigate digestive health after the intake of a dietary supplement, consisting of the probiotic strain <italic>L. reuteri</italic>, during a three-month period. Furthermore, we evaluated whether a change in digestive health correlated to an improved subjective perception of wellbeing, and lower levels of depression, anxiety and stress.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study participants</title><p id="Par10">The study population was recruited through advertisements in local and regional newspapers. At senior living homes information meetings were held and flyers were handed out to all residents. The study population was recruited from the region of &#x000d6;rebro, within a 45&#x000a0;km radius from the City center. Residents at the senior living homes were invited to participate after careful presentation of the protocol, individual discussion if needed, and signing of the consent form. A total population of 307 eligible free-living older adults (mean age 73.1, range 65-98) was recruited between January and March 2013. All participants lived in their own home.

</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par19">This study was a double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial enrolling free-living older adults (&#x02265;65&#x000a0;years) representing the general population in the region of &#x000d6;rebro, Sweden. The treatment period was 12&#x000a0;weeks and the intervention parameters were evaluated at week 0, 8 and 12. All subjects entered the intervention phase within two weeks. Two weeks prior follow up a reminder was sent by mail to all participants with a suggestion of day and time to meet or phone their contact person (assigned at enrolment). The participants were asked to confirm the time one-week prior follow up. Three phone calls were placed on three consecutive days to participants not responding to the letter. As a final step a home visit was made on the day assigned for follow up. The contact person assisted the study participant to assure that the questionnaires were answered correctly. A study diary was provided to all participants were the daily stool frequency was monitored and new medications were reported. The active study product consisted of a stick-pack containing freeze-dried <italic>L. reuteri</italic> DSM 17938 (1&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>8</sup> colony forming units/stick-pack), rhamnose, galactooligosaccharide and maltodextrin to a total weight of 1&#x000a0;g. The placebo product consisted of maltodextrin with the same appearance, color and taste as the active study product, identically packaged and stored. The study product was packed and labeled by BioGaia AB. Active and placebo stick-packs were packed identically with the number of the subject and storing instructions. All products were blinded and randomized by BioGaia AB. For the research team, a blinded randomization list was provided with the subject sequence and subject number. The research team allocated the study participants by randomly assigning the pre-labeled study product to the participants and a screening record in which all screened subjects were registered. For each subject enrolled, date of enrolment and ID number of the trial subject was recorded. The identity of the specific product was blinded to all subjects, contact persons and investigators. The coding was only known to the representative of the BioGaia AB responsible for product randomization and had no other involvement in the trial. All other personnel at Bio Gaia AB involved in the study as well as the research team and study staff remained blinded to the study treatment until completion of the statistical analysis and discussion of the findings.</p><p id="Par20">A statistical power calculation was performed on GSRS data from the first 100 participants indicating that 74.2&#x000a0;% of older adults suffer from gastrointestinal discomfort (judged by a score of &#x0003e;2 at any domain of GSRS). A sample size of 150 per group (300 in total) provided 80&#x000a0;% power with 95&#x000a0;% confidence interval to detect a minimum clinical improvement in gastrointestinal discomfort of 20&#x000a0;% among the intervention arm and 5&#x000a0;% of the placebo arm. Based on these calculations a decision was made to aim to include at least 200 subjects in each group, 400 in total, to assure that the study was adequately powered. In total 307 study participants were recruited of these 290 were enrolled and randomized (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).

DSM17938 is a well-studied probiotic strain and has been found to exert a positive effect on constipation and diarrhea in adults and are currently used as treatment of colic in infants in Sweden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. To our knowledge this is the first study investigating the effect of <italic>L reuteri</italic> in free-living older adults. However, 12&#x000a0;weeks of treatment failed to show a difference in any of the outcome measures.</p><p id="Par41">The study aimed to include a population of older adults representing the general population. This is an important group to investigate in a healthy aging perspective, as these older adults in the near future will be in need of elevated health care. Thus, it is within this group it is important to perform interventions that will promote health and optimal functionality through out life.</p><p id="Par42">The study population reported a mean GSRS score of 1.9&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.8, suggesting that a large proportion of the study participants did experience no or mild gut complaints, results that are in line with our previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Thus, the study population was also comprised of persons experiencing no gastrointestinal symptoms, without the possibility to experience an improvement during the intervention. It is therefore likely that the outlined study would have gained from a larger sample size and/or a more homogenous population focusing on one particular gut problem. It is, however, important to consider that one can expect rather modest treatment effects of probiotic compounds. Thus, a population experiencing severe gut problems might not be responsive to a probiotic effect.</p><p id="Par43">The enrolled study population was found to experience a better health status as judged by the low use of prescribed medications according to reports from the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. It should be noted that self-reporting of medication in this age-group is problematic and often result in under-reporting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. However, in this study data regarding medication was collected in the home of the older adult with supported from the contact person.</p><p id="Par44">Another aspect to consider in the RCT is the use of GSRS as primary outcome measure. An additional more fine tuned instrument such as the ROME III symptom criteria, specifically developed for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), might have increased the sensitivity and allowed for detection of more subtle changes in gastrointestinal health throughout the study. In addition, it is a risk that subjects suffering from IBS were not identified and monitored throughout the study. However, it should be noted that IBS patients responding positive to ROME III symptom criteria commonly display more severe symptoms as measured by GSRS modified for IBS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Thus, it is likely that participants suffering from IBS were included in the study, but, nevertheless, it is a limitation that these subjects could not be specifically identified, as that would have been an important finding and allowed for sub analyses.</p><p id="Par45">Another reason for the negative outcome might be a too low dose of <italic>L. reuteri</italic>. The dose was identical to a previous clinical trial, reporting positive effects of <italic>L. reuteri</italic> on constipation in adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. However, <italic>L. reuteri</italic> has been found to be more prevalent in subjects over 66&#x000a0;years of age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Thus, suggesting that a higher dose might be needed in order to obtain a positive effect in older adults.</p><p id="Par46">In addition, an inadequate number of study participants were enrolled. Five hundred eleven older adults in the region of &#x000d6;rebro responded to our advertisement and notified their interest to participate in the study. Three hundred and seven was still interested to participate after receiving an information letter regarding the study. However, given the low number of participants that were included in the final analysis (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;249), additional recruitment strategies should have been applied. Thus, the study was underpowered. In addition, we made the decision to exclude 71 subjects from the final analysis as PPI and GMMS was found to affect and interfere with the primary outcome parameter.</p><p id="Par47">Use of PPI have been found to be associated with enteric <italic>Clostridium difficile</italic> infection (CDI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. CDI is commonly associated with diarrhea and long-term use of antibiotics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Thus, PPIs have the potential to affect the composition of the gut microbiota and stool frequency. In the current study antibiotic use the last six months prior study start was an exclusion criterion. It is therefore likely that no subject suffered from <italic>Clostridium difficile</italic> associated diarrhea. Nevertheless, given the potential of PPI to affect the gastrointestinal tract use of PPI should have been an exclusion criterion, particularly as we were not able to recruit a sample size that allowed for sub analysis.</p><p id="Par48">GMMS is frequently used in the treatment of constipation and diarrhea among older adults, regulating the intestinal motility and stool frequency. Clearly, it would have been a benefit for the study to set use of GMMS as an exclusion criterion. However, in a pilot study it was observed that older adults declined participation when asked not to take GMMS during a month. Hence, we decided to analyze the effect of GMMS intake in subsequent sub analysis after study finish.</p><p id="Par49">In addition, 33 participants had to be excluded due to missing or incomplete CRF. It is possible that data from these participants would have an impact on the results. However, we would still not reach the minimal required sample size (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;150) per arm. In addition, 28 questionnaires (HADS: 11; PSS: 17), had to be excluded from the analysis due to missing values. For both PSS and HADS no more than one item can be missed in order for the questionnaire to be included in the analysis. Given that 249 participants were included in the final analysis the excluded questionnaires represent a modest proportion and complete data sets would probably not affect the outcome for the secondary parameters radically. It is interesting to note that no items were missed when the study participants filled out GSRS, the primary outcome measure. Further, emphasizing that this instrument is easy and works well in an older population. All participants did fulfill the inclusion criteria and were mentally fit to complete the questionnaires. Only eight participants scored below 26 on the Mini mental state exam (MMSE), indicating mild cognitive impairment (data not shown). However, mild cognitive impairment rarely causes changes severe enough to interfere with daily life or independent function and probably did not affect their ability to complete the questionnaires.</p><p id="Par50">Even though the trial had a negative outcome on the primary parameter we did observe a modest effect of probiotic treatment on stress level at week 8 and 12. Similarly, we found that subjects suffering from indigestion and abdominal pain, respectively, showed a significant decrease of anxiety at week 8 after probiotic treatment, but not at week 12. Similar findings have previously been reported and probiotic treatment has been found to have an influence on anxiety, as measured by HADS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. It should, however, be noted that our results are based on self-reported data and thus, rely on the respondents&#x02019; honesty, accurate understanding and interpretation on the questions asked. Furthermore, it is important to point out that the findings presented here have not been corrected for multiple comparisons, thus the <italic>p</italic>-values shown are only descriptive and should be interpreted with caution.</p><p id="Par51">In addition, the study product used in the study also contained galactooligosaccharide a well-known prebiotic fiber, known to have a positive impact on the gut microbiota [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Thus, we cannot exclude that the modest effects observed in the trial is due to a synbiotic effect.</p><p id="Par52">Despite the negative outcome, the results outlined in the present study highlights important issues that needs to be taken into consideration when designing clinical trials in older adults, particularly the high drop out rate in this part of the population is essential to reflect upon before starting the recruitment process.</p><p id="Par53">In addition, it is evident that promoting gut health is important in order to increase the over all health status among older adults. Further studies will have to thoroughly investigate the gut-brain axis and how this signaling pathway changes with age. It will particularly be important to investigate the relationship between common gut problems, such as constipation and diarrhea, and the composition of the gut microbiota in older adults. This will gain insight on how aging affects gastrointestinal function and will be essential knowledge to build on when designing new RCTs to elucidate the effect of pro- and prebiotic compounds in older adults.</p></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par54">The RCT failed to show any improvement in digestive health after daily intake of a supplement containing the probiotic strain <italic>L. reuteri</italic> during a three-month period. Neither was any significant improvement in wellbeing, stress or anxiety observed. Even though the trial had a negative outcome, the study highlights important issues that need to be taken into consideration when designing clinical trials in older adults. Furthermore, it is evident that promoting gut health may impact the over all health status, including mental health, among older adults.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Dr M&#x000e5;rten Lindqvist for providing valuable help with the extensive data analysis and Dr Johnny Karlsson for logistic help throughout the study.
