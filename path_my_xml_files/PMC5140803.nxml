with chronic lumbar pain affect postural control and low back pain. [Subjects and Methods]
Ten subjects were randomly selected and allocated to each a group wearing soft lumbosacral
orthoses and a group wearing rigid lumbosacral orthoses. They wore the lumbosacral
orthoses for 4 weeks. Pain index and postural control were measured on the first day of
wearing lumbosacral orthoses and 4 weeks later. Pain index was evaluated using a visual
analogue scale, and postural control was measured using a Balance measurement system. The
measurements examined included the overall balance index, anteroposterior balance index,
and mediolateral balance index. [Results] There were statistically meaningful within-group
differences in all variables, the visual analogue scale, overall balance index,
anteroposterior balance index, and mediolateral balance index, in the group wearing soft
lumbosacral orthoses. There were meaningful differences in visual analogue scale, overall
balance index, and mediolateral balance index in the group wearing rigid lumbosacral
orthoses. Furthermore, there was a meaningful difference in anteroposterior balance index
between the group wearing soft lumbosacral orthoses and the group wearing rigid
lumbosacral orthoses. [Conclusion] The results of the present study showed that wearing
soft lumbosacral orthoses was more effective than wearing rigid lumbosacral orthoses.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Soft lumbosacral orthoses</kwd><kwd>Rigid lumbosacral orthoses</kwd><kwd>Low back pain</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Low back pain is a pain appearing between 12th rib and hip with or without leg pain<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. It is one of the most common diseases, and
the prevalence rate of this disease is 60 to 85% over the course of an entire lifetime and
15 percent among adults<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. About 10% of patients with low back pain have low back pain
for more than 6 weeks, and 5% of these patients have pain for more than 3 months. So low
back pain brings about a decline in physical activity due to difficulties faced in daily
living and emotional stress. It has negative effects such as muscle atrophy, decrease of
muscle strength and bone density, and deformation of the musculoskeletal system through loss
of the balance of the normal spine<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Patients with low back pain are given improper sensory information on the location of the
body in relation to gravity and supporting surfaces due to changes in the character and
quantity of proprioceptive inputs from muscle spindles, Golgi tendon organs, joints, and
skin receptors<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Various problems occur in
the somatosensory system of patients with chronic low back pain. Decrease of the mobility
and stability of the waist occurs in these patients, and these bring about a decline of
muscle strength and coordination capability and a change in proprioception<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.
These disabilities of the musculoskeletal system affect balance performing ability and limit
use of a proper exercise strategy in perturbation<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. In particular, patients with low back pain have a decreased balance
ability compared with normal individuals<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.
When the human body is exposed to an unexpected load, muscles have to respond quickly to
maintain the body&#x02019;s balance and posture against the load. It is said that patients with low
back pain will have problems with balance and maintaining posture caused by a delayed
response time<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. In patients with low back pain, wearing an orthosis is considered a
method of solving these problems, as it provides mechanical support and psychological
stability. As a result, it decreases low back pain by decentering the weight of the upper
body concentrated on the waist<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. In
particular, it is said that it can stabilize the lumbosacral area by decreasing lordosis and
segmental movement of the lumbar body<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Orthoses can be divided into soft and rigid orthoses according to the material comprising
them. Soft orthoses are called corsets or belts and are made from a neoprene material. They
can increase the intra-abdominal pressure and improve low back pain by altering the muscles
around the trunk and abdomen. Rigid orthoses are made from polyethylene and are prescribed
to limit movement of the spine locally or segmentally<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. There is lack of
research on comparing these two types of orthoses. Therefore, the aim of this study was to
investigate how application of these two types of lumbosacral orthoses to patients with
chronic low back pain affects postural control and low back pain.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The institutional review board of Sehan University approved the research ethics of this
research as a clinical trial (document number 2016-2), and all subjects understood the
purpose of the study very well and provided written informed consent prior to participation
in the study, in accordance with the ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinki.
Twenty patients with chronic low back pain were registered as subjects for this prospective
experimental research. The experiment was conducted during the 4 weeks starting on March 14,
2016, and ending on April 8, 2016. This research selected subjects who had low back pain for
more than 3 months and no vestibular disease or disease in the ear, nose, and throat.
Furthermore, it selected patients who had no neuropsychiatric impairments, visual handicaps,
or episodes of dizziness or mild headache. Ten subjects were randomly assigned to each of a
group wearing soft orthoses and a group wearing rigid orthoses (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Characteristics of the subjects</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Variables</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Soft orthoses group (n=10)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Rigid orthoses group (n=10)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (years)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">59.4 &#x000b1; 5.4<sup>a</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">57.3 &#x000b1; 6.2</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Height (cm)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">161.1 &#x000b1; 4.72</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">161.8 &#x000b1; 7.79</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Weight (kg)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">60.9 &#x000b1; 7.46</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">60.4 &#x000b1; 7.85</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><sup>a</sup>Mean &#x000b1; SD</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap>). They wore the orthoses for 4 weeks, and the pain index and postural control
were measured on the first day they wore the orthoses and 4 weeks later. Pain index was
evaluated using a visual analogue scale (VAS). Postural control was measured using a Biodex
System 3 isokinetic dynamometer (Biodex Medical System, Shirley, New York, USA). Subjects
stood on a fixed foot plate for measurement of postural control. The foot plate was set such
that it could move within a range of 5 degrees so that the central point of the subjects
could be adjusted before testing. It has the following limits with respect to movement: 8
degrees anterior, 4 degrees posterior, and 16 degrees lateral. The mean angle out of center
based on biomechanics was measured and converted into a stability index. A low stability
index indicates a stable state, and a high stability index indicates an unstable state. The
measurements examined included the overall balance index (OBI), anteroposterior balance
index (API), and mediolateral balance index (MBI). The change in overall movement was
measured with the OBI, the change in the sagittal plane was measured with the API, and the
change in the coronal plane was measured with the MBI. Data analysis was performed using
PASW Statistics for Windows, Version 18.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA), and the general
characteristics of the subjects were tested for normality using the Shapiro-wilk test. The
paired t-test was used to compare changes within groups, i.e., the rigid orthoses group and
soft orthoses group. ANCOVA was used to compare changes between groups. The significance
level was set to &#x003b1;=0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The results of comparison by paired t-test between before and after application of the

wearing soft lumbosacral orthoses and rigid lumbosacral orthoses for 4 weeks in 20 subjects
with chronic low back pain (10 in each group) to investigate the effects on postural control
and pain. It has been reported that patients with low back pain exhibit a decrease in
endurance, decrease in flexibility, and limited range of motion and also that these symptoms
affect balance ability compared with normal individuals<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Lumbosacral orthoses for
patients with low back pain can decrease low back pain and help to improve balance ability
by stabilizing the lumbosacral area<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Redford et al.<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that lumbosacral orthoses used a lot by patients
with low back pain can mitigate pain by limiting movement of the trunk and decreasing the
load on the waist by transmitting forces applied to intervertebral discs to soft tissue
surrounding the abdomen. Million et al.<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>
divided their subjects into a group wearing a lumbosacral corset and a group not wearing the
corset. They showed that pain decreased in the group wearing the lumbosacral corset. Sinaki
et al.<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that wearing a spinal
weighted kypho-orthosis can increase location awareness of the vertebral joint or
proprioception, in improve balance and walking quality, and decrease low back pain by
increasing the strength of the back extensor muscle patients with osteoporosis-kyphosis over
60&#x02005;years old and at risk of falls. The present study supported advanced research through the
result that pain decreased in both groups, i.e., the soft lumbosacral orthoses and rigid
lumbosacral orthoses groups. It is considered that the mechanical characteristics of
lumbosacral orthoses decrease pain by increasing the stability of the spine and pelvis. Vogt
et al.<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup> showed that lumbosacral orthoses
can increase joint position sense by increasing afferent proprioceptive inputs through
mechanoreceptors of the skin and facilitate voluntary extension of the spine, improve
posture, and decrease lordosis of the spine effectively by providing presentment about
proper skill of movement and that it can help to maintain proper posture in the lumbar
vertebrae via the three-point pressure principle. Kawaguchi et al.<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that a lumbar orthosis increased the muscle
strength of the back and abdomen and decreased muscle activity in their study of 31 men. It
is said that a lumbar orthosis can enable muscles to work effectively to perform a task.
Ivanic et al.<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that the soft
spine orthosis, as a corset type, is designed to increase passive stability and uprightness
of the waist compared with those resulting from use of a rigid spine orthosis. They also
said that soft lumbosacral orthoses are more effective than rigid lumbosacral orthoses. The
present study showed that OBI, API and MBI decreased meaningfully between before and after
the experiment in the soft orthoses group but that there were meaningful differences in only
OBI and MBI in the rigid orthoses group. These result showed that the soft orthoses were
more effective than the rigid orthoses in the present study. This supports the findings of
previous studies indicating that orthoses do not affect the activity of the abdominal
muscles or the ability of the lumbar vertebrae joints in spite of the fact that they became
the cause of a decrease in muscle activities or the cause of stiffness in the waste<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. The API represents the change in postural control in the sagittal
plane. Rigid orthoses are mainly prescribed to protect the spine or facilitate healing and
to limit movement of the spine locally or segmentally<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. It has also been reported that spinal orthoses affect erector
spinae muscle more than abdominal muscles<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. A rigid orthosis limits the movement of the spine by more than a
soft orthosis. So, it is considered that a rigid orthosis affects a change in postural
control in the sagittal plane by decreasing the activities of muscles surrounding the waste.
These result will help to prepare baseline data providing related information with proper
mediation about wearing lumbosacral orthoses rightly. The limitations of this study included
that there was no control group and a lack of diversity with respect to the experiment
period. Also, the duration the subjects wore the orthoses was not controlled exactly, and it
was difficult to generalize. It is considered that prospective studies controlling the study
period and duration the orthoses are worn exactly and including a control group will be
needed on the utility of orthoses prescribed as a therapy method for patients with low back
pain.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This paper was supported by the Sehan University Research Fund in 2016.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Krismer</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>van Tulder</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group>, Low Back Pain Group of the Bone and Joint Health Strategies for Europe
