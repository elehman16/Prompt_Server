We investigated the indirect effect of 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV-7) on pneumococcal acquisition in newborn Gambian babies.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Twenty-one villages were randomised to receive PCV-7 to all subjects (11 vaccinated villages) or to infants aged 2&#x02013;30 months (10 control villages). Other control villagers received Meningococcal C conjugate vaccine. From 328 babies born during the trial, nasopharyngeal swabs were collected after birth, then weekly until 8 weeks of age when they received their first dose of PCV-7. Pneumococcal carriage and acquisition rates were compared between the study arms and with a baseline study.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>57.4% of 2245 swabs were positive for <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>. Overall carriage was similar in both arms. In vaccinated villages fewer infants carried pneumococci of vaccine serotypes (VT) (16.9% [31/184] vs. 37.5% [54/144], p&#x0003c;0.001) and more carried pneumococci of non-vaccine serotypes (NVT) (80.9% [149/184] vs. 75.7% [109/144], p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.246). Infants from vaccinated villages had a significantly lower acquisition rate of VT (HR 0.39 [0.26&#x02013;0.58], p&#x0003c;0.001) and increased acquisition of NVT (HR 1.16 [0.87&#x02013;1.56], p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.312). VT carriage (51.6% vs. 37.5%, p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;031 in control and 46.1% vs. 16.8%, p&#x0003c;0.001 in vaccinated villages) and acquisition rates (HR 0.68 [0.50&#x02013;0.92], p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.013 in control villages and HR 0.31 [0.19&#x02013;0.50], p&#x0003c;.001 in vaccinated villages) were significantly lower in both study arms than in the baseline study. NVT carriage (63.2% vs. 75.7%, p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.037 in control and 67.2% vs. 75.3%, p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.005 in vaccinated villages) and acquisition rates (HR 1.48 [1.06&#x02013;2.06], p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.022) and (HR 1.52 [1.11&#x02013;2.10], p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.010 respectively) were significantly higher.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>PCV-7 significantly reduced carriage of VT pneumococci in unvaccinated infants.

In the Gambia, pneumococcal carriage rates are high and colonisation commences very soon after birth, before the recommended age for administration of the first dose of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine <xref rid="pone.0049143-1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Any additional indirect, or herd, protection of unvaccinated babies would potentially be of major public health benefit.</p><p>Clinical trials of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines among children in South Africa <xref rid="pone.0049143-Klugman1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> and The Gambia <xref rid="pone.0049143-Cutts1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> have shown efficacy against invasive pneumococcal disease comparable to that demonstrated in the US <xref rid="pone.0049143-Whitney2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049143-Black2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. In addition, carriage of pneumococcal serotypes included in the vaccine was reduced in the vaccinees <xref rid="pone.0049143-Cheung1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. A cluster Randomized Clinical Trial (RCT) has now documented a reduction in nasopharyngeal carriage of VT pneumococci and a non-significant increase in the prevalence of pneumococci of non-vaccine type (NVT) among unvaccinated subjects 30 months of age and older <xref rid="pone.0049143-Roca1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. To evaluate the indirect effect of pneumococcal vaccination in infants prior to the age of vaccination, a longitudinal carriage study was conducted, as part of this trial, in newborns during their first 8 weeks of life.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study population</title><p>Twenty-one villages in Sibanor, Western Region, The Gambia, were selected as being representative of rural areas in The Gambia, as described previously <xref rid="pone.0049143-Hill1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Study design</title><p>This single blind, cluster randomized (by village) trial was approved by the joint MRC/Gambia Government Ethics Committee. The conduct of the trial was guided by a Data Safety and Monitoring Board. The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information; see Checklist S1 and Protocol S1. Written informed consent was obtained from the leaders of the communities and from individual participants. The 21 villages were randomly assigned to one of two groups. All participants above the age of 30 months in vaccine group villages received 1 dose of PCV-7 (Prevenar)(Wyeth Lederle Pediatric Vaccines) whilst individuals in this age group resident in the control villages received 1 dose of meningococcal polysaccharide C conjugate vaccine. Younger children in both groups received PCV-7 (1&#x02013;3 doses according to age group at first dose). Children born during the trial received 3 doses of PCV-7 starting at 2 months of age. This trial was conducted according to the principles of International Conference on Harmonization - Good Clinical Practice guidelines. Details of the randomisation and other methods employed in the trial have been previously described <xref rid="pone.0049143-Roca1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.</p><p>The vaccinated and control villages were similar at the start of the trial with respect to their basic characteristics, although the Mandinka ethnic group was over-represented in vaccinated communities <xref rid="pone.0049143-Roca1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. All infants born in the study villages between July 2006 and May 2008 were eligible to participate in this ancillary study. The primary outcome measure in this study was carriage of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>, considered for the primary analysis in two groups: vaccine type and non-vaccine type pneumococci. A nasopharyngeal swab was collected as soon as possible after delivery, and then weekly until 8 weeks of age when infants were vaccinated with PCV-7 according to the study protocol. Commencement of pneumococcal vaccination from this age was the basis for the 8 week sampling period. The trial was completed prior to introduction of routine PCV-7 into the national immunisation program.</p><p>A baseline cross-sectional survey of pneumococcal carriage undertaken two years prior to the trial showed a high prevalence of pneumococcal carriage that was similar in vaccinated and control villages <xref rid="pone.0049143-Hill1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. In another subsequent baseline study, two hundred and thirty-six newborn infants were enrolled in a longitudinal study of pneumococcal acquisition and had a nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) collected at birth, 2 weekly till 6 months of age and then monthly till the end of their first year of life <xref rid="pone.0049143-Hill2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Carriage data from the baseline (pre-vaccination) study in infants provided a comparison with the carriage data in the ancillary study of the randomised trial.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Sample size determination</title><p>A previous pre-vaccination baseline survey showed that the prevalence of carriage of pneumococci of vaccine type was approximately 40% in infants up to the age of 2.5 months and approximately 30% in those aged 30 months or more <xref rid="pone.0049143-Hill2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. The coefficient of variation between villages was 0.3. Assuming that the study would recruit at least 200 newborns, we calculated that we would have over 90% power, with a type1 error of 5%, to detect a 50% reduction in pneumococcal carriage of vaccine type.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Sampling process</title><p>Nasopharyngeal samples were collected using calcium alginate-tipped swabs (Fisher Scientific, USA). Swabs were inoculated immediately into skim milk tryptone glucose glycerol (STGG) transport medium, placed in a cold box and transferred to the MRC laboratories in Fajara within 8 hours of collection in accordance with the World Health Organisation standard protocol <xref rid="pone.0049143-OBrien1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Inoculated vials were stored at &#x02212;70&#x000b0;C until they were tested in batches.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Laboratory analysis</title><p>Frozen STGG vials containing swabs were thawed at room temperature and then vortexed for a minimum of 20 seconds. 10 &#x000b5;L aliquot of thawed STGG media was inoculated onto a specific selective medium (gentamicin blood agar). Pneumococcal isolation and serotyping were carried out using standard methods as described previously <xref rid="pone.0049143-Adegbola1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Data management and statistical analysis</title><p>All data were double entered into a Microsoft access database and checked for errors. Vaccine serotypes were defined as those contained in PCV-7 (4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F and 23F) and serotype 6A. Non-vaccine serotypes were defined as all other serotypes, including non-typeable pneumococci <xref rid="pone.0049143-Hill1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049143-Hill2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Acquisition was defined as isolation of <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> for the first time. Differences in carriage prevalence of vaccine groups and individual pneumococcal serotypes were tested using generalized linear models of the binomial family with an identity link to estimate risk differences, using a clustered robust variance estimator to adjust for multiple samples per child. Time to first acquisition was defined as the midpoint between a sample without the serotype and the first sample with the serotype, or the midpoint between birth and the first sample date if the first sample was positive. Kaplan-Meier failure functions were used to study time to first acquisition of pneumococci. Mean survival times were calculated by extending the tail of the survival curves to reach the x-axis assuming an exponential distribution if the longest follow-up time was a censored observation. This allowed estimation of mean survival times for acquisition of VT, NVT and any pneumococcus, which in some cases were beyond the end of the study period. A similar approach was used by Cheung et al <xref rid="pone.0049143-Cheung1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. It was not possible to calculate median survival times in some cases because too few children had acquired some serotypes before the end of the study. Hazards for acquisition in the trial and in the baseline pre- vaccination study were compared using Cox regression with robust standard errors to adjust for village clustering after checking that the proportional hazards assumption was satisfied. A p-value of &#x0003c;0.05 was considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses were carried out using Stata version 11 (Stata Corporation, TX, USA).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Characteristics of the study population</title><p>Three hundred and fifty-three new births were reported during the study period.

This group of 11 NVT serotypes and the NT made up nearly half (47%) of all isolates recovered in the study. Carriage of vaccine serotypes was lower in infants from vaccinated than in those from control villages. This was statistically significant for VT overall (6.0% vs. 20.0%, risk difference &#x02212;14.0%; p&#x0003c;0.001) and for individual VT 19F and 23F. Although overall carriage of any NVT was significantly higher in infants from vaccinated compared to those from control villages (50.5% vs. 40.5%, risk difference 9.8%; p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.010), carriage of the individual NVTs was not significantly different between study arms.

We found significantly reduced carriage and risk of first acquisition of VT pneumococci within the first 8 weeks of life in infants born into communities where the whole population had been vaccinated with PCV-7 compared to those born in control communities where only those &#x0003c;30 months had been vaccinated. In parallel, overall carriage rate and risk of acquisition of non-vaccine serotypes (NVT) were increased in these infants compared to controls. A significant reduction in carriage and acquisition rate of VT was also demonstrated in both groups of villages when compared to findings in the previous baseline cohort study.</p><p>Protection against VT carriage has been demonstrated previously among American Indian infants living in PCV7-vaccinated communities compared to their counterparts living in control communities and this was attributed to reduced transmission of VT from vaccinated children <xref rid="pone.0049143-OBrien2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. In addition, the proportion of isolates that were NVT was significantly higher in infants in vaccinated communities compared to controls. Indirect protection against VT carriage has also been demonstrated among children and adults living with a PCV-7-vaccinated child <xref rid="pone.0049143-Millar1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. The findings from these studies among American Indian children are similar to ours. The epidemiological characteristics of pneumococcal disease in the American Indian population is known to be similar to that seen in The Gambia, with high rates of carriage and invasive disease <xref rid="pone.0049143-Cortese1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. However, our study has shown indirect protection of infants at a much younger age than in these studies and for the first time in a developing country setting.</p><p>Since pneumococcal transmission in the community is probably driven mainly by young children <xref rid="pone.0049143-Hussain1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, as has also been shown previously in the Gambia <xref rid="pone.0049143-Hill3" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, we expected to find little difference in carriage among the unvaccinated newborns. The absolute drop in VT carriage from baseline was about twice as much in infants from villages where the whole population had received PCV-7 than in infants from control villages. It is possible that a proportion of newborn infants in rural Gambia first acquire pneumococci from their mothers and that maternally acquired antibodies against VT (all mothers in vaccinated villages received one dose of PCV-7) could have played a role in the reduced VT carriage and acquisition rates seen in infants in vaccinated villages. Enhanced concentrations of IgG to specific pneumococcal serotypes have been demonstrated in Bangladesh <xref rid="pone.0049143-Shahid1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> and in Papua New Guinea <xref rid="pone.0049143-Lehmann1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> among infants born to mothers who received pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine in late pregnancy. A three-fold increase in anti-pneumococcal IgG in the colostrum was also demonstrated previously in Gambian mothers who received a pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine in pregnancy <xref rid="pone.0049143-Obaro1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. A similar study in the USA demonstrated enhanced IgG concentrations in infants of vaccinated pregnant women who received pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine and lower nasal carriage of pneumococcal serotypes in the infants up to the age of 16 months <xref rid="pone.0049143-Munoz1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>.</p><p>In our study the proportion of isolates that were NVT was significantly higher in infants in vaccinated communities compared to those from control. Furthermore, though the risk of NVT acquisition was not significantly different between both study arms, it was significantly higher in each of the study arms when compared with findings from the baseline cohort study. Replacement carriage with NVT has been demonstrated in randomised controlled trials <xref rid="pone.0049143-Dagan1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049143-Eskola1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049143-Mbelle1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049143-Millar2" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> and observational studies <xref rid="pone.0049143-Dunais1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049143-Frazao1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049143-Ghaffar1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. This trend in newborns in The Gambia is of concern given the increased frequency of NVT invasive disease which has been observed in some, but not all, populations where PCV-7 is routinely used <xref rid="pone.0049143-Huang1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049143-MuozAlmagro1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. We noted no overall difference in the prevalence of VT or NVT serotypes by year since the start of the study. However the individual NVT serotypes 7F, 13 and 19A were all significantly more common in second year following vaccination, and the majority of the serotype 19A isolates were found only in second year in intervention villages. Serotype 19A has become the most frequently carried serotype and the leading cause of invasive disease and respiratory infections in the United States after the introduction of PCV7 <xref rid="pone.0049143-Huang2" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049143-Pelton1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. We may have observed a true delayed replacement effect of 19A and this requires careful monitoring.</p><p>This study had some limitations. A follow up period of just 8 weeks, necessitated by the vaccination with PCV-7 of all infants in the study at this time, weakened the ability of the study to demonstrate whether the observed indirect effects would persist, disappear or even increase over time. The duration of carriage could not be assessed as most carriage losses were censored. We have used data from a longitudinal carriage study among infants born in the study communities nearly 2 years prior to the start of vaccination to make inferences about the extent of the indirect protection of newborns in the control villages. Though pneumococcal carriage rates have remained the same in Gambia in the years preceding PCV vaccination, temporal trends in the study villages could have reduced comparability between these data. However, whatever changes that might have occurred should have been distributed equally among the study arms because of randomisation and not affected the main conclusions of the study. The possible role of maternally acquired anti-pneumococcal antibodies in reducing carriage in infants in vaccinated villages could only be speculated on as this was not studied. The study was designed to detect differences in carriage of any VT or any NVT pneumococci. We conducted further analyses of individual serotypes. The chance of finding spurious effects is increased in these secondary analyses, due to multiple comparisons, and consequently these findings for individual serotypes need to be interpreted with caution.</p><p>In summary, this randomised controlled trial in rural Gambia has demonstrated that PCV-7 vaccination results in strong indirect protection against pneumococcal carriage of vaccine serotypes during the first 8 weeks of life. Comparison of the differences in pneumococcal carriage between communities where the whole population was vaccinated, communities where only under 30 month old children were vaccinated and the same villages prevaccination suggest that this strong indirect effect comes from both under 30 month and over 30 month old vaccinated populations. While evidence of replacement carriage with NVT necessitates the need for continued surveillance, the combined direct and indirect effects of PCV-7 enhance the recommendation for widespread implementation of PCVs into routine vaccination schedules in countries where they are needed most.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0049143.s001"><label>Protocol S1</label><caption><p>
