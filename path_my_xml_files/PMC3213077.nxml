It is often difficult to discontinue benzodiazepines because of the development of dependence. We aim to assess if melatonin can facilitate the withdrawal of prolonged benzodiazepine administration in patients with schizophrenia. Furthermore, we aim to investigate the association of benzodiazepine dose reduction with the following clinically important variables: sleep, psychophysiology, cognition, social function, and quality of life.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>Randomized, blinded, two-armed, parallel superiority trial. We plan to include 80 consenting outpatients diagnosed with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, 18-55 years of age, treated with antipsychotic drug(s) and at least one benzodiazepine derivative for the last three months before inclusion. Exclusion criteria: currently under treatment for alcohol or drug abuse, aggressive or violent behavior, known mental retardation, pervasive developmental disorder, dementia, epilepsy, terminal illness, severe co morbidity, inability to understand Danish, allergy to melatonin, lactose, starch, gelatin, or talc, hepatic impairment, pregnancy or nursing, or lack of informed consent. After being randomized to prolonged-release melatonin (Circadin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) 2 mg daily or matching placebo, participants are required to slowly taper off their benzodiazepine dose. The primary outcome measure is benzodiazepine dose at 6 months follow-up. Secondary outcome measures include sleep, psychophysiological, and neurocognitive measures. Data are collected at baseline and at 6 months follow-up regarding medical treatment, cognition, psychophysiology, sleep, laboratory tests, adverse events, psychopathology, social function, and quality of life. Data on medical treatment, cognition, psychophysiology, adverse events, social function, and quality of life are also collected at 2 and 4 months follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The results from this trial will examine whether melatonin has a role in withdrawing long-term benzodiazepine administration in schizophrenia patients. This group of patients is difficult to treat and therefore often subject to polypharmacy which may play a role in the reduced life expectancy of patients compared to the background population. The results will also provide new information on the association of chronic benzodiazepine treatment with sleep, psychophysiology, cognition, social function, and quality of life. Knowledge of these important clinical aspects is lacking in this group of patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01431092">NCT01431092</ext-link></p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Schizophrenia is one of the most costly brain diseases in the world regarding human, social, and health economic costs. The lifetime risk of developing schizophrenia is 0.7% and the prevalence is 0.5% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The disease most often manifests itself in late adolescence or early adulthood and often implies loss of social functioning and reduced quality of life. Schizophrenia is a severe brain disease with a heterogeneous course: 25-30% present a mild course with almost full remission, 50% have a moderate course with waxing and waning symptoms, and 20-25% have chronic symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>There has been an intense search for more effective medical treatments, especially regarding the improvement of cognitive functioning, which has been shown to strongly predict the prognosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The second generation antipsychotics have been most intensively studied with respect to these outcomes, because they were initially marketed as a revolution in the treatment including the cognitive deficits. However, later trials have shown that the pro-cognitive effect of these drugs is much more modest than previously assumed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>Combination therapy with antipsychotics and other classes of psychoactive drugs is highly prevalent in the treatment of schizophrenia, but the effect on cognition after long-term combination treatment has hardly been investigated. The evidence available on augmentation of antipsychotics with benzodiazepines is inconclusive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]; nevertheless, benzodiazepine administration is often prolonged in patients with schizophrenia. Prolonged benzodiazepine administration is associated with numerous adverse reactions including sedation, cognitive impairment, risk of falls, development of tolerance, physical and psychological dependence, and rebound insomnia (reduced total sleep time and increased sleep latency when treatment discontinues). Because of the development of dependence, it is often difficult to discontinue long-term benzodiazepine administration. Furthermore, we have recently reported an association of increased risk of death in schizophrenia patients treated with a combination of antipsychotics and long-acting benzodiazepines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. This underlines our poor understanding of potential interactions and adverse reactions when benzodiazepines are administered in combination with antipsychotic treatment.</p><p>Benzodiazepines demonstrate a high level of efficacy in the initial treatment of insomnia, but several studies have found changes in the sleep architecture (including reduced amount of slow wave sleep), indicating reduced sleep quality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The effect on the sleep pattern following long-term administration has not been investigated but is highly important for patients with schizophrenia since their sleep pattern is most often already disrupted. According to systematic reviews, the majority of patients with schizophrenia suffer from disturbed sleep, including reduced sleep efficiency and total sleep time, increased sleep latency, and changes in the sleep architecture, including reduced amount of slow wave sleep and REM (rapid eye movement) sleep [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>Melatonin represents a possible alternative to treat sleep disturbances in psychiatric patients with chronobiological disturbances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. A smaller observational study has suggested that patients with schizophrenia have reduced secretion of melatonin compared to healthy controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In addition, benzodiazepine treatment is associated with reduced secretion of melatonin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The drug is a naturally occurring hormone with minimal adverse effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] and several possible therapeutic effects, including sleep regulatory, anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, and pro-cognitive properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The effect of exogenous melatonin on these outcomes in patients with schizophrenia has only been investigated to a limited extent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In a randomized, blinded, cross-over trial, Shamir et al. found that melatonin improved sleep efficiency in 19 patients with schizophrenia and poor quality of sleep [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Kumar et al. have shown that melatonin improved the quality of sleep in a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial with 40 participants with schizophrenia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Shamir et al. evaluated sleep quality from wrist actigraphy whereas Kumar et al. evaluated sleep quality subjectively using a questionnaire.</p><p>The possibility of facilitating benzodiazepine withdrawal with temporary addition of melatonin has not been addressed in patients with schizophrenia. However, in general practice settings two randomized, placebo-controlled trials with respectively 34 and 38 participants (with insomnia not associated with schizophrenia) reported contradictory results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Garfinkel et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] found a statistically significant positive effect of adding melatonin when tapering off benzodiazepines, but they did not include a control of compliance (e.g. urine screens). Vissers et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] found no effect of melatonin on the rate of benzodiazepine tapering. The two trials both applied rather fast taper off regimens and a limited amount of personal contact and support. Because of the specific characteristics of schizophrenia outlined above and the contradicting results in normal participants, such results cannot readily be transferred to schizophrenia patients.</p><p>Here we describe the design of a trial evaluating whether prolonged-release melatonin is helpful in stopping the long-term use of benzodiazepines in patients with schizophrenia - the SMART trial.</p><sec><title>Melatonin</title><p>Melatonin is a naturally occurring hormone produced by the pineal gland and is structurally related to serotonin. Physiologically, melatonin secretion increases soon after the onset of darkness, peaks at 2-4 a.m. and diminishes during the second half of the night [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. It is the effect on melatonin receptors (MT1 and MT2) in the suprachiasmatic nucleus in the hypothalamus which contributes to the sleep inducing properties, because these receptors are involved in the regulation of sleep and circadian rhythms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Melatonin has a very short half-life (30-40 minutes) and the physiological level during the night is maintained by continuous secretion.</p><p>Circadin<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>is prolonged-release melatonin and is approved as a drug in Europe for primary insomnia in patients aged 55 years or above. The physiological profile and levels of melatonin is mimicked during 8-10 hours following oral administration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Each tablet contains 2 mg melatonin and 80 mg lactose monohydrate. The tablets must be swallowed in one piece 1-2 hours before bedtime and following a meal. Circadin<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>is not recommended for patients with hepatic impairment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Circadin<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>is completely absorbed after oral administration. The bioavailability is 15% because of a pronounced first-pass effect in the liver.</p><p>The absorption is delayed when Circadin<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>is ingested with a meal resulting in delayed (3 hours versus 0.75 hours) and reduced peak plasma concentration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The elimination half-life is 3.5-4 hours. The drug is metabolized in the liver (the CYP1A enzymes and the CYP2C19 enzyme), mostly to the inactive metabolite 6-sulphatoxy-melatonin (6-S-MT), and eliminated by renal excretion as sulphated and glucuronidated conjugates of 6-hydroxy melatonin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>The efficacy of Circadin<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>2 mg has been investigated in three randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled trials lasting between 5 weeks and 6 months with respectively 170, 332, and 791 participants diagnosed with primary insomnia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. An improved sleep quality and morning vigilance and reduced sleep latency compared with placebo was reported in participants aged 55 years or above. Trials comparing Circadin<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>directly with a relevant active comparator are lacking.</p></sec><sec><title>Research objectives and hypotheses</title><p>The SMART trial evaluates if prolonged-release melatonin versus placebo administration facilitates benzodiazepine withdrawal in schizophrenia patients. We hypothesize that adding melatonin will accelerate the rate of benzodiazepine tapering off and therefore will result in reduced benzodiazepine dose at follow-up in the experimental group compared with the control group. Furthermore, we aim to investigate how the treatment affects cognition, sleep efficiency, and benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms. Neurocognitive tests and psychophysiological examinations are used to evaluate the effect on cognition. Polysomnography is used to evaluate the effect on sleep continuity and sleep architecture, and wrist actigraphy is applied to ensure that the polysomnographical results are representative. We also hypothesize that melatonin will improve cognition reflected as improvements in neurocognitive and psychophysiological measures; that melatonin will improve sleep efficiency and subjective sleep quality; and that melatonin will reduce withdrawal symptoms.</p><p>In addition, the data of the trial are also analyzed as an observational cohort design to investigate the association of benzodiazepine dose reduction/discontinuation with sleep, psychophysiology, cognition, social function, and quality of life (further elaborated in Appendix 1). These supplementary analyses will contribute with important knowledge of the association between benzodiazepine withdrawal in schizophrenia and these outcomes, which eventually could lead to more differentiated clinical treatment guidelines.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><sec><title>Design</title><p>Randomized, blinded, two-armed, parallel group superiority trial (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Flow chart of the SMART trial design</bold>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-244X-11-160-1"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Ethics</title><p>The trial has been approved by the Committee on Biomedical Research Ethics of The Capital Region in Denmark (H-1-2011-025) and the Danish Medicines Agency (EudraCT 2010-024065-46) and is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01431092).

Gradual taper is preferred to sudden discontinuation both nationally and internationally and this approach is also supported by a Cochrane review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The largest (percentage) dose reduction should be planned during the beginning of the tapering process where it is most easily tolerated. When treated with short-acting benzodiazepine derivatives (elimination half-life 24 hours or less) the participants are offered to shift to diazepam (run-in phase). Diazepam is preferred for tapering because of its long elimination half-life (and therefore a stable plasma concentration) plus the availability of low dose tablets. If preferred by the individual participant the tapering process will be conducted with his/her usual benzodiazepine derivative. Participants driving a car will not be offered to shift to diazepam because of the long elimination half-life. Participants will be advised not to drink alcohol during the trial period. The discontinuation plan will continuously be adjusted according to the individual participant. If necessary, the discontinuation can be (temporarily) paused. There is no upper limit of the duration of staying on the same dose. The continuous contact with the participants will follow general recommendations in this area based on thorough clinical experience [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. However, most current recommendations stem from general practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p><p>Trial medication (Circadin<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>2 mg and matching placebo, respectively) begins simultaneously with the tapering process. The participants are instructed to ingest the trial medication 2 hours before bedtime (between 9 and 11 p.m.) following a light meal. The participants are randomized and given the trial medication once they are ready to begin tapering off their benzodiazepine(s), i.e. after baseline assessments and after possible shifting to long-acting benzodiazepine (if the latter is relevant). The participants are treated with the trial medication during the entire trial period including during the follow-up assessment after 6 months, irrespective of their final dose of benzodiazepine. Hereafter, the trial medication is abruptly discontinued.</p><p>Any co medication is allowed. We aim to keep the co medication constant during the trial period but any necessary changes (from a clinical point of view) are allowed and will be controlled for in the analysis if necessary. It is possible that the withdrawal process will reveal symptoms and signs (e.g. anxiety disorder, depression) where treatment with other non-dependence-producing medication is indicated (e.g. antidepressant drugs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].

In the analysis of the pattern of benzodiazepine dose, P300, BACS, and BWSQ-2 over time, we will apply a mixed model with repeated measures (MMRM).

Let BEST be the group where a significant and beneficial effect has been observed. Missing values will be replaced by optimistic ones in the other group and by pessimistic ones in BEST.

When imputing optimistic values, the data will be reviewed from right to left setting the 6 months value to 0 if it is missing.

During the taper off, we assume that the dose decay curve approximately follows an exponential function, because the discontinuation plan assumes a constant withdrawal rate.

We wish to be able to detect a statistically significant difference of minimum 8 weeks between the two intervention groups with regard to average duration of adherence to the discontinuation plan with 90% probability. We furthermore assume that the participants in the control group on average will be able to follow the discontinuation plan for two months (8 weeks) while the participants in the melatonin group are assumed to be able to follow the discontinuation plan for four months (16 weeks). The slope is assumed to vary between 10 and 20% per week in both groups.</p><p>The distribution of benzodiazepine dose in the melatonin and placebo group is assumed to equal the distribution found among our previous sample of outpatients. The distribution of the final dose under the given assumptions is therefore found as follows:</p><p>For each intervention group the slope is assumed to follow an even distribution between 0.1 and 0.2. A slope following this distribution is allocated randomly to each participant. The time passing before a participant stops the withdrawal is randomly allocated to each participant as time is normally distributed with a mean of 8 weeks and a standard deviation (SD) of 2 weeks in the placebo group and a mean of 16 weeks and a SD of 2 weeks in the melatonin group. Finally, the dose at follow-up is calculated for each participant.</p><p>Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref> shows the mean and SD of dose at follow-up in each intervention group according to this model.

But it seems reasonable to suggest a net effect, which is approximately equivalent to the one gained by improving the length of withdrawal with 2 months. Furthermore, the baseline doses in the experimental group may show to be somewhat higher than among our previous outpatient sample. By adding 5 to all the baseline doses and repeating the analysis, we get delta = 0.8 and SD = 0.65 which equals a sample size of 18 in each group (the non-transformed means of follow-up dose in the two groups are 3.92 and 1.39).</p><p>Consequently, a total sample size of 80 patients must be regarded as a conservative estimate.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This trial will assess if melatonin has a role in withdrawing long-term benzodiazepine administration in patients with schizophrenia. There is no other evidence-based facilitating treatment and therefore the control group is treated with placebo. Patients above 55 years are not included in the trial because sleep characteristics and cognitive abilities change markedly with increasing age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. When discontinuing the use of benzodiazepines the participants are relieved from the serious adverse reactions associated with prolonged benzodiazepine administration. Consequently, there is a substantial therapeutic potential by conducting this trial both for the individual participant as well as the future patients who may gain advantage of the results. This group of patients is difficult to treat and therefore often subject to polypharmacy which may play a role in the reduced life expectancy of patients compared with the background population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. The results will also bring new information on the association of chronic benzodiazepine use with sleep, psychophysiology, cognition, social function, and quality of life. Knowledge of these important clinical aspects is lacking in this group of patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Current status of trial</title><p>Inclusion is planned to begin in October 2011.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>LB conceived of and designed the trial and drafted the manuscript.

The SMART trial was designed to evaluate differences between the two intervention groups, i.e. differences between benzodiazepine withdrawal under cover of prolonged-release melatonin versus placebo. In addition to the analyses described in the protocol, we aim to analyze the whole study population from baseline to follow-up, because we expect a larger effect size on numerous of the assessed variables due to the benzodiazepine dose reduction rather than the melatonin treatment per se. For such an analysis we do not have a control group (i.e. a group of participants not tapered off from habitual benzodiazepine use). These supplementary analyses will contribute with important knowledge on how benzodiazepine dose reduction affects the selected variables in schizophrenia which will eventually lead to more differentiated clinical treatment guidelines.</p><p>Hypotheses:</p><p>&#x02022; Discontinuing or reducing the dose of long-term benzodiazepine administration will result in improved cognitive functioning reflected in positive effects in the neurocognitive and psychophysiological measures.</p><p>&#x02022; Discontinuing or reducing the dose of long-term benzodiazepine therapy will result in increased quality of life and subjective well-being due to eliminated/reduced adverse reactions.</p><p>&#x02022; Sleep continuity and sleep architecture will change towards a more normal pattern when benzodiazepine therapy is discontinued or reduced in dose - i.e. reduced amount of stage 2 sleep, increased amount of slow wave sleep and REM sleep (reversal of the benzodiazepine induced changes), and improved sleep efficiency.</p><p>&#x02022; Discontinuing or reducing the dose of long-term benzodiazepine therapy will result in improved social functioning (due to eliminated/reduced adverse reactions) but will not affect psychopathology.</p><p>Outcome measures (all variables listed below are evaluated with regard to the association with benzodiazepine dose reduction/complete discontinuation for the complete cohort of participants from baseline to follow-up, controlled for a possible effect of melatonin):</p><p>&#x02022; Psychophysiological measurements: primarily selective attention, secondarily sensory gating.</p><p>&#x02022; Neurocognitive assessment: primarily BACS composite score, secondarily BACS subscores.</p><p>&#x02022; Sleep continuity and sleep architecture (one night polysomnography): primarily sleep efficiency and changes in sleep architecture, i.e. the percentage of sleep spent in sleep stage 1, 2, 3+4, and REM.
