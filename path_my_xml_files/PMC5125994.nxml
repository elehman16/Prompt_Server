Recently, a more tailored treatment approach has been proposed, in particular for two well-established clinical phenotypes, frequent exacerbators and chronic bronchitis-dominant COPD. ELOM-080 has demonstrated clinical efficacy in treating symptoms and preventing exacerbations in subjects with chronic bronchitis. However, little is known about the potential effects of ELOM-080 in COPD patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Aim</title><p>To evaluate the effect on exacerbation, cough sputum, and general state of health of long-term treatment with ELOM-080 in COPD patients with an exacerbation history and chronic bronchitis.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We performed a post-hoc analysis of a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled parallel-group clinical trial of a 6-month treatment with ELOM-080 (3&#x000d7;300 mg) in patients with chronic bronchitis and concomitant COPD. The primary outcome was the proportion of subjects with at least one exacerbation over the 6-month study period. Secondary outcomes included the total number of exacerbations (ie, cumulative occurrence of exacerbations during the study period) and the proportion of acute exacerbations necessitating an antibiotic treatment, monthly evaluations of sputum and cough symptoms, and the general state of health and a safety analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Of 260 randomized subjects, 64 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria for COPD (ELOM-080: 35, placebo: 29). Compared to placebo, ELOM-080 reduced the percentage of subjects with at least one exacerbation (29% versus 55%, <italic>P</italic>=0.031) and a reduction in the overall occurrence of exacerbations (ELOM-080: 10, placebo: 21, <italic>P</italic>=0.012) during the winter season. The percentage of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients (sputum/expectoration and cough) was consistently higher in the ELOM-080 group compared to placebo, with statistical significant differences after 2 and 3 months of treatment (2 months: ELOM-080 25%, placebo 11%, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.005; 3 months: ELOM-080 26%, placebo 14%, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05). Likewise the subjective rating of general health status was better in the ELOM-080 group with statistically significant superiority after 2 and 3 months of treatment (2-month treatment: <italic>P</italic>=0.015; 3-month treatment: <italic>P</italic>=0.024). Tolerability results were comparable between ELOM-080 and placebo.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>ELOM-080 is efficacious in patients with COPD and a chronic bronchitis phenotype.

At screening, baseline conditions and eligibility were checked and medical history and demography including smoking habits recorded; physical examination, vital signs, and spirometry (FEV<sub>1</sub>) were performed and a safety lab sample was drawn. Subjects were originally eligible, if they fulfilled all of the following key inclusion criteria (for a full list of in- and exclusion criteria):<xref rid="b29-copd-11-2877" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> A diagnosis of chronic bronchitis according to WHO definition,<xref rid="b31-copd-11-2877" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> a screening pulmonary function result (forced expiratory volume in 1 second) of &#x02265;50% predicted, and a history of at least one acute exacerbation in the past winter season.</p><p>Following randomization, follow-up visits were scheduled monthly to assess exacerbations, treatment compliance, change in concomitant medications, adverse events (AEs), and patient-rated overall efficacy of the study drug. Between visits, patients recorded the occurrence and impact of cough, sputum, and difficulty of expectoration in a diary card. Patients rated the occurrence of cough and sputum on a 4-point scale, where 1= constantly bothered, 2= often bothered, while 3= rarely bothered, and 4= never bothered at all. The general state of health was rated accordingly on a 4-point scale (1= very good; 2= good; 3= bad; 4= very bad).</p><p>The post-hoc analysis compared the effect of ELOM-080 versus placebo in a subset of the safety analyzable population of chronic bronchitis patients who additionally fulfilled diagnostic criteria for COPD. For this purpose, subjects were considered as COPD patients when they either a) had a documented physician diagnosis of COPD, or b) fulfilled all of the following three criteria: prescription of concomitant bronchodilator treatment (inhaled or oral beta-2-agonists, inhaled anticholinergics, oral theophylline); smoking history of at least 10 years; spirometric evidence of airflow obstruction, FEV<sub>1</sub> &#x02264;80% of the predicted value.</p><p>The original study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, Good Clinical Practice and German Drug Law (Arzneimittelgesetz, AMG).

This phenotype affects a significant proportion of the overall COPD population and is clinically associated with an increased risk for exacerbations and disease progression.<xref rid="b6-copd-11-2877" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> In addition, COPD patients with the bronchitic phenotype appear to be at greater risk for experiencing mucopurulent exacerbations during the winter period.<xref rid="b32-copd-11-2877" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></p><p>Importantly, in our post-hoc analysis, treatment with ELOM-080 over 6 months during the winter season was associated with a reduction in the exacerbation rate versus placebo and numerically or statistically significant improvements of symptoms of cough, expectoration, and sputum, and subjectively rated general health status over the course of 6 months. While health status benefits may be difficult to fully interpret in their clinical significance due to the use of a rather simple, not validated questionnaire, consistent effects on acute exacerbations were observed for both the reduced percentage of subjects experiencing at least one exacerbation, as well as the cumulative overall occurrence of exacerbations during the study period. Thus, the beneficial effects observed with ELOM-080 over the comparator arm were not driven by few patients experiencing multiple exacerbations under placebo. The reduction in acute exacerbations with ELOM-080 also led to fewer and shorter treatments of acute episodes with antibiotics. While the final decision to prescribe antibiotics &#x02013; as in other published studies<xref rid="b33-copd-11-2877" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="b34-copd-11-2877" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> &#x02013; was based on the treating physicians&#x02019; clinical judgment using criteria described in the methods section, the frequency of antibiotics usage may nonetheless serve as a crude estimate for the number of exacerbations caused by bacteria. The mechanism, by which ELOM-080 leads to a reduction in winter episodes of acute exacerbations in our post-hoc analysis of COPD patients is likely linked to the secretolytic properties, but may involve additional mechanisms. It is well documented that infection with common cold viruses, for example, rhinovirus, during the winter season promotes growth and spread of resident bacteria such as <italic>haemophilus influenzae</italic>, in particular in patients with significant chronic colonization.<xref rid="b35-copd-11-2877" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> Thus, effects of ELOM-080 on mucociliary clearance may improve local lower respiratory tract host defense resulting in decreased virus-mediated flare-up of bacterial exacerbations. This is supported by the reduced occurrence of sputum/expectoration and cough symptoms under ELOM-080 versus placebo in our post-hoc analysis. However, as the nature of our data do not allow us to draw firm conclusions on whether these symptomatic improvements actually preceded the effect on exacerbations, it is also possible that the observed symptomatic effects are rather a consequence of than a cause of reduced exacerbations. In this regard, it is also possible that the effect of ELOM-080 on symptoms increased the threshold for a symptomatic &#x0201c;breakthrough&#x0201d; during an acute event, thus reducing the overall number of detected exacerbations.<xref rid="b36-copd-11-2877" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> Importantly, the results on the efficacy of ELOM-080 in the COPD subgroup did not differ from the results in the overall population,<xref rid="b29-copd-11-2877" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> where 28% of patients experienced at least one exacerbation versus 47% with placebo (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01).</p><p>Exacerbations in COPD are recognized as heterogeneous events, and different interventions may impact on different exacerbation drivers, depending on their mechanism.<xref rid="b37-copd-11-2877" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b39-copd-11-2877" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> In clinical practice, these drivers are often difficult to identify and no reliable biomarker exists this far to support characterization of exacerbations in routine care. Thus, it appears tempting to combine interventions with distinct modes of action in an attempt to maximize the potential for exacerbation prevention in an individual patient.<xref rid="b40-copd-11-2877" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> Our results described herein with ELOM-080, in light of concurrent results of other mucosecretolytics in defined COPD populations<xref rid="b16-copd-11-2877" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="b17-copd-11-2877" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> and the well-documented safety of these agents, suggest that it is worthwhile to reconsider the potential role of these medicines in both the symptomatic and preventative treatment of COPD. In any case, the results presented herein may serve as a hypothesis for a future prospective clinical trial in this COPD phenotype using an appropriate clinical setting, eg, add-on treatment to bronchodilators.<xref rid="b41-copd-11-2877" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></p><p>ELOM-080 was well tolerated in our study.

First, the post-hoc nature of the study does not allow to draw any firm conclusions about the &#x0201c;true&#x0201d; effectiveness of ELOM-080 in a broader COPD population. However, the positive results of the current analysis nonetheless provided important data for hypothesis-generation for future trials in this population. Taking into account the drug&#x02019;s mode of action, the observed effects were not unexpected and lend further support to the potential adjunct use of this class of medication in chronic therapy.<xref rid="b42-copd-11-2877" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> Second, the target population recruited into the original study were chronic bronchitis, not COPD patients. However, there is significant clinical overlap between chronic bronchitis and COPD,<xref rid="b6-copd-11-2877" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> particularly in smokers, and in fact, chronic bronchitis is an essential part of the umbrella diagnosis COPD. We used standard diagnostic criteria or a physician-based diagnosis of COPD to identify reliably those patients with concomitant COPD, ie, patients with a chronic bronchitic phenotype of COPD. In fact, a large proportion of the subjects included in the original study had concomitant bronchodilator therapy and presence of airflow limitation, evident by pre-bronchodilator FEV<sub>1</sub> values between 62% and 78% (IQR) of predicted. While this criterion differs from current GOLD classification strategies (based on post-bronchodilator FEV<sub>1</sub> values), the spirometric criteria were at the time of study conduct in line with the American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society criteria published in 1995.<xref rid="b43-copd-11-2877" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> Therefore, we believe that the spirometric criteria we used &#x02013; among others &#x02013; were sufficient to reliably identify COPD patients.</p><p>Third, the definition of an exacerbation used in the present trial is suitable for AECB, while there are subtle differences from defining COPD exacerbations, although there are overlapping criteria.<xref rid="b44-copd-11-2877" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="b45-copd-11-2877" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> Further, we did not differentiate exacerbations into mild, moderate, and severe. As we did not observe any hospitalizations for COPD, it is possible to conclude that the exacerbations observed corresponded to mild-moderate exacerbations, with a substantial proportion necessitating additional medical treatment. However, our study design did not allow to capture steroid-treated exacerbation, as this was not part of the prespecified definition. In large-scale COPD exacerbation trials, the majority (up to 80%) of exacerbations are treated with antibiotics, either alone, or in combination with steroids.<xref rid="b33-copd-11-2877" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="b34-copd-11-2877" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> While there is evidence, that COPD subjects with chronic bronchitis phenotype may be more prone to recurrent bacterial exacerbations than subjects without this phenotype, the results of our post-hoc analysis cannot be generalized to exacerbations of other suspected causes, necessitating the introduction of systemic corticosteroid bursts. However, the authors are convinced that the demonstrated reductions in mucopurulent exacerbation with ELOM-080 versus placebo are meaningful and clinically relevant in this population.</p><p>Finally, our analysis did not include subjects with severe or very severe COPD, who have been shown to be at particular risk for exacerbations. However, the underlying mechanisms of exacerbations are not necessarily different in more severe stages of COPD, therefore it is possible that the observed effects with ELOM-080 on winter period exacerbations may also be replicated in these subjects.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This post-hoc analysis provides evidence of a beneficial effect of the mucosecretolytic ELOM-080, in preventing mucopurulent exacerbations and improving symptoms of chronic sputum production (sputum, phlegm, cough) in COPD patients with a &#x0201c;chronic bronchitic&#x0201d; phenotype. In light of the documented tolerability profile, reconsideration of this class of medicine as a potential maintenance or seasonal treatment in this subset of COPD patients appears justified.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Disclosure</bold></p><p>The institution where KMB and JB are employed has received lecture fees, advisory honoraria, and compensation for design and conduct of clinical trials from various pharmaceutical companies in the past 5 years, including honoraria from G.
