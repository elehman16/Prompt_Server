<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref> Prevalence rates continue to be high globally and more specifically in the UK.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref> In 2005, the Department of Health initiated the National Child Measurement Programme (NCMP) to identify schoolchildren in Reception (typically aged 4&#x02013;5&#x02005;years) and Year 6 (aged 10&#x02013;11&#x02005;years) who are overweight or obese in England.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref> Since its inception, results from the NCMP have indicated high levels of overweight and obesity in both age groups&#x02014;the most recent findings (school year 2010/2011) identifying 22.6% and 33.4% of Reception and Year 6 children as overweight or obese, respectively. Surveillance programmes have evolved into screening programmes with a high proportion of UK primary care trusts choosing to inform parents of their child's weight status. Although this practice is controversial, it is also the case that identification may be a trigger for parents to initiate lifestyle change and/or seek professional support.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></p><p>Research has indicated that there may be an effectiveness gradient with regard to the impact of child obesity treatment with age.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref> Generally, earlier treatment is associated with better outcomes following programmes that are less intensive. To be effective, it is recommended that interventions are multicomponent and include age-appropriate nutrition and physical activity with behaviour change strategies that are developmentally appropriate to the cognitive abilities of the child and the nature of relationships in the family life cycle.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref> Although the availability of treatments is steadily increasing, there are significant disparities in the availability of treatments across the developmental continuum. In the UK, only 8 of 45 weight management schemes cover the 5&#x02013;7 age range<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref> and only 4 of the 13 Department of Health approved Child Weight Management programmes are suitable for children under the age of 7.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref> To our knowledge, there are no published, peer-reviewed weight management trials or service level evaluations for children aged 5&#x02013;7 in England. This leaves a gap in the understanding of the outcomes that it is possible to achieve for overweight and obese children in this age range in a UK setting.</p><p>The aim of this study was to report outcomes from the UK service level delivery of MEND 5-7 (Mind, Exercise, Nutrition...&#x02009;Do it!), a multicomponent, community-based healthy lifestyle intervention designed for overweight and obese children aged 5&#x02013;7&#x02005;years and their families.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Recruitment</title><p>Families were recruited between 2009 and 2011 using a variety of techniques. MEND provides recruitment resources such as posters, flyers and letters that can be used within local networks to support the recruitment process. In addition, support is also provided, detailing the effective use of these resources. Children were eligible if they were classified as overweight or obese (body mass index (BMI) &#x02265;91st percentile) according to the UK 1990 reference data<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>; had no apparent clinical conditions, comorbidities, physical disabilities or learning difficulties that would interfere with programme engagement and were aged between 5 and 7&#x02005;years with at least one parent/carer who was able to attend each of the programme sessions.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Study design</title><p>The study employed an uncontrolled repeated measures design evaluating changes in the anthropometric, psychosocial, physical activity and nutritional outcomes. This study reports the outcomes of participating children with complete preintervention and postintervention data when delivered in UK community settings under service level conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Study intervention</title><p>The MEND 5-7 programme is a comprehensive, multicomponent intervention designed to tackle obesity in childhood. The programme supports families by providing information on child nutrition (based on government healthy eating guidelines), active play and parenting practices to help parents practically integrate these recommendations into everyday life. The programme uses a non-diet approach to prevent unduly restrictive eating which can lead to problematic eating behaviours.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></p><p>MEND 5-7 is based around key principles in health-related behaviour change and behavioural parent training programmes. These methods are drawn from evidence-based practices in child psychology and parenting interventions.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></p><p>Reviews of behavioural treatments for childhood obesity show that group-based interventions are the most commonly used delivery formats and that they are more effective than individual treatment sessions.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref> Groups are more efficient, provide greater opportunity for therapeutic interactions between participants, improve attendance rates and are cost-effective.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref> Community groups provide greater access to minority ethnic groups, counter stigma, provide a social support network and aid the therapeutic process of problem-solving.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref> These factors improve the understanding of the condition, adherence to the intervention and implementation of changes in behaviour. Recognising the importance of family involvement for behaviour change, the programme requires a parent or carer to attend all sessions.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Structure and content</title><p>The programme consists of 10 (1&#x02005;h and 45&#x02005;min duration) weekly group-based sessions delivered by two trained leaders and one optional assistant. The programme is held in community settings such as sports centres and schools for groups of 8&#x02013;15 children and their parents/carers. The first and last sessions are allocated as introductory and graduation sessions, respectively, incorporating measurements and parental/carer questionnaire completion.</p><p>Each session has four components: &#x02018;Power Time&#x02019; (20&#x02005;min), &#x02018;Healthy Families&#x02019; (25&#x02005;min), &#x02018;Active Play&#x02019; and &#x02018;Parent/carer Workshop&#x02019; (during this time, children take part in 60&#x02005;min of physical activity and parents/carers attend a workshop). &#x02018;Power Time&#x02019; is a joint parent/carer and child snack time designed to help parents incorporate evidence-based food exposure techniques into their daily routines to increase their child's preferences for healthier foods. &#x02018;Healthy Families&#x02019; is also a joint parent/carer and child session that focuses on educating and promoting skills for everyday play, active family lifestyles and healthy family eating in the home environment. &#x02018;Active Play&#x02019; is a child-only play session that takes place while the parents/carers are in their workshop. The focus is on fun and active participation. The aim is to provide children with positive experiences of being active in a supportive setting.</p><p>The parent/carer workshops include interactive activities and discussions focusing on nutrition, activity and behaviour change. Five of the parent/carer workshops focus on healthy eating and nutrition-related topics. Group discussions include practical training on understanding food and drink labels, fat and sugar content of foods and drinks, portion sizes and managing fussy eating. The remaining workshops focus on family rules and routines, reducing screen time and overcoming barriers to physical activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Training</title><p>The MEND 5-7 programme is delivered by community-based health, education and physical activity professionals who attend a 2-day, face-to-face training course. The training is derived from established competency-based skills training methods<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref> and includes direct teaching, role-play, guided discussion and multiple choice assessments. After training, all staff are required to complete an online assessment to gain certification to deliver the programme and pass an enhanced CRB (Criminal Records Bureau) check.</p><p>Following successful completion of the training, delivery teams are provided with four manuals, two for programme delivery, one for programme management and one for physical activity. These resources provide full details of session plans, objectives, direct teaching notes, desired outcomes, set-up and delivery requirements and all aspects of the physical activity programme component.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Outcome measurements</title><sec id="s2f1"><title>Demographics</title><p>Socioeconomic status was determined based on home ownership,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref> grouped as &#x02018;owner occupied&#x02019;, &#x02018;private rented&#x02019;, &#x02018;social rented&#x02019; and &#x02018;other&#x02019;.

Parents are asked to indicate how &#x02018;true&#x02019; each statement is of their child on a 3 point Likert scale (not true, somewhat true, certainly true). A &#x02018;total difficulties&#x02019; score is generated, with higher scores indicating greater levels of emotional distress. Measures of psychological distress were included to evaluate the impact of the intervention upon the children's well-being and to ensure that physical health outcomes were not achieved at the expense of well-being.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Data cleaning and statistical analysis</title><p>Owing to the data being collected under service level conditions by non-researchers, comprehensive cleaning procedures were undertaken to ensure data quality. Outliers for anthropometric measurements were identified from a visual analysis of histograms and scatterplots. Visual analysis enabled the identification of seven observations that were inconsistent with other observations in the data set. After comparison to reference growth charts, these seven data sets were excluded due to biologically unlikely increases in height of over 5.5&#x02005;cm over the course of the premeasurement and postmeasurement sessions. Participants were excluded from the activity analysis if the addition of reported daily physical activity and sedentary behaviour exceeded 16&#x02005;h, resulting in seven data sets being excluded.</p><p>Variable distribution was checked using the Kruskall-Wallis test for normality. Paired sample t tests were employed to assess mean differences in the outcome variables from baseline to 3&#x02005;months (end of intervention). Changes in the proportions for fruit and vegetable intake from baseline to the end of the intervention were assessed using McNemar's test. Baseline differences for those who did and did not complete postprogramme measurements were examined using independent sample t tests. Similarly, effects of gender pre&#x02013;post programme were examined using independent sample t tests. Statistical significance was set at p&#x0003c;0.05.

children aged 5&#x02013;7&#x02005;years. Positive changes were observed for children's weight status, diet and activity levels and emotional well-being. Parents also reported an increase in self-efficacy in relation to their parenting role.</p><p>Most of the outcome literature on child weight management programmes has been reported under trial conditions. Outcomes reported in studies of general practitioner-led behavioural treatment of individual families (LEAP (Live, Eat and Play) intervention<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>) and in generic parenting programmes unmodified to deal with the specific needs of obese and overweight children (Triple P) have shown no significant reductions in measures of degree of obesity. A version of the Triple P programme specifically adapted for obesity (Lifestyle Triple P) showed a reduction of &#x02212;0.11 at 20&#x02005;weeks,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref> the HICKUPS study of a multicomponent group-based parenting intervention reported a reduction of &#x02212;0.36 at 6&#x02005;months and the PEACH study of a parent-only group intervention showed a reduction of &#x02212;0.26 at 6&#x02005;months.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></p><p>In the current study, children with complete sets of measurement data had a significant reduction in BMI z-score of &#x02212;0.20 after 10&#x02005;weeks. The results presented here were similar to the unpublished 3&#x02005;month data (&#x02212;0.20) for children taking part in the randomised controlled trial of the MEND programme for 7&#x02013;13-year-old children<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref> and its national service level evaluation (&#x02212;0.18).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref> Although not directly comparable to the treatment effects reported in experimental studies using intention-to-treat analysis, this study suggests that community level interventions delivered under conditions of normal service delivery may achieve similar results to those obtained in clinical trials.</p><p>Generally, interventions that produce greater treatment effects are more intense and involve relatively higher levels of contact time.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref> The US preventive services task force (USPSTF) concludes that low-intensity interventions&#x02014;defined as those involving less than 25&#x02005;h direct professional contact time&#x02014;are insufficient to have a positive impact on weight status in obese and overweight children. The MEND 5-7 programme consists of 17.5&#x02005;h of face-to-face contact time and demonstrated significant reductions in zBMI for 62% of children with complete sets of measurement data. Contrary to USPTS&#x0003e; recommendations, this suggests that clinically meaningful outcomes may be achievable by low-intensity interventions.</p><p>MEND 5-7 has been designed to be delivered by community-based, non-obesity specialists, in contrast to other studies that have used highly skilled professionals to deliver the intervention.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref> A large proportion of childhood obesity interventions employ intensive programmes involving specialist dieticians and other health professionals.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref> Childhood obesity interventions are significantly more expensive when skilled professionals and additional contact hours are employed. In an increasingly resource-constrained public-sector environment, these factors might limit the potential reach of evidence-based programmes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref> The development of a clinically effective, low-intensity programme using non-specialist, community-based delivery staff could be a crucial strategy to meet the needs of younger children who are already overweight. The present results suggest that clinically meaningful outcomes may be achievable by low-intensity interventions delivered by non-specialist staff. Further research would be desirable to explore whether these initially promising data could be independently replicated under service level conditions.</p><p>The UK Department of Health physical activity guidelines specify that children and young people (5&#x02013;18&#x02005;years old) should engage in 60&#x02005;min of activity per day while minimising sedentary behaviours.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref> Sedentary behaviours&#x02014;in particular, time spent watching television&#x02014;are associated with metabolic risk factors in children<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref> and have been shown to predict BMI in early adulthood.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref> Independent of TV viewing time, higher levels of sedentary behaviours have been shown to lower levels of physical activity in children.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></p><p>There is also evidence that participation in physical activity leads to health benefits<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref> and lowers levels of overweight and obesity in children.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref> In this study, participation in MEND 5-7 was associated with significant, positive changes in physical activity levels (p&#x0003c;0.01), TV viewing time and sedentary activity levels (p&#x0003c;0.0001). Parents reported that children on the programme had reduced sedentary behaviour by an average of 4.1&#x02005;h, of which 3.4&#x02005;h was television viewing, and increased their physical activity levels by 2.9&#x02005;h per week. Such reductions in sedentary activity and increase in physical activity during participation in the programme is very encouraging.</p><p>Some limitations of the study should be acknowledged. Only 62% of participants who started the programme completed postprogramme measurements. This level of completion is not atypical for a pilot study or reports of service-level implementation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref> but may be a source of bias that could lead to an overestimation of treatment effect. Statistical analyses revealed that there were limited differences between those participants who completed the programme and those who did not. The data presented here are uncontrolled data representing the short-term impact of the intervention for children with complete sets of measurement data. Controlled studies of the impact beyond the 10&#x02005;week programme are needed to establish whether the present results are sustained and more effective than no or an alternative intervention. While it is well documented that subjective measures of physical activity over-report when compared to more accurate, objectively measured physical activity,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref> subjective measurement can be a useful and cost-effective tool when employed in a community-based programme if it is not feasible to obtain objective measurements.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref> The improvements found in physical activity and sedentary behaviours require supporting evidence using objective measurement.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Participation in the MEND 5-7 programme was associated with beneficial changes in physical, behavioural and psychological outcomes for children with complete sets of measurement data, when implemented in UK community settings under service level conditions. The findings presented warrant further evaluation in a formal trial to establish if the observed outcomes would have occurred in the absence of intervention, are replicable across varying ethnic and socioeconomic groups, are sustainable and are cost-effective. Further, process evaluation of programme implementation will also establish if the delivery model, using non-obesity specialists, can provide a scalable and suitable care pathway for families of overweight and obese children on a national level.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e201" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2013-002607.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e202" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2013-002607.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank Dr Venediktos Kapetanakis for his statistical advice.
