The new challenge now is to manage noncavitated lesions noninvasively, and thus, various methods and materials for remineralization of carious lesion have become the need of the hour. A combination of diet, pathogenic bacteria (plaque), and unfavorable salivary components together leads to production of organic acids which results in drop in pH, eventually leading to demineralization and cavitation. Conversely, remineralization is wherein the dissolution of minerals are prevented and by using oral fluids (plaque, saliva) as an intermediary, teeth are replenished back with the lost minerals like calcium and phosphate.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>Various remineralizing toothpastes containing agents such as fluoride, casein phosphopeptide, and novamin are in the market to yield daily remineralization and prevention against dental decay. Fluoride has been considered the cornerstone of remineralization.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Studies have shown that fluoride drives the process of remineralization only if there is adequate supply of calcium and phosphate.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Studies proving decrease in the incidence of caries postincorporation of calcium and phosphate into diet paved the way for these to be incorporated into toothpaste.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Further, along with calcium and phosphate, calcium sucrose phosphate (CaSP) addition was studied which also showed synergistic benefits.</p><p>Anticay, a CaSP&#x02013;calcium orthophosphate complex, supplies both calcium and phosphate in a soluble form. It is a fine, white, nonhygroscopic powder with a neutral blend taste. It contains approximately 11.5% calcium on a dry weight basis. This complex helps reduce the acid solubility of enamel and increase the rate of remineralization by a common ion effect. Furthermore, it has shown to inhibit the formation and adherence of plaque to the enamel surface. This anticay technology has been incorporated into toothpastes such as Toothmin (Abbott Healthcare) and Enafix (Group Pharmaceuticals Ltd., India).[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] This study is on Anticay's (CaSP Enafix) ability to provide calcium and phosphate ions to saliva, to reduce the amount of plaque and to evaluate its substantivity potential in the oral cavity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Two groups of study participants having 15 children each in the age group 6&#x02013;13 years were selected for this study having a parallel design with 1:1 ratio. Each of the selected participant had nonrestored teeth and noncarious oral cavity. The institutional ethical committee approval was granted, and informed consent was attained from the secretary of both the orphanages and the study was commenced on December 2015 and continued for a year. After screening of a total of 70 children in the two orphanages located in the same area of Kerala, India, the eligible thirty participants were divided into two groups based on the orphanages they resided in. Fifteen males residing in one orphanage were allotted to control group (Group X) and were asked to continue using their regularly used calcium, phosphate-containing toothpaste which on verification was Colgate (Colgate Palmolive (India) Ltd.). Fifteen females residing in another orphanage were allotted to the test group (Group Y) and were given CaSP toothpaste (Enafix 5%). After intraoral examination and recording of diet chart, the study participants were demonstrated Bass brushing technique keeping time period of brushing (2 min), amount of paste (pea size), sugar exposure (3&#x02013;5: solid and 5&#x02013;7: liquid), and the frequency of brushing (twice daily) constant, which were regularly monitored by the warden of both the orphanages. These parameters are in accordance with literatures in the past.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>From each study participant of both groups, 1 ml of unstimulated saliva sample was collected before brushing (Sample A). Passive drooling method with minimal oral movements as described in previous studies was used to collect the unstimulated saliva.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Following that, study participants from their respective groups were asked to brush using the paste allotted to them. Half an hour and 6 h after brushing, saliva samples were again collected (Sample B and Sample C, respectively) from both the groups to evaluate the substantivity of the toothpaste in the oral cavity. Collected samples were immediately transported in an ice box maintaining a temperature of 4&#x000b0;C to the biochemistry laboratory for analysis of calcium and inorganic phosphate ions using Olympus AU2700 autoanalyzer (Beckman Coulter, Inc, Fullerton, CA, USA). It is a fully automated photometric analyzer which follows the colorimetric principle to analyze calcium, phosphate level of various body fluids.</p><p>After collecting saliva 6 h postbrushing, a disclosing agent (2-tone dye: GC Tri Plaque ID Gel) was applied thoroughly on all the surfaces of teeth, and plaque index was recorded using O&#x02019;Leary Plaque index given by Timothy J. O&#x02019;Leary in 1972.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] After rinsing, the presence of any colored stain on the dentogingival junction of buccal, lingual/palatal, mesial, and distal surfaces of all teeth present was examined, marked in the record form and summed up following which the given formula was applied:</p><p><inline-graphic xlink:href="CCD-9-151-g001.jpg"/></p><p>In a similar manner, 6 h postbrushing evaluation of salivary calcium and phosphate ions was done every 3 months (Sample D), 6 months (Sample E), and 12 months (Sample F) in both the groups, while plaque index was recorded only for the test group (Enafix &#x000d7; 5%) in order to evaluate the efficacy of CaSP toothpaste in altering the amount of plaque [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. In this way, the parameters recorded for each study participant were salivary calcium and phosphate level and plaque index. Constant reinforcement by regular calls, once in a week visit to the orphanages, getting attendance sheet marked by the warden indicative of the brushing protocol followed by the study participants, and constant look over the diet chart to note any variation was done to have an accurate result.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>CONSORT flow diagram</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="CCD-9-151-g002"/></fig><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Derivation of sample size was done using the following formula:</p><p><inline-graphic xlink:href="CCD-9-151-g003.jpg"/></p><p>A sample size of five in each group was attained, following which 15 participants were chosen for each group keeping in mind the chances of dropouts in this 1-year study.</p><p>Student's <italic>t</italic>-test was applied to compare the calcium and phosphate values in control and test groups.

Calcium and phosphate levels in saliva would serve as a biomarker in indicating the remineralization potential of that particular toothpaste. This is in accordance with the literature given by Raghu and Ananthakrishna in 2016,[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] Lindh <italic>et al</italic>. in 2014,[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Hara and Zero in 2014,[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and Buzalaf <italic>et al</italic>. in 2012.[<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] Evaluation of the substantivity of Enafix (calcium sucrose phosphate toothpaste) in the oral cavity was done by analyzing the difference between salivary calcium and phosphate level after &#x000bd; h and after 6 h of brushing on day 1.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first <italic>in vivo</italic> study evaluating the potential of CaSP in remineralizing the tooth via analysis of salivary calcium and phosphate level. Furthermore, no study so far has been conducted to test the substantivity of this toothpaste in the oral cavity. Although postulated before in several studies such as Awasthi <italic>et al</italic>. in 2015,[<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] the ability of this agent in reducing the amount of plaque has not been much evaluated. Study participants were chosen from orphanages keeping in mind the uniform diet that they follow with minimal sugar exposure. This reasoning is supported by sequence of age old studies conducted by Harris <italic>et al</italic>. in 1967, 1968, and 1969.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Unstimulated saliva was collected as it leads to more accurate phosphate level as well as less bacterial contamination.[<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]</p><p>Attempts to follow the standard protocol of study was done by constant calls, visits and demonstration of brushing technique, checking the attendance sheet given to the warden and evaluating any change in the diet. The 6h postbrushing saliva sample was selected for evaluation of parameters on 3<sup>rd</sup>, 6<sup>th</sup>, and 12<sup>th</sup> months as this is the time for maximum undersaturation of saliva due to the incorporation of in between meals, thereby creating a cariogenic environment. This is supported by the study done by Creanor <italic>et al</italic>. in 2011[<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and Sullivan <italic>et al</italic>. in 1997.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Difference in baseline salivary calcium and phosphate level could be possibly due to various factors, one of which is the gender difference in the two groups. This reasoning is supported by Mohammad and Sultan in 2007[<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] and Dawes in 1970[<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] who stated that there is a significant difference in the salivary inorganic components in males and females, with lower level seen in females due to their lesser flow rate compared to males. Gender difference between the groups can be considered as one of the limitations, while it cannot be ignored that this difference also gave an additional result to the study. Test group showed an overall improvement in salivary calcium and phosphate level, though statistically not significant.</p><p>ANOVA test revealed that test group's salivary calcium level showed marked increase in sample collected &#x000bd; h and 6 h after brushing on day 1 and also in the 12<sup>th</sup> month of intervention. In the control group, despite using the same calcium and phosphate-containing toothpaste even before intervention, a sudden rise on the 1<sup>st</sup> day followed by a drop to almost the preintervention values could be due to many reasons which primarily revolve around patient's compliance. The statistical analysis of the plaque level in test group revealed a decline on the 12<sup>th</sup> month when compared to the plaque level scored on day 1. This is parallel to the study conducted by Awasthi <italic>et al</italic>. in 2015[<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] on autistic children.</p><p>The following summaries can be drawn from this 1-year study on Enafix (CaSP):</p><p>
