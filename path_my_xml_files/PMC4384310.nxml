It is generally caused by degeneration of the intervertebral disks. The typical mechanism of pain, described as compression of the nerve root by the herniated disk, reportedly cannot explain all of the clinical symptoms. The concept of local chemical mediation of pain by the injured tissues has recently gained much more favor. Many cytokines that may be responsible for chemical mediation of low back pain have been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Findings in animal studies and clinical research suggest that phospholipase A2 (PLA2) is not only an important inflammatory cytokine and pain-causing factor but also a special signature of local tissue inflammation. PLA2 activity is closely associated with intervertebral disk degeneration, intervertebral disk herniation, radicular pain, and lumbar diskogenic pain. It is the initial factor in a series of pathophysiological changes and has an acknowledged proinflammatory effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Therefore, PLA2 plays an important role in the pain associated with disk degeneration.</p><p>Less invasive techniques introduced in recent years, including percutaneous nucleoplasty, are based on high-tech equipment and medications and contribute to less pain and more effective clinical outcomes in the treatment of low back pain. These minimally invasive techniques have been gradually accepted by both surgeons and patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The therapeutic mechanism of percutaneous nucleoplasty is thought to ablate the nucleus pulposus and decrease the intradiskal pressure. Since 2002, we have used this technique to treat more than 800 patients with low back pain. We found that some patients with low back pain without high intradiskal pressure (such as severe intervertebral disk degeneration or annulus fibrosus tears) could also be cured or obtain satisfactory pain relief after coblation therapy. The therapeutic mechanism of coblation in these patients was unclear. Therefore, this study was designed to explore the effect of coblation on the PLA2 activity in degenerative intervertebral disks and provide experimental evidence for the clinical use of coblation in the treatment of low back pain due to intervertebral disk degeneration.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Experimental animals</title><p>This study was approved by the Animal Experimental Ethics Committee of Beijing Army General Hospital. A total of 46 New Zealand white rabbits (weight, 2.0&#x02013;2.5&#x000a0;kg; age, 2.0&#x02013;2.5&#x000a0;months) were purchased from Vital River Laboratories (Beijing, China). They were randomly assigned to an animal model group (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;38) and a control group (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;8). A surgical procedure was performed in the animal model group to establish the animal model of intervertebral disk degeneration. Two rabbits died of infection after the surgery. Thirty-six animal models were successfully established and then randomly divided into two groups: the coblation group (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;18) and coblation control group (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;18). At each time point, six rabbits in the coblation and coblation control groups were euthanized for the analysis of PLA2 activity (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (Signa TwinSpeed 1.5&#x000a0;T Excite II; GE Healthcare, USA) and X-ray were performed to confirm the preoperative status of the involved disks prior to surgery. The animal model of intervertebral disk degeneration was induced as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. A C-arm with image intensification (BV300; Philips Electronics, Eindhoven, The Netherlands) was used to identify the location of L4&#x02013;5 and L5&#x02013;6. A posterolateral incision was made in the iliac crest, and the L4&#x02013;5 and L5&#x02013;6 disks were exposed. A 16-gauge puncture needle was used to induce an injury to the disk to a depth of 5&#x000a0;mm. Muscles and skin were closed with 3-0 silk suture. Four weeks postoperatively, the animal model group underwent MRI and X-ray examinations to assess the degeneration of the disks, and 36 animal models were successfully established. Two animals died of iatrogenic infection. The MR images of the disk was assessed by an observer blinded to the study using modified Thompson classification based on changes in the degree and area of signal intensity from grades 1 to 4 (1&#x02009;=&#x02009;normal, 2&#x02009;=&#x02009;minimal decrease in signal intensity but obvious narrowing of high-signal, 3&#x02009;=&#x02009;moderate decrease in signal intensity, 4&#x02009;=&#x02009;severe decrease in signal intensity). The animal model with grade 2 or grade 3 was suitable for the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Nucleoplasty procedure</title><p>Nucleoplasty (Coblation&#x000ae;; ArthroCare Spine, USA) was performed in the coblation group as soon as we identified the successful establishment of the animal model of intervertebral disk degeneration, while no procedure was performed in the coblation control group. Each rabbit was tranquilized as described above. The operative field was prepared in a sterile fashion using betadine. L4&#x02013;5 and L5&#x02013;6 were identified with the C-arm while using Kirschner wires as markers. The procedure was performed as follows. The skin was stabbed by a 16-gauge hypodermic needle in preparation for puncture. Under fluoroscopic guidance, the access needle was inserted at an angle of 40&#x000b0; from the mid-back, targeting the tip of the stylet to the center of the nucleus in both the coronal and sagittal planes. The exact positioning of the stylet was then confirmed using anteroposterior and lateral views. The stylet was withdrawn from the needle, and a DC SpineWand was inserted under fluoroscopic guidance. The SpineWand was then connected to the cable. The controller was set at power level 1. The COAG pedal on the foot controller was depressed for 0.5&#x000a0;s. The ABLATION pedal on the foot controller was depressed for 3 to 5&#x000a0;s while the flange was rotated 180&#x000b0; in a back-and-forth motion. At the same time, the effective length was confirmed to extend from the inner part of the annulus fibrosus to that of the opposite side. The depth of penetration was controlled to extend not more than 5&#x000a0;mm from the needle tip. After the coblation zone had been created, the SpineWand was withdrawn from the needle and the needle was then withdrawn from the rabbit. Throughout all procedures, care was taken to avoid disturbing the peripheral tissues around the vertebrae. Following the surgeries, the rabbits were permitted free cage activity (4,000&#x000a0;cm<sup>2</sup>), food, and water. Gentamicin was given intramuscularly for three consecutive days.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Assessment of PLA2 activity in the intervertebral disk</title><p>The PLA2 activity assessment (titrimetric analysis) was performed as previously published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. All reagents were purchased from Beijing Chemical Preparation Company (Beijing, China). The substrate buffer solution comprised phosphatidylcholine (3.75&#x000a0;mmol/L), glycine (0.1&#x000a0;mmol/L), boric acid (3.57&#x000a0;mmol/L), and sodium deoxycholate (6.03&#x000a0;mmol/L). Before use, the solution was placed in a water bath at 60&#x000b0;C for 30&#x000a0;min, and the pH was adjusted to 8.50 with sodium hydroxide solution (1&#x000a0;mol/L). The components of the PLA2 diluent were similar to those of the substrate buffer solution, but phosphatidylcholine was not included. Dilute hydrochloric acid (0.005&#x000a0;mmol/L) was also prepared for titration and determination of the amount of base.</p><p>The rabbits in the coblation and coblation control groups were followed serially by both MRI and X-ray at different time points: real time, 1&#x000a0;week, and 4&#x000a0;weeks after nucleoplasty. At each of these time points, six rabbits were randomly euthanized for analysis of disk specimens. A posterior longitudinal skin incision was made along the lumbar spine in a sterile fashion. Both the L4&#x02013;5 and L5&#x02013;6 motion segments were dissected from the lumbar spine. The L4&#x02013;5 and L5&#x02013;6 intervertebral disks were then carefully separated with a scalpel. Each disk was cut into 1-mm<sup>3</sup> pieces. After being weighed, the disk tissue was mixed with PLA2 diluent (4&#x000a0;ml/g) and centrifuged at 4,000&#x000a0;r/min for 10&#x000a0;min. The supernatant was mixed with 0.4&#x000a0;ml of PLA2 diluent, centrifuged at 8,000&#x000a0;r/min for 20&#x000a0;min, and collected and stored at 4&#x000b0;C.</p><p>First, each sample was placed in a 60&#x000b0;C thermostatic water bath for 30&#x000a0;min. Next, 0.4-ml samples and different reagents according to Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> were added to two tubes (tubes A and B), then placed in a water bath at 37&#x000b0;C for 60&#x000a0;min. Tube A was added with 0.2&#x000a0;ml calcium chloride (0.2&#x000a0;ml), and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) (1.1&#x000a0;ml) was added to tube B. The pH in tube A was carefully adjusted to match that in tube B by titration with dilute hydrochloric acid. A sensitivity pH meter (sensitivity, 0.001) (inoLab pH&#x000a0;740; WTW Co., Weilheim, Germany) was used to detect the endpoint of the reaction. The PLA2 activity was considered to indicate the consumption of dilute hydrochloric acid.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>

It has been widely studied with respect to its potential involvement in the onset of low back pain. The mechanical behaviors of intervertebral disk degeneration and their changes with degeneration have been investigated, but the current mechanical theory cannot explain all treatment effects. For instance, the pathophysiology of sciatica due to lumbar disk herniation involves factors other than mere mechanical compression of the nerve root because many patients with disk herniation remain entirely asymptomatic. The pain-related chemical mediators released by the tissues involved in degenerative disk disease have been increasingly recognized in recent years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Many inflammatory cytokines are related to disk degeneration. These factors appear to be activated in cases of symptomatic herniation, suggesting that inflammation of the nerve root might result from an inflammatory process in the herniated disk itself. Among them, PLA2, a lipolytic enzyme first discovered in the herniated disk tissues in 1990 by Saal et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], preferentially cleaves arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipids, resulting in various inflammatory mediators such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes. It has played an important role as a very important inflammatory cytokine within the pathological manifestations of the disk degeneration, neurological symptoms, peripheral nerve injury, and diskogenic pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>In our study, we found that the PLA2 activity in the coblation control group was significantly higher than that in the control group, indicating that PLA2 activity is closely related to intervertebral disk degeneration. One postulated mechanism is that when intervertebral disk degeneration occurs, PLA2 is activated by various proinflammatory mediators such as interleukin-1, tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1;, and interleukin-6, which are secreted by the degenerative intervertebral disk. This gradually leads to high expression of PLA2 in the degenerative intervertebral disk as the degeneration progresses.</p><p>Over recent years, several minimally invasive treatment modalities for intervertebral disk degenerative disease have been studied, such as intradiskal steroid injection, intradiskal electrothermal therapy, and intradiskal radiofrequency thermocoagulation. Coblation is a surgical method of volumetric tissue removal through molecular dissociation during arthroscopic surgery developed by ArthroCare Corporation. It achieves its operative result through a lower intradiskal pressure. In practical applications, however, we have found that the current theory of mechanical decompression cannot explain all clinical phenomena. In some patients with low back pain, the contrast media (injected volume of &#x0003e;2&#x000a0;ml) spread rapidly outside the annulus fibrosus during diskography, indicating severe intervertebral disk degeneration or an annulus fibrosus tear. Interestingly, these patients also achieved satisfactory pain relief after coblation therapy. Under this premise, we postulated that pain relief is associated with decreased inflammatory cytokine levels after coblation.</p><p>The PLA2 activity in the coblation control group was significantly higher than that in the control group. When coblation was performed on degenerative intervertebral disks, the PLA2 activity began to decline over time. In addition, a significant difference in PLA2 activity in the coblation group was only noted between real time and 1&#x000a0;week after coblation. Accordingly, it can be postulated that coblation energy has an effect on the PLA2 activity in degenerative intervertebral disks, especially in the early treatment stage.</p><p>Based on the results obtained in this study, we conclude that the energy produced by coblation can degrade the PLA2 activity in the intervertebral disk, resulting in pain relief in the treatment of low back pain, although the exact mechanism remains unclear. A possible explanation is that the energized particles during the coblation procedure have sufficient energy to break down the molecular bonds of PLA2. As a result, the PLA2 activity decreased after the treatment. Because PLA2 is considered to be the rate-limiting enzyme in the inflammatory cascade reaction, the progressive inflammatory effect was terminated by the destruction of PLA2 activity. Notably, the PLA2 activity obviously decreased 1&#x000a0;week after the procedure and gradually declined over time. Therefore, it can be postulated that inhibition of the inflammatory cascade reaction is an important mechanism of treatment by way of terminating PLA2 activity.</p><p>There are several limitations in this study. (1) The observation period was 4&#x000a0;weeks long. Further research with longer study periods should be conducted to identify changes in PLA2 activity. (2) Histological analysis was not performed to examine the morphological features of the cells in the intervertebral disk in this study; such features could be related to changes in PLA2 activity. (3) PLA2 activity was detected by titrimetric analysis instead of immunohistochemical analysis, which could have led to bias with respect to methodology.</p><p>In conclusion, PLA2 activity is closely associated with the different stages of intervertebral disk degeneration. According to this study, we found that low PLA2 expression is present in normal intervertebral disks, and PLA2 activity gradually increases with further progression of degeneration. Percutaneous nucleoplasty is a relatively novel therapeutic method that was introduced in recent years. In our experimental study, percutaneous nucleoplasty was performed based on the successful establishment of an animal model of intervertebral disk degeneration. We have found that coblation can degrade the PLA2 activity in degenerative intervertebral disks. The therapeutic effect appears to be significant 1&#x000a0;week postoperatively then slowly declines over time. The therapeutic effects of coblation in patients with severe degenerative intervertebral disks and annulus fibrosus tears can be explained through this experimental study using an animal model.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>DR carried out the studies and drafted the manuscript.
