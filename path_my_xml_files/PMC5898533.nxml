It is the most common cancer in women of Low and Middle Income Countries (LMICs) <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>.</p><p id="p0015">In the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), 18.85 million women, aged 15 years and older are at risk of developing CC. Current estimates indicate that every year 6024 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer and 4719 die from the disease <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.</p><p id="p0020">The link between human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and CC is well established <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. HPV infection is implicated in 99.7% of CC cases worldwide <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. When HPV infection persists in the cervix, it can induce changes which constitute the precancerous lesions of the cervix (PLC), also called dysplasia or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN)&#x000b7;CIN is asymptomatic and progresses to CC over a prolonged period of time (7&#x02013;20 years). CC can be prevented by screening and treatment of CIN in asymptomatic women. Cytology is considered as the standard CC screening method but is not feasible in LMICs due to its high cost, lack of adequate infrastructure or qualified cytotechnicians. Therefore, visual inspection of the cervix after application of 5% acetic acid (VIA) is recommended as a screening tool in low-resource settings with no acces to HPV testing or cytology screening. It has limited specificity but a high sensitivity, is cost-effective and provides immediate results <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p><p id="p0025">Sauvaget et al. performed meta-analyses with different categories of studies to provide an updated estimation of the accuracy of visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) in detecting true disease. The reference category consisted of 26 studies in which VIA was performed on asymptomatic women who all underwent confirmatory testing and in which the disease threshold was cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2. They reported an 80% sensitivity (range, 79%&#x02013;82%) and a 92% specificity (range, 91%&#x02013;92%) for VIA. Study region, capacity of screener, or size of the study population did not modify VIA accuracy. In conclusion, it was shown that screening for precancerous and cancerous cervical lesions using VIA is a simple, low-cost, and efficient alternative to cytologic testing in low-resource areas. The more the severity of disease, the more sensitive and specific is VIA in detecting the disease <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p><p id="p0030">In another meta-analysis by Sauvaget, Cryotherapy was shown to be an effective, safe, and acceptable treatment for CIN. Actually, on a equivalent of 28,827 cases of treated CIN, Cryotherapy achieved cure rates of 94.0% for CIN1, 92.0% for CIN2, and 85.0% for CIN3 <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p><p id="p0035">Of all available and effective treatments of CIN, cryotherapy seems the most appropriate for LMICs, but is still hampered by major logistical problems such as unavailability of refrigerant gas. These feasibility issues highlight the need for a low-cost and minimally invasive method of treating CIN in LMICs <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p><p id="p0040">Recently, an antiviral drug called Antiviral 2 (AV2<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Cesa Alliance, Luxembourg) made of natural essential oils was developed and preliminary results suggest it to be effective in clearing or reducing the size of PLC related to HPV <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved its organic compounds (carvone, eugenol, geraniol, and nerolidol). These combined compounds have a broad spectrum anti-viral effect, both topically and orally <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> and AV2 may regress cervical lesions due to deactivation of the virus.</p><p id="p0045">In a recently published phase 2 clinical trial study conducted by Martinez et al. at Hospital de la Familia, in Juarez, Mexico, efficacy of AV2<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> in the regression of cervical lesions diagnosed at colposcopy was compared to placebo in 50 women over the age of 18. The results showed that the application of AV2<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> yielded a reduction of more than 50% of lesion size for 21 out of the 28 (75%) patients who received the active treatment, versus 0% for the comparable placebo pool. At the other end of the scale, only 2 (7%) participants in the AV2<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> group failed to respond positively compared to 80% of participants in the placebo group <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.

HPV is acquired at the onset of sexual activity which occurs at around 15 years of age. Its prevalence is very high at a younger age and is often transient because most women will spontaneously eliminate the virus after some years. When it persists, HPV infection can take in average 10 years to lead to CC. Thus, testing is projected to start 10 years later after sexual debut in this case at 25 years old onward.</p><p id="p0065">Exclusion Criteria: Pregnant, breastfeeding and post-partum women will not be accepted in the study. In case of suspected or diagnosed cervical cancer, the women will be referred in a tertiary hospital for the proper management.

Unfortunately, real time HPV test such as Care HPV<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> test (Qiagen) is not available yet in DRC. Plus, we need to prioritize the SAT approach which minimizes lost to follow-ups and all the difficulties encountered when women have to be recalled for results. For instance, in Africa, mothers are the pivot in the life of the family, they go to the crops, they travel for small businesses and all these situations possibly tend to affect follow-up rates.</p><p id="p0225">Moreover, in our institution we are not able to perform HPV testing needed in this study yet. The samples will be shipped to South Africa for both LBC and HPV testing and it will take some months to get the results back. So, we cannot rely on HPV testing for randomization. We will thus randomize based on VIA test whose results are immediate. According to the natural history of cervical cancer, it takes 7&#x02013;20 years for cervical HPV infection or dysplasia to lead to cervical cancer and a high proportion of HPV infection and mild dysplasia may regress spontaneously. During the two-months follow-up period we will detect all women with cervical dysplasia, even in the placebo arm, and treat them accordingly by cryotherapy which is a standardized treatment method used for the treatment of precancerous lesions. For those reasons, placebo can be safely used.</p><p id="p0230">This study will be the first large-scaled study in Kinshasa to report on HPV prevalence and genotyping in DRC. One limitation for this study is the fact that instead of cytology or hpv testing results, randomization will be based on VIA which is a subjective test.</p><p id="p0235">Finally, when we will get all the results concerning LBC and HPV testing, we will recall women to inform them of their results and treat those in need with standard treatment until we clear all precancerous lesions.</p></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>Publication plan</title><p id="p0240">Sources of funding, institutional affiliations and conflicts of interest will be declared in the subsequent publications related to this study.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>Competing interests</title><p id="p0245">The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec id="sec6"><title>Author's contributions</title><p id="p0250">ABM, YJ, JPVG have written and designed the study protocol.
