</p><p>Immediately, after presentation in surgery emergency, a detailed history was taken. A thorough clinical examination was done. Once the clinical diagnosis of secondary bacterial peritonitis was suspected, patients were subjected to following set of investigations: complete hemogram, blood sugar, kidney function test, i.e., blood urea, serum creatinine, Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, coagulation profile, liver function test, i.e., total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, indirect bilirubin, serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase, serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase, Alk. Phosphatase, arterial blood gas, analysis, chest X-ray, and electrocardiogram (ECG).</p><p>Thereafter, an intravenous (IV) line was established using 16&#x02013;18 Gauge cannula in a suitable peripheral vein. Patients were catheterized and bladder evacuated. Nasogastric (NG) tube was inserted. Patients were given O<sub>2</sub> by mask at the rate of 5 L/min. Central venous pressure (CVP) monitoring was initiated using jugular venous line, setting zero at mid-axillary line. Antibiotics (ciprofloxacin 200 mg intravenously 12 hourly and metronidazole 500 mg intravenously 8 hourly) were started. At this junction of time, all patients were given test dose (10&#x02013;20 ml slowly IV) of HES &#x02013; 6%, 130/0.4 (9.1) while closely observing the patients for pruritus, rashes, or flushing suggestive of possible anaphylactic reaction. Patients presenting with anuria or oliguria were given one liter of crystalloids intravenously within 30&#x02013;60 min to improve UOP while observing for fluid overloading. If UOP did not improve, patients were given injection furosemide 40 mg IV. If UOP still did not improve, patients were excluded from the study.</p><p>At this juncture, physiological component of the Physiological and Operative Severity Score for the enUmeration of Mortality and Morbidity (POSSUM) system (annexure-2) was recorded. The physiological component of POSSUM consists of 12 variables: age, cardiac status, respiratory status, systolic blood pressure (BP), heart rate, Glasgow Coma Scale, serum concentration of urea, K<sup>+</sup>, Na<sup>+</sup>, hemoglobin level, white blood cell (WBC) count, and ECG. Each factor (except WBC count, and ECG which have three grades only) is exponentially allocated 1, 2, 4, or 8.</p><p>Expected goals, in the form of improvement in clinical, hematological, or biochemical indices were specified for each patient; however, in general, this consisted of improvement in heart rate, BP, CVP, serum electrolytes, kidney function, and hematocrit.</p><p>Patients were randomized with the help of computer-generated random table and administered the fluid therapy according to randomization without knowledge of the observer. Group A patients were given crystalloid solutions. Group B patients were given 6% HES. Ringer's lactate solution was additionally given to all patients to compensate for fluid loss by sweating and gastric tube.</p><p>Fluid therapies as per random group were commenced as soon as contraindications for colloid infusion had been ruled out. Group A patients were resuscitated by crystalloid solution, the amount and rate of infusion of which were determined by patient's condition and progress. Group B patients were resuscitated by 6% HES 130/0.4 (9.1) up to total dose of 30 ml/kg body weight, to be infused at the rate of 15 ml/kg body weight/hour. These patients were also given crystalloids according to their needs.</p><p>Preoperative fluid resuscitation was deemed complete if the required changes in clinical, hematological, or biochemical status were achieved or if, in the opinion of both the surgeon and anesthetist, further attempt at resuscitation were unlikely to be of any value or would be inappropriate without operative intervention. At this moment, the observer recorded the physiological component of POSSUM score again by appropriate clinical examination and investigations. The amount of fluid infused and time taken to achieve goals of emergency fluid resuscitation were noted.</p><p>Thereafter, the patients were subjected to emergency laparotomy at the earliest. A uniform protocol of general anesthesia was used for all patients. The operative procedure was tailored according to the needs and operative findings of the patients.</p><p>Postoperatively, the observer closely monitored all patients till death or 30 days after discharge from hospital, for complications and outcome. This included monitoring by clinical methods. Hematological, biochemical, microbiological, and radiological investigations were done as and when required. Blood products if required were given to both groups of patients. Subsequent changes in antibiotics and duration of antibiotic treatment were according to microbiological results and the progress of the patient. All patients were encouraged for oral feeding, commencing after return of bowel activity. Rest of the interventions such as ventilatory support, vasopressor use, dressing of the wound, removal of drain tube, NG tube, and Foley's catheter were tailored according to the patient's progress.</p><p>Outcomes were recorded as alive or dead and complicated or uncomplicated. Standard definitions were used for complications.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] The operative severity elements of the POSSUM for all patients were scored at discharge/death. The elements of operative severity score consist of operative severity, multiple procedures, total blood loss, peritoneal soiling, the presence of malignancy, and mode of surgery. As for the physiological elements, each factor (except for multiple procedures and mode of surgery) is divided into four grades allocating a score of 1, 2, 4, or 8.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All data were presented as mean. Predicted morbidity and mortality were calculated using POSSUM score and previously given logistic regression equations and exponential analysis.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] That the two groups (control and study) were similar (or not), to start with, was demonstrated by comparing the physiological component score at admission (repeated measure analysis of variance [ANOVA]), age (Student's <italic>t</italic>-test) and sex ratio (Chi-square test). Effect on morbidity and mortality was compared by repeated measure ANOVA and its significance tested by Tukey's test. The length of stay (LOS) were compared using unpaired t- test.

However, there are scanty studies worldwide to assess the benefits of preoperative resuscitation in perforation peritonitis case; therefore, this prospective, randomized, observer-blind large study in patients with perforation peritonitis was conceived. Audit of benefits of preoperative fluid resuscitation is additional problem. This may be done using parameters such as crude morbidity and mortality. However, comparison of crude mortality and morbidity is misleading because such rates make no allowance for differences in case mix and fitness of patients. Therefore, to audit the benefits of fluid resuscitation, we needed a risk-adjusted scoring system that predicts both mortality and morbidity. Copeland developed POSSUM as an audit tool for comparing outcome in surgical patients.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Subsequently, it has been validated world over. Moreover, it is very simple to use. Thus, it can be said that POSSUM is one such excellent tool of audit. Hence, we choose POSSUM to compare outcomes.</p><p>There were two objectives of this study. The first objective was to quantify the benefits of the preoperative resuscitation in terms of morbidity and mortality, using POSSUM, in patients with perforation peritonitis. The second objective was to find the fluid of choice, between crystalloids and colloid solution, for preoperative resuscitation.</p><sec id="sec2-6"><title>The benefits of preoperative fluid resuscitation</title><p>McIlroy <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] were probably the first one to audit the benefit of preoperative fluid resuscitation in emergency situations. They studied 148 patients suffering from acute gastrointestinal pathology. Using POSSUM as the tool, they demonstrated that fluid resuscitation improved predicted morbidity and mortality by 4.3 &#x000b1; 0.7% and 4.2 &#x000b1; 0.8%, respectively. However, in their study, the patients were largely elderly (mean age being 61 years), and only 30% had perforation peritonitis. Further, the authors did not document time required for achieving goals of resuscitation. Last, and importantly, it was a nonrandomized trial. Nonetheless, they not only demonstrated that resuscitation can be audited and quantified but also proved that resuscitation helps in improving mortality and morbidity.</p><p>Our study provides level I evidence of the beneficial role of preoperative fluid resuscitation in perforation peritonitis patients irrespective of the type of fluid used; the predicted morbidity and mortality were reduced by 11.6% and 16.0%, respectively. These findings assume great importance as our trial was an RCT, included a large number of patients with age ranging from 18 to 60 years, focused entirely on perforation peritonitis, and the benefits were more pronounced. Thus, our study overcame the shortcomings seen previously (in McIlroy <italic>et al</italic>. study).</p></sec><sec id="sec2-7"><title>Choice of fluid</title><p>There have been numerous trials to find out which is the fluid of choice for resuscitation. A major disadvantage of crystalloid solutions is that relatively large volumes have to be infused to restore an intravascular volume deficit (the classical 3:1 replacement rule). This can lead to interstitial edema which may worsen gas exchange in the lungs and impair wound healing in the skin.</p><p>Recently, hyperosmolar crystalloid fluids in the resuscitation of critically ill patients have been used. Hyperosmolar crystalloid fluids act by drawing fluid from the intracellular and interstitial space to intravascular volume.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Hence, it is believed that only small volume (and consequently shorter infusion times) is required to achieve the resuscitation end-points. This is the main advantage of these types of fluids.</p><p>Colloid solutions are essentially crystalloid solutions with biologically inert colloid particles added. The colloid particles act as oncotic agents to retain fluid in the intravascular fluid compartment. The normal colloid oncotic pressure is 25; it is now possible to administer fluids that have colloid oncotic pressures of up to seventy. In the absence of capillary leakage of colloid particles, these hyperoncotic solutions can expand the intravascular volume by up to 2&#x02013;3 times their infused volume.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>Albumin is a human product, biological colloid, carries with it the risks of infection transmission. Volume for volume, albumin is up to ten times as expensive as other synthetic colloids.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>HES appears valuable and significantly cheaper alternative to albumin even for prolonged (5 days) volume therapy in critically ill. HES has been found to be better than modified gelatin as volume preload before spinal anesthesia for cesarean section.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] HES has been found to inhibit endothelial activation, thus preventing neutrophil adhesion during sepsis syndrome.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] HES attenuates hypoxia-induced increase in vascular leakage and acute inflammation.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Its infusion has no adverse effect on standard coagulation parameters.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>Cochrane Database Systematic Review 2007 studied 53 trials comparing crystalloids and colloid for fluid resuscitation for hypovolemia.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Pooled relative risks fail to show a mortality benefit for resuscitation with any type of colloid.</p><p>Our study shows that the resuscitation with either type of fluid decreased predicted morbidity and mortality.

These findings are contrary to recent observations derived from meta-analysis,[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] wherein it has been stated that the colloids had no beneficial effect on pooled relative risk for mortality. Moreover, this study demonstrates that the time taken to fluid resuscitate is same irrespective of the type of fluid used. Importantly, however, LOS remains unchanged by the type of fluid employed. The findings of this study assume greater importance in view of the fact that there were no side effects attributed specifically to a particular type of fluid. There was no instance of anaphylactic reaction with HES.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Preoperative emergency fluid resuscitation is associated with statistically significant improvement in predicted morbidity and mortality, irrespective of the fluid use. This improvement in predicted morbidity and mortality is more in patients receiving HES, without increasing the time taken to achieve the goals of the resuscitation. However, the LOS is not impacted by the preoperative fluid resuscitation.</p><p>The benefits of preoperative fluid resuscitation in patients with perforation peritonitis have been audited through this study for the first time. Recently, the need for fluid resuscitation has been re-emphasized.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] In view of this, it is recommended that adequate time should be invested in preoperative fluid resuscitation to favorably impact the predicted morbidity as well as the mortality. However, the choice of fluid may not matter much. Hence, all patients with perforation peritonitis must be resuscitated using IV fluids (either crystalloids or colloids) early and adequately. However, care must be exercised to avoid fluid overloading as the same has been linked with increased severity of organ dysfunction and worse outcome.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><sec id="sec2-8"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-9" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Kirkpatrik</surname><given-names>CJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Klosterhalfen</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Hauptmann</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name></person-group><person-group person-group-type="editor"><name><surname>Vincent</surname><given-names>JL</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The role of the endothelium in the multiple organ failure</article-title><source>Yearbook of Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine</source><year>1992</year><publisher-loc>Berlin</publisher-loc><publisher-name>Springer</publisher-name><fpage>14</fpage><lpage>24</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Sibbald</surname><given-names>WJ</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Sepsis &#x02013; Current Perspectives in the Pathophysiology and Therapy</article-title><source>Update in Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine</source><year>1994</year><volume>Vol. 18</volume><publisher-loc>Berlin</publisher-loc><publisher-name>Springer</publisher-name><fpage>266</fpage><lpage>73</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>McIlroy</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Miller</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Copeland</surname><given-names>GP</given-names></name><name><surname>Kiff</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Audit of emergency preoperative resuscitation</article-title><source>Br J Surg</source><year>1994</year><volume>81</volume><fpage>200</fpage><lpage>2</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">8156335</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Sagar</surname><given-names>PM</given-names></name><name><surname>Hartley</surname><given-names>MN</given-names></name><name><surname>MacFie</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Taylor</surname><given-names>BA</given-names></name><name><surname>Copeland</surname><given-names>GP</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Comparison of individual surgeon's performance.
