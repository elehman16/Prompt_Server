An increasing number of studies have demonstrated the link between thin ideal exposure and body image in young Australian children (e.g., Ricciardelli and McCabe <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2001</xref>). For example, watching television and perceiving pressure to be thin from the media were found to be related to increased awareness of weight loss strategies and disturbed eating behavior over time in young North American and Australian children (Harrison and Hefner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2006</xref>; McCabe and Ricciardelli <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2005</xref>). As girls in Western societies (like The Netherlands) are frequently exposed to thin fashion dolls, this might affect the development of their body image and eating behaviors as well. Since little is known about the effects of playing with thin dolls, it is important to investigate the effects of doing so on young girls&#x02019; body image and eating behavior.</p><p>Numerous studies have shown that children in Western societies experience body image concerns at a very young age (Davison et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2003</xref>; Hill et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">1994</xref>; Hill and Robinson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">1991</xref>; Schur et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2000</xref>; Shunk and Birch <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2004</xref>). This research stresses the significance of studying socio-cultural influences on children (e.g., Clark and Tiggemann <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2006</xref>; Collins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">1991</xref>). Children learn through observing and imitating behaviors they see in their environment (Villani <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2001</xref>). For example, in children&#x02019;s media, beauty is often associated with goodness, whereas ugliness is associated with badness (Herbozo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2004</xref>). Furthermore, the media teaches children that obese children have fewer friends, are less liked by their parents, are lazier, and less happy than normal weight children (Hebl and Heatherton <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">1998</xref>; Hebl and Turchin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2005</xref>; Hill and Silver <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">1995</xref>). Young girls are found to be especially susceptible to thin ideal media, negatively affecting body satisfaction and promoting disturbed eating behaviors such as dieting (e.g., Moriarty and Harrison <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2008</xref>; Phares et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2004</xref>). Many young girls indicate using media as an important source of information about dieting (Lawrie et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2007</xref>; Schur et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2000</xref>).</p><p>Like children&#x02019;s media, playing with toys is also part of the socialization process of children (Sutton-Smith <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">1985</xref>). Fashion dolls might serve as role models for young girls. Playing with these dolls might provide girls with mental representations of what is expected of them later in life, with respect to their social skills as well as their body appearance. The most famous fashion doll in the world is probably Mattel&#x02019;s Barbie. In Western societies, almost all girls own one or more Barbie dolls (Rogers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">1999</xref>). Particularly famous aspects of Barbie are her body shape and proportions that have been criticized for being extremely unrealistic (e.g., Brownell and Napolitano <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">1995</xref>; Pedersen and Markee <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">1991</xref>). Norton et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">1996</xref>) showed that the probability for such a body shape is less than 1 in 100,000 women. Since many young girls are exposed to this unrealistic thin ideal by playing with Barbie dolls, this might affect how they look at themselves.</p><p>Although there has been discussion about the extremely thin body of Barbie, only one experimental study actually tested the effects of exposure to images of Barbie on body image in a sample of young girls&#x02019; from the United Kingdom (Dittmar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2006</xref>). In that study, 5- to 8-year-old girls were exposed to images of Barbie or to images of Emme (developed by Tonner); a doll with more realistic body proportions that was endorsed by the American Dietetic Association as a healthy role model for young girls. They found that girls between the ages of 5.5 to 7.5&#x000a0;years old had lower body esteem scores and a greater discrepancy between actual and ideal body sizes or actual and adult body sizes (relative difference between the actual body size of the girl and her desired adult body size) if they were exposed to images of a Barbie, whereas exposure to images of the Emme doll had no effects on these variables. However, children between the ages of 7.5 and 8.5 experienced greater actual and adult body discrepancies if exposed to images of Emme, whereas no effects were found for exposure to images of Barbie in this age group. Dittmar et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2006</xref>) reasoned that the age difference they found can be explained by the fact that the girls under the age of 7.5 are still developing a self-concept and therefore use Barbie actively as a reference norm, whereas girls older than 7.5&#x000a0;years have already internalized the thin ideal as a cognitive self-concept structure (see also Vygotsky <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">1991</xref>).</p><p>In the present study, we aimed at replicating and extending the study by Dittmar et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2006</xref>) by testing the effects of actually playing with thin dolls vs. playing with an average sized doll. Dittmar et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2006</xref>) found lower body esteem and higher body dissatisfaction in girls after exposure to images of the Barbie doll as compared to images of the Emme doll and the control condition. No differences between the Emme doll and the control condition were found on these variables. Dittmar et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2006</xref>) used pictures of the dolls as stimulus material in their experiment. It is possible that actually playing with the doll would have more profound effects since the body proportions of the doll become even more salient when they actually handle it. In addition, because the Emme doll does differ from the Barbie doll not only in body size but also literally in height and weight (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), a larger but equally slim doll (Tyler) as Barbie was included in the present study to control for the possible confounding effect of the smaller size of the Barbie doll. In addition, following Dittmar et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2006</xref>), a neutral condition was included to serve as a baseline condition for girls&#x02019; body image which involved playing with Legos instead of a doll. Similar to Dittmar et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2006</xref>), age differences were tested in the present study. Since we know that negative body image and dissatisfaction are associated with unhealthy eating behaviors such as dieting and bulimic eating behaviors (e.g., Stice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2001</xref>), it is essential to test whether playing with these different-sized dolls has a direct impact on eating behavior. Therefore, we included food intake as a dependent measure in the present study.

Most girls were native Dutch citizens (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;111). Six girls were born in different countries (Belgium, China, Ireland, Indonesia, Syria and Thailand). Exclusion of these girls did not alter the results, so it was decided to include them in the analyses. The mean age of the sample was 8.04 (SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.32). Mean age across conditions did not significantly differ, <italic>F</italic>(2,116)&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.81, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;.17, cohen&#x02019;s <italic>f</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;.18: thin dolls (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;57; M&#x02009;=&#x02009;8.07, SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.35), average-sized dolls (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;33; M&#x02009;=&#x02009;7.73, SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.13), and no doll (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;27; M&#x02009;=&#x02009;8.37, SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.45). The mean body mass index (BMI) of the girls was 17.28 (SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.70). Mean BMI across conditions did not differ significantly, <italic>F</italic>(2,116)&#x02009;=&#x02009;.13, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;.88, cohen&#x02019;s <italic>f</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;.05: thin dolls (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;57; M&#x02009;=&#x02009;17.17, SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.82), average-sized dolls (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;33; M&#x02009;=&#x02009;17.48, SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.54), and no doll (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;27; M&#x02009;=&#x02009;17.25, SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.72).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Materials and Measures</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Dolls</title><p>In one condition the girls played with a Barbie (Mattel&#x000ae;). In a second condition girls played with an Emme doll that was especially made with a realistic body size, based on the full-figured American fashion model Emme. Barbie&#x02019;s body represents a U.S. dress size 2, whereas Emme represents a U.S. dress size 16 (Dittmar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2006</xref>). The problem with comparing the Barbie to the Emme doll is that the Emme doll is not only larger in body size, the doll itself is also taller than Barbie. To control for differences in the height of the dolls, we included a third condition with another doll also developed by Tonner (from Tonner&#x02019;s Tyler Wentworth Collection) that is comparable in height to Emme, but also very slim like Barbie, which we refer to as the Tyler doll. Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> depicts images of the three dolls used in this study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Body Size of the Doll</title><p>To check whether the girls actually noticed the different body sizes of the dolls, they were asked to indicate the body figure of the doll. We presented the girls with nine female body silhouette drawings ranging from very thin to very large (Stunkard et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">1983</xref>) and asked the girls to indicate which picture looked most like the doll they just played with. Further, the girls were presented with a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), which comprises a line of 140&#x000a0;mm on which they were asked to indicate to what extent they considered the doll they just played with as thin.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Dependent Variables</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Body Esteem</title><p>To be able to compare our results with the results of Dittmar et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2006</xref>) we used the same measure to investigate body esteem. Their final scale consisted of 6 items measuring perceived appearance by others (e.g., &#x02018;Children my own age like my looks&#x02019;), weight perception (e.g., &#x02018;My weight makes me happy&#x02019;) and non-specific body esteem (e.g., &#x02018;I am proud of my body&#x02019;). Like Dittmar et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2006</xref>), we used a response format with pictures of smiley&#x02019;s in which the girls had three response options; &#x02018;no&#x02019;, &#x02018;in between&#x02019;, and &#x02018;yes&#x02019;. They were scored with a &#x02018;0&#x02019;, &#x02018;1&#x02019; or &#x02018;2&#x02019;, respectively. Facial pictures were used to illustrate the response options. The items were summed and divided by 6 to create a body esteem score for each girl. All statements were positively worded, so a higher score on this measure indicates greater body esteem. Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha in our sample was .64.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Actual-Ideal Body Size Discrepancy</title><p>To measure the actual-ideal body size discrepancy the Children Figure Rating Scale was used (see Tiggemann and Wilson-Barrett <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">1996</xref>). A series of nine drawings of girls&#x02019; body figures, ranging from very thin to very fat, were presented. The girls were asked to indicate which drawing looked most similar to their own current body shape, and which one would be their ideal body shape. The difference between the reported current body shape and the ideal body shape was used as a measure of body dissatisfaction. A positive score indicated a discrepancy between the current and the ideal body shape; this meant that the girl wanted to be thinner than she actually reported to be. Scoring a zero indicated that there was no difference between the current and the ideal body shape, which meant that the girl was satisfied with her body shape. A negative score indicated that the girl wanted to be larger than she actually reported to be. The use of the Figure Rating Scale has proven valid for use in young children (Gardner et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">1997</xref>) and has good test-retest reliability (e.g., Veron-Guidry and Williamson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">1996</xref>; Wood et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">1996</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Food Intake</title><p>During the taste test the girls could freely eat from three bowls filled with chocolate-coated peanuts. The amount of test food the girls ate during the taste test was measured with a professional scale (Kern 440) and the total amount of test food eaten (in grams) represented their food intake.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Covariates</title><sec id="Sec12"><title>BMI</title><p>BMI (weight (kg)/height<sup>2</sup> (m)) was calculated based on measured height and weight. Weight was measured in light clothing and without shoes to the nearest .1&#x000a0;kg. Height was measured according to standard procedures (without shoes), to the nearest .5&#x000a0;cm.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Satiety</title><p>Food intake may depend on level of satiety. We aimed to control for individual differences in state of caloric deprivation, so we asked the girls to indicate on a VAS (140&#x000a0;mm) to what extent they felt hungry just before they participated in the experiment (ranging from &#x02018;not at all hungry!&#x02019; to &#x02018;very hungry!&#x02019;). To avoid demand characteristics we assessed the satiety level of the girls after the experimental manipulation (see also Anschutz et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2008</xref>; Anschutz et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2009</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Liking of Testfood</title><p>We controlled for liking of chocolate-coated peanuts by presenting the girls with a VAS (140&#x000a0;mm) to measure the extent to which they liked the test food (ranging from &#x02018;I totally do not like it&#x02019; to &#x02018;I totally like it&#x02019;).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Moderating Variables (Additional Analyses)</title><sec id="Sec16"><title>Owning a Barbie</title><p>We investigated whether the girls in our sample owned a Barbie at home by asking them the question whether they owned a Barbie or not.

After gaining consent from the schools to participate, the parents of the children received a letter in which they were fully informed about the purpose of the study and were asked whether they would allow their child to participate or not (active informed consent). Girls who were allergic to the test food (i.e., chocolate coated peanuts) were excluded from participation.</p><p>All girls were tested in a separate room at their schools during regular school hours for approximately 30&#x000a0;min per session. There were four conditions within a randomized experimental design: Barbie doll, Emme doll, Tyler doll, and Control. During the first 10&#x000a0;min of the session, the girls played with the dolls or LEGO&#x000ae;. When playing with one of the dolls, the girls were instructed to dress the doll for a party and a working day. They started by playing with a naked doll to make sure they had seen the body of the doll. The setting in which they played was a dressing room for dolls, with all kinds of dolls clothes and accessories the girls could use. Girls in the control condition were asked to build a house with the LEGO&#x000ae;. The experimenter was sitting next to the girls and tried to make the girls feel comfortable if needed, but did not interfere with the play. After approximately 10&#x000a0;min of playing, the girls filled out questionnaires concerning their body esteem and body shape satisfaction. Then, the experimenter presented the girls with three pre-weighed bowls of chocolate-coated peanuts with one colour in each bowl. The girls were told that they had to evaluate the chocolate-coated peanuts in order to decide which colour tasted best. They were told that the experimenter would leave them alone for several minutes and they could eat whatever they liked from the test food to determine which colour tasted best. Then the experimenter left the room and returned after 8&#x000a0;min. Subsequently, girls had to fill out the other questionnaires of interest. These questionnaires comprised measures of our dependent variables (body esteem and actual-ideal body size discrepancy), manipulation check (body size of the dolls), possible covariates (satiety, liking of the test food), and moderating variables (owning a Barbie, time spent playing with Barbie, enjoyment of the experiment). Finally, to calculate BMI, their height and weight was measured. All girls were asked not to talk about the experiment with their classmates. After data collection and analyses were finished, all participating schools were informed about the results of the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Preliminary Analyses</title><p>A MANCOVA was conducted to check whether there were any differences between the effects of exposure to the two thin dolls (Barbie vs. Tyler) on body esteem, actual-ideal body size discrepancy or food intake (controlling for BMI).

Following Dittmar et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2006</xref>), age was categorized into two groups; girls under 7.5&#x000a0;years of age (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;42) and girls over 7.5&#x000a0;years of age (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;75). BMI was included as a covariate in all analyses, because BMI and body dissatisfaction (e.g., Yates et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2004</xref>) as well as BMI and food intake (e.g., MacDiarmid et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">1998</xref>) have been found to be related. Satiety (<italic>r</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;.10, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;.28) and liking of the test food (<italic>r</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;.15, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;.12) were not significantly associated with food intake, and were therefore not included as covariates in the analyses regarding food intake.

Further, three 3 (condition; thin dolls, average size doll, no-doll control)&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;2 (age group; under and over 7.5) ANCOVA&#x02019;s were conducted to test the effects on body esteem, actual-ideal body size discrepancy and food intake of the girls (H1, H2, and H3), controlling for BMI.</p><p>Cohen&#x02019;s <italic>d</italic> was reported to indicate the effect size of the main effects of age group.

The most important finding was that girls who played with the average sized doll ate significantly more than girls who played with a thin doll.</p><p>Contrary to Dittmar et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2006</xref>), we did not find that exposure to a thin doll negatively affected body esteem or actual-ideal body size discrepancy compared with exposure to an average-sized doll for girls younger or older than 7.5&#x000a0;years. An explanation might be that Dittmar et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2006</xref>) exposed the girls to a picture book with images of the dolls - which might not be different from exposure to thin models in magazines- whereas the girls in our study actually played with the dolls. Magazine exposure might indirectly imply more &#x02018;aggressive&#x02019; norm-setting, since it is a form of media exposure and the media is known for setting social and cultural norms regarding appearance even in young children (Lawrie et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2007</xref>). In Dittmar et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2006</xref>), the images of the dolls might actually have functioned as thin model images. We know from the literature that exposure to slim model images is related to higher body dissatisfaction than exposure to average or oversized model images (for reviews see Grabe et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2008</xref>; Groesz et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2002</xref>). It is important to keep in mind that the young girls in the current study were aware of the body size of the dolls, as is shown by the substantial differences between experimental conditions on the manipulation check. Thus, the lack of effects on girls&#x02019; body image cannot be explained by the fact that they did not notice the dolls&#x02019; body sizes. Still, when exposed to a real doll the girls might experience less external pressure, because they are in control of the play and no explicit norms are imposed by the environment. Therefore this type of exposure might not directly affect their body image, which might be rather stable. Future studies might explicitly compare the effects of toys with the effects of portrayals of thin images in the media.</p><p>Interestingly, we did find an effect on girls&#x02019; actual eating behavior. They ate less food when they played with the thin dolls than when they played with the average sized doll. Perhaps the girls were inspired by the Barbie to achieve a slim body and therefore ate less. Results of previous studies showed that young girls are already aware of the thin ideal and weight loss strategies to achieve this ideal (e.g., Dohnt and Tiggemann <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2004</xref>). However, closer inspection of the means indicated that the girls ate more when they played with the average sized Emme doll instead of eating less when they played with the thin dolls. This might be explained by the fact that exposure to a heavier model leads to elevated food intake. In a different context, studies focusing on imitation of eating behavior revealed that the physical appearance of a model can influence the &#x02018;normative&#x02019; standard of food intake in an eating context (Salvy et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2007</xref>). Hermans et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2008</xref>) found that the Dutch female students in their experiment only imitated the elevated intake of a confederate if the confederate was of normal weight, and not if the confederate was slim. Although the dolls in our study did not eat, it still might have been the case that their physical appearance created a differential eating context in which the average sized doll created a context where eating an unrestricted amount of test food would be normative and socially accepted. Accordingly, the body size of a model in a certain context might refer to a normative eating standard (Anschutz et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2008</xref>), which might explain why the girls in the present study ate more when they played with the average sized doll. Different types of norms might apply to food intake compared to body image, as body image was not affected in the present study. Norms regarding body image might be related to &#x02018;thinness&#x02019; (so these norms might be communicated by thin images/dolls), whereas our results regarding food intake suggest that it was actually the larger doll that carried out a norm regarding food intake.</p><p>The average-sized doll might also have caused a relief effect. This relief effect, implying that some women feel better about their own body and might even eat more after exposure to average sized media models, was previously found in adult females (Anschutz et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2008</xref>; Dittmar and Howard <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2004</xref>). In the current study, playing with a more realistically proportioned doll may have freed the girls from dietary restraint and made them feel that they could take as many sweets as they wanted. This explanation is further supported by the finding that almost half of the girls in our sample desired a thinner body size. It would be interesting to replicate the present study using healthy test food. It could be examined whether the girls would also eat more healthy food after exposure to an average sized doll, which would then clearly be a positive eating behavior. Another suggestion for future research might be to let the girls play that they are preparing a dinner, using a setting with all kinds of foods (healthy and unhealthy), to see whether they are more likely to choose healthy foods and maybe also less food when they play with a thin doll than when playing with an average sized doll.</p><p>A remarkable finding of the present study was that no significant correlation was found between food intake and body esteem or body size discrepancy, as was previously found in adults (e.g., Stice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2001</xref>). Perhaps the female children in our study have not yet fully developed a coherent self-concept (Marsh et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">1998</xref>), including body image as a cognitive construct. This implies that although young children display behaviors related to appearance enhancement in relation to thin ideal cues, they do not express dissatisfaction with their body in accordance yet (see also Hayes and Tantleff-Dunn <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2010</xref>). However, this assumption remains speculative and requires further examination in future research.</p><sec id="Sec29"><title>Limitations and Future Directions</title><p>It should be mentioned that we do not know what the long-term effects of playing with a doll could be on body image and food intake in young girls. A suggestion for future study would be to investigate the long-term effects of playing with a thin doll, and to compare these with the effects of playing with a more average sized doll like Emme, starting with the first time the girls are exposed to the dolls. Young girls who have never been exposed before to a Barbie or Tonner doll could participate in the study, in which the girls would be exposed to a Barbie or Tonner doll at certain (controlled) time points. Right after the exposure, body image and actual food intake could be measured. This design could provide more insight into the effects of doll exposure over time. Another suggestion would be to focus on young boys by examining the effects of exposure to action hero toys with different body sizes on body image and appearance-related behaviors in boys. Pope et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">1999</xref>) showed that male action toys have grown much more muscular over time and became highly unrealistic. Additionally, previous studies also showed that exposure to the male beauty ideal is related to body image concerns in men (e.g., Jones and Crawford <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2005</xref>; Olivardia et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2004</xref>). Moreover, previous research in adult men showed that handling unrealistic proportioned action figures was related to a decrease in body esteem (Barlett et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2005</xref>). The present sample was slightly older than the sample used by Dittmar et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2006</xref>). Since the older children reported still playing with dolls, we did not consider our sample too old for comparison with the Dittmar et al. study. However, in future studies we will aim at testing the effects of playing with dolls in a younger sample.</p><p>Future studies could also use a different measure of body esteem to investigate how consistent the present findings with regard to body esteem are. At least in our Dutch sample, we noted that the reliability of the scale was rather low, which is a limitation of the present study&#x02019;s investigation of the effects of our manipulation on this dependent variable. The body esteem scale of Dittmar et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2006</xref>) assesses different aspects of body esteem (e.g., weight related body esteem or concerns regarding own appearance as perceived by others) with only six items in total, which might have made the construct that was measured less cohesive. Further, low alpha&#x02019;s were found in other studies using self-report questionnaires when assessing psychological constructs in young children (e.g., Putnam and Rothbart <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2006</xref>; Rothbart et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2001</xref>). A suggestion for future research might be to use the Body-Esteem Scale (Mendelson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">1996</xref>). This scale was designed to assess children&#x02019;s attitudes and feelings about their bodily appearance and was found to have good internal consistency in a young children&#x02019;s sample (see also Ricciardelli and McCabe <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2001</xref>).</p><p>In sum, the present study is the first to compare the effects of actually playing with different-sized dolls on body image and food intake among young girls. Body image did not differ for girls who played with thin dolls vs. average-sized dolls; but the girls who played with average-sized dolls ate more than the girls who played with thin dolls. Since girls in Western societies are frequently exposed to fashion dolls, it is important to further examine the effects of exposure to these dolls on their body image and eating behaviors.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p><bold>Open Access</bold> This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Noncommercial License which permits any
