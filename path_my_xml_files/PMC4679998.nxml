Several population cohort studies suggest, however, that alcohol consumption may not be solely harmful. In fact, moderate alcohol consumption seems to have beneficial effects on various parts of our health, decreasing the risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></p><p>Systematic reviews and meta-analysis on the association between alcohol consumption and dementia have concluded that at present there is no indication that light-to-moderate alcohol consumption is harmful to dementia.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> On the contrary, it has been stated that there is substantial evidence that light-to-moderate alcohol consumption reduces the risk of dementia and cognitive decline.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p><p>While there are numerous studies focusing on alcohol as a risk factor for dementia and mortality in healthy subjects, virtually no attention has been paid to the effect of alcohol consumption in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD).</p><p>It has been argued that social drinking may be harmful for patients with AD;<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> however, we have not been able to identify any studies on the association between alcohol consumption and mortality in patients diagnosed with dementia. Considering that AD is a neurodegenerative disorder and that alcohol has known neurotoxic effects, one could easily jump to the conclusion that alcohol is damaging for patients with AD. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the positive association between moderate alcohol intake and mortality shown in population-based studies on healthy subjects can be transferred to patients with mild AD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>The data reported in this post hoc analysis were collected as part of the Danish Alzheimer's Intervention Study (DAISY), a longitudinal multicentre study on the efficacy of a psychosocial intervention in patients with mild AD in five county districts in Denmark. Details of the background, cohort and methods of the study have been reported earlier.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6&#x02013;8</xref> Briefly, this multicentre, rater-blinded, randomised controlled study (RCT) included 330 outpatients with mild AD, or dementia with Lewy bodies, and their 330 primary caregivers. The participants were randomised to control support during follow-up or to control support plus DAISY intervention (multifaceted and semitailored counselling, support and education) over a period of 12&#x02005;months. The follow-up period was 3&#x02005;years. The aim of the original DAISY study was to assess the efficacy at 12&#x02005;months of an early psychosocial counselling and support programme for outpatients with mild AD and their primary caregivers. For the present study, only patients with AD (n=321) were included.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Participants</title><p>Inclusion criteria for the patients were: (1) a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score &#x02265;20, (2) a clinical diagnosis within the past 12&#x02005;months of <italic>probable AD</italic> or <italic>mixed AD with vascular components</italic>, (3) age &#x02265;50 and (4) having a primary caregiver willing to participate in the study. The patients met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> criteria for dementia and the NINCDS-ADRDA<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> criteria for probable AD. Patients were excluded if they lived in a nursing home, participated in other intervention studies or if they had severe somatic or psychiatric comorbidity (including significantly impaired hearing or vision). Written informed consent to participate was obtained from all patients and primary caregivers.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Assessment of alcohol intake</title><p>At inclusion, the caregivers were asked about the patient's current average daily intake of alcohol.</p><p>The caregivers were asked in a questionnaire to assess: &#x02018;Alcohol consumption&#x02014;current daily intake (tick off one box): no alcohol, only at parties, 1 or &#x0003c;1&#x02005;unit/day, 2&#x02013;3&#x02005;units/day or more than 3&#x02005;units/day&#x02019;. Alcohol consumption was not divided into types of alcoholic beverages (beer, wine, spirits, etc).</p><p>Owing to the similar raw 3-year mortality (18.4% and 20.2%) and since the two classifications were overlapping, the groups &#x02018;only at parties&#x02019; and &#x02018;1 or &#x0003c;1&#x02005;unit/day&#x02019; were compiled under the title &#x02018;1 or &#x0003c;1&#x02005;unit/day&#x02019;.</p><p>The Danish unit of alcohol was used in the study. A Danish unit of alcohol is 12&#x02005;g/15&#x02005;mL of pure alcohol (a UK unit of alcohol is 10&#x02005;mL of pure alcohol.)</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Assessment of mortality</title><p>Mortality data were retrieved from The Danish Civil Registration System.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Assessment of confounders</title><p>A number of potential confounders were recorded in order to adjust the analysis: age, sex, smoking, household status, MMSE, quality of life (QoL), awareness, education level and comorbidity.</p><p>MMSE was used to assess global cognitive functions.

Previous studies have either focused on alcohol consumption and the risk of developing dementia, or on alcohol consumption and mortality in healthy subjects.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>

An association that is suggestive of a protective effect between alcohol and mortality was seen only in the group of patients who had 2&#x02013;3&#x02005;units/day.</p><p>There are several possible explanations for the protective association between moderate alcohol intake and mortality observed in our study: (1) small amounts of alcohol may have a health preserving effect per se as indicated in studies in healthy subjects; (2) patients with moderate alcohol intake may have a richer social environment, which has been shown to improve the QoL and perhaps mortality; (3) the seemingly protective association may be caused by bias due to the fact that some patients with low intake may be in the terminal phase of their life.</p><p>In earlier studies, there are a variety of proposed explanations for the associations between moderate alcohol consumption and mortality in healthy subjects. Among these, evidence is perhaps strongest for moderate alcohol consumption lowering mortality indirectly by decreasing the risks of cardiovascular disease.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> However, other plausible explanations such as modification of inflammation by lowering of interleukin 6 levels,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> or increase in insulin sensitivity,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> have been suggested.</p><p>Results concerning the effect of alcohol consumption on the development of dementia are diverging, but most studies have demonstrated a reduction in dementia and risk of AD with moderate alcohol intake compared to abstinence.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>

Some have argued that only consumption of wine was associated with a lower risk of dementia,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>

This points in the direction that increased alcohol intake is only protective until a certain consumption level.</p><p>Several limitations of our study must be acknowledged. The results of this study are based on post hoc analysis, that is, the investigation of alcohol intake on mortality was not described in the original DAISY protocol.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> However, the present research question was formulated (in an unpublished protocol) before the analyses were performed, and was not part of a portfolio of research questions. Hence, we believe that our results do not contain confirmation bias.</p><p>In the alcohol groups, other than our reference group (1 or &#x0003c;1&#x02005;unit/day), the number of study participants was relatively low. The group &#x02018;More than 3&#x02005;units per day&#x02019; especially had few participants. This could be the reason for lack of power and therefore the lack of association between alcohol and mortality in the groups &#x02018;No alcohol&#x02019; and &#x02018;More than 3&#x02005;units per day&#x02019;. However, the point estimates do not point towards an association.</p><p>In our questionnaires, we focused on the amount of alcohol consumed. We did not address other aspects of alcohol consumption that might be equally important. This includes considering if the group of abstainers contained both ex-drinkers and patients with lifelong abstinence and taking into account patterns of alcohol consumption. Since units were not divided into types of alcohol, we are unable to detect whether a possible protective association between moderate alcohol consumption and mortality is limited to one type of alcohol, for example, wine.</p><p>In this study, the amount of alcohol consumed by the patient was not self-reported, but was assessed by the primary caregiver and therefore less likely to be marred with inaccuracy caused by dementia. However, we cannot rule out that some patients took more alcohol than was noticed by their primary caregivers, or that the primary caregiver was not entirely accurate about the amount of alcohol a patient consumed. Characteristics of the caregivers might differ considerably between dyads (patient and primary caregiver). Cognitive abilities and the caregivers&#x02019; own alcohol consumption levels are some of the things that are likely to have influenced both the actual amount of alcohol consumed by the patient and the amount reported.</p><p>We assessed alcohol consumption only once at inclusion. It might have been more representative to obtain measurements of alcohol consumption multiple times throughout the participant's lives after the AD diagnosis, thus characterising long-term alcohol consumption patterns for our patients with AD and possibly avoiding measurement errors.</p><p>The participants in this study make up a relatively homogeneous group of participants. They have been selected for an intervention study and there might therefore be an over-representation of better functioning patients. We analysed for some effect modification in a series of secondary analyses. Different effects of alcohol intake are generally expected between sexes because the official health authorities&#x02019; guidelines on drinking are different for men and women based on the assumption of biological differences in ethanol metabolism proposed in earlier studies. In our analyses, no differing effects were seen.</p><p>It is an obvious concern that perhaps participants consuming alcohol moderately are generally healthier and consequently less likely to die in the follow-up period than those who do not consume alcohol.</p><p>To rule this out, we adjusted for premorbid conditions in our analysis by including CCI as a possible confounder. To accommodate any doubt whether the statistical correction fully controlled for differences in group composition concerning comorbidity, we performed a subgroup analyses. This showed no evidence of differential effects.</p><p>To rule out that the accuracy of ethanol reporting was questionable if a primary caregiver did not live together with the patient, a sensitivity analysis was performed that excluded patients living alone. Again, no differing effects were seen.</p><p>It can be speculated whether patients who are weak and approaching their terminal phase of life will naturally reduce their alcohol intake&#x02014;a form of reverse causality. In this case, the protective effect that was found would be artificially inflated. To remove the worst cases of reverse causality, the first year of follow-up was removed from the analysis in a sensitivity analysis. This analysis retains the conclusions from the original primary analysis with effects that point in the same direction. This strengthens our belief that moderate alcohol intake is indeed associated with decreased mortality and not an artefact of reverse causation.</p><p>There might be concerns about the pattern of intake (binge drinking vs regular intake) in the groups &#x02018;Only at parties&#x02019; and &#x02018;One or less than 1&#x02005;unit/day&#x02019;, which was compiled under one group. However, omitting the subcategory &#x02018;Only at parties&#x02019; from the analyses resulted in similar results as the primary analyses.</p><p>Since extensive data were collected on each patient in the DAISY study, we were able to adjust for a wide range of potential confounders, which is essential when studying the effects of alcohol consumption. However, there are a number of possible confounders that we did not adjust for. These include social status, body mass index, medication use and genetic factors such as apolipoprotein E.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></p><p>Other studies on alcohol and mortality have shown different curves for men and women. The non-significant interaction term between sex and alcohol intake found in our analysis indicates that the association between alcohol intake and mortality is similar for the two sexes and it is not necessary to stratify for sex in these analysis.</p><p>Guidelines on AD management advise against excessive alcohol consumption as a secondary preventive measure,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> but we have not been able to identify any guidelines concerning light-to-moderate alcohol consumption. Worldwide, approximately 35 million people currently suffer from dementia and the number is likely to increase considerably over the years to come.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>
<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></p><p>The WHO data from 2003 show that approximately 94% of the Danish population had consumed alcohol in the past 12&#x02005;months.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> This shows us that there is likely to be a considerable number of people with AD who drink alcohol regularly. In view of that, more reflection should be given as to how alcohol affects subjects with AD.</p><p>The results of our study point towards a potential, positive association of moderate alcohol consumption on mortality in patients with AD. However, we cannot solely on the basis of this study neither encourage nor advise against moderate alcohol consumption in patients with AD.</p><p>Further studies are needed on this area. Studies on the effect of alcohol on cognitive decline and disease progression in patients with mild AD would be especially interesting.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> SB drafted the manuscript and is the guarantor.
