This randomized controlled trial investigated the long-term migration measured by radiostereometric analysis (RSA) of HA-coated, uncoated, and cemented tibial components in TKA.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and methods</title><p> 68 knees were randomized to HA-coated (n = 24), uncoated (n = 20), and cemented (n = 24) components. All knees were prospectively followed for 11&#x02013;16 years, or until death or revision. RSA was used to evaluate migration at yearly intervals. Clinical and radiographic evaluation was according to the Knee Society system. A generalized linear mixed model (GLMM, adjusted for age, sex, diagnosis, revisions, and BMI) was used to take into account the repeated-measurement design.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p> The present study involved 742 RSA analyses. The mean migration at 10 years was 1.66 mm for HA, 2.25 mm for uncoated and 0.79 mm for the cemented group (p &#x0003c; 0.001). The reduction of migration by HA as compared to uncoated components was most pronounced for subsidence and external rotation. 3 tibial components were revised for aseptic loosening (2 uncoated and 1 cemented), 3 for septic loosening (2 uncoated and 1 cemented), and 1 for instability (HA-coated). 2 of these cases were revised for secondary loosening after a period of stability: 1 case of osteolysis and 1 case of late infection. There were no statistically significant differences between the fixation groups regarding clinical or radiographic scores.</p></sec><sec><title>Interpretation</title><p> HA reduces migration of uncemented tibial components. This beneficial effect lasts for more than 10 years. Cemented components showed the lowest migration. Longitudinal follow-up of TKA with RSA allows early detection of secondary loosening.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>The early fixation properties of hydroxyapatite (HA) coatings on prostheses have been extensively studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0011">Geesink 2002</xref>). Animal studies have shown that HA may convert fibrous tissue into bone, and that even under unstable mechanical conditions HA is capable of inducing bone growth across peri-implant gaps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0028">Soballe et al. 1992a</xref>,b, 1993). Additionally, radiostereometric (RSA) studies have shown reduced early migration of HA-coated tibial components compared to porous coated or non-coated tibial components in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0020">Nelissen et al. 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0026">Regner et al. 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0033">Toksvig-Larsen et al. 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0032">Therbo et al. 2008</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to early migration, the long-term migration of HA-coated tibial components has been scantily reported&#x02014;as shown by a recent systematic review (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0035">Voigt and Mosier 2011</xref>). Thus, it is not clear whether the early biological fixation of HA-coated tibial components will endure and how the long-term migration compares to that of uncoated or cemented tibial components. Moreover, HA-specific complications such as delamination of the HA layer and third-body wear caused by HA particles have been reported in total hip arthroplasty and are potential problems in the long run (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0003">Bloebaum et al. 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0019">Morscher et al. 1998</xref>).</p><p>We have already shown in a randomized radiostereometric trial of HA-coated, uncoated, and cemented tibial fixation that HA significantly reduces early migration compared to uncoated components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0020">Nelissen et al. 1998</xref>).

To account for the learning curve with this&#x02014;at the time&#x02014;new TKA at our institution (1992) and to gain experience with the RSA equipment, the first 12 TKAs were not randomized and received cemented fixation. These 12 TKAs were not included as part of the study. Nevertheless, RSA analysis was performed in order to exclude potential selection bias for the consecutive study. The migration was similar to that of the randomized cemented cases (p = 0.3), as analyzed with a generalized linear mixed model. During the study, patients remained blind regarding the fixation method. Observers were blinded during the RSA analysis regarding the presence or absence of HA coating, so the study was double-blind regarding the type of uncemented fixation (HA-coated or uncoated). Since cement is visible on (RSA) radiographs, the study was single-blind regarding the comparison with cement.</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>CONSORT flow chart.</p></caption><p>

For the uncemented components, HA reduces migration compared to the uncoated components and this clinically relevant effect endures beyond 10 years. The positive effect of HA was most noticeable in reducing subsidence and external rotation compared to the uncoated tibial components.</p><p>Negative effects of HA are the risk of HA delamination and third-body wear due to HA particles, as demonstrated in total hip arthroplasty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0003">Bloebaum et al. 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0019">Morscher et al. 1998</xref>). In the present study, the migration patterns of the HA-tibial components were stable at the long-term follow-up, so delamination of the HA coating was unlikely for the HA applied which was 60 &#x003bc;m thick and had a crystallinity of more than 90%. Crystallinity of more than 75% has been shown to provide adequate fixation and bone ingrowth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0024">Overgaard et al. 1999</xref>). The rate of insert exchange in the HA group was comparable to that of the cemented and uncoated groups, thus no indication for accelerated third-body wear due to HA particles was anticipated. However, larger comparative studies are needed to fully address the potential influence of third-body wear by HA particles in TKA.</p><p>Early migration appears to predict long-term migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0012">Grewal et al. 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0027">Ryd et al. 1995</xref>). Indeed, the increased (early) migration in the uncoated group compared to the cemented and HA group has been associated with an increased revision rate for the uncoated components. There were 2 cases of secondary loosening after a period of stability. Since these patterns have not been described before, there is a need for long-term RSA studies to further investigate these interesting migration patterns. The HA-coated components in our study also showed the well-described migration pattern for uncemented tibial components: substantial initial migration followed by stabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0022">Nilsson et al. 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0013">Henricson et al. 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0008">Dunbar et al. 2009</xref>).</p><p>Compared to the HA-coated tibial components, the uncoated components showed more initial migration, which took more time to stabilize. Other RSA studies with follow-up ranging from 1 to 5 years have found similar results regarding the effect of HA on migration compared to porous coated and uncoated tibial components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0020">Nelissen et al. 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0021">Nilsson et al. 1999</xref>, 2006, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0026">Regner et al. 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0033">Toksvig-Larsen et al. 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0004">Carlsson et al. 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0032">Therbo et al. 2008</xref>). In addition, recent clinical cohort series have illustrated that good long-term survival (with any reason for revision as endpoint) of 99% at 10 years and 98% at 10&#x02013;15 years of follow-up can be achieved with similar HA-coated, posterior cruciate retaining tibial components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0005">Cross and Parish 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0009">Epinette and Manley 2007</xref>).</p><p>The magnitude of difference in migration from 1 to 10 years was less pronounced than the magnitude of difference in migration in the early postoperative period. It is not clear whether the differences in migration from 1 to 10 years are clinically relevant.</p><p>Knee Society scores and radiolographical outcome were similar in all groups. The high rate of insert exchange due to wear for the Interax TKA has been described in the literature and was judged to be caused by the type of sterilization of the polyethylene (gamma in air) and inappropriate shift of the load center on the tibial component, particularly in the smaller sized non-conforming inserts, causing excessive stress on the posteromedial and posterolateral surfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0031">Sugimoto et al. 2005</xref>).</p><p>The strengths of our study are the long-term follow-up and the blinding for the presence or absence of the HA coating for both the patient and the observers. In surgical trials, blinding is often an issue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0007">Devereaux et al. 2003</xref>). An HA coating, however, is ideal for a double-blind design, since it cannot be seen on radiographs, so the RSA analyzers and patients were blinded. On the other hand, cement is visible on (RSA) radiographs, so the study was only single-blind (patient) regarding the comparisons with cement. Nonetheless, migration analysis with RSA is a standardized and objective method with low susceptibility to different interpretations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0034">Valstar et al. 2005</xref>). The risk of biased results for the cemented components is therefore negligible.</p><p>We should also note some limitations. Three-quarters of our patients suffered from end-stage rheumatoid arthritis. One could question whether the conclusions apply to osteoarthritis. However, the migration at 10 years was very similar between OA patients and RA patients (1.61 mm and 1.52 mm). The long-term migration of HA-coated tibial components compared to cemented components has been scantily reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0035">Voigt 2011</xref>). The early migration in our study is comparable to that found by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0023">Onsten et al. (1998)</xref>, who included only OA patients. At 2 years, their cemented components migrated (MTPM) approximately 0.6 mm and their HA components migrated approximately 1.0 mm. These migrations are similar to our results; OA or RA did not influence the effect of HA on long-term migration of the tibial components.</p><p>In conclusion, HA reduces migration of uncemented tibial components, which was most pronounced in the first postoperative years. The beneficial effect of HA endures beyond 10 years and there is no evidence for delamination of the HA layer. Since cemented components showed the lowest migration throughout the follow-up and have excellent survival in the registries, cement is a safe choice for fixation of the tibial component. Longitudinal follow-up of TKA with RSA allows early detection of secondary loosening.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The following authors designed the study (RGN, ERV), gathered the clinical data (RGN, BGP), gathered the RSA data (BLK, ERV), performed the RSA analysis (BGP, BLK) analyzed the data (BGP, MF) and wrote the initial draft manuscript (BGP, ERV, MF).
