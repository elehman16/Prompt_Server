Both measures have value weighted tariffs attached, so may be appropriate for use in economic evaluation, as well as in evaluations of the effectiveness of an intervention. These measures have their theoretical underpinnings in Amartya Sen&#x02019;s work on functioning and capability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], which advocates an assessment of wellbeing that maintains a focus on what a person is able to do (capability), rather than what a person does (functioning). The capability approach encourages a broad evaluative space which can include a person&#x02019;s ability to achieve their basic requirements, such as living in good health, and more complex abilities, such as the ability to achieve things that are important to them, like fulfilling social or professional roles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>ICECAP-A and EQ-5D scores, data points weighted by frequency count</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12955_2016_430_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p>The ICECAP-A is intended for use with adults, with a sister measure (the ICECAP-O) available for use with older people. The ICECAP-A measures capability in Attachment, Stability, Achievement, Enjoyment and Autonomy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] (while the ICECAP-O measures capability in Attachment, Security, Role, Enjoyment and Control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]). A score of one on both ICECAP measures indicates full capability and the measures are anchored to &#x0201c;no capability&#x0201d; indicated by a score of 0. Scores can be used in economic evaluations through the use of full capability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] or sufficient capability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] approaches.</p><p>The most commonly used measure within economic evaluations, in contrast, is a generic preference based outcome focusing on health-related quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The descriptive system for this measure, the EQ-5D-3&#x000a0;L, comprises mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain and discomfort, and anxiety and depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The three level version, the EQ-5D-3&#x000a0;L has been extensively validated in numerous clinical settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. A score of one indicates full health and states worse than death are represented by scores between zero and&#x02212;0.59. Scores from the EQ-5D-3&#x000a0;L are used in economic evaluation through the calculation of the quality-adjusted life year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The five level version of the EQ-5D was not available for use at the start of this trial.</p><p>The broader assessment of quality of life potentially offered by the ICECAP-A may allow researchers to assess changes in attributes that are not routinely evaluated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The ICECAP-A is being used alongside the EQ-5D-3&#x000a0;L in a number of studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. If the ICECAP-A assesses additional attributes not measured by the EQ-5D-3&#x000a0;L, then a strong case can be made for using both measures in tandem (especially if the intervention being tested targets attributes measured by the ICECAP-A). However, if the ICECAP-A provides little additional information, then use of multiple instruments in research studies may be counter-productive, as it will increase patient burden, increase the potential for selective reporting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and thus may lead to problems in synthesis of evidence at later stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Determining which of these potential situations is the case for ICECAP-A is therefore important, and provides the focus for this research. The results will help to determine the additional benefit of including the ICECAP-A in empirical work, including economic evaluation.</p><p>Earlier work, using exploratory factor analysis, determined that the ICECAP-O and EQ-5D-3&#x000a0;L provided &#x0201c;largely unique and complementary information so are not substitutes&#x0201d; <sub>p.975</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Results indicated that the ICECAP-O items of Attachment, Security, Role and Enjoyment and the EQ-5D-3&#x000a0;L item of anxiety/depression represented a single factor which the authors termed &#x0201c;psychological well-being&#x0201d;. The EQ-5D-3&#x000a0;L items of mobility, self-care, usual activities and pain represented a single factor termed &#x0201c;physical functioning&#x0201d;. While they are similar measures, it cannot be assumed these results for the ICECAP-O will hold for the ICECAP-A. Using factor analytic methods, which are similar to the methodology used by Davis et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], we aim to assess whether the ICECAP-A measure is a complement or substitute for the EQ-5D-3&#x000a0;L.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p>This analysis was completed using data from the Benefits of Effective Exercise for knee Pain (BEEP) trial, a primary care, multi-centre, pragmatic randomised controlled trial in the UK.

Factor analysis describes variability amongst a number of variables or items through the use of a smaller number of unobserved variables, known as factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. If a scale is uni-dimensional then one factor should explain the variance accurately [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Factor analysis can also be used to test the assumption that a pool of items assesses different underlying factors.</p><p>Exploratory factor analysis assumes that variables are continuous and follow a normal distribution. When using categorical variables, exploratory factor analysis can be performed using polychoric correlations, which are suitable for categorical variables or variables that do not follow normal distribution. The number of factors retained was chosen with reference to the Kaiser Criterion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], which advocates retaining factors with Eigen Values greater than one and using the scree plot to assess the suitability of this choice. An oblique Promax rotation was used, which allows for the potential that factors are correlated. Correlations between factors equal to or greater than 0.32 is considered the point at which oblique rotations are appropriate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Exploratory factor analysis was applied to all items from both the EQ-5D-3&#x000a0;L (5 items) and the ICECAP-A (5 items).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Results</title><p>The characteristics of the BEEP trial participants used in this analysis are presented in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. The mean age of participants was 63, with a roughly equal proportion of male and female participants. The average ICECAP-A capability tariff values were higher (indicating higher capability) at baseline than values previously reported in the general population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Participants reported mean EQ-5D-3&#x000a0;L scores at baseline that were lower than the UK national average for this age group, indicating poorer health-related quality-of-life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] Other outcome measures indicated that this was a population with low levels of anxiety and depression and moderate levels of pain and physical disability. A complete case analysis was performed, which included all participants who completed both the ICECAP-A and EQ-5D measures at baseline. The ICECAP-A had a 99&#x000a0;% completion rate and the EQ-5D-3&#x000a0;L has a 97&#x000a0;% completion rate, resulting in this factor analysis being completed using 442 participants.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>baseline characteristics</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Characteristic</th><th>Mean values (SD)</th><th>Median values (IQR)</th><th>Measure range</th><th>Sample range</th><th>Sample size</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="6">Socio-demographic</td></tr><tr><td>Age (SD)</td><td>63.3 (9.9)</td><td/><td/><td>45 to 90</td><td>456</td></tr><tr><td>Gender (% male)</td><td>50.2 %<sup>a</sup>

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] using the ICECAP-O.</p><p>The two factor solution found that the majority of ICECAP-A items loaded onto one factor and the majority of EQ-5D-3&#x000a0;L items onto another. The exception to this was the EQ-5D-3&#x000a0;L item of anxiety and depression, which loaded onto a factor with Stability, Attachment, Achievement and Enjoyment. The Autonomy item loaded moderately onto both factors. The Autonomy item assesses a similar attribute to the Control item in the ICECAP-O, which Davis et al. found to split between the two factors.</p><p>This analysis was completed in an older population with higher capability scores than the general public, with worse than average health states, therefore caution should be exercised when generalising these results to the general population, other patient groups or groups of different ages. However, the analysis is consistent with previous work on the ICECAP-O and EQ-5D-3&#x000a0;L which also suggested that the ICECAP-O and EQ-5D-3&#x000a0;L are measuring two separate, but correlated factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. A further limitation was the lack of availability of the EQ-5D-5&#x000a0;L at the start of the BEEP trial. However, the descriptive systems of both the three and five level measures comprise the same five dimensions and considering the results of the EQ-5D crosswalk study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], one may cautiously expect similar results using the EQ-5D-5&#x000a0;L.</p><p>Davis et al. have previously suggested that these factors be termed &#x0201c;physical functioning&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;psychosocial wellbeing&#x0201d;. We suggest that &#x0201c;physical health&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;wellbeing&#x0201d; may be more reflective of how these constructs are normally termed in health economic evaluation and in academic literature. This change in terminology from that suggested by Davis et al. was based on three lines of thought. First, the EQ-5D and other similar measures are conceptually focused on measuring health gain (rather than functioning), as the primary focus of economic evaluation. The findings of this work and to a large extent the Davis work was that the physical aspects of EQ-5D loaded onto one factor, hence physical health. Second, functioning as a term has a specific meaning in relation to the capability approach (which classifies outcomes in terms of functionings and capabilities, related to whether people do these things or are just able to do them; EQ-5D expresses one of its dimensions as ability to conduct usual activities and hence to refer to this as a functioning is potentially confusing from a capability perspective) and using it in this way could cause conceptual confusion. Third, it is not clear that all aspects captured by the second factor are &#x02018;psychosocial&#x02019; particularly in relation to achievement and autonomy (the latter of which loaded onto both factors); wellbeing, as a broader concept, seems to more accurately capture the nature of the totality of attributes included in the factor.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, results presented in this paper indicate that the ICECAP-A and EQ-5D-3&#x000a0;L are largely measuring two different constructs and thus can be seen as complementary measures, rather than substitutes for one another.</p><sec id="Sec10"><title>Ethics compliance</title><p>All procedures performed in studies involving human participants were in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional and/or national research committee and with the 1964 Helsinki declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards.
