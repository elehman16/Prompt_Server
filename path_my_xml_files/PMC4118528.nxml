It is estimated that about 4% of all global diseases are the direct result of alcohol consumption.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] An estimated 14 million people in India suffer from alcohol-related health disorders.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] The incidence of alcohol dependence is estimated to be 10-15%, affecting all classes of the Indian society.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] According to the World Health Organization (WHO) global alcohol report (2007-08), the annual adult per capita alcohol consumption in India increased from 0.4 to 0.6 liters from 2000 to 2007. The 12-month prevalence of alcohol-associated morbidity in India was 3.47% for men and 0.42% in women in 2004.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Alcohol-withdrawal syndrome (AWS) is a distressing and sometimes life threatening for alcohol-dependent individuals. It is due to the abrupt cessation of alcohol consumption in habituated consumers, the symptoms of which can be mild, moderate, or severe. Mild to moderate symptoms are characterized by anxiety, depression, tremors, restlessness, insomnia, sweating, vivid dreams, diarrhea, tachycardia, and headache, which are mostly self-limiting. Medical intervention is necessitated only if symptoms persist. Severe withdrawal symptoms are characterized by seizures, hallucinations (auditory, visual, and tactile), agitation, tremulousness, and delirium tremens where prompt therapy is necessary to control the symptoms and prevent complications.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] The worldwide incidence of AWS is estimated to be about two million per year, of which half a million have moderate to severe withdrawal symptoms necessitating pharmacological intervention.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Benzodiazepines (BZDs) constitute the standard line of treatment for AWS-chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, and lorazepam being the principle BZDs employed.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Though many other drugs such as topiramate, carbamazepine, phenobarbitone, clomethiazole, clonidine, flumazenil, and nitrous oxide are being tried in AWS, none of them are as effective as BZDs in managing AWS.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>Chlordiazepoxide, a prototype BZD, is one of the standard treatment option in AWS. Chlordiazepoxide is an allostearic modulator which sensitizes the gamma-aminobutyric acid<sub>A</sub> (GABA<sub>A</sub>) receptors by binding with a specific area in the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor-chloride channel complex and enhances GABAergic action. Some of the major limitations of chlordiazepoxide are prolonged sedation, increased potential for misuse, tolerance, dependence, withdrawal tendency, hepatotoxicity, and cognitive impairment.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>Baclofen, a GABA analogue and a gamma-aminobutyric acid<sub>B</sub> (GABA<sub>B</sub>) agonist which is used to relive spasticity and muscle spasms, has been tried as an alternative to BZDs in the management of AWS. Baclofen acts by enhancing GABA action by binding to GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors. Studies have equated the efficacy and safety of baclofen with diazepam, a BZD, in the management of AWS.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Baclofen also has anti-craving action and is less likely to produce sedation, dependence and is less likely to be abused. It is also safe in patients with hepatic dysfunction and can be continued as an anti-craving agent after the withdrawal symptoms subside.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>The utility of baclofen and chlordiazepoxide in AWS has specific advantages, with chlordiazepoxide being inexpensive, but baclofen having additional advantages such as having anti-craving action, less abuse and addiction potential, and being safe in hepatic dysfunction, which is very common in alcoholics.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>Currently, there are no studies available on usefulness of baclofen in AWS in Indian population; hence, the present study was taken up to compare the cost-effectiveness of baclofen with chlordiazepoxide in uncomplicated AWS.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title/><sec id="sec3-1"><title>Trial Design</title><p>This study was designed as a fixed dose, randomized, open label, standard controlled, parallel group study of cost-effectiveness analysis of baclofen and chlordiazepoxide in uncomplicated AWS.

Chlordiazepoxide group required less lorazepam (<italic>n</italic> = 9) when compared to the baclofen group (<italic>n</italic> = 17), also indicating that chlordiazepoxide was more effective than baclofen in controlling symptoms of AWS (<italic>P</italic> = 0.018, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>].</p><p>Since all adverse events reported from the chlordiazepoxide (<italic>n</italic> = 10) and baclofen (<italic>n</italic> = 18) groups were mild, self-limiting, and did not require any intervention, no additional costs were required for the management for these adverse events.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Both the study drugs provided excellent relief of withdrawal symptoms. Both ACER and ICER indicate that chlordiazepoxide is a cost-effective option over baclofen in both patients&#x02019; and third-party perspectives in the management of uncomplicated AWS. Baclofen was relatively less effective and more expensive than chlordiazepoxide.</p><p>This was an open-labelled exploratory study conducted on a small sample size. Further studies can help extrapolate the findings of this study.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> No</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Room</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Babor</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Rehm</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Alcohol and public health</article-title><source>Lancet</source><year>2005</year><volume>365</volume><fpage>519</fpage><lpage>30</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15705462</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Prasad</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Alcohol use on the rise in India</article-title><source>Lancet</source><year>2009</year><volume>373</volume><fpage>17</fpage><lpage>8</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">19125444</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="webpage"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ranganathan</surname><given-names>TT</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Alcohol Related Harm in India: A fact sheet[Internet]</article-title><date-in-citation>Last accessed on 2013 Jun 09</date-in-citation><comment>Available from:
