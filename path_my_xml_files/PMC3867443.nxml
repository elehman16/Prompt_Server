This study investigated structural changes in kinematic variability by characterizing submovement dynamics and muscular oscillations after practice with visuomotor tracking under different target conditions. Thirty-six participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups (simple, complex, and random). Each group practiced tracking visual targets with trajectories of varying complexity. The velocity trajectory of tracking was decomposed into 1) a primary contraction spectrally identical to the target rate and 2) an intermittent submovement profile. The learning benefits and submovement dynamics were conditional upon experimental manipulation of the target information. Only the simple and complex groups improved their skills with practice. The size of the submovements was most greatly reduced by practice with the least target information (simple &#x0003e; complex &#x0003e; random). Submovement complexity changed in parallel with learning benefits, with the most remarkable increase in practice under a moderate amount of target information (complex &#x0003e; simple &#x0003e; random). In the simple and complex protocols, skill improvements were associated with a significant decline in alpha (8&#x02013;12 Hz) muscular oscillation but a potentiation of gamma (35&#x02013;50 Hz) muscular oscillation. However, the random group showed no significant change in tracking skill or submovement dynamics, except that alpha muscular oscillation was reduced. In conclusion, submovement and gamma muscular oscillation are biological markers of learning benefits. Effective learning with an appropriate amount of target information reduces the size of submovements. In accordance with the challenge point hypothesis, changes in submovement complexity in response to target information had an inverted-U function, pertaining to an abundant trajectory-tuning strategy with target exactness.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This research was supported by a grant from the National Science Council, R.O.C., under Grant No. NSC 96-2314-B-006 -028 -MY2.

For one-dimensional kinematic data, the structure of motor variability is typically indexed with entropy measures, which characterize the degree of predictability of kinematic fluctuations over a data stream.

According to the challenge point framework <xref rid="pone.0082920-Guadagnoli1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, learning benefits are optimized with the amount of skill-dependent task information. Learning alters the transmission of information from inputs to outputs and dimensional changes in the state space of observed behaviors <xref rid="pone.0082920-Newell1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0082920-Newell2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. A prevailing view is that learning reduces dynamic degrees of freedom (dimension); however, a dimensional increase is possible for learning a challenging motor task, known as motor abundance <xref rid="pone.0082920-Newell3" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. The present study aims to map the learning benefits of single-joint visuomotor tracking onto submovement characteristics under the condition of varied target information. Our main hypotheses are that 1) the size and the complexity of submovements will be differently modulated with the amount of target information in a learning paradigm, and 2) learning benefits under different target constraints will be represented by practice-related changes in submovement dynamics. This study also links the practice-related submovement scaling to muscular oscillatory activities normally present in phasic movements <xref rid="pone.0082920-KristevaFeige1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0082920-Andrykiewicz1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0082920-Farmer1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>.

The subjects in the simple protocol learned to track a 0.5 Hz sinusoidal target within a range of 3 cm (&#x000b1;1.5 cm), and the subjects in the complex protocol learned to track a combined wave of 0.25 Hz and 0.75 Hz with 1.5 cm (&#x000b1;0.75 cm) of amplitude for each sinusoidal component. The subjects in the random protocol learned to pursue a quasi-random target spectrally ranging from 0 to 1 Hz. By conditioning of white noise with a 1 Hz low-pass filter, the peak-to-peak amplitude of the quasi-random target was empirically adjusted to 3 cm. The means of target rate were theoretically identical for all tracking protocols. A target rate below 1 Hz was chosen for the simple, complex, and random protocols to stimulate the use of feedback processes in the control of the tracking maneuvers <xref rid="pone.0082920-Sosnoff1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0082920-Pew1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. The target complexity (or information) of the practice protocol increased with the spectral components in a target signal (random &#x0003e; complex &#x0003e; simple). There were 3 pre-test trials (1-min rest between trials), 15 training trials (1-min rest between training trials), and 3 post-test trials (1-min rest between trials) of 20 seconds per trial for each group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082920-g001">Fig. 1</xref>, left). The training session began 20 minutes after the end of the last pre-test trial, and the post-test assessment was performed 1 hour after the last training trial was completed. During the experiment, a subject sat on a chair with his/her wrist and forearm of the practice (right) limb fixed within a thermoplastic splint on the table. No finger movements were constrained by the thermoplastic splint, and the fingers remained fully extended in parallel to the ground during the experiment. By carefully controlling the flexion-extension of the right metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint, the subjects in these trials were required to couple the positional trace of the fingertip of the extended middle finger to the designated target movement with visual feedback.</p><fig id="pone-0082920-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0082920.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Experiment procedure, system setup, and data recording.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0082920.g001"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Recordings</title><p>A displacement-transducing laser (ZX-LD100, Omron, Kyoto, Japan) was placed 4 cm above the fingertip (the midpoint of its recording range)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082920-g001">Fig. 1</xref>, right). The laser device could measure the distance between itself and the finger tip, such that the positional trajectory of the middle finger in reference to the midpoint of the recording range was registered during manual tracking.

Target signals and displacement of the middle finger were displayed on a computer screen as a visual guide for the manual tracking. Muscle activities of the extensor digitorum (ED) and the flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) were measured with a pair of bipolar surface electrode units (1.1 cm in diameter, gain&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;365, CMRR&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;102 dB, Imoed Inc., Salt Lake City, UT, USA).

A higher CM represented better tracking congruency and a higher degree of trajectory similarity between the target and the manual output. In terms of CM, tracking congruency was determined from all the experiment trials in the pre-test, practice, and post-test sessions. CM of the three trials in the pre-test and post-test sessions was averaged to assess baseline and post-practice performances. The learning benefit after practice was defined as a standardized change in the mean tracking congruency between the pre-test and post-test sessions (&#x00394; tracking congruency), or (CM<sub>post-test</sub> - CM<sub>pre-test</sub>)/CM<sub>pre-test</sub>.</p></sec><sec id="s2e2"><title>Submovement</title><p>Displacement data of the middle finger were down-sampled to 100 Hz in submovement analysis. The displacement data were differentiated to obtain a velocity profile. Then the velocity profile was further decomposed into two time series, the primary movement and the submovement profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082920-g002">Fig. 2</xref>)<xref rid="pone.0082920-Roitman1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0082920-Selen1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Spectrally identical to the moving target, the amplitude of the hypothetical primary movement approximated the velocity profile of a target signal in amplitude. The primary movement was the a priori standard of intended movement with a deterministic nature, specifically synchronized with the moving target. On the other hand, the submovement profile was of a stochastic nature, pertaining to the additive mechanisms of error correction to remedy tracking deviations <xref rid="pone.0082920-Roitman1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0082920-Selen1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. For the simple protocol, the submovement profile was obtained by conditioning the velocity profile with a zero-phasing notch filter that passes all frequencies except for the target rate at 0.5 Hz. The transfer function of the notch filter was<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0082920.e001.jpg"/></inline-formula>, <italic>r</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;.9975, <italic>&#x003c9;<sub>0</sub></italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;<italic>&#x003c0;</italic>/360. Subtracting the submovement profile from the velocity profile gave the primary movement, a 0.5 Hz sinusoidal wave with its amplitude approximating the velocity profile of the target signal. For the complex protocol, the submovement profile was obtained by conditioning the velocity profile with a zero-phasing notch filter to exclude frequencies of the target rate at 0.25 Hz and 0.75 Hz. The transfer function of the notch filter was <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0082920.e002.jpg"/></inline-formula>, <italic>r</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;.9975, <italic>&#x003c9;<sub>0</sub></italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;<italic>&#x003c0;</italic>/720, <italic>&#x003c9;<sub>1</sub></italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;3<italic>&#x003c0;</italic>/720. The primary movement was a combined sinusoidal wave of 0.25 Hz and 0.75 Hz with its amplitude approximating the velocity profile of the target signal. For the random protocol, the velocity profile of manual tracking was conditioned with a zero-phase 4th order Butterworth low-pass filter (cut-off frequency: 1 Hz). The spectral components of the velocity profile that were greater than 1 Hz (1&#x02013;6 Hz) were considered as submovements, since they did not spectrally couple the target movement in the random condition.</p><fig id="pone-0082920-g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0082920.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Schematic illustration of acquisition of primary movement and submovement profile from velocity profile during tracking.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0082920.g002"/></fig><p>Root mean square (RMS) was applied to obtain a time-averaged amplitude of a submovement profile and a primary movement. The relative submovement amplitude was defined as the ratio of the submovement RMS to the RMS value of the velocity profile of manual tracking. R<sub>PM/S</sub> was the amplitude ratio of the primary movement relative to the submovement profile. Multi-scale entropy (MSE) analysis was a complexity measure used to reveal information hidden in the submovement profile. The details of the MSE algorithm have been reported elsewhere (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0082920.s001">Appendix S1</xref>)<xref rid="pone.0082920-Costa1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0082920-Costa2" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Briefly, the MSE algorithm quantifies the sample entropy (SampEn) of the coarse-grained time series of kinematic data, such as to gain SampEn across different time scales (1&#x02013;25 in this study), or the SampEn curve. The area under the SampEn curve in time scales 1&#x02013;10 was empirically determined as the MSE area in low time scales. Each time scale for MSE in this study was 10 ms, conforming to the sampling rate of 100 Hz. The MSE area is a robust measure of biological complexity. A higher MSE area in submovement data indicates a noisier structure with more information contents in tuning of the movement trajectory. The standardized change in submovement complexity was the difference in MSE area between pre-test and post-test sessions divided by the MSE area of the pre-test session.</p></sec><sec id="s2e3"><title>EMG analysis</title><p>The EMG data of the FDS and ED muscles of the pre-test and post-test conditions were rectified for spectral analysis.

Central to this interpretation, the learning-based reduction of the size of submovements indicates a smoother and less variable tracking trajectory in the post-test trials. Practice with an appropriate amount of target information could effectively minimize the negative impact of kinematic variability because the subjects could adopt kinematic patterns of the target with practice and prevent excessive corrective actions based on feedback processes.</p><p>Of particular importance for understanding the role of the size of submovements in performance is that the standardized change in the amount of submovement suppression (simple (S) &#x0003e; complex (C) &#x0003e; random (R)) was inversely related to the amount of target information (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082920-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>).

According to the challenge point hypothesis, potential learning benefits are optimal with practice at a moderate level of task difficulty, or the optimal challenge point. In line with the theoretical framework, our results also support that the greatest complexity increment in submovements after practice took place around the moderate target information level (moderate task difficulty). When the amount of target information exceeded the capacity of the visuomotor system to process it, no target information could be successfully used to enrich the state of movement complexity. Supplementary to the challenge point framework, the change in submovement complexity is noted to be a potent predictor for information-dependent learning benefits.

Although this study did not directly assess the EEG-EMG corticomuscular coherence, the muscular oscillation at the 35&#x02013;50 Hz muscular oscillation was likely a peripheral part of the gamma corticomuscular coherence due to synchronous firing of spinal motoneurons in phase with the cortical rhythm <xref rid="pone.0082920-Boonstra1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Similar to the functioning of EEG-EMG corticomuscular coherence in the gamma band, the potentiation of gamma muscular oscillation in the simple and complex conditions was a physiological signature of practice-related alterations for strategic advancements.

There are two separate processes for submovement scaling (size and complexity) during motor learning with different amounts of information. In agreement with the theoretical model of optimal movement variability, practice with a suitable amount of target information reduces the negative impact of behavioral variability, or the size of submovements. Submovement size is reduced because motor variability and fruitless error-correction are minimized, fitting the behavioral outputs consistently according to task constraints. In agreement with the challenge point hypothesis, the increase in submovement complexity after practice is the positive impact of behavioral variability, showing an inverted-U relationship with increases in target information. Submovement complexity is a behavioral repertoire of exploratory flexibility to achieve task goals. Contingent on the channeling and modulation of submovements, the potentiation of gamma muscular oscillation is a biological marker of information-based learning of trajectory control.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0082920.s001"><label>Appendix S1</label><caption><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0082920.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0082920-Ranganathan1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
