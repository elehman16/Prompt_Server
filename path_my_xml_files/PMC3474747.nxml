When the results of two large clinical trials, ESPRIT and SILCAAT, showed no clinical benefit from IL-2 therapy, IL-2 administration was halted in STALWART.

The study tested the hypothesis that IL-2 with or without peri-cycle ART would maintain or increase CD4+ cell counts compared to controls receiving neither IL-2 nor ART. The maintenance of higher CD4+ values with IL-2 was hypothesized to permit the safe deferral of continuous ART (cART) for a longer period of time compared to controls. Overall, 267 individuals were randomized: 89 to receive IL-2, alone; 87 to receive IL-2 and peri-cycle ART; and 91 untreated controls. Most (78.7%) were ART na&#x000ef;ve; the remainder, according to protocol, had not taken any ART within the preceding year. When the results of ESPRIT and SILCAAT showed that IL-2 combined with continuous ART conferred excess toxicity without clinical benefit <xref rid="pone.0047506-Group1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> further IL-2 administration was halted in STALWART, and safety and efficacy data were reported <xref rid="pone.0047506-Tavel1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Although IL-2 recipients in STALWART experienced a significant increase in CD4+ cell count (the change from baseline to week 32 was approximately 130 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> higher in IL-2 recipients compared to controls), grade 3 or 4 adverse events were also significantly more common among those given IL-2. Moreover, a trend was observed for an increased risk of opportunistic diseases or death among IL-2 recipients compared to untreated controls. Thus, the IL-2 induced CD4+ cell count elevation did not appear to accurately represent an improvement in immune function.</p><p>Compared to controls, cART was less likely to have been started among IL-2 recipients during the study period. This was likely attributable to the higher CD4+ counts observed among those receiving IL-2, which, when taken at face value, would have less frequently led to the initiation of ART. This &#x0201c;delay&#x0201d; in the initiation of antiretrovirals may have accounted, at least in part, for the increased opportunistic events observed among those who received IL-2; notably, no STALWART participant who experienced an opportunistic disease was on continuous ART when the event occurred. At the time of STALWART closure, the hazard ratios (IL-2 groups combined versus controls) for opportunistic disease (OD) or death and for moderate or severe adverse events (AEs) were 5.8 (0.76&#x02013;45.1, p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.09) and 2.9 (1.4&#x02013;6.0, p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.004). Because the persistence of the IL-2 induced CD4+ cell quantitative versus qualitative discordance was unknown as well as the long-term toxicity, participants were asked to consent to an additional two years of unblinded clinical observation in an extended follow-up phase of STALWART.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics</title><p>The STALWART study was approved by the institutional review board (IRB) or institutional ethics committee (IEC) of each clinical site and of the University of Minnesota, and informed consent was obtained from all participants. A letter of amendment to the protocol was issued in April 2009 continuing unblinded safety assessments for an additional two years beyond the planned follow-up. Re-consent was obtained from patients if required by that individual IRB/IEC.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Design</title><p>The design, methods, and results of the STALWART trial have been previously published <xref rid="pone.0047506-Tavel1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. During the extended follow-up phase, patients were seen at four-month intervals for study visits where information on CD4+ cell count and HIV-RNA was collected. The following clinical events were reported as they occurred: deaths, opportunistic disease (OD) events (AIDS-defining events, bacterial pneumonia, and salmonella) and adverse events of grade 3 or 4 severity, as assessed by site investigators using a standard National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Division of AIDS toxicity table.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Statistical Methods</title><p>Because the primary focus of the extended follow-up was on adverse consequences of IL-2 administration, and because the original study showed no difference in the rates of AEs and ODs between the two IL-2 groups, key events are summarized for both IL-2 groups combined versus control. Significance testing for differences between treatment groups is performed using chi square and Kruskal-Wallis tests. Kaplan-Meier survival curves are used to summarize time to initiation of continuous ART from randomization to the end of the extended follow-up phase. This analysis is based on all patients randomized, and follow-up is censored at the end of the main study for those patients who did not participate in the extended follow-up. Cox proportional hazards models, stratified by geographic region (7 strata total), are used to summarize all-cause death, the combined endpoint of death or first OD event, and first grade 4 or grade 3/4 AE. These events are summarized for two follow-up periods: from randomization through 28 February 2009, the originally planned end of study; and from 1 March 2009 to 28 February 2011, the extended follow-up phase. An expanded model with an interaction term between treatment indicator and time period was used to assess whether the hazard ratios (HR) differed between the two time periods. Rates are shown per 100-person months follow-up.</p><p>Other analyses, shown for the 3 treatment groups, are restricted to the patients who participated in the extended follow-up. During this phase, follow-up visits continued every four months according to a visit schedule that was generated at the time of randomization. Therefore, for analyses of the extended follow-up phase, visit windows were re-defined at four-month intervals (&#x000b1;2 months) following February 28, 2009, and visit-specific measurements were imputed from data available within that visit window and closest to the anniversary date.</p><p>Analyses of CD4+ cell count following initiation of cART were performed using a mixed longitudinal regression model with random patient effects and unstructured covariance matrix. These models were adjusted for age, gender, baseline CD4+ cell count and HIV-RNA, and last measured CD4+ cell count and HIV-RNA prior to ART initiation. For this analysis, CD4+ cell counts after ART initiation are ascribed to follow-up visits in a method similar to that described in the previous paragraph.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Study Population</title><p>The extended follow-up phase of STALWART began on 1 March 2009 and continued to a common closing date of 28 February 2011.

Across treatment groups, based on the last available measurement prior to beginning the extension phase, individuals who participated in extended follow-up were more likely to have undetectable HIV-RNA levels (26.6% versus 11.6%, p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.04).

Because there was a trend towards an excess of clinical events among IL-2 recipients and because these events occurred at relatively elevated CD4+ cell counts, it was important to determine if this trend (which did not attain statistical significance) persisted after the discontinuation of IL-2. The elevated risk of adverse events associated with IL-2 administration did not persist during the extended follow-up phase. While a trend toward more opportunistic events in the IL-2 groups was observed during the extension, this may be in part explained by the delay in starting ART in the treatment groups assigned to IL-2.</p><p>Despite its ability to increase CD4+ T cells, IL-2 with continuous ART has been shown to confer no clinical benefit or protection from opportunistic diseases or death compared to continuous ART alone, but was associated with an increased risk of adverse events <xref rid="pone.0047506-Group1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. STALWART, which was undertaken before the results of ESPRIT and SILCAAT were known and stopped once these results became available, likewise showed no clinical benefit of IL-2 with or without peri-cycle ART when compared to no treatment among individuals for whom, at the time, treatment was not clinically indicated <xref rid="pone.0047506-Tavel1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Because of an apparent increase in the number of opportunistic diseases or death among those who received any IL-2 in STALWART, as well as their occurrence at relatively elevated proximal CD4+ cell counts, participants were asked to participate in a 2 year extended follow-up study. Overall approximately 83% of participants were followed in the observation phase, representative of the initial randomized STALWART population. Over the follow-up period, compared to controls, persons who received IL-2 at any time did not experience an increased rate of grade 3/4 clinical events or opportunistic diseases/death. The subsequent response to continuous ART, once started, did not appear to have been impacted by prior IL-2 with or without peri-cycle ART. This observation is important given the concern that peri-cycle ART might lead to drug resistance and predispose to treatment failure once cART has been initiated, although in the initial randomized study peri-cycle ART was not clearly associated with the emergence of drug resistance based on population sequencing <xref rid="pone.0047506-Tavel1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>.</p><p>Although SILCAAT and ESPRIT showed that IL-2 plus cART did not lead to a reduction in incidence of OD/Death compared to ART alone, there were significantly more AEs &#x02013; particularly thromboembolic events &#x02013; among IL-2 recipients. The reasons for the lack of clinical benefit of IL-2, despite its ability to markedly increase CD4+ cell count, has not been fully elucidated.

Over the extended follow up, event rates in the IL-2 groups remained higher than controls, but differences were not statistically significant. Although the time from discontinuation of IL-2 to the reversal of its effects could not be measured in this extension study, the effects of IL-2, with or without peri-cycle ART, were not persistent and not associated with any lingering impact on the response to subsequent ART.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to acknowledge the STALWART participants and the STALWART investigators (see Ref 1 for list of investigators).</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0047506-Tavel1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
