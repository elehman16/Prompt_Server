Paging transmissions can also be intercepted, and the information presented on pager displays can be viewed by anyone in possession of the pager.</p><p>Smartphones allow for instantaneous two-way and group communication through advanced technological features. Their use is widespread; over 81% of American physicians owned a smartphone in 2011.<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Previous studies demonstrate that healthcare providers rate smartphone-based email positively, and that team smartphones can facilitate communication between nurses and physicians.<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> However, these studies specifically examined the utility of smartphone-based email and voice calls, and did not include text messaging. Limitations of traditional smartphone-based text messaging include Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) noncompliance and dependence on in-hospital cellular reception, which can be unreliable. HIPAA is a 1996 US federal law that established a set of privacy and security rules governing not only what is considered protected health information (PHI), but also minimum standards for the protection of such information. HIPAA compliance is defined as meeting these minimum standards for physical, network, and process security.<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Though PHI is often transmitted via paging systems and commercial carrier-based text messaging, these modalities are not secure and are thus not HIPAA-compliant.</p><p>Text messaging applications that address these security and reliability issues have the potential to greatly enhance in-hospital communication. We hypothesized that a smartphone-based HIPAA-compliant group messaging application could improve in-hospital communication on the inpatient medicine service. To our knowledge, our study is the first to examine a HIPAA-compliant text messaging system, and also the first to compare a combination paging/HIPAA-compliant group messaging (HCGM) system with a paging-only system in assessing healthcare provider perception of communication efficiency.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><sec><title>Intervention</title><p>This study utilized Medigram (Medigram, Inc., <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://medigram.com">https://medigram.com</ext-link>), a free HCGM application for smartphones (available on iOS and Android) that allows users to send and receive encrypted, password-protected text messages via the hospital wireless fidelity (Wi-Fi) network, using commercial cellular networks as backup.</p></sec><sec><title>Study Design</title><p>In an eight-week prospective, cluster-randomized, controlled trial conducted at Stanford Hospital (June 25, 2012&#x02013;August 17, 2012), three of five inpatient medicine teams were randomized to use Medigram in addition to the existing hospital paging system (HCGM teams); the remaining two teams were assigned to use hospital paging only (control teams). Each team included one attending physician, one resident, two interns, two medical students, and a case manager. According to prescheduled rotations, attendings rotated every two weeks, and residents, interns, and medical students rotated every four weeks. All rotations were either off-service or off-site, with the exception of two attendings who rotated between study teams but within their experimental designations. Case managers remained with the same team. Additionally, the satellite pharmacy was provided with an HCGM-equipped smartphone to communicate with experimental teams.</p><p>Participation was voluntary, with a 96% participation rate (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;75). HCGM teams downloaded the free application onto their smartphones. Participants without smartphones were provided with one for the duration of the study. Proper application use was demonstrated by one researcher in a 10-minute standardized presentation. HCGM teams were encouraged to use the application in lieu of paging, except when patient care could be compromised.</p><p>All participants completed linked baseline and post-study surveys. Gift cards valued at $10 were provided on completion of each survey. Though participants were assigned to either HCGM or control groups based on the randomized assignment of their preset cluster (hospital team) to an HCGM or control group, analysis was performed on the individual level due to the hospital's set rotation schedule, which resulted in dynamic, frequently changing clusters. We also compared average length of stay and time of discharge for patients treated by control versus HCGM teams. Clinical outcome data were obtained from the hospital's database using Midas+ Statit Solutions (Midas+ Statit Solutions Group, Tucson, AZ). Survey and clinical outcome data were analyzed in Stata (StataCorp, College Station, TX) and R (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).</p></sec><sec><title>Survey Design and Analysis</title><p>Identical, anonymous baseline surveys were administered to control and HCGM teams. These surveys assessed attitudes toward the hospital paging system using a 5-point Likert scale (1&#x02009;=&#x02009;low, 5&#x02009;=&#x02009;high) to evaluate perceived measures of effectiveness, workflow integration, and overall satisfaction. Wilcoxon rank sum tests were used to compare control and HCGM group responses to these questions. Free response questions asked participants to list the most effective and ineffective aspects of the paging system.</p><p>Post-study surveys included all baseline survey questions, as well as questions about personal texting behavior. Post-study HCGM surveys also included a parallel set of questions rating the HCGM application on the same measures of perceived effectiveness, workflow integration, and overall satisfaction. Wilcoxon signed rank tests were used to compare HCGM participants' baseline evaluations of paging to their post-study evaluations of the HCGM application. Baseline and post-study surveys were linked by the last four digits of respondent cell phone numbers. To compare control and HCGM group perceptions of the hospital paging system at study completion, post-study survey responses were evaluated using Wilcoxon rank sum tests. The family-wise error rate was left unadjusted due to concerns around inflated type II errors, given the high degree of correlation between survey questions.</p><p>All free response questions were analyzed using thematic analysis and grounded theory. After reviewing responses to each question, a list of overarching themes was constructed. Two researchers then independently reviewed each free-response entry to assign it to one or more of these themes (some responses included several ideas with distinct themes). Entries with concordant theme assignments (&#x0223c;90%) were coded as such; nonconcordant entries required an additional round of review to reach concordance. Finally, objective outcome measures including length of stay and time of discharge were analyzed by two-sample <italic>t</italic> test.</p><table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Comparison of Control and HCGM Groups</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Control Group</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">HCGM Group</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Paired surveys collected (completion rate)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">22 (85%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">41 (84%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Average age &#x000b1;95% CI</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">30.10 &#x000b1;1.71</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">30.95 &#x000b1;2.94</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="3" rowspan="1">Gender</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Male</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">13 (59%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">24 (59%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Female</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">9 (41%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">17 (41%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="3" rowspan="1">Role</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Medical students</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6 (27%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">11 (27%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Interns (PGY 1)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7 (32%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">12 (29%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Residents (PGY2 and 3)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3 (14%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6 (15%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Attending physicians</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5 (23%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5 (12%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Case managers</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1 (5%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3 (7%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Pharmacists</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0 (0%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4 (10%)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="tf1-1"><p>NOTE: <bold>Abbreviations:</bold> HCGM, HIPAA-compliant group messaging; CI, confidence interval; PGY, postgraduate year.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec><sec><title>Information Security</title><p>The HCGM application in this study features 256-bit encryption technology and requires a six-digit password to access texts.

First, the proportion of attending respondents in the HCGM group was lower than in the control group. This was due to the fact that several HCGM attendings entered discrepant ID codes on their surveys, thus making it impossible to link baseline and post-study responses; these data were excluded. Additionally, two HCGM attendings were on service for four, rather than the standard two weeks, meaning two additional data points from unique attendings could not be obtained.

HCGM participants rated the application more favorably than paging in terms of clarity and efficiency of communication. These findings may be attributed to the expanded functionality offered by the application, including no character limit per HCGM text, the ability to use special characters such as slashes and ampersands, group texting, and the ability to reply immediately. HCGM may result in more efficient communication by facilitating direct two-way communication via smartphones, whereas sending or returning pages requires a landline or computer.</p><p>HCGM participants rated the application higher than paging in terms of workflow integration during rounds and patient discharge, but not during patient admissions and teaching sessions. We had hypothesized that HCGM would integrate better into participants' workflows because HCGM texts could be replied to immediately. The reasons for the equivalence of HCGM and paging for workflow integration during patient admissions and teaching sessions may have been due to weak Wi-Fi in certain areas of the hospital, and may warrant further investigation.</p><p>Analysis of HCGM utilization indicated that there were factors that made participants more or less likely to use the application. Individuals who reported that their attendings used HCGM regularly were more likely to use it themselves. Attending usage may legitimize use of HCGM for housestaff and medical students, who may otherwise feel that texting appears unprofessional. Participants who texted frequently in their personal lives were also more likely to utilize HCGM regularly, perhaps due to increased familiarity with/affinity for the platform.</p><p>HCGM participants who did not utilize the application regularly most often cited the fact that other team members did not use it. Among all users, the most frequently noted ineffective aspects of the application were its lack of ubiquity (HCGM was made available only to the small subset of individuals involved in the study) and inconsistent usage by those who did have access to the application. These findings suggest that HCGM effectiveness may be maximized with unrestricted access and mandated use; patchwork implementation, as in this study, detracts from perceived effectiveness.</p><p>Though objective outcome measures (average length of stay and average time of discharge) for patients of control attendings and HCGM attendings were examined, no significant differences were observed (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.089 and 0.494, respectively). These results may be due to the small size and short duration of the study.</p><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>Our study had several limitations. HCGM was available only to individuals in the experimental arm of the study; most members of the internal medicine department and all other departments were not reachable through the application. This lack of ubiquity was a frequently cited frustration. Among individuals to whom HCGM was made available, barriers to adoption included: close proximity to would-be message recipients, concern that smartphone usage in front of patients might appear unprofessional, and inconsistent or dropped service (weak or no Wi-Fi signal in some areas). A technical problem with the Android platform midway through the study served as a potential frustration to several participants.</p><p>Due to the aforementioned issues, some participants used the HCGM application in a very limited way. We also did not replace hospital pagers (infeasible in this hospital setting); the HCGM application was added as a supplemental system. Future studies might explore the replacement of paging systems with HCGM-type applications, as well as delve further into quantitative patient care outcomes.</p><p>It should be noted that the start of the study unintentionally coincided with the start of new interns and medical students in the hospital. Although it is possible that their relative unfamiliarity with the hospital may have made them more amenable to adopting a new technology, it is also possible that they may have been less likely to do so in the midst of such a major transitional period. Finally, this was a single-site study, and as such, its findings may not be broadly generalizable. More research on such interventions is warranted, particularly in the context of current insecure communication methods such as paging that may make hospital-wide adoption of new methods of secure communication, such as HCGM, mandatory.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Our study is the first to demonstrate that HCGM applications improve healthcare provider perception of multiple measures of in-hospital communication, including efficiency of communication, workflow integration, and overall satisfaction. Notably, 85% of HCGM team respondents said they would recommend using an HCGM system on the wards. As smartphone use is expected to continue to increase among physicians and the general population, it is increasingly important to understand how to utilize these powerful communication tools to improve healthcare in an effective and secure manner.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank the Stanford Medicine Residency Program and Stanford Hospital and Clinics for allowing them to perform the study, as well as Medigram, Inc., for supplying gift cards to incentivize survey completion and loaner iPhones to allow individuals without smartphones to participate in the study.</p><p>Disclosures: Stanford University School of Medicine's Medical Scholars Program provided financial support to the first author over the course of the study.
