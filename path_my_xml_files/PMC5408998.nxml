To better evaluate the different impact of LDI and anti-tachycardia pacing (ATP) on reducing painful shocks, we assessed all treated episodes in the ADVANCE III trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and results</title><p>A total of 452 fast (200 ms &#x0003c; cycle length &#x02264; 320 ms) arrhythmic episodes were recorded: 284 in 138 patients in the SDI arm and 168 in 82 patients in the LDI arm (106/452 inappropriate detections). A total of 346 fast ventricular tachycardias (FVT) were detected in 169 patients: 208 in 105 patients with SDI and 138 in 64 patients with LDI. Setting LDI determined a significant reduction in appropriate but unnecessary therapies [208 in SDI vs. 138 in LDI; incidence rate ratio (IRR): 0.61 (95% CI 0.45&#x02013;0.83), <italic>P</italic> = 0.002]. Anti-tachycardia pacing determined another 52% reduction in unnecessary shocks [208 in SDI with hypothetical shock-only programming vs. 66 in LDI with ATP; IRR: 0.37 (95% CI 0.25&#x02013;0.53, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001)]. The efficacy of ATP in terminating FVT was 63% in SDI and 52% in LDI (<italic>P</italic> = 0.022). No difference in the safety profile (acceleration/degeneration and death/cardiovascular hospitalizations) was observed between the two groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The combination of LDI and ATP during charging is extremely effective and significantly reduces appropriate but unnecessary therapies. The use of LDI alone yielded a 39% reduction in appropriate but unnecessary therapies; ATP on top of LDI determined another 52% reduction in unnecessary shocks.

Long-detection interval avoids therapies for non-sustained arrhythmias, but delays ATP delivery for sustained fast VT (FVT) with cycle length (CL) between 200 and 320 ms; this might theoretically reduce the efficacy of ATP or of subsequent shocks if ATP fails.<sup><xref rid="euw032C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> The efficacy and safety of ATP/shock therapy were therefore evaluated in the ADVANCE III database.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study overview and patient selection</title><p>The design and results of the ADVANCE III trial have been published previously.<sup><xref rid="euw032C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="euw032C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Briefly, the ADVANCE III trial was a randomized, single-blind, parallel, multi-centre trial that enrolled and analysed 1902 patients undergoing their first implantation of a single-/dual-chamber ICD or a biventricular ICD (cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator). All devices were able to deliver ATP during capacitor charge, in order not to delay the high-energy therapy.

In the light of this finding, it has been hypothesized<sup><xref rid="euw032C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> that the main stratagem for achieving optimal programming is simply to use a higher VF cut-off. However, results from the ALTITUDE study showed that there is still a proportion of VFs with CL slower than 200 ms, which may be not treated by means of the high-rate approach. In this setting, the present analysis of the ADVANCE III data showed that combining long detection followed by an ATP attempt and, if necessary, a shock is a safe and effective solution and does not compromise detection rates.</p><p>Our data strongly support the hypothesis that a combined strategy of long detection and ATP during charge can optimize the reduction in unnecessary shocks. On considering only appropriately treated events, the ADVANCE III programming strategy was able to dramatically reduce potential shock exposure from 208 possible events (if patients were treated with SDI and shock-only therapy) to 138 (if treated with a shock-only strategy and LDI) and, further, to only 66 shocked episodes (on combining LDI with ATP during charge) (<italic>Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="euw032F3">3</xref></italic>).

A sufficiently long excitable gap is required in order to enable ATP to invade the circuit and terminate a re-entrant VT. Theoretically, the tachycardia CL is the most important factor, since the faster the VT and the shorter the excitable gap, the less likely the ATP will be able to enter the circuit. It has been reported that the CL is the most important predictor of ATP success in spontaneous VTs occurring in ICD patients.<sup><xref rid="euw032C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> However, our data do not support this finding, in that we observed no difference in ATP efficacy among different CL ranges. In addition, other studies have shown that the stimulation site<sup><xref rid="euw032C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="euw032C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> and R&#x02013;R fluctuations<sup><xref rid="euw032C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> may also play a significant role in the ability of ATP to terminate the arrhythmias.</p><p>In the ADVANCE III trial, ATP efficacy was lower than that reported for FVT in the Pain FREE I and II studies<sup><xref rid="euw032C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="euw032C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> and by Jim&#x000e9;nez-Candil <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref rid="euw032C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> The lower ATP efficacy observed in the ADVANCE III trial could be explained by the differences in patient selection, in that ADVANCE III enrolled a lower proportion of patients with ischaemic heart disease and, more importantly, a markedly greater proportion of primary prevention patients, who are theoretically less predisposed to structured VT amenable to ATP.</p><p>Our data support the hypothesis that delivering ATP after short detection leads to overestimation of efficacy. We can speculate that the higher efficacy observed in the SDI arm might be mainly related to the treatment of non-sustained episodes that would not last long enough to be detected in the LDI arm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary material online, <italic>Figures S1</italic> and <italic>S2</italic></xref>). Accordingly, the 9% difference in efficacy between SDI and LDI did not come as a surprise, bearing in mind that 30% of the episodes in the shock arm of the Pain FREE II trial self-terminated during capacitor charge. However, the causal link between potentially over-treated non-sustained episodes and the higher ATP efficacy in SDI is not clearly established. Further specific investigations are needed in order to clarify this point.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>First-shock efficacy</title><p>It could be expected that a longer duration of a poorly tolerated FVT could produce some degree of metabolic disturbance, which might increase the defibrillation threshold.

Furthermore, the observed efficacy of shock after unsuccessful initial ATP in the LDI arm proved, nonetheless, to be slightly higher than that recorded in a large cohort of patients who experienced 3677 episodes.<sup><xref rid="euw032C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup></p><p>It should also be noted that LDI reduced the overall number of episodes treated with multiple shocks (<italic>Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="euw032F1">1</xref></italic>). While the effect of a single shock is still controversial, patients who suffer multiple shocks have a poor quality of life.<sup><xref rid="euw032C22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> It is therefore crucial to limit the delivery of repeated high-energy shocks.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Anti-tachycardia pacing safety</title><p>Although ATP was less effective after a LDI, it proved consistently safe, as acceleration and VT induction were rare (19 in SDI and 21 in LDI) and similar (<italic>P</italic> = 0.079) to the rates observed in the standard-detection group. Some concerns about long-detection programming could arise in those patients presenting only sustained episodes, as reduced ATP efficacy may result in a higher rate of necessary appropriate shocks. However, these concerns seem unjustified, since our results show a significant reduction in the number of shocks delivered in the LDI arm.

The use of LDI alone cut appropriate but unnecessary ICD therapy by 39%, while the use of a single ATP attempt on top of LDI avoided the need for painful shocks in &#x0003e;50% of cases, thus confirming the importance of this painless strategy. Anti-tachycardia pacing was confirmed to be safe in terms of VT accelerations, death, or hospitalizations. For the above-mentioned reasons, the combination of ATP during charge with a long-detection window should be considered in the majority of ICD recipients. Further studies are warranted to specifically optimize ATP programming in ICD recipients.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Supplementary material</title><p>
