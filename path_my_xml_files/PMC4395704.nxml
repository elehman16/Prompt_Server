developing with the purpose of identifying the effect of 8 weeks duration of aerobic
exercises on the expression of BDNF, IGF-1 and cortisol, to identify effect of aerobic
exercise on the expression of cortisol, BDNF and IGF-1 related to nerve cell growth.
[Subjects and Methods] The subjects were 20 junior-high school students with no history of
physical illness. The students were divided into an exercise group and a control group.
The exercise group performed 3 treadmill exercise times per week for 8 weeks. The exercise
time for the consumption of 200&#x02005;kcal was calculated and the exercises were performed by
each individual for 8 weeks. [Results] The exercise group showed statistically significant
in increases serum BDNF and IGF-1 after 8 weeks, but cortisol showed no significant
change. There were statistically significant differences between the groups in serum BDNF
and IGF-1 after 8 weeks, but the difference in cortisol levels was not significant.
[Conclusion] We found that long-term regular aerobic exercises has a positive effect on
the enhancement of serum BDNF levels at rest and IGF-1 of adolescents who are still
undergoing through brain developments.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Aerobic exercise</kwd><kwd>Adolescents</kwd><kwd>BDNF</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) is a neurotrophic factor that appears throughout
the mammalian central nervous system<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>It is frequently found in the hippocampus of the brain (hippocampal formation), as well as
in the cerebral cortex and amygdalus. BDNF is reported to affect learning ability and
memory, as it operates in the areas that regulate neuronal growth, and repair and
neuroplasticity. It is also a feature of the brain during brain formation before birth and
its influence continues through adolescence<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>BDNF is reported to be an important material for the growth and development of nerve cells
in different areas both within and outside of the brain, increasing resistance to damage and
improving the survival of neurons<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. It is
a key factor in growth and differentiation during neural development, and is often used as
an index to measure the impact of exercise on the rehabilitation of damaged nerves. It is
further reported that both exercise and learning induce growth of the motor cortex, increase
in hippocampal BDNF, and increase in the plasticity of the brain, which in turn induces
development of the cell body and axon of the associated neurons<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>BDNF expression in the hippocampus has been reported to improve the production and survival
of brain cells<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>, and BDNF expression is
reported to be stimulated by exercise<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.
It has also been reported that exercise has a positive impact on BDNF expression in the
animal brain<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>For young people, increases in BDNF induced by aerobic exercises would enhance neuronal
growth and development in the hippocampus, which would in turn enhance cognitive ability,
learning ability and memory, greatly improving educational performance. Therefore exercise
is considered to be essential for the development of the adolescent brain.</p><p>Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), one of the factors involved in BDNF expression, is
known to mediate regulation of genes involved in BDNF-related neurogenesis<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>, and it is involved in the growth and
differentiation of neuron units of the brain<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. In association with exercise, IGF-1 increases in both the brain
and peripheral nerves after exercise and neurotransmitters are also increased in the blood
vessels<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. On the other hand,
psychological stress has negative effects on nerve cells and heightened stress reduces BDNF
mRNA expression<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>A fast-paced lifestyle, coupled with education policy and environmental changes in South
Korea are thought to have increased the psychological stress of the Korean youth population.
Cortisol is a typical stress hormone. Corticotrophin-releasing factor (CRF) is secreted by
the hypothalamus, which in turn induces the release of adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH)
from the anterior pituitary. ACTH induces cortisol secretion into the adrenal cortex via the
bloodstream.</p><p>Cortisol is released not only in response to psychological stress, but also as a product of
the energy generation required for exercises. With exercise, cortisol is released through
the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis into the circulation of the human body. Cortisol,
which is one of the major corticosteroids, plays a role in the conversion of glycogen in
muscles and the liver into blood glucose, or fats into fatty acids for the purpose of
metabolic energy production. Also, cortisol responds sensitively to self-defensive stimuli
such as psychological oppression, anxiety, or fear, similar to the response to energy
generation for the stimulation of movement. The relationship between stress and BDNF mRNA
(messenger ribonucleic acid) reveals that increased stress will lower the level of BDNF
expression<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup> and significantly disturbs
the creation of the nerve cells in the hippocampus<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Zheng et al. reported that BDNF and cortisol have a negative
correlation<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Most previous studies of BDNF have used experimental animals and many of their results
correlate with a particular disease. In those experiments, animals were forced to perform
aerobic exercises, with stress induced for the initiation and maintenance of the exercising
condition. When these animals are given a stimulating stressor, such as electrical shocks or
swimming as exercise, the stress elicits strong instincts to escape and initiates changes in
the peripheral circulation. It also activates circulation in the central brain, thus
affecting the whole body. In addition to the need to use a stressor to initiate exercise
conditions in animals, the results use of these animal models have obvious limitations
regarding their application to the human body. In order to investigate the effect of
cortisol on the expression of BDNF and IGF-1 through aerobic exercise, such experiments must
ultimately be carried out using voluntary exercises performed by human subjects, negating
the need for stress induced exercise states which can confound results. Previous studies
have not yet sufficiently proved the relationship of cortisol expression and nerve cell
growth in response to aerobic exercise, as well as the involvement of BDNF and IGF-1.</p><p>The purpose of this study was therefore, to identify effect of aerobic exercise on the
expression of cortisol, BDNF and IGF-1 related to nerve cell growth.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Twenty healthy junior high school students, who did not regularly exercise and were not

brain function, so it is well known that BDNF is secreted in peripheral veins and skeletal
muscles as well as in various brain regions. Recently more research has been conducted to
measure the reaction of human serum BDNF levels and targeted cognitive function of adult and
elderly human subjects following long-term aerobic exercise and short sessions of aerobic
exercise<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Uysal et al. reported that when the rats performed regular aerobic exercises the density of
hippocampal neurons in rats increased<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>.
According to Seifert et al., seven adult male subjects performed 12 weeks of endurance
aerobic exercise and as a result BDNF serum significantly increased<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>. Griffin et al. examined the effects of both short and
long-term aerobic exercise on adolescents, whose brains are thought to still be undergoing
significant development<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. They showed
enhanced BDNF expression as a result of a single session of aerobic exercise, and a higher
level of enhancement after the long-term aerobic exercise. It has also been reported that
endurance exercise increases BDNF protein expression in the skeletal muscle of rodents<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thomas et al. reported increases in the
amount of BDNF as a result of long term regular exercise both when measured, during the
exercise and at rest compared to groups that did not exercise at all<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In this study, after 8 weeks of regular aerobic exercise, the exercise group showed
significantly increased serum BDNF expression levels, and a significant difference compared
to the control group. In the study of Erickson et al., 120 elderly subjects performed 40
minutes of walking exercise (50&#x02013;60% intensity) for 7 weeks, and they demonstrated,
significant increases in maximal oxygen uptake, serum BDNF, cognitive ability, and the size
of the hippocampus<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. Also recent studies
have reported the tendency of BDNF to increase at rest when endurance aerobic exercise was
performed<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>However, a study by Ferris et al. reported that cycling for a duration of 30 minutes at an
intensity of 55% VO2max (20% below the lactate threshold) did not affect serum BDNF
concentrations<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup>. We believe the,
increases in serum BDNF levels at rest and after regular aerobic exercise are related to the
intensity of the exercise, and a threshold intensity of 60% VO2max seems necessary to elicit
a response in BDNF levels. More research should be done to further elucidate the
relationship between exercise intensity and BDNF expression in response to exercise.</p><p>Griffin et al. studied the effects of both short- and long-term exercise<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>, examining changes in serum BDNF levels
and cognitive performance. They included the use of a Face-Name matching task test and a
Colour-Word test for cognitive performance evaluation (memory). Only the group which
conducted 5 weeks of regular aerobic exercise showed a significant improvement in the
Face-Name matching task test. Previous studies have failed to identify a relationship
between the level of expression of BDNF and improvement in brain function in humans.
Therefore, future studies relating the expression of BDNF and measures of brain function
should also consider the effects of fifferent levels of exercise intensity on functional
improvements as well as BDNF.</p><p>IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor 1) is reported to be a carrier located in the upper part
of a signaling pathway which induces the expression of BDNF. IGF-1 has been reported to be a
factor contributing to neural cell growth, differentiation and survival, and it shows
increases in expression in the brain and periphery in response to various forms of
exercise<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Previous studies of the relationship between exercise and IGF-1 have reported that growth
hormone increased due to regular aerobic exercise through the promotion of IGF-1 synthesis
in cells. It was reported that IGF-1 increased through an interaction with a variety of
cells in the liver<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><sup>)</sup>. In this study, 8
weeks of regular aerobic exercise resulted in a significant increase in serum IGF-1
expression levels post-intervention, and the exercise group also showed significant
differences from the group that did not exercise regularly.</p><p>In general, skeletal muscle growth and atrophy is regulated by insulin-like growth
factor-1<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><sup>)</sup>. Lee and Rhyu reported that
IGF-1 induced changes in the nervous system through aerobic exercise, which is a necessary
condition for increased BDNF expression. They also showed that IGF-1 was a carrier located
in the upper part of a signaling pathway which regulates the expression of BDNF<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><sup>)</sup>. Also, Larnon, Avitzur and Klinger
reported that physical activity acted in combination with growth hormones and intermediate
mediators to elicit changes in BDNF expression. They further reported that when children or
young people are at rest, physical activity-associated changes in growth hormone induce
increases in the level of IGF-1 through interactions with liver cells, which are important
for protein synthesis, bone growth, and cell proliferation<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Cortisol is a stress hormone secreted from the adrenal cortex of the kidneys, and it is
expressed in response to external stimuli which induce psychological stress, and plays a
role in increasing blood pressure and glucose levels, enabling the body to produce maximum
energy as a part of the stress response mechanism.</p><p>A study of the relationship between exercise and cortisol showed that short-term medium to
low intensity strength exercises did not change plasma cortisol levels or may have even
slightly reduced these levels, whereas high-intensity exercises increased plasma cortisol
levels in the body<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In the present study, the group which performed regular aerobic exercise for 8 weeks showed
decreased blood plasma cortisol levels, but the difference was not statistically
significant. We believe this shows that while stress-induced exercise affects the expression
of cortisol, as described in the murine studies of Zheng et al., the negative relationship
between BDNF and cortisol is likely the result of changes in cortisol due to stress rather
than the exercise performed<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>This study was conducted on adolescent subjects, whose brains were still undergoing
development, with the purpose of identifying the effect of an 8-week aerobic exercise
protocol on the expression of BDNF, IGF-1 and cortisol. The results of this study suggest
that chronic aerobic exercise has a positive effect, enhancing resting serum BDNF and IGF-1
expression in adolescents whose brains are still developing.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Mizuno</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Yamada</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Olariu</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Involvement of brain-derived neurotrophic factor in
