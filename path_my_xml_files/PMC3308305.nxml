Its most common side effects are gastrointestinal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). These symptoms are generally transient, resolve spontaneously, and can often be avoided by gradual escalation of dosage. Metformin treatment has not been associated with hypoglycemia unless used in conjunction with other glucose-lowering medicines (sulfonylureas or insulin). In U.S. clinical trials, about 4% of participants were unable to continue metformin due to adverse effects. Serious adverse events are infrequent and generally limited to lactic acidosis, which occurs only in persons with renal or hepatic insufficiency or other contraindications. Metformin is associated with weight loss when used to treat diabetes and thus differs from a number of other antidiabetic medications that are associated with weight stability or gain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). To date, metformin is indicated only for diabetes management and not for weight loss in individuals with or without diabetes.</p><p>In the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), metformin reduced the development of diabetes by 31% over an average of 2.8 years of follow-up (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). The long-term follow-up of the DPP, the DPP Outcomes Study (DPPOS), included an open-label extension of metformin treatment in those randomly assigned to metformin in the DPP. After a median of 10 years of follow-up since DPP randomization, both the lifestyle and metformin intervention groups had significantly less diabetes than the placebo group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). During the DPP, participants randomized to metformin experienced an average 2.1-kg weight loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Weight loss was a strong predictor of diabetes prevention in both the metformin and placebo groups with weight loss accounting for 64% of the metformin versus placebo effect on diabetes prevention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Weight loss in the metformin group was maintained throughout the combined DPP and DPPOS period with metformin participants having an average 2.5-kg weight loss over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). This report updates these findings by documenting the long-term safety and tolerability of metformin, and in a post hoc analysis, it tests the hypothesis that greater adherence to metformin is associated with greater weight loss and reduction in waist circumference in participants randomly assigned to metformin compared with those randomly assigned to placebo.</p><sec id="s2"><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><p>Between 1996 and 1999, 3,234 participants from 27 clinics in the U.S. were enrolled in the DPP; the 2,155 randomly assigned to the metformin (1,073) or placebo (1,082) arms are included in this analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Participants were &#x02265;25 years of age, had a BMI &#x02265;24 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (&#x02265;22 kg/m<sup>2</sup> in Asian Americans), elevated fasting glucose (95&#x02013;125 mg/dL), and impaired glucose tolerance (140&#x02013;199 mg/dL) 2 h after a 75-g oral glucose load. Participants were excluded for a prior diagnosis of diabetes or conditions or medications that would impair their ability to participate or affect weight loss. All participants gave written informed consent as approved by each institutional review board.</p><p>Metformin or matching placebo was initiated at 850-mg once per day and increased by 1 month to 850-mg twice daily unless gastrointestinal symptoms warranted a longer titration period. Standard lifestyle recommendations and written information on healthy eating, healthy weight, and physical activity were provided annually (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Case managers promoted adherence to the DPP study medications using a brief structured interview and a standard problem-solving approach.</p><p>The first phase of the DPP was completed in 2001 after an average of 3.2 years of follow-up on the advice of the Data and Safety Monitoring Board due to the effectiveness of the lifestyle and metformin interventions in preventing diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). After the DPP results were announced, participants underwent a 1- to 2-week study/drug washout period followed by a repeat glucose tolerance test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Subsequently, they were unblinded and offered a 6-month, 16-session, group-implemented program with content identical to the original DPP lifestyle intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). All DPP participants, regardless of whether diabetes had developed, were encouraged to join the DPPOS, and 88% did (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Participants followed their original treatment assignments, and all were offered quarterly group lifestyle classes. Placebo treatment was terminated. Participants initially assigned to metformin continued taking study-provided open-label metformin unless there were contraindications, or fasting plasma glucose was &#x02265;140 mg/dL in the DPP, or HbA1c was &#x02265;7% during the DPPOS, which required management outside of the protocol.</p><p>A summary of data collection during the DPP and the DPPOS can be found in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc11-1299/-/DC1">Supplementary Appendix Table 1</ext-link>.

Possible hypoglycemic events were identified by searching for &#x0201c;HYPOGLY,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;CONSCIOUS,&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;COMA,&#x0201d; and for possible anemia as &#x0201c;ANEMIA&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;B12.&#x0201d; Serious adverse events (SAEs) were handled as defined by the FDA. <italic>2</italic>) Gastrointestinal symptoms were identified annually throughout the DPP and the DPPOS by asking participants about any stomach pain, bloating, nausea, diarrhea, or loss of appetite. <italic>3</italic>) Gastrointestinal symptoms attributed to study medication were ascertained during the DPP and for those participants actively taking metformin during the DPPOS.</p><p>Weight was measured twice yearly and waist circumference annually (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Hemoglobin and hematocrit were measured annually in each clinic&#x02019;s laboratory on all participants randomized to medication during the DPP and for participants actively taking metformin during the DPPOS. Low hematocrit was defined as &#x0003c;40% in men and &#x0003c;36% in women and low hemoglobin as &#x0003c;13 mg/dL in men and &#x0003c;12 mg/dL in women.</p><sec id="s3"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Analyses are presented in two parts: <italic>1</italic>) the first 2 years of the double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial and <italic>2</italic>) the complete follow-up period since randomization, including the open-label phase, lasting an additional 7&#x02013;8 years (until 27 August 2008, the closing date for this analysis).

Four categories of long-term adherence were defined (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Participants were censored from the metformin adherence grouping when study-supplied metformin was discontinued due to uncontrolled hyperglycemia, and diabetes drug treatment was managed outside the protocol.

Men were more adherent to metformin during the DPP but not over the total follow-up period. No differences were observed among placebo participants. At the end of year 1, weight loss in the metformin group was 2.7 &#x000b1; 4.7% (mean &#x000b1; SD) compared with a loss of 0.43 &#x000b1; 4.7% in the placebo group (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001).

<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> shows changes in body weight and waist circumference in each treatment group according to pill-taking adherence during the 2-year double-blind phase. Seventy-two percent of the metformin group and 74% of the placebo group were in the &#x02265;50% adherent or highly adherent categories (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>), although fewer placebo participants were highly adherent. Adherence was strongly associated with weight loss in the metformin-treated group. The durability of weight loss was also affected by adherence. Average weight of highly adherent participants was 3.5 &#x000b1; 0.35% below baseline at 2 years, very close to their 1-year weight loss. Those with low adherence had returned to baseline weight by year 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref>) (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001).

Long-term follow-up was excellent at 92%, in contrast with other weight loss drug trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Effects of metformin on weight have been reported in several trials in diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>), one in obese adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>), and in a recent meta-analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). One report included changes in waist-to-hip circumference ratio, and only three provided data for more than 1 year of follow-up. In a meta-analysis of metformin and weight loss, weight change at 1 year was &#x02212;1.52 kg (95% CI &#x02212;2.82 to &#x02212;0.21) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). The mean weight change at 1 year in our study was &#x02212;2.7 kg in the metformin group and &#x02212;0.4 kg in the placebo group.</p><p>Adherence to metformin improved the magnitude of weight loss&#x02014;but not waist circumference&#x02014;during the first 2 years. Adherence to placebo did not affect weight loss, suggesting that metformin, rather than nonspecific adherence to positive health behaviors, was the relevant factor.</p><p>Waist circumference increased in all groups after year 2, except for the highly adherent participants where the increase began after 5 years and waist circumference remained lower than baseline. Since body weight did not increase, this suggests that central adiposity increased by redistribution of body fat.</p><p>Metformin participants in the low adherence group lost weight but placebo participants with low adherence did not. Many of those in the low adherence metformin group took some metformin but not enough to be labeled &#x0201c;adherent.&#x0201d; In addition, those with low adherence in the placebo group may have personality traits related to accepting advice, ability to change habits, etc., whereas low adherence in the metformin group may also be related to gastro-intestinal side effects. Therefore, one would not expect those with low adherence in the two groups to have the same characteristics.</p><p>Metformin lowers glucose and reduces risk for diabetes in part through weight loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Although basal energy metabolism is highly correlated with body mass, early studies showed that despite appreciable reductions in body weight with metformin treatment, basal energy expenditure remains unchanged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). This is because metformin-induced weight loss is almost exclusively confined to reductions in adipose mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>) with little change in lean tissue. This pattern is different from that seen with caloric restriction, which tends to induce loss of lean tissue as well as adipose tissue. Metformin has several effects on energy metabolism that parallel physical exercise. Both exercise and metformin stimulate phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). AMPK is an important regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>), hepatic and muscle fatty acid oxidation, glucose transport, insulin secretion, and lipogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Whether metformin directly affects energy expenditure from physical activity is unknown. Metformin might also influence weight loss through reduced food intake owing to irritation of the gastrointestinal tract, which may motivate a reduction in food intake or change in nutritional preference.</p><p>Adherence to metformin was high. In the double-blind phase of the trial, 72% were highly adherent, and throughout the entire trial, 62% of the metformin group was highly adherent.</p><p>No significant safety issues were identified. Both hemoglobin and hematocrit declined slightly in the metformin group over the first year after randomization and stabilized after that. Metformin participants reported more gastrointestinal symptoms than placebo participants, however these abated over time and both types of gastrointestinal symptom reports were similar between groups by the latter years of the DPPOS.</p><p>One potential bias is that 12% of DPP participants chose not to continue into the DPPOS. It is likely that some of those who discontinued the study or who continued but chose not to take open-label metformin did so because of side effects, which may have influenced the safety and tolerability profile of metformin during the open-label DPPOS period.</p><p>In summary, metformin produces a highly significant reduction in body weight and waist circumference with minimal safety issues and limited issues of tolerability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). The weight reduction persists for up to 10 years and is related to adherence to metformin. Waist circumference initially declines, then steadily increases after a nadir at 12&#x02013;36 months in all groups except in the highly adherent group, in which this increase was delayed for 5 years. Metformin was well tolerated with few side effects.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><p>Clinical trial reg. nos.
