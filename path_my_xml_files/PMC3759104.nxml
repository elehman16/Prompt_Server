The institutional review board approved the study, and all the study procedures adhered to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki. All the subjects were explained the benefits and risks of the procedure, the composition, and the source of the collagen implant before obtaining an informed consent. The study subjects included individuals&#x02019; &#x02265; 18 years of age with medically uncontrolled primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) or primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG) with no previous intraocular surgery. POAG was defined in the presence of an IOP &#x0003e; 21 mmHg, open anterior chamber angle on gonioscopy, glaucomatous optic disc damage on clinical examination, and corresponding glaucomatous visual field defects. PACG was defined in the presence of an occludable angle on gonioscopy (posterior trabecular meshwork not seen in at least 180&#x000b0; of the total circumference of the angle in primary position), glaucomatous optic disc damage, and corresponding glaucomatous visual field defects. The IOP was measured using Goldmann Applanation Tonometer, and gonioscopy was performed using a Sussmann's 4 mirror gonioscope under appropriate testing conditions. Optic disc changes that were considered to be glaucomatous were focal or diffuse neuroretinal rim thinning, localized notching or nerve fiber layer defects. Visual field defects were considered glaucomatous if at least 2 of the 3 Anderson's criteria (3 or more non-edged points in a cluster depressed to <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 5% and 1 of which is depressed to <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 1%, Glaucoma Hemifield Test outside normal limits and Pattern Standard Deviation depressed to <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 5%) were fulfilled. Age, gender, type of glaucoma, presence of systemic diseases (diabetes mellitus and systemic hypertension in particular), presenting IOP, highest recorded IOP, number of anti-glaucoma medications and visual field parameters were noted. After enrollment, patients were randomized into 1 of the 2 groups; Trabeculectomy with Ologen implant was group 1 (Ologen group), and trabeculectomy with MMC was group 2 (MMC group). Randomization was done using a permuted block randomization. Block size of 4 was determined, and 2 eyes of group 1 and 2 eyes of group 2 were randomly allocated into each block.

A 4 &#x000d7; 4 mm triangular, partial thickness scleral flap was reflected, a trabeculectomy of 2 &#x000d7; 2 mm was performed using a Vanna's scissors, and a peripheral iridectomy was completed. The scleral flap was closed with single 10-0 Nylon suture at the apex, and conjunctiva was secured with two 8-0 Vicryl wing sutures. The procedure was the same for both the groups, except that the eyes randomized to Ologen group had scleral flap closure with a single apical loose suture (as per the manufacturers recommendation), and a 6 mm &#x000d7; 2 mm Ologen implant was placed on top of the sclera and the conjunctiva was then closed [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>]. The MMC Group had 4 MMC (0.4 mg/ml) soaked sponges placed sub-conjunctivally over a wide area for 2 minutes (after making the superficial scleral flap). The sponges were removed, and the area was copiously irrigated with 20 cc of ringer lactate. Postoperatively, all patients were treated with prednisolone acetate 1% eye drops in tapering doses over 5 weeks, antibiotic eye drops 4 times-a-day for a week and cyclopentolate 1% eye drops 3 times-a-day for 2 to 3 weeks.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Biodegradable collagen matrix implant positioned directly above the scleral flap.
