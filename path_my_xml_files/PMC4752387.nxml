In addition, hepatitis serologies were repeated at the time PrEP was stopped if HBV infection status was ambiguous at baseline or if the study participants were susceptible at baseline. Participants at screening who were positive for HBcAb and negative for HBsAb were also tested for HBcAb IgM (HBcAb IgM) to distinguish acute from chronic infection. Individuals were excluded from the trial if the HBcAb IgM was positive, if they had indications for HBV treatment based on local practice standards, or had elevations in liver function tests (LFTs), including alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), or total bilirubin more than 2-fold the upper limit of normal (ULN) within 28 days of enrollment, or signs of hepatic cirrhosis. All participants with evidence of active hepatitis B infection were excluded from participation at sites in Brazil because of local concerns about safety and treatment monitoring requirements.</p><p>Hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) and hepatitis B e antibody (HBeAb) were tested for in enrolled participants with a positive HBsAg and when the activity of HBV remained ambiguous after initial screening (ie, when HBcAb was positive, HBsAb was negative, and HBcAb IgM was negative). Participants with a positive HBsAg were followed up with a medical history and LFTs at weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 after stopping study drugs to assess for flares. Participants were also tested for elevated LFTs if they had signs or symptoms of hepatitis during the study and when deemed clinically appropriate.</p><p>For enrolled individuals with a positive HBsAg at any time during the trial, HBV DNA was measured via polymerase chain reaction.

Of the 5 individuals with HBV genotypes obtained, 3 had genotypes obtained after some exposure to FTC/TDF PrEP, and none had evidence of antiviral drug resistance.

This participant was hepatitis B susceptible at screening (all negative for HBsAg, HBcAb, and HBsAb) with normal LFTs. At week 4, the participant had elevated LFTs (AST = 205, ALT = 669), and serologies showed negative for HBsAg, HBsAb, HBeAg; positive for HBcAb, HBcAb IgM, HBeAb at that visit. LFTs normalized 2 weeks later, and by week 28, he developed positive HBsAb and positive total HBcAb suggesting resolution of infection with protective immunity.

At screening, the participant had normal AST/ALT (35/35), with serologies consistent with chronic HBV infection: positive for HBsAg, HBcAb, and HBeAg and negative for HBsAb, HBcAb IgM, and HBeAb. Testing at enrollment (15 days after his screening visit) indicated that his AST/ALT had increased to 214/304 (grade 3) before PrEP initiation. Eight days after enrollment, repeat LFTs at an interim visit indicated grade 4 elevations (ALT 1061, AST 1473), and PrEP was stopped. At that time, there was evidence of an acute HBV infection with interval appearance of detected HBcAb IgM and continuing positive HBsAg, HBcAb, positive HBeAg, and negative HBsAb and HBeAb. Eleven weeks later, his AST/ALT returned to normal, and he was restarted on study drug 3 weeks later. Retrospective analysis at enrollment revealed a HBV viral load &#x0003e;3.41 &#x000d7; 10<sup>9</sup> copies that was undetectable by week 24 and remained undetectable for the duration of participant's time in the study. During visits at study weeks 28 and 72, HBV serology showed interval loss of HBsAg and HBeAg and interval appearance of HBeAb, yet still no detectable HBsAb.

Two individuals who did not attain immunity were administered a fourth dose. Neither individual developed subsequent immunity.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s5"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this large multinational randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial of oral FTC/TDF for HIV PrEP, hepatitis B exposure was highly prevalent (&#x0003e;25% of participants screened with evidence of prior or active infection). Although over 60% of the participants were HBV susceptible at screening, fewer than 25% had reported ever receiving an HBV vaccine. Among those who had received a vaccine, fewer than half had received all 3 doses recommended by the CDC<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>; this deficiency varied widely among the sites and was especially high in the Andes.</p><p>In contrast to low vaccination rates before the trial, vaccine uptake during the trial was excellent with over 97% of eligible participants receiving at least 1 dose and 85% receiving the complete series; the vaccine response rate (as reflected by HBsAb seroconversion) for those completing the series was 87%, consistent with the CDC data regarding vaccine immunogenicity.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> The acute HBV infections that occurred during the study highlight how prevention through vaccination is imperative, and the low rates of global vaccination provide a clear opportunity for disease prevention. Engaging adult MSM and transgender women in PrEP programs may offer a unique opportunity to increase vaccination rates. Interestingly, there is also some evidence from a recent retrospective study that use of hepatitis B-active antiretroviral therapy for treatment of HIV (lamivudine, emtricitabine, and TFV) led to a lower incidence of hepatitis B acquisition than the use of antiretrovirals without hepatitis B activity.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> This effect was especially apparent when TFV was used, which provides another protective benefit of FTC/TDF use and is consistent with our data, showing that no acute HBV infections occurred after 4 weeks on FTC/TDF; both cases of acute HBV infection that occurred in the placebo arm occurred later. These findings suggest that FTC/TDF might serve to prevent hepatitis B-susceptible people from acquiring hepatitis B before completion of the vaccine series.</p><p>Among the 12 participants enrolled in the study with chronic hepatitis B, almost all of those tested had no evidence of antiviral drug resistance (8/9). One isolate from a participant randomized to the placebo arm showed possible resistance to lamivudine and telbivudine. No participant had virus associated with resistance mutations against TFV, and no participants experienced a flare either during the trial or after drug discontinuation, although one participant whose LFTs were normal while on study drug developed a low-grade, asymptomatic, and self-limited elevation of the transaminases after PrEP discontinuation. The majority with chronic hepatitis B randomized to FTC/TDF (5 of 6) had visits when drug was detected followed by visits when no drug was detected, indicating inconsistent adherence, and yet, none experienced a hepatitis B flare. It is possible that flares were absent because individuals with evidence of liver dysfunction were excluded. The risk of flares with FTC discontinuation seems to be limited to people with advanced liver disease.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></p><p>Interestingly, TFV use in chronic hepatitis B in the setting of cirrhosis has led to regression of fibrosis.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Regarding the 2 cases of acute HBV infection within the FTC/TDF arm, 1 resolved with development of immunity and the other resolved clinically with loss of circulating antigen but remained HBsAb negative. It is not known whether this person may have a recurrence of HBV antigenemia after stopping PrEP.</p><p>The principal limitation of this study is the small number of enrolled participants with active HBV infection, which limits the ability to provide definitive conclusions regarding the safety of PrEP use in the context of HBV infection in MSM/TGW or conclusive guidance related to best practices. Our results are reassuring, however, in that none of the participants in iPrEx with chronic HBV infection developed a flare during intermittent use of PrEP and even after drug discontinuation.</p><p>We agree with the CDC that screening for HBsAg should occur before PrEP initiation; while most providers prescribing PrEP are compliant with most PrEP guidelines, only approximately 60% of providers are screening for HBV infection.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Obtaining HBsAg alone followed by HBV DNA (when available) for individuals with a positive HBsAg may be the only required testing before initiating PrEP, especially in resource-limited settings in which obtaining additional serologies may be more expensive than vaccination.</p><p>We did not find that testing for HBsAb, HBcAb, HBcAb IgM, HBeAb, or HBeAg added value for the purposes of assessing PrEP eligibility. Importantly, persons with isolated HBcAb (and negative HBsAg and HBsAb) were all HBV DNA negative with normal LFTs, indicating that this common pattern of serologies was consistent immunity from prior infection rather than active infection with a HBV mutant. Individuals with HBV infection who are interested in PrEP can be safely started on FTC/TDF, which will also provide excellent activity against HBV<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>; consistent adherence may be required to prevent development of resistance.</p><p>This experience, combined with prior evidence showing no hepatitis flares among 23 women during and after oral TDF PrEP,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> demonstrates that PrEP can often be safely started and stopped in persons with HBV infection who do not have cirrhosis or transaminase elevations at PrEP initiation. As information is limited and treatment for HBV infection is complex, referral to a specialist is appropriate when available, especially for PrEP discontinuation. At that time, a separate decision regarding continuing FTC/TDF or switching management strategies for HBV infection must be reached.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Such a decision would be based on further testing to evaluate cirrhosis to determine the need for ongoing hepatitis B treatment.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></p><p>Individuals infected with HBV should have monitoring of LFTs (and possibly HBV viral load where available) every 6&#x02013;12 months while on PrEP to ensure that the emergence of HBV resistance to FTC/TDF has not occurred, a theoretical concern with suboptimal adherence.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Although TDF presents a high barrier to developing HBV drug resistance, especially when given as combination therapy,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> inconsistent adherence due to intermittent dosing may lead to drug resistance,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> yet no cases have been reported.
