Current treatment for PD is pharmacologically focused and can have significant side-effects. There is increasing interest in holistic approaches including mindfulness to help manage the challenges associated with living with PD. We hypothesised that there would be an improvement in PD associated function and wellbeing in participants after participating in a 6-week mindfulness-based lifestyle program, and that these improvements would be sustainable at 6&#x000a0;months. Our primary objective was to determine changes in function and wellbeing associated with PD.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>An exploratory prospective, mixed-method, randomised control trial incorporating a before and after design with a waitlist control, with an embedded qualitative component was conducted in 2012&#x02013;2013. Participants included community living adults with disability congruent to H&#x00026;Y Stage 2 PD, aged 18&#x02013;75, fluent in spoken and written English and able to attend at least four of six sessions of the program. Participants were randomised to the intervention or wait-list control groups at two locations. All participants in the wait-list control group eventually received the intervention. Two randomisation codes were created for each location. Allocation to the intervention or wait-list control was by random number generation. The program facilitator and participants were blinded to participant data.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Group 1 included 35 participants and group 2 (the waitlist control), 37. Data was analysed from 24 (group 1) and 33 (group 2) participants. The intervention group, compared to the waitlist control, showed a small improvement in function and wellbeing associated with PD immediately after the program (t-score&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;0.59) and at 6-month post intervention (t-score&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;1.42) as reported by the PDQ-39 SI. However this finding was not significant (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.56 and 0.16 respectively). A small yet significant effect size (<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.23) in PDQ-39 ADL was reported in group 1 after 6-months post-intervention. This showed a positive improvement in the ADL as reported by group 1 after 6-months (t-score &#x02212;1.8, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.04). Four secondary measures are reported.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our findings suggest mindfulness-based lifestyle programs have potential to assist participants in managing the ongoing difficulties associated with a neurological condition such as Parkinson&#x02019;s disease. Importantly, our study shows promise for the long term benefits of such programs. Improvements to participant activities in daily living and mindfulness were retained at 6-months post intervention. A more definitive study should be conducted in a larger sample of PD patients to further explore these findings and their impact on reducing stress and anxiety in PD patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.anzctr.org.au/TrialSearch.aspx?searchTxt=12612000440820&#x00026;conditionCategory=&#x00026;conditionCode=&#x00026;interventionCodeOperator=&#x00026;interventionCode=&#x00026;ageGroup=&#x00026;healthyVolunteers=&#x00026;gender=&#x00026;allocationToIntervention=&#x00026;dateOfRegistrationFrom=&#x00026;">ACTRN12612000440820</ext-link>, 17<sup>th</sup> April 2012.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Parkinson&#x02019;s disease</kwd><kwd>Neurological disorder</kwd><kwd>Mindfulness</kwd><kwd>Group program</kwd><kwd>Meditation</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Parkinson's Victoria</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Parkinson&#x02019;s disease (PD) is the second commonest neurodegenerative disease in developed countries. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. When adjusted by age, global incidence rates of PD range between 9.7 and 13.8 per 100,000 population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In 2014 there were nearly 70,000 people living with PD in Australia, approximately 14,500 more than in 2005, and 5,100 more than in 2011 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. With many developed countries reporting increased ageing populations, the incidence of PD is expected to increase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Despite this recognition, many diagnosed with PD continue to suffer poor quality of life, experiencing complex motor and non-motor symptoms affecting emotional, cognitive and physical well-being [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>Where PD is poorly self-managed, symptoms can lead to significant challenges in completing basic daily activities. Negative outcomes for people diagnosed with PD extend beyond the individual or patient level. Large proportions of the burden of disease are carried by those who care for PD sufferers and economically by health-systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. These effects can be intensified by complex and, at times, invasive treatment options. Lifestyle-based interventions, incorporating mindfulness training, have been identified as improving self-management outcomes in patients with a variety of chronic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and neurological diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>Mindfulness is a form of meditation that has been defined as: &#x0201c;<italic>the awareness that emerges through paying attention on purpose, in the present moment, and nonjudgmentally to the unfolding of experience moment by moment</italic>&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. One program for multiple sclerosis, utilising lifestyle and mindfulness training in conjunction with conventional medical care, found reduced costs of disease, reversal of disease progression and improvement in patient quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Meta-analyses also suggest longer term improvements in patient mental health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In more recent years, programs encompassing mindfulness have begun to explore the neurobehavioral effects for people living with PD, with positive outcomes, including improved motor function, patient experience of pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and development of better coping mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The longitudinal benefit of such programs on the self-management of PD however, to the best of our knowledge, has not yet been explored.</p><p>This study aimed to investigate the impact of a 6 week mindfulness-based lifestyle program for community living adults with Hoehn and Yahr (H&#x00026;Y) stage two PD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].

Melbourne is a capital city in Australia with over four million people. In Australia, there are approximately 80,000 people living with Parkinson&#x02019;s. In Victoria, more than 2,225 people are newly diagnosed with Parkinson&#x02019;s every year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].

Target participants were initially invited to participate through a combination of written invitations from Parkinson&#x02019;s Victoria sent to people listed on the Parkinson&#x02019;s registry, advertisements in PV publications and through neurologists and primary care clinicians. In order to assist with the potential issue of slow recruitment, as seen in previous trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], a recruitment officer (BV) was employed. The recruitment officer worked with the Advisory Group to develop additional recruitment strategies, including: the development of promotional materials (flyers, brochures, and posters), engaging with PD support groups, presenting at PD community events and utilising the M.J. Fox Foundations clinical trial finder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Intervention</title><p>The intervention was a mindfulness-based lifestyle program involving facilitated, two hour group sessions once a week for a total of 6-weeks. The program was designed to introduce key lifestyle and mindfulness elements to participants. Typically, each session consisted of a 5&#x02013;20 min mindfulness practice, led by the program facilitator and author of the model (CH), introduction to one of the ESSENCE elements (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) and an open group discussion about participants&#x02019; thoughts and feelings about the program. The mindfulness practice included specific techniques, such as, attention to the breath, a &#x02018;body scan&#x02019; and letting go of competing or negative thoughts. Participants were further introduced to strategies designed to help them to live better with a chronic disease and encouraged to use aspects of the program that were most relevant to them.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>ESSENCE</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12883_2016_685_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p>A 3 disc CD pack with guided mindfulness practices free-of-charge and printed information was given to participants to assist them with their practice outside of the group sessions.

Week 7 (T1) questionnaires were distributed to the intervention participants after the final session and if a participant was absent then the questionnaire was mailed. Wait-list control participants received the questionnaire in the mail. The 6 month (T2) questionnaires were all mailed.

This positive effect on participant motor function is not uncommon where behaviour-change is the central focus of the intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. A similar study exploring the effects of the provision of behavioural advice on PD symptom management found improved motor performance and reduced tremor amongst PD participants when compared to a control group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Furthermore, improvements in function may be found where advice on behaviour-change is delivered within a supportive group setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The embedded qualitative study highlighted the group support that was part of the program had assisted participants in coping with PD, particularly when groups shared chronic disease management &#x02018;tips&#x02019; and experiences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. The positive group dynamic of the mindfulness-based lifestyle program delivered in our study offered opportunities for participants to share ideas for better disease management and may be reflected in the significant increase in participants&#x02019; ADL after 6-months from receiving the program. This sustained effect was similarly noted in participant improvement in emotional well-being. Positive outcomes for motor and non-motor dysfunction are particularly reflected where mindfulness is strongly embedded [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] and emphasised in intervention programs. Others have found that interventions which promote personal control may assist in reducing disability and improving quality of life in people with PD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].</p><p>Emerging evidence which suggests that mindfulness may lead to neuroplastic changes of regions in the brain involved in the regulation of emotion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] and improvements in emotional well-being, particularly stress-management, anxiety and depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] for people with chronic and neurological disease. Our study however showed a statistically but not clinically significant increase in depression following the intervention which returned to normal at 6&#x000a0;months. In the initial stages of learning mindfulness people can report more awareness of depressive symptoms that were already present [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. This may be further compounded by negative effects in changing PD medication dosage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] and the challenges associated with adapting to chronic disease, whereby making adjustments to a person&#x02019;s social and work life can be stressful or create worry until the benefits of those changes start to make themselves obvious. It should be noted that severity of PD symptoms is evidenced to fluctuate throughout the year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] with poorer outcomes reported during busy social periods, such as Christmas, which is when our study took place. There also appeared to be a correlation between increased adherence to the program and depression at 6 months, which may need to be considered as a possible unwanted outcome in a bigger study.</p><p>We also found an increase in stress immediately after the 6-week program and then significant reduction compared to baseline in stress at 6 months post program, primarily associated with a recent PD diagnosis. Importantly these benefits appeared to be sustainable over longer periods of time signifying indicating the potential to improve mental well-being in those recently diagnosed with PD. Early treatment strategies which aid in the diminishment of symptom severity, or the stress associated in experiencing symptoms, are seen to have more meaningful impacts in improving quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec23"><title>Mindfulness: a feasible therapeutic intervention</title><p>We found that mindfulness training may be a feasible therapeutic intervention within a population of persons with PD. Previous evidence has suggested greater benefits from mindfulness training particularly for depression but only after sustained or formal practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Our findings indicate that by simply introducing mindfulness practices, benefits for people with PD can be achieved. After participating in only six sessions of a holistic lifestyle program which included up to 20&#x000a0;min of mindfulness training each week increases in participant mindfulness levels were found, and, importantly, appeared to be retained longitudinally. Despite many not engaging in continued formal practice, positive psychological benefits of the practice are still found [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. For participants in this study, knowledge of mindfulness techniques assisted with better management of anxiety and stress.</p><p>Although ad hoc utilisation of mindfulness techniques (as opposed to formal practice) appeared to bring benefit to the study population, it was evident that where mindfulness was practiced more regularly and formally participants were more likely to report positive improvements to their well-being. This finding is consistent with the literature. As mindfulness skills become more integrated into a regular routine, the greater the benefit in stress reduction and symptom management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec24"><title>Limitations</title><p>An important limitation was the relatively small sample size of our exploratory study. A larger sample is now needed to confidently determine significant changes in patient outcomes. The programme was facilitated by the author of the model (CH) which may have introduced some bias. Furthermore, our inclusion criteria and choice of program location may have limited our study sample to only include participants of a higher socio-demographic status and lower disease severity than the general PD population and may, therefore, reduce the generalisability of our study findings. This effect is not uncommon in community based studies recruiting voluntary participants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Finally, our primary outcome measure (PDQ-39) and use of the DASS-21 anxiety sub-scale may also raise some limitations. Due to the ambiguity of scoring the PDQ-39 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>], and poor loading and internal consistency of the DASS-21 anxiety sub-scale, interpreting valid change magnitudes amongst a sample with early stage PD disease severity is challenging and may not reflect the true changes of disease progression from the patient perspective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Larger studies should be aware of these limitation when including the PDQ-31 and DASS-21 as outcome measures.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This small, community based prospective mixed-method randomised clinical trial incorporating a before and after design with a waitlist control provides needed evidence about the value of incorporating mindfulness training into the treatment options available to people with PD. Our findings suggest that mindfulness-based lifestyle programs may have great potential to assist participants in managing ongoing difficulties associated with a neurological condition such as Parkinson&#x02019;s disease. In particular, our study provides suggestive evidence of potential long term benefits for the management of PD after receiving a mindfulness-based lifestyle program, when delivered alongside conventional treatment during early stages of diagnosis. A more definitive study should be conducted in a larger sample of PD patients to further explore the suggested significant increases in activities of daily living and mindfulness in reducing outcomes of stress and anxiety in PD patients.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ADL</term><def><p>Activities of daily living</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BOD</term><def><p>Bodily discomfort</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>COG</term><def><p>Cognitions</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>COM</term><def><p>Communication</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DASS</term><def><p>Depression anxiety and stress scales</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EMO</term><def><p>Emotional well-being</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FMI</term><def><p>Freiberg mindfulness index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>H&#x00026;Y</term><def><p>Hoehn &#x00026; Yahr</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HBQ</term><def><p>Health behaviours questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HrQOL</term><def><p>Health related quality of life</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LOC</term><def><p>Locus of control</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MDB</term><def><p>Mobility</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PD</term><def><p>Parkinson&#x02019;s disease</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PDQ</term><def><p>Parkinson&#x02019;s disease questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PV</term><def><p>Parkinson&#x02019;s victoria</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SOC</term><def><p>Social support</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>STI</term><def><p>Stigma</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors gratefully acknowledge our funder Parkinson&#x02019;s Victoria and all those who participated in the ESSENCE Mindfulness Lifestyle Research Program.
