The FACT-G is reliable and validated instrument for measuring HRQoL in cancer patients.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Pain relief evaluation</title><p>Brief pain inventory (BPI) is a self-administered assessment tool used in pain management. The basic concept of BPI is to provide the information on the intensity of pain and the degree to which it interferes with the daily activity. The BPI is a brief and easy to use tool for assessment of pain in clinical research. The long version of the BPI has the front and back body diagrams, the four pain severity items and seven pain interference items rated on 0-10 scale and the question about percentage of pain relief by analgesic. The long version uses 7 days recall period. The interference items are presented with 0-10 scale, with &#x02018;0&#x02019; = no interference and &#x02018;10&#x02019; = interference completely. The BPI measures how much pain has interfered with the seven daily activities including general activity, walking, work, mood, enjoyment of life, relation with others, and sleep. The BPI pain interference typically scored as the mean of the seven interference items. We chose Bengali translation of validated BPI for the interference items for statistical analysis.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Clinically significant change was defined as at least one-step change on the symptom scale.</p><p>Clinical follow up after 12<sup>th</sup> week was optional according to the individual needs.

Although treatment outcomes in advanced disease remain modest, with the paradigm shifts in the approach to treatments, they are steadily improving. Customized treatments based on the tumor histology and genetic profiles have becomes the standard of care.</p><p>Systemic chemotherapy with the platinum-based doublets is the standard of care in metastatic or advanced NSCLC.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] This leads to modest survival advantage and improve QoL. TRT remains an important treatment modality for patients with symptom from intra-thoracic disease. There is no consensus which fractionation scheme should be used for palliative TRT. Different palliative TRT fractionation schedules, ranging from 10 Gy in single fractionation to 30 Gy in 10 fractions are used in clinical practice considering the patients preference, PS, and institutional protocol. In 2002, Cochrane meta-analysis of 10 randomized palliative radiotherapy trials in NSCLC was published.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] The palliative effect on disease-related symptoms were equivalent in all the fractionation schedules regardless of total radiotherapy dose.</p><p>Considering the poor prognosis for our patients, the primary objective of the study was the pain relief. This result was consistent with the previous studies in metastatic NSCLC.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] HRQoL data did not reveal any significant difference among the study groups except social well-being. There is slight decrease in physical and functional well-being mean score of FACT G at 2<sup>nd</sup> week post-TRT in all the arms. It indicates a slow deterioration of HRQoL in the physical and functional domains just after palliative hypo fractionated TRT. However, social well-being mean score increased over time up to 12 weeks post treatment except in the arm A (17 Gy in 2 fractions). Whereas, social well-being score decreased just after post radiotherapy and continued to decrease throughout the follow up periods.</p><p>The TRT side effects were mild and temporary. Dysphasia, a symptom related to radiation oesophagitis, increased during and shortly after the radiotherapy compared with the pretreatment level. It appears early in arms A (17 Gy in 2 fractions) and B (20 Gy in 5 fractions) than arm C (30 Gy in 10 fractions) and subsides within few weeks after completion of radiotherapy.</p><p>PS is the most important prognostic factor for median OS. In our study, we observed longer survival period in patients with good PS, as expected. However, there was no significant difference detected in OS among the three different palliative radiotherapy arms. In addition, subgroup analyses of patients with poor PS, the hypo fractionated (17 Gy in 2 fractions) TRT was equally effective as more fractionated high dose TRT (30 Gy in 10 fractions). We observed a non-significant increase in median survival in patients with good PS and those treated with more fractionated high dose TRT (30 Gy in 10 fractions). Bezjak et a l.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] reported a study (10 Gy in fractions vs. 20 Gy in 5 fractions) and found a significantly superior median survival in favor of higher dose TRT (6.0 vs. 4.2 months, <italic>P</italic> = 0.03). This difference was restricted to the good PS, which is similar to our results.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>The efficacy of hypo fractionated TRT with respect to symptom palliation and OS in metastatic NSCLC is equivalent to that of more protracted or higher dose TRT. However, stage IV NSCLC with good PS may be benefited from more protracted TRT schedule. The side effect of hypo fractionated TRT was tolerable and comparable with protracted and higher dose TRT. Short-term hypo fractionated treatment is convenient for patients with limited expected survival.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Falk</surname><given-names>SJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Girling</surname><given-names>DJ</given-names></name><name><surname>White</surname><given-names>RJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Hopwood</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Harvey</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Qian</surname><given-names>W</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Medical Research Council Lung Cancer Working Party.
