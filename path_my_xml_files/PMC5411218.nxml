Patients were included according to the following criteria: (1) patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grade 2 that patients had slight systemic diseases and mild lesions of important organs, but normal compensatory function,<sup>[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup> and (2) aged 4 to 9 years old. Patients with cardiopulmonary anomaly and other serious systemic diseases were excluded from this study. Approval from the Ethics Committee of Taian City Central Hospital was obtained and informed consents were signed by legal guardians of all patients prior to operation.</p><p>All the patients were randomly divided into 3 groups in accordance with the random number table: high-pressure group (HP group, n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;26), patients received laparoscopic high ligation of the hernia sac, and a pressure of the capnoperitoneum of 12&#x0200a;mm Hg was used; low-pressure group (LP group, n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;20), patients received laparoscopic high ligation of the hernia sac with a pressure of the capnoperitoneum of 8&#x0200a;mm Hg; open operation group (OP group, n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;22), patients received high ligation of hernia sac by open operation.</p></sec><sec><label>2.2</label><title>Anesthesia and surgery method</title><p>HR, blood pressure, and blood oxygen saturation were monitored regularly when children entered the operation room. Anesthesia was induced by intravenous atropine (0.02&#x0200a;mg/kg) with 100% oxygen at 8&#x0200a;L/min for 3&#x0200a;minutes, followed by fentanyl (2&#x0200a;&#x003bc;g/kg), midazolam (0.05&#x0200a;mg/kg), etomidate (0.2&#x0200a;mg/kg) and cis-atracurium (0.15&#x0200a;mg/kg). After intubation, patients received an aerosol solution of 1% isoflurane and continuous intravenous injection of 15&#x0200a;mL/h mixture composed of 50&#x0200a;mL propofol + 1&#x0200a;mg remifentanil during operation. Meanwhile, capnoperitoneum pressure was controlled using the capnoperitoneum apparatus. All the operations were performed by the same team of surgeons. After satisfactory anesthesia, patients in HP and LP groups were maintained in the supine position. Open laparoscopy was performed using an 1&#x0200a;cm arc incision at the umbilicus of patients, and then the high ligation of the hernia sac was performed at a 2&#x0200a;mm abdominal transverse cleavage line incision on the affected side with the stable capnoperitoneum pressure of either 12&#x0200a;mm Hg (HP group) or 8&#x0200a;mm Hg (LP group). Residual CO<sub>2</sub> was evacuated at the end of operation by compressing the abdomen. For patients in the OP group, the high ligation of the hernia sac was performed through a 2&#x0200a;cm abdominal transverse cleavage line incision on the affected side by open operation.<sup>[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup></p></sec><sec><label>2.3</label><title>Monitoring index</title><p>The values of HR, systolic blood pressure (SBP), and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), as well as end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> (PetCO<sub>2</sub>) were recorded at 5&#x0200a;minutes before operation and 20&#x0200a;minutes after establishing capnoperitoneum, respectively. Operative time and length of postoperative stay were also recorded. In addition, venous blood of all patients was collected at 30&#x0200a;minutes before operation, 20&#x0200a;minutes after establishing capnoperitoneum, and 12&#x0200a;h after operation, respectively.

The results showed that compared with OP and LP groups, circulatory system indexes, including HR, SBP, and DBP, as well as respiratory system index PetCO<sub>2</sub> were increased after establishing capnoperitoneum for 20&#x0200a;minutes. In addition, the concentrations of ACTH and COR were higher after operation than those before operation. Compared with the OP group, perioperative concentrations of ACTH and COR were significantly increased in the LP and HP groups, and the concentration of ACTH in the LP group was higher, while perioperative concentration of COR was lower than those in the HP group. Twelve hours after the operation, no significant difference was found in the concentration of ACTH or COR among the HP, LP, and OP groups.</p><p>The side effects of high-pressure capnoperitoneum with CO<sub>2</sub> on circulatory, respiratory and neuroendocrine systems had been reported during laparoscopy.<sup>[<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup> A previous study showed that HR and blood pressure significantly increased after the induction of capnoperitoneum.<sup>[<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup> Similarly, the present study found that capnoperitoneum increased HR and blood pressure. This might be explained that: (1) the establishment of capnoperitoneum induced an increase of the intra-abdominal pressure and the change in position, which led to the elevated blood pressure and increased peripheral vascular resistance, thereby increasing cardiac afterload; (2) high diffusion of CO<sub>2</sub> into blood induced hypercapnia and the productions of adrenaline, norepinephrine, or dopamine, which resulted in capillary contraction and raised blood pressure; (3) increased HR and blood pressure were caused by reduced coronary perfusion pressure and decreased aortic compliance due to reduced chest volume and increased pulmonary pressure after the induction of capnoperitoneum; (4) due to incomplete development of the cardiac muscle in children, the side effects of capnoperitoneum on HR and blood pressure may be more significant.<sup>[<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup> Thus, the endotracheal intubation and high-concentration oxygen inhalation were provided in children during operation. In addition to HR and blood pressure, PETCO<sub>2</sub> was also increased due to the establishment of capnoperitoneum in our study, which was consistent with the study of Pan et al.<sup>[<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</sup> It had been demonstrated that increased PetCO<sub>2</sub> was induced because of the transperitoneal absorption of CO<sub>2</sub> and reduced lung function.<sup>[<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</sup> Our study also found that HP capnoperitoneum induced higher HR, blood pressure, and PetCO<sub>2</sub> than LP and OP. Consistent with our study, Khan et al<sup>[<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</sup> suggested that HR, mean arterial blood pressure, and PETCO<sub>2</sub> were elevated with increased pressure of the capnoperitoneum. These results can be interpreted that LP capnoperitoneum had less intraoperative hemodynamic changes than HP capnoperitoneum in pediatric laparoscopic surgery.</p><p>Furthermore, this study found that compared with the OP group, neuroendocrine changes of children had obvious difference in laparoscopy. However, Reith et al<sup>[<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</sup> reported that cytokine response in open cholecystectomy was less pronounced when compared to laparoscopic cholecystectomy in adult. The contradiction might be caused by different types of surgery and a more sensitive neuroendocrine stress response in children. We found that the establishment of capnoperitoneum induced different alterations in influences in the concentrations of ACTH and COR dependent on the discretion of the capnoperitoneum pressures. When the body suffered sudden intense stimulation, both ACTH and COR levels were significantly increased because of stress reaction. Watanabe et al<sup>[<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</sup> also demonstrated that plasma concentrations of ACTH and COR were both increased during capnoperitoneum. We speculate that the reasons may be: (1) increased intra-abdominal pressure resulted in reduced renal perfusion and then activated the vascular control center of the medulla oblongata, which enhanced sympathetic activation; (2) pain caused by surgical trauma activated the hypothalamus-adenohypophysis-adrenocortical system, which induced elevated ACTH and COR.<sup>[<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]</sup> These results indicated that LP capnoperitoneum might have lower neuroendocrine response than HP capnoperitoneum in pediatric laparoscopic surgery.</p><p>However, this study has some limitations. First, the sample size is small, which may cause the result bias. Thus, a larger sample study should be performed to confirm our results. Second, the supplements of some clinically relevant data may increase the more clinical significance. Even so, the current data also can illustrate the effect of different capnoperitoneum pressures on stress responses.</p></sec><sec><label>5</label><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our results indicate that LP capnoperitoneum may reduce intraoperative hemodynamic changes and neuroendocrine stress reaction.
