The most frequently cited symptoms of concern were hirsutism, weight and menstrual irregularity. Statistically significant improvements in menstrual rates were found at 6&#x02005;months within group for both standardised CHM (mean difference (MD) 0.18&#x000b1;0.06, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.29; p=0.0027) and individualised CHM (MD 0.27&#x000b1;0.06, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.39; p&#x0003c;0.001), though not between group (p=0.26). No improvements were observed for BMI nor for weight in either group. Improvements in hirsutism scores found within group for both groups were not statistically significant between group (p=0.09). Liver and kidney function and adverse events data were largely normal. Participant feedback suggests changing to tablet administration could facilitate adherence.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>A CHM randomised controlled trial for PCOS is feasible and preliminary data suggest that both individualised and standardised multiherb CHMs have similar safety profiles and clinical effects on promoting menstrual regularity.

<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Although the pathogenesis of PCOS is complex, it is typically associated with hyperandrogenism, hyperinsulinaemia and an elevated ratio of the gonadotropins luteinising hormone to follicle-stimulating hormone.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Primary care management of menstrual disturbances typically involves oral contraceptives and insulin-sensitising agents but there is evidence of patient dissatisfaction associated with intolerable side effects, consequent poor adherence and potential increase in cardiovascular and metabolic risk.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6&#x02013;10</xref> This highlights issues and barriers with current management and warrants exploration of other treatments.</p><p>Complementary medicines such as multiherb Chinese herbal medicines (CHMs) are reportedly used by over 70% of women with PCOS and is a commonly encountered condition among herbal practitioners.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Previous studies have demonstrated the potential for certain herbs for PCOS through mechanisms such as increasing granulosa production of oestradiol and progesterone, increasing aromatisation of testosterone to 17-&#x003b2; oestradiol and reducing levels of luteinising hormone.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13&#x02013;15</xref> There is also emerging evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) conducted in China and a pilot study conducted recently in the USA highlights the potential for CHM in the management of symptoms such as oligomenorrhoea and amenorrhoea.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16&#x02013;20</xref> Although this provides encouraging preliminary evidence, the majority of the RCTs have been conducted in China and are methodologically poor, limiting the generalisability of these findings. This necessitates further exploration of CHM for PCOS within a fully powered RCT in UK primary care.</p><p>Given the novelty of offering CHM in UK primary care, it is important to first conduct a feasibility study to reduce uncertainties and facilitate planning of a main study.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21&#x02013;24</xref> The aims of this study were to evaluate the feasibility of a randomised study exploring the effects of standardised or individualised multiherb CHM for PCOS-related oligomenorrhoea and amenorrhoea, to pilot study processes and to obtain safety and clinical data to facilitate sample size calculations for a main study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Design</title><sec id="s2a1"><title>Design and setting</title><p>Details of the study design are provided in our protocol publication.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> To summarise our methods, our primary feasibility research question was:

In Chinese medicine terms based on traditional use, this prescription is directed at moving stagnant liver Qi, tonifying the kidney yang and on nourishing and moving the blood. It is not licensed as a proprietary product in the UK but, like individualised prescriptions, is available following a one-to-one consultation with a CHM practitioner in the UK. CHM practitioners in the UK must show evidence of an adequate level of education and training from an accredited institution, or equivalent experience, in order to be registered with a professional organisation such as the Register of Chinese Herbal Medicine (RCHM) or Association of Traditional Chinese Medicine (ATCM).

Dietary and lifestyle advice was permitted as part of usual care. Participants were blinded in that they were informed they would be randomised to one of two CHM treatments and were provided no further information regarding treatment differences. An independent statistician (PP) used computer-generated random numbers with allocation ratio 1:1 to provide an irregular block allocation sequence. Allocation codes were transferred to sealed opaque envelopes and provided to an RCHM-approved herbal dispensary who conducted randomisation. As practitioners were providing care as well as conducting objective outcome assessments, it was especially important to this study that practitioner and assessor blinding was maintained. In order to carry this out, practitioners were asked to formulate an individualised prescription for each participant at each visit. This was sent to the herbal dispensary who conducted randomisation at first visit, and dispensed either the standardised or individualised prescription according to randomisation. Prior to and during the study, practitioners and the study team did not have knowledge of the randomisation sequence or of treatment allocation. Participant blinding was not evaluated since participants were not informed regarding the differences between the two CHM treatments. Statistical analysis was conducted blinded.</p><p>Our feasibility outcomes were recruitment and retention rates. We included adherence as a part of our feasibility assessment, measured by Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS) at weeks 4 and at final visit, and by weighing prescription containers at week 12 and at final visit. Practitioner blinding was evaluated through a questionnaire used in previous studies of similar nature and analysed using Bang Blinding Index (BBI) administered at weeks 4, 12 and at final visit.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> We evaluated participant feedback at final visit and case report form (CRF) data were collected throughout the study as part of usual research practice and analysed to explore areas of potential improvement. At end of study, we conducted an audit of randomisation and allocation procedures to assess security of these processes.</p><p>Our primary outcome measure was menstrual regularity; secondary measures were hirsutism using validated modified Ferriman-Gallwey (mFG) questionnaire, anthropometrics using body mass index (BMI), weight, waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) and quality of life questionnaires Polycystic Ovary Syndrome Questionnaire (PCOSQ), Measure Yourself Medical Outcome Profile (MYMOP) and Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI). Additional information regarding the specific measures we used and clinical relevance of the individual scales and scores used are available in our study protocol.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Although menstrual regulation is regarded as clinically important, we wished to explore menstrual regulation as the primary outcome for the main study because we remained uncertain regarding the effects of a 6-month CHM treatment on menstruation. We therefore collected clinical data on menstruation to obtain an estimate of treatment effect and associated variability to support sample size calculations for a future study. The appropriateness of menstrual regulation as a primary outcome for the main study was examined by seeing whether or not we could collect menstrual data for analysis. Furthermore, we explored whether menstrual regulation appeared to be an important outcome to participants by ranking patient-generated MYMOP data whereby participants specified up to two key symptoms (MYMOP1 and optionally MYMOP2) that were of greatest concern to them and which did not have to be PCOS-related. To investigate whether other outcome measures such as mFG or anthropometrics could be more appropriate as the primary outcome for the main study, we again collected data on treatment effects and where these symptoms ranked in MYMOP to indicate importance to participants.</p><p>Outcome measures were taken at baseline and at final visit with the exception of menstrual frequency which was recorded throughout study participation.

There were however no between-group differences in any of these measures (MYMOP1 p=0.98, MYMOP2 p=0.29, MYMOP activity p=0.19, MYMOP well-being p=0.97). Minimum clinically important difference (MCID) of 1.0 was reached for MYMOP1 for both groups and for MYMOP activity for only standardised CHM. All remaining MYMOP results show potential for a clinically important difference since 95% CIs include the MCID.</p></sec><sec id="s3b2e"><title>Polycystic Ovary Syndrome Questionnaire</title><p>For both groups, statistically significant improvements were seen in PCOS total scores within group for both standardised CHM (MD 5.17&#x000b1;1.0, 95% CI 3.09 to 7.25; p&#x0003c;0.001) and individualised CHM (MD 3.74&#x000b1;1.0, 95% CI 1.72 to 5.77; p&#x0003c;0.001) but not between group (p=0.33).

All nine were assessed as mild in severity, expected, not serious and having a reasonable causal relationship with treatment. Gastrointestinal symptoms (bloating, nausea, loose stools, vomiting) were the most commonly reported with the remainder consisting of tiredness, skin breakout, ovulation pain, light headedness and headache.</p><p>The majority of AR incidents (14/17, 82.4%) subsided with continued administration and lasted a median of 4&#x02005;days (range 1&#x02013;74&#x02005;days). Two symptoms (loose stools and bloating) persisted with continued administration of standardised CHM for two participants.</p><p>Two serious adverse events were reported.

<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> At week 4, this was standardised (BBI &#x02212;0.11, 95% CI &#x02212;0.35 to 0.14, random) and individualised (BBI 0.47, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.71, unblinded); week 12 standardised (BBI &#x02212;0.24, 95% CI &#x02212;0.54 to 0.07, random) and individualised (BBI 0.50, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.88, unblinded); and final visit standardised (BBI &#x02212;0.56, 95% CI &#x02212;0.91 to &#x02212;0.20, opposite) and individualised (BBI 0.61, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.92, unblinded). The most commonly cited reasons for treatment guesses were &#x02018;presence of effects&#x02019; and &#x02018;lack of effects&#x02019; which consistently led to guesses of individualised and standardised CHM, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s3d2"><title>Security of randomisation and allocation procedures</title><p>Randomisation, allocation and CHM dispatch were conducted as intended, after comparing the randomisation list from our statistician against the randomisation log generated by the pharmacy and a sample of 89 (39.9%) prescriptions.</p></sec><sec id="s3d3"><title>Adherence</title><p>Both groups demonstrated a small increase in MMAS mean scores by the final visit (standardised MD 0.9&#x000b1;SD 2.2, 95% CI &#x02212;0.3 to 2.0; individualised MD 1.0&#x000b1;1.4, 95% CI 0.3 to 1.8) which was not statistically significant between group (p=0.86). A mean of 65% (SD 21.2) of CHMs had been administered, calculated from 21 participants (52.5%) for whom at least 75% of prescription data had been accounted for.</p></sec><sec id="s3d4"><title>Participant and CRF evaluation</title><p>Overall, participants reported positive experiences of the study. Thirty-two participants (80%) reported they would &#x02018;definitely&#x02019; or &#x02018;probably&#x02019; agree to take part in a study like this again. Three participants (7.5%) reported being &#x02018;unsure&#x02019; or &#x02018;probably not&#x02019;. There were five non-responses (12.5%).</p><p>Thematic analysis of participant feedback highlighted five broad themes: (1) appraisal of the CHM intervention, (2) managing practicalities of research participation, (3) empowerment and enablement, (4) management of care and (5) quality of care. Participants appraised CHM by improvements in symptoms of personal concern and not necessarily menstrual regularity. Participants raised concerns regarding safety and taste difficulties that reduced adherence and described feeling empowered through gaining further knowledge of PCOS and of CHM within this study. Aspects of care management were highly valued such as frequent monitoring and a holistic and personalised approach. Quality of care was appraised positively and seen to be delivered in an approachable, non-judgemental and knowledgeable manner, and with compassion and trust.</p><p>To evaluate study processes, we analysed thematically CRF data which highlighted three broad themes: (1) improving participant experience, (2) improving trial conduct and management, and (3) design considerations for future research. Highlighted areas for improvement suggested improved consideration for participant anxieties surrounding taking anthropometric and hirsutism assessments. Management of CHMs was considered complex, particularly surrounding CHM administration and weighing which could have been discussed in more detail with participants. Participants reported wishing to finding out personal and overall study progress and recommended the inclusion of biochemical investigations and ovarian status in future research. Limitations with hirsutism assessment were raised as it did neither consider rate of hair growth nor area of hair distribution. Future work could consider frequency of hair removal or time until hair regrowth which may reflect more accurately hirsutism status as appraised by participants.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>The findings of this study suggest that it is feasible to conduct a clinical study in the UK using an RCHM-approved dispensary, offering either individualised or standardised multiherb CHM treatment for 6&#x02005;months to women with PCOS-related oligomenorrhoea and amenorrhoea. Our results support the evaluation of oligomenorrhoea and amenorrhoea, but suggest that hirsutism could be considered as a primary outcome since this was a key concern for our participants according to our MYMOP1 and MYMOP2 ranking data. Individualised and standardised CHMs when prescribed by a registered CHM practitioner and administered for 6&#x02005;months appear to be safe, without harmful effects on either liver or kidney function, and with minimal side effects. Although these findings appear encouraging, they should be considered preliminary owing to the sample size and the feasibility nature of this study and our results relating to clinical effects and safety should be interpreted with these limitations in mind.</p><p>Our preliminary data support the use of either individualised or standardised CHM as there was no statistically significant difference between group in improvement of menstrual rate at 6&#x02005;months. However, we acknowledge that this feasibility study had a small sample size and we cannot rule out the possibility that a larger sample would provide greater power to detect a potentially important difference. Although we considered the retention rate of 72.5% acceptable, changing administration to once per day and to a tablet or capsule are likely to further improve participant retention. Finally, we were unsuccessful in recruiting CHM practitioners and would recommend that a future study provide financial reimbursement for practitioner time and to plan for better access to safety testing.</p><p>For this study, we were unable to include a control arm such as placebo, wait list or treatment as usual and our results should be interpreted with caution owing to factors that were not controlled for such as contextual effects and regression to the mean. We however successfully evaluated feasibility as planned and a significant strength of this study is that we collected data prospectively on standardised and individualised multiherb CHMs which were administered according to real-world practice and for 6&#x02005;months. Safety and adverse events data from our study appear to be consistent with the findings of previous CHM studies in the UK<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>
<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>
<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> which suggest that CHMs appear to be safe and overall well tolerated. Our study compared real-world CHM-prescribing approaches for a significant duration of time, whereas the majority of previous PCOS and CHM trials evaluate standardised CHMs for &#x0003c;6&#x02005;months.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>
<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> Although our safety data are encouraging and appears consistent with the findings from an Australian survey,<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> this was a small-scale study and larger studies with longer term follow-up remain warranted. Owing to financial constraints, we were unable to conduct biochemical tests and evaluate polycystic ovarian morphology as part of our outcome measures and we would strongly recommend including these in a main study to increase the rigour of the study design and to maximise relevance of such findings for clinicians and for the PCOS population. Future feasibility studies should consider including these PCOS-relevant medical investigations to increase scientific rigour.</p><p>We successfully recruited the target sample size and found an acceptable retention rate of 72.5%. This suggests strong interest from the PCOS population in the UK which is important since less than one-third of primary care trials are able to recruit within the specified timeframe<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> and high attrition rates of up to 53% are typically found in PCOS studies.<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>
<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> However, we recruited outside of primary care and participants were aware they would be randomised to one of two active CHM treatments. A question that remains unanswered is the recruitment and retention rate within a National Health Service (NHS) setting and the willingness of participants to be randomised to a placebo or wait-list control group. Furthermore, it is possible that we recruited a selective group since a significant proportion of our participants reported previously discontinuing conventional medicines due to side effects or lack of effects, and had prior use of CAM and of Chinese medicine. However, we argue that this could potentially reflect real-world prescribing strategies where women resistant to first-line treatments such as the contraceptive pill or insulin-sensitising agents could instead be offered as therapeutic alternatives such as CHMs, provided there was robust evidence for clinical effect and safety.</p><p>Although evaluating oligomenorrhoea and amenorrhoea would be an appropriate primary outcome measure for the main trial, this feasibility study has highlighted challenges in statistical and clinical interpretation of menstrual regularity. Insufficient menstrual data at baseline and at end of study meant it was not possible to use our predefined approach of assessing menstrual regularity and this was thus evaluated as a menstrual rate following other PCOS studies.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>
<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>
<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Although this enables our results to be more easily compared with the wider literature, we acknowledge this was a decision made post hoc. Furthermore, it is possible that our baseline menstrual diary data were subject to recall bias and which could be overcome by considering a run-in phase. As hirsutism ranked higher than menstrual irregularity as a key concern for participants in the MYMOP data, it is possible that evaluating hirsutism would be more relevant to patients with PCOS and which in turn could facilitate recruitment in a future study. This needs to be considered alongside shortcomings of hirsutism assessment we have already highlighted, suggesting that a subjective or quality of life measure may be more appropriate.</p><p>Robust evaluation of adherence and practitioner blinding is important in RCTs as a means of assessing internal validity. We found the process of collecting both self-reported and objective adherence data useful to triangulate findings and would recommend this for future trials. These data enabled us to conclude that a reduction in prescribed CHM dosage may be appropriate to improve participant acceptability and without compromising clinical effect on menstrual cyclicity. By close of study, our practitioner blinding results point to a &#x02018;standardised opposite and individualised unblinded&#x02019; scenario, suggesting that blinding was likely secure. This highlights a &#x02018;wishful thinking&#x02019; scenario that is consistent with other studies and suggests a high response bias, where the desire to believe that the more effective intervention&#x02014;in this case the individualised treatment&#x02014;was associated with a treatment response.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>
<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> This emphasises the importance of blinding caregivers and assessors in RCTs and in evaluating blinding as a key factor in internal validity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We have demonstrated that it is feasible to conduct a CHM trial for oligomenorrhoea and amenorrhoea in PCOS. Our preliminary findings suggest that individualised and standardised multiherb CHMs have similar safety profiles and clinical effects on menstrual regularity. This evaluation supports the use of menstrual regularity as a primary outcome measure for a main study which should include an appropriate control group such as placebo or treatment as usual.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors are grateful to George He and the Phoenix Medical team for CHM dispensing support and for discounted CHMs. The authors would like to thank all participants for their time and contribution to this study, without whom this work would not have been possible.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Twitter:</bold> Follow Lily Lai <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://twitter.com/lilylai">@lilylai</ext-link></p></fn><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> All authors have made important and impactful contributions to the present manuscript.
