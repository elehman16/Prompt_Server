The primary role of bacteria in the etiology of periodontal diseases is unequivocal. Treatments have been varied and numerous, yet traditional mechanical debridement to disrupt the subgingival flora and provide clean, smooth, and biologically compatible root surfaces is still the mainstay. In spite of the excellent results achieved, mechanical debridement alone has shown to leave behind a significant number of pathogenic microorganisms in relatively inaccessible areas.</p><p>A microbiological approach to periodontal therapy aims primarily at suppressing specific pathogenic bacteria and permitting a subsequent recolonization of a microbiota compatible with health.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] The various methods used to deliver antimicrobial agents include rinsing, irrigation, systemic administration, and local application using sustained and controlled delivery devices.</p><p>Systemic delivery enables the antimicrobial agent to reach all periodontal and oral sites. However, it achieves relatively low drug levels within the periodontal pocket and poses a risk of adverse reactions to nonoral body sites. Medicaments have also been delivered via mouth rinses and supragingival irrigation, but the depth of penetration of the medicaments via these means into the periodontal pocket is limited.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] Subgingival irrigation of antimicrobials has shown reasonably good results with high initial drug concentrations in pockets. However, drawbacks with irrigation systems are a small drug reservoir and exponential kinetics, which tend to shorten the period of effective drug concentration. In addition, oral irrigation may not facilitate the penetration of the drug to the deepest areas of the pocket and self-irrigation may be limited by poor patient compliance.</p><p>Local antimicrobial therapy in periodontitis involves direct placement of an antimicrobial agent into diseased subgingival sites, bypassing other oral and nonoral body sites. The concept of controlled release local delivery of therapeutic antimicrobial agents was championed and developed into a viable concept primarily by Dr. Max Goodson, whose first delivery device involved hollow fibers of cellulose acetate filled with tetracycline.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] The initial reports using locally delivered tetracycline were promising, hence other antibiotics in several different types of vehicles were also investigated to develop sustained release delivery systems for periodontal treatment.</p><p>By means of controlled local delivery from within the periodontal pocket, a single administration of a small amount (milligrams) of the antibacterial agent required can maintain therapeutic concentrations within the gingival crevicular fluid for a longer period of time than any other mode of delivery. The antimicrobial agents used have been incorporated into gels, pastes, films, strips, polymers, and fibers as vehicles for local controlled drug release into the periodontal pockets.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>]</p><p>This study was done in an attempt to evaluate the benefits of the adjunctive use of doxycycline controlled release gel versus doxycycline controlled release implant in the management of periodontal pockets by estimating the drug concentration in the gingival crevicular fluid and saliva and also assessing their clinical effects over a period of 90 days.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-2"><title>AIMS AND OBJECTIVES</title><p>This study was designed to assess the efficacy of locally made doxycycline gel versus locally made doxycycline implant as biodegradable controlled local delivery systems, used as an adjunct to scaling and root planing by evaluating the following criteria:</p><p>

The dispersion was then sonicated to make it uniform throughout, poured in a glass mould lined with aluminium foil, and allowed to dry. The dried film was then cut into 0.5 cm &#x000d7; 0.5 cm films.</p><sec id="sec3-1"><title>Preparation of the in situ gel</title><p>Ingredients: Doxycycline hyclate 25 mg, propylene glycol 0.25 g, poly(lactide-co-glycolide)/PLGA 0.50 g, triacetin 4.25 g.</p><p>Procedure: PLGA was placed in a glass vial, triacetin added, heated at 60&#x000b0; C, and agitated using a mechanical shaker overnight to obtain a clear solution. Doxycycline, dissolved in propylene glycol, was then added to the polymer solution and sonicated for 30 seconds to get a uniform dispersion. When PLGA solution comes into contact with the <italic>in vivo</italic> aqueous environment, it transforms to a solid matrix that releases the loaded drug for a prolonged period of time.</p><p>(Materials used in the preparation of both gel and implant are approved by the US FDA for biomedical applications and approved by the institution board for human trials.)</p></sec><sec id="sec3-2"><title>In vivo study</title><p>Thirty patients with localized periodontal pockets measuring &#x02265;5 mm and without any systemic disorders were selected from among the patients visiting the Department of Periodontics, College of Dental Surgery, Manipal. Care was taken to see that the selected patients did not have a history of antibiotic therapy in the past 6 months. All patients participating in this study were informed of the details of the study and their consent was taken before starting the study.</p><p>Selected patients received a full mouth supragingival and subgingival scaling, root planing, and polishing. Oral hygiene instructions were given. Patients were then recalled after 2 weeks for reevaluation of the periodontal status. Patients who showed a reduction in pocket depth owing to gingival shrinkage were eliminated and only those 30 patients who had pocket depths &#x02265;5 mm were selected for the final study. These 30 patients (14 males and 16 females) were then randomly divided into three groups, with 10 patients per group. The first group received the doxycycline gel, the second group the doxycycline implant, and the third group received only scaling and root planing (the control group).

</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec1-5"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>A number of local or targeted delivery systems have been developed for administering antimicrobial agents to the subgingival environment. Two different forms of biodegradable controlled release drug delivery systems&#x02014;gels and implants&#x02014;were evaluated in this study after placement in periodontal pockets. Doxycycline, a semisynthetic tetracycline, was chosen due to its known efficacy against putative periodontal pathogens and potential clinical efficacy in modulating clinical signs of periodontitis in humans (Polson <italic>et al</italic>)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] and fewer side effects when compared with tetracycline.</p><p>In this study, the mean GCF concentration of doxycycline ranged from 5.8650 &#x003bc;g/&#x003bc;l 1 hour after gel placement to 2.4385 &#x003bc;g/&#x003bc;l at the end of 60 days, while that of the implant ranged from 3.2244 &#x003bc;g/&#x003bc;l 1 hour after implant insertion to 2.2990 &#x003bc;g/&#x003bc;l on the 60<sup>th</sup> day. The mean salivary concentrations ranged from 0.8177 &#x003bc;g/&#x003bc;l at the end of 1 hour to 0.9143 &#x003bc;g/&#x003bc;l at the end of 60 days for the gel and from 0.7853 &#x003bc;g/&#x003bc;l at 1 hour to 0.6805 &#x003bc;g/&#x003bc;l at 60 days for the implant. The concentration of doxycycline released from the gel was significantly greater than from the implant in the GCF at 1 hour, 10 days, and 30 days and in the saliva at 10 days and 30 days. The initial higher drug release from the gel is attributed to the rapid release of drug from the fluid gel before its solidification within the periodontal pocket.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] Stoller <italic>et al</italic>,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] reported that the release of doxycycline hyclate (from a biodegradable gel) in the GCF peaked 2 hours after placement with levels between 1473 &#x003bc;g/ml and 1986 &#x003bc;g/ml. The levels remained consistently above 1000 &#x003bc;g/ml till 18<sup>th</sup> hour and then declined till the 7<sup>th</sup> day. In this study, the GCF and salivary doxycycline concentrations were well above the required minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) (0.1&#x02013;2.0 &#x003bc;g/ml)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] even on the 60<sup>th</sup> day, to have an antibacterial effect.</p><p>Both gel and implant groups showed statistically significant reductions in plaque scores, gingival inflammation, and probing depth and gain in attachment levels from baseline to the 90<sup>th</sup> day. The control group also showed improvement in all clinical parameters; however, only reduction in probing depth and gain in attachment level were clinically significant. Polson <italic>et al</italic>,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] reported doxycycline hyclate delivered in a biodegradable delivery system to be an effective means of reducing the clinical signs of adult periodontitis. Garrett <italic>et al</italic>,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] Wennstrom <italic>et al</italic>,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] and Eickholz <italic>et al</italic>,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] in separate studies, compared the clinical results obtained following only scaling and root planing with locally delivered doxycycline. They concluded that subgingival doxycycline is a useful adjunct to conventional mechanical therapy in the nonsurgical management of chronic periodontitis.</p><p>Both the gel and implant were found to be useful drug delivery systems in the treatment of localized periodontitis. No difference was found between the gel and implant systems as far as improvement in clinical parameters was concerned. The possible advantage of a gel is its syringeability and therefore ease of placement (Needleman).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] Being more fluid, the gel is able to adjust to the shape and size of the pocket.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] A gel, however, is limited by rapid drug release as the drug is more free to diffuse out (Needleman).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] In this study, drug concentrations were maintained above the MIC for the entire 60 days in the gel group in spite of an initial rapid drug release. The implant on the other hand is rigid and comes in a standard size. To ensure that 1 mg of drug is delivered to the diseased site, the entire implant has to be placed within the periodontal pocket. A gel may be easily placed in tortuous or narrow pockets or relatively inaccessible areas as it can be directly syringed into these areas, whereupon it will solidify and release the drug. Implants owing to their rigidity may be required to be placed in larger or compound pockets.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-6"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>The following conclusions may be drawn from the study:</p><p>
