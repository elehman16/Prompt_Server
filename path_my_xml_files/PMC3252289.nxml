Patients suffer from pain and functional impairment in activities of daily life which are associated with a decrease in quality of life. Conservative therapeutic interventions such as physical exercises aim at reducing pain and increasing function and health-related quality of life. However, there is only silver level evidence for efficacy of land-based physical exercise in the treatment of hip OA. The purpose of this randomized controlled trial is to determine whether the specific 12-week exercise regime "Hip School" can decrease bodily pain and improve physical function and life quality in subjects with hip osteoarthritis.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>217 participants with hip OA, confirmed using the clinical score of the American College of Rheumatology, are recruited from the community and randomly allocated to one of the following groups: (1) exercise regime "Hip School", n = 70; (2) Non-intervention control group, n = 70; (3) "Sham" ultrasound group, n = 70; (4) Ultrasound group, n = 7. The exercise regime combines group exercises (1/week, 60-90') and home-based exercises (2/week, 30-40'). Sham ultrasound and ultrasound are given once a week, 15'. Measures are taken directly prior to (M1) and after (M2) the 12-week intervention period. Two follow-ups are conducted by phone 16 and 40 weeks after the intervention period. The primary outcome measure is the change in the subscale <italic>bodily pain </italic>of the SF36 from M1 to M2. Secondary outcomes comprise the WOMAC score, SF36, isometric strength of hip muscles, spatial-temporal and discrete measures derived from clinical gait analysis, and the length of the centre of force path in different standing tasks.

In Germany, approximately five million people suffer from osteoarthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. It is the most prevalent musculoskeletal disease and its impact on morbidity and mortality in industrialized countries is almost as large as the impact of respiratory or digestive disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The knee and hip joints are the most commonly affected joints of this disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Data from a large cohort-study reveal hip symptoms in 36% of an American population aged 45 and older. 28% of this population had radiographic, and 10% had symptomatic hip OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Prevalence for symptomatic hip OA increases in older individuals and women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. According to demographic estimates, more than 20% of the population will be older than 65 years in 2040 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], and the impact of OA will further increase. Patients suffer from pain and functional impairment in activities of daily life such as walking or climbing stairs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Strength deficits and gait disturbances like gait asymmetries and reduced walking speed are frequent findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Bodily pain and deficits in physical functioning are associated with a decrease of life quality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>Joint replacement is the treatment strategy in the final stages of hip or knee OA. In earlier stages, conservative therapeutic interventions are important to reduce pain and increase function and health-related quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In this respect, physical therapy and physical exercise programs are relevant and important therapeutic options. Here, treatments during which the patient is active are preferable to passive therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Physical exercises in particular are non-hazardous in terms of side-effects and can have positive effects on life quality, management of everyday life and physical functioning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Exercises can further decrease pain and their efficacy was shown to be comparable to the efficacy of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). In addition, they do not have expected adverse reactions in comparison to the long term use of NSAIDs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Evidence for effectiveness of exercises in the treatment of lower limb osteoarthritis</title><p>Platinum/1a level of evidence is given for the efficacy of joint related exercise programs with respect to pain reduction and increase of function in subjects with knee OA. It applies to analyses including data of aquatic and land-based exercises, as well as for land-based exercises only [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. According to the EULAR evidence based recommendations for the management of hip osteoarthritis published in 2004, data on exercise interventions for hip OA are required to determine the benefit of treatments at each key site of OA, as there may be true treatment differences for OA according to the site affected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. More recently, meta-analyses have been published focusing explicitly on the effects of exercise on hip osteoarthritis. Combined data of aquatic and land-based exercises for hip OA demonstrate evidence (1a) for the reduction in pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. However, there is only silver-level evidence for the efficacy of land-based physical exercise to reduce pain and to improve function in the treatment of hip OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. The aforementioned review summarizes the effects of only five randomized controlled trials (RCTs) which were included into the meta-analysis. Only one of these studies explicitly focused on patients with hip osteoarthritis. The authors conclude that the limited number and small sample size of the included RCTs restricts the confidence that can be attributed to the presented results. Therefore, adequately powered RCTs evaluating exercise programs specifically designed for people with symptomatic hip OA need to be conducted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><p>Aside from a lack of large RCTs studies on subjects with hip OA, there is not much known about how an optimised training program should be designed and what kind of training would be the most efficient for treating hip and knee OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Hip School</title><p>The group exercise program "Hip School" was established in 1996 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Since then, more than 20 therapy groups have been organized in the region allowing many patients with hip osteoarthritis access to a supervised training program. Several studies were conducted previously to evaluate the efficacy of the Hip School [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. However, its efficacy has not yet been demonstrated in a randomised controlled trial using generally accepted measures. This lack of evidence is being addressed by the clinical trial described in this study protocol. The protocol is based on (a) previous pilot studies investigating the reliability, validity, and feasibility of the methods that will now be used to quantify efficacy outcomes in subjects with hip osteoarthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], and (b) an interventional study used to quantify efficacy and feasibility of an additional home-based exercise program in combination with the aforementioned therapy regime [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Study purpose</title><p>The primary aim of this study is to determine whether a 12-week intervention program comprising group and home-based exercises decreases bodily pain in subjects with hip osteoarthritis in comparison to a non-treated control group. Efficacy is quantified by the subscale <italic>bodily pain </italic>of the SF36. The secondary aim is to determine whether this exercise regime can improve function, health-related quality of life, strength of hip surrounding muscles, postural control in bi-pedaled, tandem-, and single leg stance, joint function, and gait parameters in comparison to a non-treated control group, an attention control group (sham ultrasound), and an ultrasound group. Ultrasound therapy is only investigated in an explorative manner. Follow-up data are recorded to evaluate the sustainability of the interventional programs over another 40 weeks.</p><p>It is hypothesized that a 12-week intervention program will (1) decrease pain, and (2) improve physical function in comparison to a non-treated control. It is further hypothesized that (3) the efficacy of the exercise regime is superior to the efficacy of an intervention solely aiming for attention control, and (4) that effects are long-acting.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><sec><title>Design</title><p>This is a randomized, controlled trial, single-blinded for participants for two of the four treatment options (sham ultrasound and ultrasound) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Recruited patients undergo telephone screening followed by a clinical examination by a medical doctor to ensure eligibility. Eligible participants then undergo outcome assessment using the complete test battery prior to intervention, and will subsequently be randomized to one of the four groups. A ratio of 10:10:10:1 will be used for randomization into Hip School (HS), no intervention group (CO), sham ultrasound group (SUS), and ultrasound group (US). During the 12 week intervention period, monthly logbooks for physical exercises and pain have to be completed by all subjects. The complete test battery is repeated after the 12 week interventional period. Questionnaires (WOMAC, SF36) and log books are accessed via telephone assessment 16 and 40 weeks after the retest.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Trial protocol</bold>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2474-12-270-1"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Randomization process and allocation concealment</title><p>Randomization is stratified by gender due to its possible influence on efficacy of strengthening exercises [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Since not all subjects can be measured and treated simultaneously, the study is divided into four identical interventional periods (sequence 1-4), and the mentioned allocation procedure is performed in permuted blocks of 50-60 subjects each. The randomization sequence is generated electronically prior to each interventional period. Participants draw a lot with a randomization number at the beginning of baseline assessment. This process is double-blinded (participant and investigator). At the end of the baseline assessment, a study nurse compares the randomization number of the lot with the randomization list displaying information on treatment allocation. Group allocation is then documented on an extra sheet of the case report form. The case report form is filed after baseline assessment. The assignment process as described prevents foreknowledge of treatment assignment.</p></sec><sec><title>Blinding</title><p>Treatment allocation to ultrasound and sham-ultrasound is blinded to the subject. Blinding of the investigator is not possible as sham-ultrasound is applied according to the normal routine without turning on the power.</p><p>Day and Altman suggest blinding assessment by using non-involved assessors to record outcome variables [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. However this is not feasible in the context of the given study. To allow readers to judge possible information bias, assessment routine and blinding are stated explicitly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Blinding is impossible as treatment exposure can be discovered by interviewing the study participants (except the differentiation between US and SUS, which is kept single-blinded until the end of the study). Furthermore, independent assessors are not available, as quantification of outcomes needs specific know-how and man-power of our institution is limited. Moreover, instrumented gait analysis and assessment of postural control using pressure mats are relatively objective measures with limited possibility of exerting external influence. Strength measures may be more susceptible to external influences, as motivation is an important factor for maximum strength development. To minimize potential influence of the assessors, instructions are standardized and always given by the same investigator. SF36 and WOMAC are self-administered psychometric instruments. Subjects are introduced to the questionnaires at the beginning of the baseline assessment before treatment allocation is done. Subjects may contact the study nurse in case of questions. However, there is no assessor recording the responses of the subjects to the questionnaires and therefore no need for blinding.</p></sec><sec><title>Participants</title><p>217 men and women aged between 18 and 85 years are recruited via regional press, flyers in medical and physiotherapeutic practices, the outpatient clinic of the Department of Sports Medicine, and personal communication.

Group size is restricted to a maximum of 15 participants. Elastic rubber bands, stability trainers (pads), exercise balls and exercise mats are used as training devices. Group and home training sessions include hip specific elements of motor learning and mobilization, strength training and exercises to improve postural control, as specified below. Group sessions further include education related to exercises, such as information on anatomical basics and training modalities. The sessions enhance social contacts by having group-based introductions and feedbacks before and after the exercises, and by enforcing partner and group exercises.

After two static trials, participants continuously walk back and forth on an eleven meter walk-way until at least seven valid trials for each side and condition are captured. For the barefoot condition, the walk-way is covered with an EVA-foam (shore 80) to allow a comfortable and natural walking pattern. Kinematic and spatial-temporal data are collected using a Vicon motion analysis system with six cameras (ViconPeak, MCAM M1, 120 Hz, Oxford, UK). Data are analysed with the lower body model of the conventional gait model Plug-in-Gait (Vicon Polygon, Oxford Metrics Ltd., Oxford, UK). Markers are placed on the superior and posterior iliac spines, lateral thigh, and lateral epicondyle of the knee, lateral shank, lateral malleolus, calcaneus, and second metatarsal head. Additional markers are placed on the toe or toe cap, respectively, to ease the detection of toe off.</p><p>Outcome measures include the following spatial-temporal variables: stride length, step length, step width, walking velocity, cadence, single and double support time. Other variables of interest include time histories, maximum and minimum joint angles, and ranges of motion of the sagittal plane for pelvis, hip, knee, and ankle joint, as well as pelvic drop and hip adduction and abduction in the frontal plane. Outcome measures of five trials for each limb and condition (barefoot and shod) are extracted and averaged with a customized Matlab routine (Mathworks Inc., Natick, Massachusetts, USA).</p></sec><sec><title>Functional tests</title><p>Pelvic obliquity, passive ranges of motion of the hip, knee and ankle joint and muscular flexibility of the iliopsoas muscle, rectus femoris muscle and the hamstrings are examined by a physiotherapist.</p></sec><sec><title>Isometric strength measures</title><p>The Isomed 2000 (D&#x00026;R GmbH, Hernau, Germany) isokinetic dynamometer is used to measure isometric peak torque for hip abduction (HAB), hip adduction (HAD), hip flexion (HF) and hip extension (HE). The feasibility and reliability of the test protocol was evaluated in a previous study. It was shown, that HAD and HE are prone to larger measurement errors. This can be explained by a hindered fixation, as the pelvis is pried upwards when the leg pushes downwards [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. For this reason, tests are accompanied by two investigators to ensure proper fixation and to decrease the time necessary per measurement and ensuring a high level of standardization with respect to the test procedure. While one investigator operates the device and give standardized instructions to each subject, another investigator manually stabilize the subject's pelvis during all measurements of HAD and HE, where the pelvis tends to become instable. This investigator further monitors the subjects during the measurements for signs of pain or muscle cramps.</p><p>Test procedure: Subjects accomplish a five minute warm-up on a bicycle ergometer (50-100 Watt) followed by some stretching exercises. Subsequently, the randomly selected starting leg is allotted and subjects remove their shoes. Prior to the test, a knee orthosis is attached to the tested leg. For HAB and HAD, the orthosis is set at 90&#x000b0; at the knee. For HF and HE, the orthosis is set at 0&#x000b0;. The orthosis is necessary to decrease measurement artifacts related to oscillations and resulting moments of inertia of the shank and foot. All test modes are performed on each leg separately. Test mode and sequence, subject positioning, joint angle position and annotations for fixation are given in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>. Maximal axis-joint alignment is insured before subjects are fixed to the surface and dynamometer. Each trial is initialised by a sub-maximum test trial to allow participants to get used to the work movement and measurement procedure. Participants are then asked to contract their muscles to the maximum three times in a given time frame of 40 seconds against the fixed lever arm of the dynamometer. Each test trial is followed by a break of 30 seconds. After all strength tests, a physiotherapist performs some traction and stretching exercises to allow relaxation of joints and muscles of the participants.</p><table-wrap id="T4" position="float"><label>Table 4</label><caption><p>Test modalities for isometric strength measures.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left">Test mode and sequence</th><th align="left">Position and fixation</th><th align="left">Joint angle</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><bold>1.

Responsiveness of the subscale is comparable to the pain scale of the disease specific WOMAC in patients with osteoarthritis undergoing a rehabilitation intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. The SF36 is recommended as a generic instrument for recording relevant domains in osteoarthritis of the lower limb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. It is the most widely used generic health instrument [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>] and allows comparison of disease states within and between different disorders.</p><p>Sample size calculation is based on clinically relevant changes: An effect smaller than the minimum clinical important difference (MCID) may be measureable although patients will be unable to notice it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. MCID was derived from literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>], basic values and statistical spread of the measure for the given population were derived from a pilot study of our own research group on subjects with hip osteoarthritis. According to the mentioned presumptions, a sample size of n = 60 in each group will have 80% power to detect a clinically relevant difference in bodily pain for HS in comparison to CO using a two group t-test with a 0.05 two-side significance level. A failure rate of 15-20% is approximated, thus final sample size is set at n = 70 for each group, except US with n = 7. This is only an explorative intervention. Sample size was calculated using G*Power Version 3.0.10 (Franz Faul, Universitaet Kiel, Germany).</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data will be analyzed on an intention-to-treat principle using all randomized participants. Missing data will be filled in by carrying the last score forward. A per protocol analysis will also be conducted as a subordinate type of analysis. Demographic characteristics, joint and muscle function, and logbooks will be displayed with descriptive statistics. Multivariate statistics will be used (factors: group &#x000d7; time) for outcomes measured on a continuous scale. For strength measures, baseline levels will be included as covariates.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.
