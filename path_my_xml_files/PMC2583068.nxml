Since rates of infection due to methicillin-resistant <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> (MRSA) infection are increasing and treatment outcomes for bacteraemia caused by MRSA are generally worse than those observed with methicillin-susceptible <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> bacteraemia, clinical characteristics and treatment results in the trial&#x02019;s pre-specified subset of patients with MRSA were analysed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients receiving daptomycin were compared with those receiving vancomycin plus low-dose gentamicin. Success was defined as clinical improvement with clearance of bacteraemia among patients who completed adequate therapy, received no potentially effective non-study antibiotics and had negative blood cultures 6 weeks after end of therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Twenty of the 45 (44.4%) daptomycin patients and 14 of the 43 (32.6%) vancomycin/gentamicin patients were successfully treated (difference 11.9%; confidence interval &#x02212;8.3 to 32.1). Success rates for daptomycin versus vancomycin/gentamicin were 45% versus 27% in complicated bacteraemia, 60% versus 45% in uncomplicated bacteraemia and 50% versus 50% in right-sided MRSA endocarditis. Cure rates in patients with septic emboli and in patients who received pre-enrolment vancomycin were similar between treatment groups. However, in both treatment groups, success rates were lower in the elderly (&#x02265;75 years). Persisting or relapsing bacteraemia occurred in 27% of daptomycin and 21% of vancomycin/gentamicin patients; among these patients, MICs of &#x02265;2 mg/L occurred in five daptomycin and four vancomycin/gentamicin patients.

For reasons that may relate to the bacterial strain, the patient population or the antimicrobials used for therapy, the duration of bacteraemia in MRSA bloodstream infections and endocarditis is, on average, longer than that associated with MSSA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKN372C1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKN372C8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKN372C9">9</xref></sup></p><p>While the morbidity and mortality associated with both MSSA and MRSA bacteraemia and endocarditis are notable, the rates of complicated disease and death among individuals infected with MRSA are higher, even after controlling for the increased numbers of co-morbidities in the MRSA group.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKN372C10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKN372C11">11</xref></sup> This phenomenon was also observed among patients participating in the recent randomized trial of daptomycin versus standard therapy for these conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKN372C8">8</xref></sup> Whether lower treatment success rates are due to the microorganism or the antimicrobials used to treat the infection remains unknown.

The availability of other antimicrobial agents with activity against MRSA provides an opportunity to examine alternative regimens. The aim of the study was to compare the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with MRSA bacteraemia or endocarditis treated with daptomycin with those of patients treated with vancomycin and short-course gentamicin.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Design overview</title><p>Patients participated in this open-label, multicentre, international, randomized trial between August 2002 and March 2005. The trial is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00093067). The parent study was a non-inferiority trial to assess the efficacy and safety of daptomycin compared with standard therapy (either an antistaphylococcal penicillin or vancomycin, with initial short-course gentamicin) for MSSA and MRSA bacteraemia and endocarditis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKN372C8">8</xref></sup> Patients were randomized by a computerized central randomization schedule to either daptomycin or standard therapy in a 1:1 ratio. The primary outcome was the clinical success rate at the test of cure visit 42 days after completion of therapy. The null hypothesis was that the treatments differed by at least 20%. The central database of this trial was used to perform a detailed analysis of the pre-specified subset of patients with MRSA bacteraemia or endocarditis.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Setting and participants</title><p>The protocol, approved by the Institutional Review Board at each site, was consistent with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. To improve comparability among patients and to accommodate the guidelines for a registrational trial, some patients were excluded from randomization into the trial. Eligible patients were &#x02265;18 years of age with one or more blood cultures growing <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> within 2 calendar days prior to randomization. Patients whose creatinine clearance was &#x0003c;30 mL/min and those with known osteomyelitis, polymicrobial bacteraemia or pneumonia were ineligible for participation. Prior receipt of an antibiotic active against <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> was not an exclusion criterion. Patients with prosthetic valves were ineligible to participate, as were those who had intravascular foreign material at the time a positive blood culture was drawn (unless the investigator intended to have the material removed within 4 days after the first dose of study medication). All patients or their authorized representatives provided written informed consent.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Interventions: MRSA subset</title><p>Participants with MRSA bacteraemia or endocarditis were to receive either daptomycin 6 mg/kg iv every 24 h or standard therapy (vancomycin 1 g iv every 12 h with gentamicin 1 mg/kg iv every 8 h for the first 4 days of treatment).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKN372C16">16</xref></sup> Vancomycin and gentamicin doses were adjusted by investigators. Blood cultures were performed daily until they were negative, at the end of therapy and 42 days after completion of therapy (test of cure). Haematological parameters, coagulation tests, creatine phosphokinase levels and chemistry profiles were monitored during therapy and at the test of cure visit.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Definitions and outcomes</title><p>The investigators established an initial diagnosis based on the modified Duke criteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKN372C17">17</xref></sup> and determined the duration of therapy according to their working diagnosis. Complicated bacteraemia was present when MRSA was isolated from the blood on at least 2 days during the first 5 days of therapy, metastatic infection was found or the infection involved prostheses that were not removed within 4 days. These patients, who did not have endocarditis as defined by the Duke criteria, were to receive a minimum of 28 days of therapy. Uncomplicated bacteraemia was usually treated for 10&#x02013;14 days. If patients had definite or possible endocarditis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKN372C17">17</xref></sup> in the absence of predisposing abnormalities or active lesions of the aortic or mitral valves, the diagnosis of right-sided endocarditis was established. Left-sided endocarditis was defined as described in the modified Duke criteria.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKN372C17">17</xref></sup> The planned treatment course for patients with endocarditis was a minimum of 28 days.</p><p>The final diagnoses and outcomes were determined by an independent adjudication committee blinded to treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKN372C8">8</xref></sup> Conflicts of opinion between members of the committee were settled by discussion leading to consensus. Persisting or relapsing bacteraemia was investigator-defined, meaning that the investigator decided when to discontinue study medication in the case of ongoing or recurrent MRSA bacteraemia. The independent adjudication committee reviewed the role of persisting or relapsing MRSA bacteraemia in its analysis of outcomes.</p><p>The treatment outcome was categorized as success if an adequately treated patient was clinically cured or improved and blood cultures were negative 42 days after completion of therapy. The outcome was categorized as failure if a patient experienced persisting or relapsing MRSA infection, clinical failure or death for any reason. Failure was also defined by premature discontinuation of therapy because of a treatment-limiting adverse event, receipt of potentially effective non-study antibiotics or lack of blood culture at the 42 day post-therapy evaluation.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Differences between the patients in&#x000a0;the treatment groups were analysed using Fisher&#x02019;s exact test for categorical data (occurrence of adverse events and laboratory abnormalities) and analysis of covariance for continuous data (change from baseline serum creatinine). The 95% confidence interval (CI) for the difference in success rates (daptomycin minus vancomycin/gentamicin) was calculated based on the normal approximation to the binomial distribution. Survival curves were estimated using the Kaplan&#x02013;Meier methodology, and the treatment groups were compared using the Wilcoxon and log-rank tests.

Despite advances in diagnostic techniques and supportive care, patients with bacteraemia may develop suppurative complications and metastatic infections. In particular, the development of infective endocarditis is feared. Patients may become unstable so quickly that they become ineligible for otherwise life-saving surgical therapy. For many years, there have been no significant advances related to antimicrobial therapy for MRSA bacteraemia and endocarditis.</p><p>The current study, the only prospective and randomized trial comparing a newly available antibiotic with standard therapy for MRSA bacteraemia and endocarditis, provides a unique opportunity to address questions about the role of antimicrobials in treating these life-threatening infections. In this analysis of patients with MRSA bacteraemia and endocarditis, daptomycin performed as well as vancomycin/gentamicin, with fewer adverse events. Even among older patients, a group at higher risk of morbidity and mortality, daptomycin performed at least as well as standard therapy. Success rates among patients with septic pulmonary emboli were similar in both treatment arms. This result is consistent with experimental models demonstrating the efficacy of daptomycin for haematogenous <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> infections of the lung.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKN372C21">21</xref></sup></p><p>Because stringent criteria were used to define outcomes, the overall success rates in both treatment arms were low. Some of the reasons for failure, such as lack of adherence to protocol or discontinuation of therapy because of adverse events, were related to the study format. Several patients who were considered failures secondary to persisting or relapsing bacteraemia were found to have deep-seated foci of infection, including osteomyelitis, infected devices and abscesses that were not apparent at the time of study entry.</p><p>Prior vancomycin therapy did not appear to influence the treatment response, a potentially significant finding in view of <italic>in vitro</italic> studies suggesting potential increases in daptomycin and vancomycin MICs among <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> strains exposed to vancomycin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKN372C18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKN372C22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKN372C23">23</xref></sup> The lack of success of therapy for patients with left-sided endocarditis in both treatment arms is of concern but difficult to interpret in light of the small number of patients with endocarditis in this study. Several of these patients, as well as others with right-sided endocarditis or complicated bacteraemia, failed therapy because treating physicians determined that they were not candidates for surgical intervention. The fact that most of the patients in the vancomycin arm received concomitant short-course gentamicin therapy may have influenced the rate of nephrotoxicity in this group; an analysis is under review. Recent guidelines state that the addition of gentamicin for therapy of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> native valve endocarditis is optional.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKN372C16">16</xref></sup></p><p>The reasons that MRSA bacteraemia and endocarditis are so difficult to treat are multifaceted.

During the course of therapy, foci of infection such as abscess, osteomyelitis and indwelling devices became apparent in several cases; the type and timing of surgical intervention that might have impacted outcomes was not standardized. Persisting and relapsing bacteraemia was investigator-defined, and we were unable to make a statement with regard to the mean duration of bacteraemia because of the limitations in collecting daily blood cultures. The number of patients with left-sided endocarditis due to MRSA was small, and there were no treatment successes in this group.
