Current guidelines recommend triptans as first-line treatment for moderate-to-severe migraine attacks. Frovatriptan is a second-generation triptan with a longer terminal elimination half-life in blood than other triptans (~26 hours). Three double-blind, randomized crossover preference studies have been recently conducted, assessing efficacy and safety of frovatriptan versus rizatriptan, zolmitriptan, and almotriptan, respectively. Frovatriptan showed favorable tolerability and sustained effect, with a significantly lower rate of relapse over 48 hours versus the other triptans. These findings were confirmed in a series of analyses of patient subsets from the three studies, including patients with menstrually related and oral contraceptive-induced migraine, hypertension, obesity, weekend migraine, as well as patients with migraine with aura. In all patient subsets analyzed, lower headache recurrence rates were observed versus the comparator triptans, indicating a more sustained pain-relieving effect on migraine symptoms. A further randomized, double-blind study demonstrated that frovatriptan given in combination with the fast-acting cyclooxygenase inhibitor dexketoprofen provided improved migraine pain-free activity at 2 hours, and gave more sustained pain-free activity at 24 hours, versus frovatriptan alone. These benefits were observed both when the combination was administered early (&#x0003c;1 hour after symptom onset) or late (&#x0003e;1 hour after onset). Different pharmacokinetic, but synergistic, properties between frovatriptan and dexketoprofen may make the combination of these agents particularly effective in migraine treatment, with rapid onset of action and sustained effect over 48 hours. These benefits, together with potential cost-effectiveness advantages versus other triptans could drive selection of the most appropriate treatment for acute migraine attacks.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical"><title>Video abstract</title><p>

Frovatriptan 2.5 mg was compared with rizatriptan 10 mg in the first study, zolmitriptan 2.5 mg in the second study, and almotriptan 12.5 mg in the third study. After treating three episodes of migraine in not &#x0003e;3 months with the first treatment, the patient switched to the other treatment. Patients were encouraged to treat one to three attacks for a maximum period of 6 months. Patients with no migraine episodes during one of the two observation periods were excluded. The primary end point of the studies was the between-treatment comparison of the direction and strength of patient preference, assessed by a questionnaire at the end of the study, and measured on a scale from 0 (no preference) to 5 (strong preference). Secondary end points included numbers of pain-free at 2 hours, pain relief at 2 hours, pain-free at 24 hours, and recurrence of headache within 48 hours.

These results suggest that the long half-life of frovatriptan may ensure a low rate of headache recurrence in obese as well as normal-weight individuals, which may be important given that obesity is common among individuals with migraine.<xref rid="b22-dddt-10-3225" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> The results confirm that dose adjustment of frovatriptan is not required in obese patients and therefore implies a lower need of tablets to be taken to relieve pain.</p></sec><sec><title>Weekend migraine</title><p>Migraine often occurs during weekends. However, evidence regarding efficacy of triptans in weekend migraine is limited.<xref rid="b44-dddt-10-3225" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> A retrospective analysis was performed in patients enrolled in the three head-to-head studies who had migraine attacks on weekends as well as workdays.<xref rid="b23-dddt-10-3225" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> The average number of migraine attacks was greater (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001) during weekends (285&#x000b1;45 attacks) compared with workdays (256&#x000b1;37 attacks). The proportion pain-free at 2 hours did not significantly differ between weekend and workday attacks for either frovatriptan (26% versus 27%) or comparators (34% versus 32%). However, the relapse rate within 48 hours for weekend compared with workday attacks was significantly lower with frovatriptan, but not with comparators (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-dddt-10-3225">Table 2</xref>).</p><p>Therefore, among the different triptans, frovatriptan appears to offer the advantage of a lower risk of recurrence and more sustained antimigraine effect during weekend attacks.

Importantly, however, the longer duration of action of frovatriptan, which correlates with its pharmacokinetic profile, provides sustained efficacy and reduced relapse rate, compared with other triptans, offering a benefit to patients in the acute treatment of migraine. These results are consistent across a variety of patient profiles.</p><p>These benefits, together with potential advantages of cost-effectiveness versus other triptans, could drive selection of the most appropriate treatment for acute migraine attacks. In all cases, treatment should be tailored to the need of the individual patient.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Medical writing support was provided by Melanie More at Prime Medica Ltd (Knutsford, Cheshire, UK) during the preparation of this manuscript, funded by Menarini.
