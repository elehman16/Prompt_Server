The different procedures of physical rehabilitation have not been demonstrated to play a favourable role in this disorder. The aim of the present study was to compare functional outcomes in severe cases of Bell's palsy when treated by steroids alone or by steroids accompanied by Kabat physical rehabilitation. This prospective study included 94 subjects who showed sudden facial nerve (FN) palsy with House-Brackmann grade IV or V and who were divided into two groups on the basis of the therapeutic approach: one group (a) was treated by steroids, and the other (b) received steroids in combination with physical rehabilitation. Medical treatment consisted in administration of steroids at a dosage of 60 mg per day for 15 days; physical rehabilitative treatment consisted in proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation according to Kabat, and was administered to one of the two groups of subjects. Recovery rate, degree of recovery and time for recovery were compared between the two groups using the Mann-Whitney and univariate logistic regression statistical tests (Ward test). Kabat patients (group b) had about 20 times the odds of improving by three HB grades or more (OR = 17.73, 95% CI = 5.72 to 54.98, p &#x0003c; 0.001) than patients who did not receive physical treatment (group a). The mean speed of recovery in group b was the half of that recorded for group a (non-Kabat subjects). No difference was observed in the incidence of synkineses between the two groups. Steroid treatment appears to provide better and faster recovery in severe cases (HB IV and V) of BP when complemented with Kabat physical rehabilitation.</p></abstract><trans-abstract xml:lang="it"><title>RIASSUNTO</title><p>La terapia della paralisi di Bell, incentrata su farmaci steroidei e/o antivirali, pu&#x000f2; ancora far esitare nei soggetti affetti sequele disfiguranti per un recupero incompleto. Le diverse procedure riabilitative non si sono dimostrate al giorno d'oggi in grado di giocare un ruolo favorevole in questo senso. Scopo di questo lavoro &#x000e8; stato quello di mettere a confronto i risultati funzionali di pazienti affetti da forme severe di paralisi di Bell, quando trattati con solo cortisone con quelli nei quali al cortisone &#x000e8; stata affiancata una terapia riabilitativa secondo Kabat. Lo studio prospettico ha incluso 94 soggetti con paralisi di Bell di grado IV e V secondo House-Brackmann (HB) a loro volta suddivisi in due gruppi: (a) trattato con terapia steroidea; (b) trattato con terapia steroidea e riabilitazione Kabat. Il trattamento medico &#x000e8; consistito di 60 mg di prednisolone al giorno per 15 giorni; la terapia riabilitativa &#x000e8; consistita nel trattamento di facilitazione neuromuscolare propiocettiva secondo Kabat. Percentuale, grado e tempi di recupero sono stati comparati utilizzando l'analisi statistica Mann-Whitney e il test di regressione logistica multivariata (Ward test). I pazienti Kabat (gruppo b) hanno avuto 20 volte di pi&#x000f9; la possibilit&#x000e0; di migliorare di 3 o pi&#x000f9; gradi HB (OR = 17,73, 95% IC = 5,72 a 54,98, p &#x0003c; 0,001) rispetto a quelli di gruppo a. La velocit&#x000e0; media di recupero nel gruppo b &#x000e8; risultata la met&#x000e0; di quella registrata nel gruppo a. Nessuna differenza &#x000e8; stata invece riscontrata sull'incidenza di sincinesie. Si pu&#x000f2; dunque concludere che la terapia steroidea permette un migliore e pi&#x000f9; rapido recupero dei casi severi di paralisi di Bell, quando associata a terapia riabilitativa Kabat.</p></trans-abstract><kwd-group><title>KEY WORDS</title><kwd>Bell's palsy</kwd><kwd>Physical rehabilitation</kwd><kwd>Kabat</kwd><kwd>House-Brackmann grading system</kwd><kwd>Steroid treatment</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction" id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Bell's palsy (BP) is an acute, sudden unilateral peripheral paralysis of the facial nerve (FN) that accounts for almost 75% of all acute facial palsies (FP).

In all, FN palsy was graded according to the House- Brackmann (HB) system <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref>. From a total of 390 patients, only those staged HB IV or higher were taken into consideration. Pregnant women and individuals with involvement of other cranial nerves were also excluded from the study. Ninety-six patients, hence composing the study group, were enrolled: HB IV (66 subjects) and HB V (28 subjects).</p><p>Randomisation of these patients was performed by the personnel working at the ED that, on the basis of individual judgment on the FN severity, sent 66 BP patients home and 28 to our FN Center for consultation. In this way, two separate groups were identified:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p><italic>study group a,</italic> formed by 66 patients, aged 16-90 years (mean = 57.1), 30 females and 36 males, 58 with HB IV and 8 with HB V. All these subjects were sent home by the ED with medical steroid protocol treatment, eye drops for eye protection and paracetamol in case of pain;</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>study group b,</italic> formed by 28 patients, aged 32- 74 years (mean = 55.7), 13 males, 15 females, 10 with HB IV and 18 with HB V. All these patients were sent for consultations to our FN Centre by ED staff. At our Centre, standard facial movements (brow lift, gentle eye closure, forced eye closure, snarling, smiling and lip pucking) were documented in each patient by video-recording with a mobile phone, and reviewed by a senior ENT to assign the appropriate HB grade. The Kabat physical rehabilitation was started within 7 days from BP onset, and was associated for two weeks with medical treatment, consisting of daily prednisolone (2 mg/kg), for 10 days and tapered off within 2 weeks.</p></list-item></list><p><italic>Group b</italic> subjects were evaluated at our Centre twice a week, during the rehabilitation sessions and at the end of the cycle, defined with the maximum improvement of FN function that remained stable for a least 1 month of follow-up. Once a week from FP onset, <italic>group b</italic> patients were re-evaluated, so as to define the progression or eventual recovery in days via direct clinical observation.</p><p>At day 7 from FP onset, <italic>group a</italic> subjects received a telephone contact and were classified according to the capability of eye closure, so as to distinguish grade III or better from grade IV or worse. Next, they were asked to self-assess and report in a diary, from that day on, facial features such as:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>symmetry of the face at rest: if the right and left sides of the face appeared similar at rest (without any movement);</p></list-item><list-item><p>facial motion through different facial movements (brow lift, gentle eye closure, forced eye closure, snarling, smiling and lip picking).</p></list-item></list><p>Kabat rehabilitation consists in the facilitation of the voluntary response of an impaired muscle through the global pattern of an entire muscular section that undergoes resistance. This method appears to be extremely rational for facial muscles, since most of the face muscular fibers run diagonally, with easy irradiation to the upper facial region due to the cross-FN innervations. Three regional fulcra were taken into consideration: upper, intermediate and lower fulcrum. The first (forehead and eyes) is connected via a vertical axis to the intermediate one (nose), while the lower mimic-chewing-articulatory fulcrum lies along the horizontal axis. Hence, action on the upper fulcrum also involves the other two fulcra. The manipulation of these three fulcra is carried out by utilising both contralateral contractions and basic propioceptive stimulation, including stretching, maximal resistance, manual contact and verbal input. In the upper fulcrum, the activation of the frontal, corrugators and orbicularis muscles is carried out by their upwards or downwards traction, which is always in a vertical plane depending on the specific function that needs to be activated. In the intermediate fulcrum, activation of the common elevator muscle of the ala nasi and the upper lip is also carried out using traction movements, in this case contrary to the normal direction, following a vertical line. For the lower fulcrum, the maneuvers are carried out on the risorium and orbicularis oris muscles in a horizontal plane, and on the mental muscle in a vertical plane.</p><p>For statistical purposes, the time of recovery has been expressed in days. The time of recovery and the final HB degree of palsy were compared between groups.</p><sec id="S2a"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The dataset was cleaned before analysis with respect to inconsistent and missing values, duplicates, outliers, digit preference and normality of continuous variables. The non-parametric Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon (MWW) U test was used to verify the null hypothesis that the two study groups are the same against an alternative hypothesis, namely that one group would tend to have better recovery values than the other. Univariate logistic regression (Ward test) was used to compare all rehabilitated (group b) and non-rehabilitated (group a) patients for the final grade of improvement, degree of improvement (1-grade, 2 grades, 3 grades and 4-grades) and timing of recovery. The effect of treatment was evaluated by three different approaches, adjusted for age and gender: i) multiple linear regression to model the paired change of HB grade between before and after treatment (at the end of follow-up); ii) multiple logistic regression to model the chances of having a paired decrease in disease status by three HB grades or more, before and after treatment (at the end of follow-up); iii) multiple Cox proportional hazards regression for time of improvement (speed of recovery), with follow-up time in days (information about patient status was retrieved daily). Statistical assumptions underlying the tests were systematically checked.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="S3"><title>Results</title><p>Grade IV at baseline was recorded in 87.9% of group a and in 35.7% of group b.

Moreover, at the end of follow-up, in group b there was no case of one-grade improvement, while an improvement by four grades was found in 25.0% of subjects; in group a, one-grade improvement was observed in 16.7% of patients, and none showed a four-grade improvement (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table I</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table I.</label><caption><p>Sample description by categories of treatment strategy.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" border="0"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">

Although steroid treatment is considered the gold standard of medical therapy, the observation that a not insignificant number of BP subjects may retain some important sequelae has promoted the adoption of additional forms of treatment and several types of rehabilitative procedures have also been taken into consideration. Each rehabilitative procedure would theoretically work with specific targets and is tailored to the patient's need and time from FP onset. For instance, the exercises based on gross movements determine a massive and spread contraction of the muscular components of the face, but a high likelihood of synkineses may develop even in the presence of improvement in facial stiffness <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref>. Laser and biofeedback techniques are usually performed only when signs of recovery of face movements are observed <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref>
<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref>. Moreover, neuromuscular retraining therapy, which focuses on motor control of facial movements triggered by different feedback stimulation and which is particularly indicated to prevent or treat synkineses, is not advised before three months of paresis <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref>. Likewise, mime therapy, which consists of massage, relaxation, inhibition of synkinesis, and co-ordination and emotional expression exercises, has been proposed only at a late stage of paresis, with no reports on its potential role when applied at an early stage <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref>.</p><p>After having positively experienced the role of physical Kabat rehabilitation in the jatrogenic or post-surgical forms of FP, when applied at an early stage <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref>, it seemed reasonable to perform a study in order to assess whether this type of protocol, which involves an early approach to the affected patient, could also work in BP patients presenting with a HB grade IV or worse. In fact, to our knowledge, studies comparing the effect of physical treatment to that of exclusive steroid treatment in BP are scanty. In the present study, the composition of the study groups was not achieved by randomisation, but by the individual attitude of the ED staff to either send patients home or to our attention for consultation, although the former protocol mostly included less severe cases. In both instances, all patients received steroid treatment, while the Kabat rehabilitation was only performed on subjects that were sent and followed directly at our Clinic and that formed study <italic>group b</italic>.</p><p>In the present study, only the most severe cases, i.e. HB IV and V subjects, were taken into account for the final evaluation. Through this methodology, it was possible to have comparable patients in the study groups, as well as in HB IV or V subjects separately, for assessment of the primary outcomes of the study, i.e. recovery time, final HB grade and probability to achieve a 3-grade HB improvement.</p><p>Although <italic>group a</italic> (steroids only) patients were numerically greater than those of <italic>group b</italic>, this latter included only the most severe HB grades and therefore all were addressed to rehabilitative treatment. The use of such physical rehabilitation led to a faster recovery time in <italic>group b</italic>, nearly half of that recorded in <italic>group a</italic> subjects, while for HB IV subjects it was reduced by seven times less than in <italic>group a</italic>. After physical rehabilitation, the degree of improvement (grade reduction at the HB) at the time of definitive clinical outcome was significant in comparison to the final condition of patients treated only with steroids, since patients treated simultaneously with pharmacological and rehabilitative therapy recovered in a significant number to normality (HB I), while in most of the patients who received only steroids, the maximum recovery was HB II.</p><p>When considering HB IV only, the significance value of difference between rehabilitated and non-rehabilitated cases was ten times less than that observed in the entire group (HB IV and V); the same finding was observed in HB V, with less significance than HB IV, due to a marked intersection of values at the HB III level. This is why in the most severe subjects (HBV), there was a prevalence of recovery to HB III in non-rehabilitated cases and to HBI in rehabilitated subjects.</p><p>Moreover, group b patients recovered by three grades two times more frequently than those in <italic>group a</italic>, and in <italic>group b</italic> the degree decreased, i.e. improved, by one further point, in total and single grades, compared to <italic>group a</italic>. In <italic>group b</italic>, moreover, a 20 fold higher probability of improvement by three HB grades was seen, and the most severe cases had similar improvement only when rehabilitated.</p><p>Most of the severe (HB V), non-rehabilitated patients reached as maximum result of HB III, while similar cases when undergoing Kabat rehabilitation could even obtain a normal facial function (HB I).</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="S5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>It is possible to conclude that, when Kabat rehabilitation is associated with standard steroid treatment in the case of severe BP, affected subjects may be likely to have a faster and better recovery than those in whom only medical treatment is applied. It would therefore be worthwhile to always include this type of physical rehabilitation in patients with BP, especially in the most severe cases which may carry the risk of disfiguring facial sequelae.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R01"><label>1.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>De Diego-Sastre</surname><given-names>JI</given-names></name><name><surname>Prim-Espada</surname><given-names>MP</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Fern&#x000e0;ndez- Garc&#x000ec;a F.
