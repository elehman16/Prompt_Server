Based on animal and in vitro studies, resveratrol reverts these risk factors via stimulation of silent mating type information regulation 2 homolog 1 (SIRT1), but data in human subjects are scarce. The objective of this study was to examine the metabolic effects of high-dose resveratrol in obese human subjects. In a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, and parallel-group design, 24 obese but otherwise healthy men were randomly assigned to 4 weeks of resveratrol or placebo treatment. Extensive metabolic examinations including assessment of glucose turnover and insulin sensitivity (hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp) were performed before and after the treatment. Insulin sensitivity, the primary outcome measure, deteriorated insignificantly in both groups. Endogenous glucose production and the turnover and oxidation rates of glucose remained unchanged. Resveratrol supplementation also had no effect on blood pressure; resting energy expenditure; oxidation rates of lipid; ectopic or visceral fat content; or inflammatory and metabolic biomarkers. The lack of effect disagrees with persuasive data obtained from rodent models and raises doubt about the justification of resveratrol as a human nutritional supplement in metabolic disorders.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><p>Management of obesity and its complications is a major health issue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>).

We consider this trial important for several reasons. First, the high incidence of obesity and type 2 diabetes calls for novel preventive and therapeutic modalities. Second, substantial evidence from preclinical work suggests that resveratrol stimulates SIRT1 activity and suppresses inflammatory pathways in human adipose tissue in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>). Third, the compound is already widely available as an over-the-counter nutritional supplement with an array of alleged salutary effects. Fourth, resveratrol treatment may serve as a model to investigate potential biomarkers for CR and SIRT1 in human models.</p><p>Our primary outcome, insulin sensitivity, which was assessed by the hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp, was not significantly affected by resveratrol. The same was true for HOMA-IR, fasting glucose, and fasting insulin. Our negative findings are in conflict with the work by Timmers et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>), who demonstrated statistically significant improvements in HOMA-IR, suggesting a favorable effect on insulin sensitivity. However, the gold standard for the assessment of whole-body insulin sensitivity is the hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp technique used in our study. Furthermore, our inclusion of glucose tracer allowed for the determination of glucose turnover in the basal state and EGP during the clamp, all of which also failed to be affected by resveratrol. We also found no effects of resveratrol on either resting energy expenditure or rates of lipid oxidation.</p><p>When assessing blood pressure, we found a trend toward a moderate increase in 24-h blood pressure after resveratrol administration compared with placebo. Again, the differences were insignificant and in opposition to the findings by Timmers et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>), who recorded a robust decrease in both systolic and diastolic blood pressures, which were assessed by the mean of conventional clinical blood pressure triplicates. Furthermore, we examined the ectopic fat content in hepatic and muscle tissue by MR spectroscopy and, in contrast to Timmers et al., we recorded no effects of resveratrol. In preclinical settings, the finding of diminished hepatic fat induced by resveratrol is consistent, and the reason why we fail to reproduce the findings by Timmers et al. could relate to baseline differences. Because lipid content is expressed as a relative number relative to the water content, we cannot directly compare the data sets. In accordance with the ectopic fat content, we also failed to detect changes in adipose tissue assessed by MR imaging, which perhaps is less surprising considering the relatively short duration of treatment.</p><p>Consistent with the lack of physiological responses to high-dose resveratrol, we also did not find any alterations in gene expression of a panel of pivotal metabolic and inflammatory biomarkers. Nor were protein phosphorylation levels of AMPK and acetyl-CoA carboxylase or total acetylation status affected. As mentioned, our data disagree with the recently published work by Timmers et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>), who recorded significant effects using only one-tenth of our dose in a group of obese men. In comparison with the participants in the study by Timmers et al., ours were slightly younger (age 38.4 &#x000b1; 2.6 vs. 52.5 &#x000b1; 2.1 years) and more obese (BMI 34.2 &#x000b1; 0.7 vs. 31.59 &#x000b1; 0.7 kg/m<sup>2</sup>; fat 31.3 &#x000b1; 0.8 vs. 26.4 &#x000b1; 0.5%). To what degree age and extent of obesity may impact the effect of resveratrol in human subjects remains to be investigated. We have scrutinized our design to identify potential design-related problems to explain the lack of effect. We have demonstrated that the absorption of our resveratol formulation is comparable to the absorption of the compound used in the study by Timmers et al. Our study groups were well matched and of a reasonable sample size, the compliance was good, and we consider the duration of treatment sufficient. The difference in age between our two treatment groups was due to two outliers in the resveratrol group, aged 60 and 68 years. We have repeated all our analysis without these two outliers, which did not change the negative outcome (data not shown). Finally, the risk of a type 2 error due to low sample size should also be considered. In the study by Timmers et al., a sample size of 11 was sufficient to demonstrate effects in a cross-over design. Compared with that study, ours holds the potential advantage of a parallel design, which eliminates the risk of untoward seasonal changes and carry-over effects. A limitation of our study is the inability to directly demonstrate the presence of resveratrol and metabolites in plasma. However, we demonstrated the absorption and excretion of the investigational product by means of our pharmacokinetic pilot study and urinary metabolite measurements.</p><p>Based on solid preclinical evidence, it is likely that a certain degree of baseline metabolic abnormalities is a prerequisite to benefit from resveratrol treatment, and it could be speculated that our participants were &#x0201c;too healthy.&#x0201d; However, both HOMA and M values at baseline may indicate mild insulin resistance in our cohort: a HOMA value of 2.77 previously has been defined as the threshold for insulin resistance in metabolically healthy subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>). Moreover, in a group of lean but slightly younger men (BMI, 24.6 &#x000b1; 3.2 kg/m<sup>2</sup>; age 23.0 &#x000b1; 2.0 years) clamped at an identical insulin dose and with the same procedures as those used in our laboratory, we recorded an M value of 5.8 mg/kg/min after 3 h (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>) compared with 2.5 mg/kg/min in the current study, which suggests a &#x02248;60% reduction in insulin sensitivity in our participants. Nonetheless, in future studies, and before making any definitive conclusions, the therapeutic potential of resveratrol should be tested in patients with more pronounced morbidity such as type 2 diabetes, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and hypertension.</p><p>Little is known about the pharmacodynamic properties of resveratrol. Even though the preclinical evidence is quite substantial, basic mechanisms of action are not elucidated or agreed upon. SIRT1 seems to be a pivotal mediator of the metabolic effects of resveratrol, but the up- and downstream mechanisms are not fully understood. One of the main questions pending is whether the effects depend on AMPK and, if so, whether AMPK activation is up- or downstream of SIRT1. Regardless of our inability to demonstrate AMPK activation, resveratrol may have potential targets in addition to AMPK and SIRT1. Emerging evidence suggests certain pathways are affected differently at different dose levels, with subsequent effects on physiological outcomes, both in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>) and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). In fact, to our knowledge, the latter work is the first to report an inverse dose-response relationship in vivo; more pronounced effects apparently are observed at lower doses. Even though an inverted or J-shaped dose-response relationship seems to be an unlikely explanation for our results, this remains a possibility. Future studies should focus on dose-response relationships and preferably also compare the impact of treatment duration, including potential acute effects of resveratrol. It also remains to be reported whether alternative small-molecule activators of SIRT1 (STACs) may be more effective compared with resveratrol in clinical settings. Regardless of our findings, the scientific field of sirtuin biology remains an area of great interest.</p></sec>
