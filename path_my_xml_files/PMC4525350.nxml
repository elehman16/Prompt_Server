The intervention group received 3 ml of 0.9% normal saline sterilized before and after each intravenous drug or every 12 h. However, in the control group, the intravenous drugs were given as routine and saline lock was not used. The evaluation of intravenous catheter regarding the incidence of phlebitis and its degrees using Jackson's Visual Infusion Phlebitis Scale was performed 6 times within 72 h (every 12 h).

About 150 million peripheral venous catheters are used annually in America.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] However, one should not forget that like any other invasive procedure, it has side effects. One of the most common complications associated with intravenous therapy is phlebitis.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Its prevalence in the UK was reported to be from 20 to 80%[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and in Iran as 69%.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Based on the Nursing Society of Intravenous Fluid, the accepted rate of phlebitis for each population is 5% or less.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>In order to detect and identify the symptoms of phlebitis and determine its degrees, the Infusion Nursing Society suggested Jackson's Visual Infusion Phlebitis (VIP) Scale.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] In this scale, the severity of phlebitis with regard to symptoms such as redness, pain, swelling, fever, edema, forming a tight intravenous rope, and fever is graded from 1 to 5, and it is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>.

Despite the many options that exist in the treatment and prevention of phlebitis, providing a suitable solution to prevent and reduce the incidence of this complication remains challenging. Given the high prevalence of phlebitis, the need for developing new methods of treatment and prevention can still be sensed.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Many studies have been conducted to evaluate and compare the effects of saline lock (3 ml of 0.9% normal saline injection intermittently into the catheter) and heparin lock (flushing 1&#x02013;3 ml solution containing 10&#x02013;100 units of heparin per milliliter) in maintaining an open venous catheter and reducing its complications, especially for phlebitis.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>In the study by Fojital <italic>et al.</italic>,[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] saline lock was as effective as heparin lock in preventing phlebitis, while in the study by Bertolino <italic>et al.</italic>,[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] the rates of vein occlusion and incidence of phlebitis were higher in the saline lock group. The study by Alexander compared these two methods and revealed that saline lock was preferred to heparin.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] He also quoted Le Duc (1997) in that using normal saline saved about US$ 27,594 toward the costs of nursing care and the solutions used.</p><p>Campbell <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] studied the effects of using saline lock for different number of times on the problems caused by peripheral vein catheter. The results of their studies showed that in the group in which saline lock method was used once daily, there were less complications, such as phlebitis progress, compared to using it every 12 h or every 8 h. Moreover, Myrianthefs <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] reported that the problems caused and the rate of incidence of high degree of phlebitis in the group with saline lock was higher than in the group which did not use saline lock.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>Due to the contradictions in the application of this method as an appropriate solution in the prevention of phlebitis and its associated problems, the present study examined the impact of saline lock on the incidence of phlebitis and its degree.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ATERIALS AND</sc> M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><p>The present study was a single-blind clinical trial (IRCT2013100214859N1) performed by the researcher on 88 patients divided into two groups of 44 each. Sampling was performed among hospitalized patients in the cardiac care units of Alzahra, Feiz, Amin, Noor, and Ali Asghar hospitals affiliated to Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Iran, during 3 months in the year 2012. Subjects of the research were first selected through convenient sampling from patients satisfying the inclusion criteria who were then divided into two groups of control and intervention using random number table.</p><p>The inclusion criteria of the present study were: Subjects being hospitalized for at least 3 days, having peripheral venous catheter in the upper extremity, and being alert enough to express the pain caused due to catheter. The exclusion criteria were: Discharge or death during the study, continuous infusion of fluid for the patient, catheter replacement for any reason other than phlebitis, unwillingness of the patient to continue cooperating, and having been prescribed immunosuppressive drugs and serum concentrations of greater than 800&#x02013;900 mOsm. During the study period, any patient with conditions requiring emergency intervention, such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or with certain conditions, such as organ transplantation due to immunosuppressive drugs, was excluded from the study.</p><p>Data collection was done using questionnaires and through interviews and observations. The first part included demographic information, data on diabetes and hypertension, information about catheter, and the medications received. The second part included the phlebitis registration form using Jackson's VIP Scale. This scale is rated from 0 to 5 to assess the degree of phlebitis signs and symptoms depending on the site of catheter insertion and the patient's description of pain. In this study, each of the subjects who showed a degree greater than 0 was considered to have phlebitis.</p><p>To perform the study, the researcher showed the introduction letter from the School of Nursing and Midwifery, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, and described the research objectives and gained the cooperation of authorities. Then, from among the patients admitted to coronary care units, the subjects who met the inclusion criteria were selected. After obtaining informed consents from the patients, their information form was completed. Then, depending on the vein, polyurethane catheter No. 18 or 20 was placed in the patient's upper extremities by a qualified person. The exact date and time were recorded on the catheter using standard fixed transparent glue and at the end of the catheter, a yellow leulock was placed. If the insertion of the intravenous catheters involved problems such as multi-entry and exit, in other words, if there were problems with finding the vessel and it was tried to place the catheter in the vein more than once, the subject was excluded. The intervention group received 3 ml of 0.9% normal saline sterilized before and after each intravenous injection through leulock. If the patient did not receive any intravenous medication, the saline lock was performed every 12 h. However, in the control group which included routine drug prescriptions and patient's serum, saline lock was not performed. During the study period, catheter placement was checked and recorded every 12 h for 72 h by the researcher who was not aware of the subjects&#x02019; categories in the control and intervention groups (single-blind).[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Whenever the patient gained a score of 3 or higher on the phlebitis scale, the exact date and time were recorded. The catheter was then replaced, and appropriate treatment was administered and the time of reviewing that subject ended.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] All the medications of the patients during the study were recorded. The results obtained in this study were analyzed using SPSS for Windows (version 16; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA), descriptive statistics such as frequency distribution and mean, and inferential statistical tests including Chi-square test, <italic>t</italic>-test, and Mann&#x02013;Whitney test.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Ethical considerations</title><p>The ethical considerations that have been mentioned in the &#x0201c;Methods&#x0201d; section, have been approved by Isfahan University of Medical Sciences.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>R<sc>ESULTS</sc></title><p>Of the 88 subjects examined in this study, 54.5% were women and 45.4% were men.

The chance of occurrence of phlebitis in the control group (without saline lock) was 10.3 times higher than in the intervention group (with saline lock) (OR = 10.263, CI = 3.397&#x02013;31.990).</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec1-4"><title>D<sc>ISCUSSION</sc></title><p>Regarding the degree of incidence of phlebitis in the present study, the highest rates of phlebitis were related to grade 1, 2, and then 3 and 4. In the descriptive study of Sing <italic>et al.</italic>, results showed that the frequency of phlebitis degree 1 and 2 was higher than grade 3 and 4.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] In the study by Oliveira <italic>et al.</italic>, grade 2 of phlebitis was reported to be higher than other measures.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] In the study of Ali Ramaei, most cases of phlebitis were related to first, second, third, and forth degrees; these results were consistent with the results of the present study.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Given the significant difference in terms of the degree of phlebitis between the two groups in the present study, it can be concluded that in the intervention group, using saline lock was effective in reducing the severity of phlebitis. Since one of the most important duties of nursing care is to check catheter placement to prevent phlebitis, it is expected that prevention and care take place before the symptoms of severe phlebitis develop. Thus, higher degrees of phlebitis should be seen to a much lesser extent. This indicates that nurses should have sufficient knowledge of safe management of intravenous therapy. Moreover, like all aspects of health care, intravenous management should be performed with the highest quality and based on evidence. So that by taking care, the development of phlebitis symptoms is prevented or minimized.</p><p>The results showed that in both groups, with increased duration of catheterization, the phlebitis rates also increased. Other studies have shown a relationship between the duration of catheter placement and the incidence of phlebitis.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] In a descriptive study by Uslusoy, the incidence of phlebitis on the third day was higher than that on the first and second days.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] In the study by Powell <italic>et al.</italic>, the incidence of phlebitis on the first and second days was less than that on the third day.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] In the studies by Ghadami[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and Tripathi,[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] the incidence of phlebitis increased over time. The results of all of these researches were consistent with the present study.</p><p>Results of the present study showed that performing saline lock in the intervention group compared with the control group, which did not have saline lock, had a significant impact in reducing the incidence of phlebitis during this study. In the first few days, saline lock had led to a reduction in the incidence of phlebitis. Venous catheter placement can cause mechanical damage to the vessel and it cannot be prevented. However, the damage caused by chemical injection and, in some cases, the incompatibility between the drugs remaining in the catheter track and the drugs that are prescribed following that can be prevented by washing the venous catheter using a saline lock. Furthermore, another factor involved in the saline lock effect is the prevention of bacterial colonization. Flushing the intravenous catheter with normal saline prevents the accumulation of bacteria, proteins, and platelets suspended in plasma.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] It is through these mechanisms that saline lock prevents and reduces phlebitis.</p><p>In order to confirm the results of this study, some resources have mentioned that flushing the intravenous catheter with normal saline, in addition to maintaining the intravenous catheter can be effective in the prevention of phlebitis.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] Fujita <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] found that saline lock method and heparin lock method can prevent the incidence of phlebitis, extravasation, and occlusion. The study by Sevrina[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] compared two groups; in one group, 5 ml saline lock was used every 24 h and in the other group, this method was not used. This study showed that there was no difference between the groups regarding the incidence of phlebitis and the opening of intravenous catheter.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] In the studies by Campbell <italic>et al.</italic>,[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] phlebitis, blockage, leakage, and infections occurred more in the group with higher saline lock frequency. The differences in the final results of these studies may be due to the differences the in saline lock method, the amount, and its sampling location in other wards.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSION</sc></title><p>Overall, the results of this study showed that saline lock reduced the incidence of phlebitis. Moreover, this method was effective in reducing the severity of phlebitis. But the amount of phlebitis was still high compared to the results of other studies. However, given that many factors are involved in causing phlebitis, more research on the number of times it is used to have the maximum impact on reducing the incidence of phlebitis, controlling the other factors effective on reducing phlebitis is necessary. Today, saline lock has been forgotten in many hospitals. Based on the results of this study, nurses, especially in the cardiac care units, can be taught and encouraged to use this method. By expressing its useful features, this method can be replaced by the routine care methods of peripheral venous catheter. This method can reduce phlebitis, prevent possible drug interactions caused by simultaneous prescription of multiple drugs, and prevent the rising medical costs resulting from the hospitalization of patients and using equipments. However, given that this method can prevent catheter occlusion, using this method can also reduce the frequency of catheter replacement, so that greater convenience is provided for the patient.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>A<sc>CKNOWLEDGMENT</sc></title><p>This article was derived from a master thesis of Raziyeh Gadiriyan with project number 392007, approved by Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Iran, the registration number as commented in the Methods section.
