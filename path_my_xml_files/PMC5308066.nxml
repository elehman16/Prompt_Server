Several investigators have demonstrated that, in general, ceramic substrates cause greater and hence destructive abrasive wear of human enamel.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>A ceramic restorative material that combines good strength without the disadvantage of increased enamel wear would be a significant addition to clinical dental practice. Although numerous <italic>in vitro</italic> wear studies have been conducted on dental ceramics, few studies have provided detailed information to characterize and predict the wear behavior of a range of dental ceramics used for all ceramic systems at present. These studies have reported the effect of individual ceramic systems on the wear of enamel.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Taking these studies into consideration, it is challenging to compare the effect of different ceramic systems on the wear of enamel because these studies have been conducted in different environmental and testing conditions as well as in the presence of altered variables. Therefore, this <italic>in vitro</italic> research project was undertaken to evaluate and compare the wear behavior of human tooth enamel opposing different ceramic restorative materials; monolith zirconia with glaze, mechanically polished monolith zirconia without glaze, porcelain fused to metal and lithium disilicate glass ceramic using a reciprocating sliding wear testing apparatus in the same controlled environment and testing conditions using same variables.</p><p>A second part of the study is to observe the phase transformation of zirconia structure due to wear in the presence of artificial saliva. Zirconia exists in three major phases: Monoclinic, tetragonal, and cubic. The tetragonal crystalline state is responsible for the high strength and fracture toughness of yttrium oxide stabilized tetragonal zirconium dioxide polycrystals (Y-TZP) materials. Once a crack propagates within a Y-TZP material, the energy supplied by the crack can trigger the tetragonal to monoclinic phase transformation in the surrounding grains. This phase transformation leads to a local compressive stress field that hinders further crack propagation.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] This so-called transformation toughening is what makes Y-TZP the strongest ceramic material class used in the dentistry. However, it is well known that on Y-TZP material surfaces, the tetragonal to monoclinic phase transformation can slowly occur by contact with water.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] This is called low-temperature degradation (LTD). Zirconia has the propensity to undergo LTD, which is a kinetic phenomenon in which the polycrystalline tetragonal material slowly transforms into monoclinic zirconia over a rather narrow but important temperature range, typically between room temperature and approximately 400&#x000b0;C in the presence of water, depending on the stabilizer used, its concentration, and the grain size (GS) of the ceramic. This time dependant phase transformation is followed by microcracking and loss of strength which starts at the surface and then proceeds into the bulk.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>Therefore, a strict control of the phase transformation is thus imperative to retain those properties which make the ceramic material so desirable. Hence, a part of the study included observing the tetragonal to monoclinic phase transformation that may occur while simulating wear occurring at room temperature in a wet environment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Fabrication of zirconia discs [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Box 1</xref>]</title><p>A disc of dimension 10 mm in diameter and 2 mm in height was fabricated in wax using the precision milling.

The disc was additionally secured with the help of condensation silicone putty. The cusp tips and ceramic discs were positioned under a constant load of 5 kg. Artificial saliva was sprayed between the tooth sample and ceramic surface at intervals during testing so as to further simulate the oral conditions.

However, the rate of wear may be disturbed by the introduction of restorations with wear properties differing from those of the replaced tooth structure. The severity of this problem may be accentuated by an improper occlusal scheme; for example, group function with a porcelain occlusion can cause more wear than canine-guided mutually protected occlusion.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Therefore, there is a need to investigate the wear properties of restorative materials and their potential abrasive effects on the opposing natural teeth.</p><p>In this <italic>in vitro</italic> study, wear of enamel when opposed to different ceramic systems was simulated to the oral environment using a wear machine. Two-body wear that was brought about by this machine provided a combined action of impact, followed by sliding that matches the inherent action of closure during mastication of the mandibular teeth onto the maxillary teeth for a total of 10,000 cycles.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] A weight of 5 kg (49 N), which is comparable to normal chewing force, was exerted onto the specimens.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>Enamel varies in its properties depending on its position in the tooth and its histological structure.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Cuspal enamel is stronger and can withstand forces in a direction parallel to the enamel rods than perpendicular to the rods. Hence, in this study, freshly extracted nonattrited, noncarious premolars of young adolescent patients undergoing orthodontic extractions were used. Since this study was to observe the wear behavior of enamel in a clinical environment, only the cuspal tips of the dental specimens were held in contact with the ceramic specimens.</p><p>Li and Zhou[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] investigated the influence lubrication on the wear behavior of human enamel, using a reciprocating wear test apparatus. It was found that the depth and severity of the wear scars were much smaller with artificial saliva lubrication than in dry conditions and therefore, concluded that saliva plays an important lubricant effect during the wear process of enamel in the oral environment. Because the surface hardness of glass or ceramic decreases in an aqueous environment, the two mating materials can easily adhere at the microscopic level of sharp asperities in the presence of saliva.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Consequently, a more intimate approximation between the contacting surfaces results in a higher coefficient of friction associated with exposure to aqueous media.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Hence, artificial saliva was used in this study to simulate the oral environment.</p><p>When two materials in contact slide over each other, one or both of the materials will suffer wear on the surface, generally the softer of the two, i.e., tooth enamel.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] According to this hypothesis, it was expected that being hardest of the two other ceramics under consideration, glazed zirconia as well as polished unglazed zirconia would produce the highest wear of the enamel. Our results corroborated with this hypothesis that showed that Group I (glazed monolithic zirconia) caused statistically significant wear of the opposing enamel as in the study by Heintze <italic>et al</italic>. where it was reported that flat glazed surfaces show more antagonistic wear than polished surfaces[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] but Group II (mechanically polished zirconia without glaze), however, showed least amount of wear of the opposing tooth enamel which was a point to ponder.</p><p>Recent studies show that a glazed zirconia surface brought about more wear than its polished surface.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Possible explanation is that the glazed surface is quickly worn away to reveal the rough surface of zirconia ceramic beneath. This may occur due to chairside adjustments that are made before cementation of the prosthesis or may also occur within a short period of function. The surfaces of all materials are rough at a microscopic level with sharp, rugged projections called asperities, which have a surface profile of peaks and valleys.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] The zirconia underneath the glaze has high asperities, and owing to its high hardness value (1378&#x02013;1354 Hv), tends to abrade the comparatively softer enamel opposite to it.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</p><p>Mechanically polished monolith zirconia (Group II) in our study showed the least amount of tooth wear among all four groups, even though it was the hardest material of the lot. Most ceramics have comparatively higher hardness values than human enamel, and the hardness of a ceramic has been used as a predictor of its potential to abrade opposing teeth.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] However, scientific studies have demonstrated a poor correlation between material's hardness and the abrasive potential of ceramic materials on human enamel.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] Hence, polished zirconia demonstrated less enamel wear than glazed zirconia, a finding that is in agreement with studies conducted by Preis <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and Sabrah <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</p><p>It was originally thought that glazed ceramics would afford the enamel a certain degree of protection against wear. However, in this study, glazed lithium disilicate (Group IV) as well as glazed porcelain fused to metal (Group III) caused greater wear of the antagonistic tooth enamel than polished unglazed zirconia. In a study conducted by Wang <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] scanning electron microscopy images of the worn surface of enamel after wear showed particles sticking on the surface of lithium disilicate antagonist as ascribed to the accumulation of chipped off enamel and glass-ceramic particles. As the lithium disilicate specimen slides over the enamel surface, sliding contact generates a frictional force which results in tensile, compressive, and shear stresses on the enamel surface. Microcracks develop within the subsurface and these subsurface cracks propagate to eventually form a particle which becomes displaced according to Reid <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</p><p>As stated by Seghi <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] Dicor glass ceramic was found to be significantly harder than other glass ceramics but had lower relative abrasiveness. Lack of significant crystalline phase may account for this lower abrasiveness despite its high hardness value. However, pressable lithium disilicate material consists of higher crystalline content (70% volume), which may be a contributing factor for increased abrasiveness of antagonistic tooth enamel, as seen in this study.</p><p>As evidenced by the literature and the results of this study, it may be prudent to conclude that polishing the surface of the ceramic is the wisest choice of surface finish when opposing natural dentition.</p><p>Powder XRD analysis was done on the zirconia specimens before and after wear simulation on Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer using 2&#x003b8;&#x02013;&#x003b8; method, where &#x003b8; is the angle of reflection. The samples were observed for tetragonal and monoclinic phases of zirconia and the data so collected were interpreted to achieve the zirconia spectra graph. In the spectra obtained by the 2&#x003b8;&#x02013;&#x003b8; method in the first zirconia sample before wear, strong peaks representing the tetragonal phase were observed, while peaks assigned to the monoclinic phase were not distinct. In the XRD of the sample after wear in the presence of artificial saliva, peaks of tetragonal phase were observed only, with no presence of transformation-produced monoclinic phase. Irrespective of the mechanism, it is evident that the presence of moisture as well as increased temperatures can induce this t &#x02192; m transformation.</p><p>The XRD results of the present study are in agreement with the results of the study carried out by E&#x000e1;stkov&#x000e1; <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] in 2004 in which absolutely no layer of transformed zirconia was recorded when specimen tested at 140&#x000b0;C/15 h. The transformed layer was found at a temperature of 180&#x000b0;C and higher only, the extent of t &#x02192; m transformation increasing with the rise in temperature. Numerous researchers have reported that reducing the average GS in zirconia-based ceramics has a beneficial effect on the stability of the tetragonal phase[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and therefore on LTD. The absence of transformation of phase in the specimen used in this study may be due to the reduced GS of the material, 0.5 &#x000b5;m which is well within the limits of standard GS allowed for zirconia intended for dental use.</p><p>Thus, taking all these factors into consideration, the operator must be capable of making an informed decision when selecting a restorative material which will restore form, function, and esthetics as well as protect the present dentition from additional damage.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>
