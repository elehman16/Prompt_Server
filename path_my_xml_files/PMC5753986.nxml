During this period, the persistence of symptoms that go unchecked can lead to unscheduled emergency room and clinic visits, calls to surgeons&#x02019; offices, and readmissions.</p></sec><sec><title>Purpose:</title><p>To analyze postoperative data from a previous study examining postoperative outcomes in 2 patient populations following breast reconstruction and anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction with use of a patient-centered mobile application. Here, the authors establish whether this method of follow-up can provide useful insight specific to the orthopaedic patient population, and they determine whether the mobile platform has the potential to modify their postoperative treatment. In addition, the authors examine its utility for orthopaedic physicians and patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Study Design:</title><p>Case series; Level of evidence, 4.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Eligible patients undergoing ACL reconstruction from 2 surgeons were consecutively recruited to use a mobile smartphone application that allowed physicians to monitor their recovery at home. Data from 32 patients were collected via the application and analyzed to evaluate recovery trends during the first 6 postoperative weeks. Following completion of the study, patients and physicians were interviewed on their experience.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Data collected from each question in the mobile application provided insightful trends on daily real-time indicators of postoperative recovery. The application identified 1 patient who required in-person reassessment to rule out a possible infection, following surgeon review of an uploaded image. It was estimated that the majority of patients could have avoided follow-up at 2 and 6 weeks, owing to the application&#x02019;s efficacy. Participants described their satisfaction with the device as excellent (43%), good (40%), fair (10%), and poor (7%), and 94% (n = 30) of patients reported that they would respond to questions using a similar application in the future. Both physicians rated their experience as positive and identified useful traits in the web portal.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion:</title><p>This system can accurately assess patient recovery; it has the potential to change how postoperative orthopaedic patients are followed, and it is well received by patients and physicians. Recognition of the study&#x02019;s limitations and employment of user feedback to improve the current application are essential before a formal randomized controlled trial is conducted.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>ACL reconstruction</kwd><kwd>smartphone</kwd><kwd>app</kwd><kwd>follow-up</kwd><kwd>mobile</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>edited-state</meta-name><meta-value>corrected-proof</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Mobile communication has had a dramatic impact on daily life, with an estimated 3 billion people using mobile devices worldwide.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-2325967117745278" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> In this technological age, the development of smartphones and mobile tablets has enhanced our ability to communicate, learn, and organize information. These innovations have created opportunities to incorporate technology into medical practice.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-2325967117745278" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Web-based questionnaires, automatic appointment and medication reminders, as well as patient learning tools have already been adopted in many areas of medicine.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-2325967117745278" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="bibr8-2325967117745278" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="bibr9-2325967117745278" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Web-based electronic entry of subjective follow-up data by patients is being used to determine the efficacy of certain therapeutic interventions.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-2325967117745278" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup></p><p>The application of emerging smartphone technology to surgical follow-up has been studied in several areas of ambulatory surgery. In a study examining surgical outpatient efficiency, mobile devices sent surveillance text messages to patients to determine the need to schedule an outpatient clinic appointment.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-2325967117745278" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Similarly, Martinez-Ramos and Lopez<sup><xref rid="bibr10-2325967117745278" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> utilized mobile phone images sent from patients via email to assess local wound complications after ambulatory surgery and to avoid unnecessary visits. Wood et al<sup><xref rid="bibr15-2325967117745278" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> applied these advances in technology to orthopaedic surgery and combined the use of a picture archiving system and a validated web-based subjective patient questionnaire to create an electronic follow-up clinic for arthroplasty patients. Semple et al<sup><xref rid="bibr14-2325967117745278" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> recently showed evidence that using smartphone technology monitoring for patients undergoing postoperative breast reconstruction and anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction is both feasible and acceptable to patients and surgeons.</p><p>In the setting of postoperative ACL reconstruction, an alternative to standard clinic-based follow-up may be beneficial for patients and surgeons. The utilization of web-based follow-up allows surgeons to monitor a patient&#x02019;s subjective quality of recovery, including symptoms of pain, feelings of anxiety, and limitations in activities of daily living. This tool has the potential to enhance quality of care by providing daily updates about the patient&#x02019;s physical impairment and mental health.<sup><xref rid="bibr13-2325967117745278" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Furthermore, while ACL reconstruction is considered a safe procedure with low complication rates, some complications can occur. Infection is rare and can occur in 0.3% to 1.7% of patients, with cases ranging from superficial infection of the surgical site to septic arthritis of the knee.<sup><xref rid="bibr7-2325967117745278" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Uploading pictures from a mobile tablet or smartphone in addition to clinical questions will allow for assessment and potential detection of early postoperative complications. This will also permit surgeons to intervene as indicated, as they would in a conventional follow-up setting. In addition, uploading photos for subsequent reassurance from physicians can resolve patient concerns and prevent unnecessary follow-up appointments and emergency department visits.</p><p>The purpose of our study was to analyze previously obtained data<sup><xref rid="bibr14-2325967117745278" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> specific to orthopaedic patients to (1) document postoperative symptoms following ACL reconstruction, (2) establish if the use of a smartphone application (or &#x0201c;app&#x0201d;) has the potential to affect postoperative management specific to an orthopaedic surgical practice by safely eliminating conventional follow-up appointments, and (3) determine the acceptance of a mobile follow-up system for orthopaedic physicians and patients. We hypothesized that we will be able to accurately and efficiently monitor trends in patient recovery, that smartphone technology for monitoring will be well received by patients and physicians, and that this pilot study will provide an impetus for future incorporation of mobile monitoring into practice.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="section1-2325967117745278"><title>Methods</title><sec id="section2-2325967117745278"><title>Device and Application</title><p>A study was initially carried out at our institution to determine the feasibility of mobile app technology to monitor the postoperative quality of at-home recovery for 2 patient populations (ACL reconstruction and breast reconstruction). This article represents the orthopaedic-specific results of this pilot study. A panel that included 2 sports medicine fellowship&#x02013;trained orthopaedic surgeons (L.M., J.T.) was created to determine potential questions specific to patients undergoing postoperative ACL reconstruction to evaluate recovery. The mobile app recovery indicators included a visual analog scale (VAS) for pain and Likert questions from the Quality of Recovery&#x02013;9 (QoR-9) questionnaire, a version of the Quality of Recovery&#x02013;40 questionnaire, which has been validated to assess the quality of life of patients after surgery.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-2325967117745278" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Using a scale of this magnitude (ie, 40 items) did not seem feasible for daily self-assessments given its length, so we decided to utilize the QoR-9 in addition to limb-specific questions that were of interest to our 2 surgeons for the purpose of daily monitoring.

Antibiotics were initiated, which resolved a superficial wound infection and may have prevented a single readmission. No other complications, such as stiffness, reinjury, or deep vein thrombosis, occurred in the study group. Aside from this 1 patient, no other patients required any changes to their postoperative treatment.</p><p>Of the 32 patients, 31 (97%) completed the survey of their study experience. They reported their overall satisfaction with the mobile device as excellent (43%), good (40%), fair (10%), and poor (7%).

Patients who responded as being unwilling to pay for the app described either not being that worried about their recovery outside the hospital or feeling that such a health care service should be provided free of cost. Some patients did report that daily responses seemed to be excessive, as it became an annoyance to respond to the same questions with the same answers every day. The 2 surgeons involved in the study completed a survey to assess their experience with this mode of follow-up. Both rated their experience as positive and identified portability, ease of use, and user-friendliness as the most positive traits of the mobile app. The physicians both concluded that they would continue to use this solution and would recommend it to other physicians and patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="section8-2325967117745278"><title>Discussion</title><p>The data collected from each question in the mobile app provided insightful trends on daily indicators of postoperative ACL reconstruction recovery, such as pain levels, feelings of anxiety, and the limitations of the affected leg. This gave surgeons important recovery information not often discussed during routine follow-up visits and at time points to which they would not otherwise have access. The utilization of this method provided surgeons with an easy, portable way to monitor subjective quality of recovery on a real-time basis. Continued collection of aggregate data on this patient population will provide the care team with a method of identifying patients who fall outside the normal variances of postoperative recovery. This will also allow surgeons to plan follow-up visits on a more individualized basis, if needed at all. Recorded data of patients&#x02019; abilities to stand, walk, use stairs, and perform activities of daily living are useful not only for orthopaedic care providers but for home care staff and physical therapists to set goals and manage expectations.</p><p>This application has the potential to enhance future patient-physician communication and improve education about what to expect postoperatively. For example, our study results show that &#x0003e;70% of our patients still had varying degrees of difficulty standing on the affected leg at 4 weeks postoperatively. Interestingly, &#x0003e;50% of patients also had some degree of anxiety about their recovery at this point. Comments from the postpilot survey about reasons for their anxiety included &#x0201c;uncertainty,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;fear of unknown,&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;not sure if I should be recovering faster.&#x0201d; A preoperative patient who is well educated about his or her upcoming recovery experience, including normal variances in recovery milestones, could suffer less postoperative anxiety. In a study of preoperative education for patients undergoing hip and knee replacement, McDonald et al<sup><xref rid="bibr11-2325967117745278" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> found that this may be true if the education is tailored toward patients who are in need of more social support, those with preoperative anxiety, and those with preexisting mobility issues.</p><p>At the conclusion of the study, both surgeons estimated that the majority of patients could have avoided their follow-up appointments at 2 and 6 weeks owing to the efficacy of the application. The future utilization of this method of outpatient follow-up could also save time and money for patients, physicians, and hospitals. In Ontario, an estimated 3000 ACL reconstructions were performed in 2008, with numbers steadily increasing each year since 2001.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-2325967117745278" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> In 1 study examining 13,571 patients undergoing ACL reconstruction, rates of 90-day deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary thromboembolism were 0.29% and 0.20%, respectively, while 0.94% had a wound complication recorded and 1.34% were readmitted to an orthopaedic ward within 30 days.<sup><xref rid="bibr7-2325967117745278" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> The removal of postoperative appointments at 2 and 6 weeks for approximately 3000 patients could result in 5834 fewer outpatient follow-up visits per year in Ontario, after adjustment for the aforementioned possible complication rates.</p><p>With this system, physicians can identify outliers in recovery milestones and flag answers that may indicate complications and poor recovery. It may be useful to limit clinic appointments to this population to investigate the reasons for their poor responses. The reduction in the number of visits could minimize waiting times and create an opportunity to increase availability for new referrals within Canada&#x02019;s socialized health care system. In addition, decreasing the number of follow-up appointments will be cost-effective for patients by reducing travel costs and time lost from work.</p><p>Two studies on the follow-up of surgical outpatients also described the success of web-based systems to avoid unnecessary follow-up visits.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-2325967117745278" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bibr13-2325967117745278" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Armstrong et al<sup><xref rid="bibr2-2325967117745278" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> modeled cost-effectiveness scenarios with mobile app home monitoring, taking into account the total of the health care system, patient, and external costs. The breast reconstruction group was given mobile devices similar to the ACL reconstruction group. For patients undergoing breast reconstruction, the researchers demonstrated that a mean Can$136 was spent in the mobile app follow-up care stream, whereas Can$381 was spent in the in-person follow-up care stream in the first postoperative month. We acknowledge the need for a formal cost analysis for patients undergoing ACL reconstruction, which will evaluate the fees and savings incurred by developing and utilizing an electronic follow-up clinic for this population of patients undergoing ambulatory surgery.</p><p>Patient feedback on the app was very positive, as 94% of participants reported their desire to use it as a mode of follow-up in the future. Our results on patient satisfaction with the application mirror a similar orthopaedic study conducted by Wood et al,<sup><xref rid="bibr15-2325967117745278" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> where 95% of patients reported that a web-based e-clinic was more convenient than a standard clinic and was the preferred method of future follow-up. Patients in a study by Martinez-Ramos and Lopez<sup><xref rid="bibr10-2325967117745278" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> also described the usefulness of a telemedicine system that sent daily postoperative pictures. Procedures included operations for inguinal or umbilical hernias, hallux valgus, carpal tunnel syndrome, Dupuytren disease, varicose veins, hydrocele, and varicocele. Physician and patient satisfaction, desire for future use, as well as constructive feedback should provide an impetus to improve the app and continue to study its relevance to postoperative orthopaedic follow-up.</p><p>We recognize limitations in our study. Equitable access to this web-based service is not universal, as not everyone can afford to pay for a smartphone/tablet or for a mobile app for 1 of these devices. In this study, participants were loaned a device with the preprogrammed application. Furthermore, both physicians recognized the need to incorporate range of motion data into the app, as the addition of this information would represent a more accurate depiction of patient recovery. Also, while orthopaedic physician feedback was positive, the sample size was small (n = 2). It is possible that the addition of surgeons to the study will result in different feelings about the mobile app and web portal, as well as suggestions for improvements.</p><p>A number of important issues can be investigated in future research and app development. In the subjective assessment of patient recovery, an area that should be addressed is the establishment of minimum scores that would act as red flags and determine when a visit to the hospital or physician may be warranted. Furthermore, from a medicolegal perspective, it may be prudent to develop an automated response that informs patients that their scores and images have actually been reviewed by the surgeon. In addition, patients who more easily forget to respond may benefit from a built-in reminder system. Since typical follow-up occurs at 1, 2, and 6 weeks, web-based responses at each interval may be more clinically relevant and attractive to patients than the system proposed in this study. The ability for patients to ask questions that they can flag as <italic>emergency</italic>, <italic>urgent</italic>, or <italic>nonurgent</italic> may also be a feature that reduces their anxiety and increases their satisfaction. After the fine-tuning of the mobile app, a prospective randomized controlled trial should be conducted to compare standard clinic-based follow-up with mobile web-based follow-up alone.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="section9-2325967117745278"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Innovations in mobile technology can have dramatic impacts in medicine.
