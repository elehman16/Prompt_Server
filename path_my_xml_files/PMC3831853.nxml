</p><p>Recent studies demonstrated that only 10% of patients were able to correctly identify any of the physicians caring for them in the in-patient department<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2042533313493270">2</xref></sup> and patients&#x02019; ability to correctly identify their physicians was increased when the physicians&#x02019; names were constantly presented in the rooms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2042533313493270">3</xref></sup> Previous studies also showed that photos of physicians displayed on the wall of the patients&#x02019; rooms could help patients correctly identify their physicians, which resulted in greater satisfaction with their care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2042533313493270">1</xref></sup> Therefore, we hypothesized that a photo album of physicians might also increase the ability of patients to correctly identify their physicians; hence we conducted this study to test the hypothesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec2-2042533313493270"><title>Methods</title><p>We conducted a prospective controlled study of patients admitted to the In-patient General Surgery Department of the Third Xiangya Hospital of Central South University from 1 May 2012 to 30 June 2012. The department was located on one floor and was composed of two wards. There were 48 rooms and 124 beds in each ward. The photo album was composed of colour photos (8&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;12&#x02009;cm) of the members of the medical team caring for the patients. The professional role of each member was displayed under the photo. Patients were admitted to the wards according to the routine protocol. On admission, each patient was verbally informed by a nurse of the medical team treating him/her. The photos of the medical team were shown to the patients in Group A (the intervention group) but not in Group B (the control group). One day before being discharged, the patients in group A were asked to return the photo albums and all the patients from both groups were asked to give the names of their caring physicians prior to departure from the hospital. Patients discharged later than June 30 were excluded from this study, which finally included 75 patients in group A and 94 patients in group B. Permission from the Hospital Ethics Committee was obtained for the study. No patient had cognitive impairment.</p><p>The proportions of patients in the two groups who were able to correctly give at least one name in his or her medical team were recorded. Exact binomial 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were determined for these two proportions. Difference between these two proportions, in addition to the 95% CIs, was compared using the Fisher exact test (MedCalc version 11, MedCalc Software Ltd, Mariakerke, Belgium) and <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec3-2042533313493270"><title>Results</title><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-2042533313493270">Table 1</xref>, the age, days of hospital stay and gender ratio of patients were similar for the two groups. Only 53% of patients (50 out of 94) in group B (the control group) could give at least one of their physicians&#x02019; name (95% CI, 52&#x02013;54%), while 85% of patients (64 out of 75) in group A (the intervention group; 95% CI, 76&#x02013;94%) could tell at least one of their physicians&#x02019; name, with 32% difference between the two groups. There was a significant difference (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.005, 95% CI, 17.4&#x02013;44.7%), which attests to the benefit of using photographic display to help patients remember the names of the medical staff.
