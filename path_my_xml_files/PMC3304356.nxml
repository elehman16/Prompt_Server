It belongs to the class III anti-arrhythmic drugs, which prolong the duration of the action potential and the effective refractory period in both atria and ventricles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0002">2</xref>). Amiodarone is absorbed variably and erratically from the gastrointestinal tract. Oral bioavailability ranges from 22 to 86% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0004">4</xref>). The low solubility of amiodarone in aqueous solution and hepatic first pass effect which has not been clearly defined might be a reason for its unpredictable absorption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0006">6</xref>). Amiodarone belongs to class II biopharmaceutical classification system (BCS) which is characterized by high membrane permeability and slow dissolution rate due to low aqueous solubility(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0007">7</xref>).</p><p>Certain changes in the formulation, the manufacturing process, the site of manufacture and the scale-up of the manufacturing process may alter the dissolution rate and the bioavailability of drug from solid dosage forms. Therefore, bioavailability issues have been of increasing concern to drug regulatory authorities for assessment of the safety and efficacy of drug products. Local drug regulatory authorities have, therefore, issued guidelines to ensure adequate bioavailability studies in new drug applications for synonym drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0008">8</xref>).</p><p>While the pharmacokinetics, metabolism, and bioavailability of amiodarone have been studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0002">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0006">6</xref>), the bioequivalence of the marketed products has not been described and no information about in vitro-in vivo correlation (IVIVC) of this drug is available.</p><p>One of the challenges of biopharmaceutics research is correlation of the in vitro drug release information of various drug formulations to the in vivo drug profiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0009">9</xref>). For amiodarone, a correlation between dissolution rate and the in vivo performance might be expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0008">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0010">10</xref>).</p><p>Since drug release pattern from each dosage form was analyzed on a &#x000b5;-bondapack C (150&#x000d7;4.6 is significantly affected by the special design which is employed in manufacturing of the formulations, planning an in vitro dissolution method corresponding to the in vivo drug absorption rate, will facilitate the development of the drug formulations and quality control tests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0009">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0011">11</xref>). For the development of an ideal oral formulation of amiodarone, it would be highly desirable to have an appropriate dissolution method which could predict the progress of the drug release and the in vivo release rate of the drug. An official monograph of amiodarone tablet formulation does not exist in any accredited pharmacopoeia and appropriate dissolution conditions have not yet been described for this drug. However, a dissolution method for amiodarone tablet is recently proposed by FDA. Therefore, an appropriate dissolution conditions based on in vivo performance could be more confidently adapted for routine and in-process quality control studies.</p><p>This paper describes the result of the bioequivalence study and dissolution behavior of six (three reference and three test tablet formulations) immediate release amiodarone tablet formulations. Since the in vitro dissolution characteristics of these tablets exhibited different release pattern, the possibility of correlation between in vitro dissolution data and in vivo bioavailability of these tablet formulations was also investigated.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S0002"><title>MATERIAL AND METHODS</title><sec><title/><sec><title>Materials</title><p>Products under the study were six amiodarone immediate-release tablet formulations containing 200 mg amiodarone hydrochloride which exhibited different release pattern due to variation in proprietary manufacturing procedure. For tests T1, T2, T3 and for References R1, R2, and R3 were designated for identification. Amiodarone hydrochloride was obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA), the internal standard, trifluoperazine was from SmithKline Beecham Inc. (Philadelphia, PA, USA), hydrochloric acid, tribasic sodium phosphate, monobasic sodium phosphate, orthophosphoric acid 85%, sodium laurylsulphate, ammonium acetate, sodium acetate, acetonitrile, and hexane, were from Merck (Germany), methanol and acetonitrile were from Caledon (Canada, Ontario). All reagents and solutions of this study were analytical grade except methanol and acetonitrile which were HPLC grade.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Drug content uniformity in tablet formulations</title><p>From each formulation, 20 tablets were transferred into a 50-ml volumetric flask containing 25 ml of methanol, sonicated, diluted with methanol to volume, mixed and filtered. Samples were assayed by a HPLC method developed in this laboratory. Briefly, an aliquot of 25 &#x000b5;l of clear sample solution mm) column, using acetonitrile-methanol (1:1) and 0.05 M monobasic potassium phosphate solution in deionized water (90:10, final pH, 3.5) at 243 nm. Drug contents of samples were determined by calibration curve.</p></sec><sec><title>Dissolution studies</title><p>The release characteristics of tested formulations were determined using USP Apparatus II (Pharma Test, PTZWS3, Germany) at 75 rpm in 900 ml of acetate buffer (pH=5, 0.1 M) containing 1% SLS maintained at 37&#x000b1;0.2&#x000b0;C. Dissolution tests were performed on 12 tablets at time intervals of 0, 5, 10, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 105, and 120 minutes using, 5 ml samples. Samples were filtered and analyzed spectrophotometrically for amiodarone concentration in order to characterize the dissolution profiles.</p></sec><sec><title>Bioavailability studies</title><p>Three separate bioequivalence studies (study 1, 2, and 3) on three commercial generic products (T1, T2, and T3) were conducted during 2000&#x02013;2005. For each study, twelve healthy adult male volunteers were recruited. Age (years), weight (kg) and height (cm) of participants in the study 1 were 22&#x02013;26, 59&#x02013;79, and 168&#x02013;192, for the study 2 were 20&#x02013;27, 65&#x02013;90, 165&#x02013;184 and for the study 3, were 19&#x02013;25, 62&#x02013;87, 165&#x02013;185, respectively. The studies were approved by the ethics committee on human studies of the Isfahan University of Medical Sciences. On the basis of medical history, clinical examinations and laboratory tests, no subject had a history and evidence of hepatic, renal, gastro-intestinal or hematological disorders or any acute or chronic disease or drug allergy. The subjects were instructed to abstain from taking any medication at least 2 weeks prior to and during the study period. Informed consent was obtained from the subjects after explaining the nature and purpose of the study. The protocol was the conventional, randomized, two-way cross- over bioequivalence study with twelve subjects in each treatment group. In the first trial period, after an overnight fasting, subjects were given a single dose of either formulation (reference or test) in a randomized fashion with 200 ml of water. Food and drinks (other than water, which was allowed after 2 hrs) were not allowed for 4 hrs after dosing to all volunteers. Approximately 10 ml of blood samples were drawn into tubes through an indwelling canola before (0 h) and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60 and 72 hrs after dosing. The blood samples were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 15 min and serum samples were separated and kept frozen at -200C in coded glass tubes until analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>HPLC assay</title><p>A reversed phase HPLC method was developed in home to quantitate serum levels of amiodarone. Chromatographic separation was performed using a &#x000b5;-Bondapak C18 (250&#x000d7;3.9 mm, Waters, Ireland) column. The mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile- 0.01 M KH PO solution (70/30) containing 20 &#x000b5;l triethylamine with the final pH of 4.0. The aqueous phase was eluted at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min and effluent was monitored at 243 nm. To 1 ml of either blank serum spiked with different amount of amiodarone (calibration samples) or serum of volunteers in a 10 ml test tube, were added 50 &#x000b5;l of internal standard solution, trifluoperazine, 1 ml of sodium acetate buffer (1 M, pH=5.4), and 8 ml of hexane and vortexed and centrifuged at 2000 g for 3 min. The supernatant was separated and evaporated to dryness under nitrogen gas. The residue was reconstituted with 100 &#x000b5;l of mobile phase and 50 &#x000b5;l aliquot was injected into the HPLC column. The standard curve covering 10&#x02013;500 ng/ml concentration range was linear, the inter- and intra- day precision and accuracy were less than 10%, the limit of quantification was 10 ng/ml, and theextraction efficiency was between 92% to 95% for calibration standard concentrations.</p></sec><sec><title>Dissolution data analyses</title><p>The in vitro drug release profiles of each two dosage forms (test versus reference) were compared using the similarity factor, <italic>f2</italic>, as described in FDA guidance for dissolution testing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0013">13</xref>).

The elimination rate constant (k<sub>E</sub>) was obtained from the least square fitted terminal log-linear portion of the plasma concentration-time profile. The area under the curve to the last measurable concentration (AUC<sub>0-t</sub>) was estimated by the linear trapezoidal rule. The area under the curve extrapolated to infinity (AUC<sub>0&#x02013;8</sub>) was calculated by equation of AUC<sub>0-t</sub>+C<sub>t</sub>/k<sub>E</sub> where C<sub>t</sub> is the last measured concentration. The peak plasma concentration (C<sub>max</sub>) and corresponding time to peak (t<sub>max</sub>) were determined by inspection of the individual drug serum concentration-time profiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0008">8</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>For the purpose of bioequivalence analysis, AUC<sub>0-t</sub>, AUC<sub>0&#x02013;8</sub>, C <sub>max</sub> and T<sub>max</sub> were considered as primary variables. For each of parameters, by an analysis of variance (ANOVA) procedure for cross-over design the values obtained for the two products were determined to assess the effect of treatment (formulation), periods, sequences, and subjects on the parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0016">16</xref>). A difference between two related parameters was considered statistically significant for a <italic>P</italic> value of less than 0.05. The 90% confidence intervals of the pharmacokinetic parameters of the two products were also estimated. The AUC and C<sub>max</sub> values were logarithmically transformed prior to the analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0017">17</xref>). Non-parametric Wilcoxon signed rank test for paired samples, was used to compare values of Tmax of the test over the reference products. The inter-subject variation of AUC<sub>0-t</sub>, AUC<sub>0&#x02013;8</sub>, and C<sub>max</sub> parameters was estimated by calculation of the respective coefficient of variation (CV) using the mean square error obtained from the ANOVA procedure. All statistical analyses were performed on untransformed data using SPSS 10.</p></sec><sec><title>Correlation development</title><p>The correlation was developed using the data of mean amiodarone serum concentration <italic>vs</italic> time following ingestion of six formulations. The principles of statistical moment analysis were utilized to assess the correlation. In this level of correlation, the in vitro MDT of the product was compared to in vivo MRT. MDT was calculated as pointed out earlier and MRT was calculated using equation described by Gibaldi and Perrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0018">18</xref>). An approach based on cumulative fraction absorbed was also utilized to achieve an IVIVC. Prior to development of the IVIVC, the fraction of the drug dissolved (FRD) was determined using the aforementioned dissolution testing methods. In addition, the fraction of absorbed amiodarone (FRA) of each formulation was estimated by the Wagner-Nelson method. The cumulative fraction of the absorbed drug absorbed at time t was calculated as follows:<disp-formula id="FD1"><label>1</label><mml:math id="M1"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>K</mml:mi><mml:mi>E</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:msubsup><mml:mo>&#x0222b;</mml:mo><mml:mn>0</mml:mn><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>Cdt</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>K</mml:mi><mml:mi>E</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:munderover><mml:mo>&#x0222b;</mml:mo><mml:mn>0</mml:mn><mml:mo>&#x0221e;</mml:mo></mml:munderover><mml:mrow><mml:mi>Cdt</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula>

<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref> shows the dissolution profiles of both reference and test tablet formulations which exhibited relatively immediate release behavior. The CV% associated with the dissolution data at each sampling time and for each formulation was less than 10%. In general, under the above described dissolution condition, test tablets had a higher dissolution rate than the reference formulations. This observation was supported by statistical analyses comparing the DE of test and reference tablets profiles at 45 min (p&#x0003c;0.05).ANOVA revealed significant differences in DE values for all tablet formulations (P&#x0003c;0.05) except for R1 versus R3 (DE, 49.6&#x000b1;2.4 vs 41.1&#x000b1;3.6; P=0.226). Products T1 and T3 showed faster dissolution rates reflected in greater DE (82.6&#x000b1;3.5 and 75.1&#x000b1;1.4, respectively); while T2, R2 and R3 exhibited slower dissolution rates as indicated in lower DE (58.8&#x000b1;2.5, 35.8&#x000b1;2.6, and 41.1&#x000b1;3.9, respectively).

It was of interest, therefore, to explore if condition of dissolution of this study, which is very similar to what is proposed by FDA, correlates with serum plasma profiles already obtained by performing bioavailability studies.</p><p>Four correlation levels have been defined as Level A, B, C, and multiple-level C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0019">19</xref>). Statistical moment analysis has been suggested as a better parameter to examine IVIVC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0009">9</xref>). In addition, a level B correlation uses all in vitro and in vivo data and was therefore employed between MRT and MDT. A poor correlation (p=0.033) between MRT and the in vitro MDT for the six products was found in the present study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003">Figure 3</xref>).</p><fig id="F0003" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Correlation between the mean dissolution time (MDT) (calculated from in vitro dissolution data) and mean residence time (MRT) (calculated from serum drug concentration data).

In addition, using the pair-wise procedure based on similarity factors (<italic>f2</italic>) which is a model independent approach, the <italic>f2</italic> values of (25.4%), (29.2%) and (25.5%) were calculated for studies, numbers 1, 2 and 3 respectively. Profiles were considered similar, where <italic>f2</italic> values lie between 50&#x02013;100%. As <italic>f2</italic> values were not in the acceptance range, the products were considered not equivalent with respect to their in vitro release characteristics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref>). Since dissolution of the drug from the test products were faster than that of the reference formulations, values of similarity factor were smaller. In order to find out a predictive in vitro dissolution method both similarity factor of in vitro dissolution testing and regression parameters of IVIVC should be taken into account. The dissolution condition which was used for amiodarone tablet formulations in the present study failed for formulations that are bioequivalent in vivo. Also very significant difference was observed between the dissolution characteristics of R1 and T1 (<italic>f2=</italic>25.4%, DE of 49.6 &#x000b1;3.5 <italic>vs</italic> 82.6&#x000b1;3.5; P&#x0003c;0.05), R2 and T2 (<italic>f2=</italic>29.2%, DE of 35.7&#x000b1;2.6 <italic>vs</italic> 58.8&#x000b1;2.5; P&#x0003c;0.05) and R3 and T3 (<italic>f2=</italic>25.5%, DE of 41.1 &#x000b1;3.9 vs 75.9&#x000b1;2.1; P&#x0003c;0.05). These products were bioequivalent in vivo as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T0001">Table 1</xref>. It seems that the dissolution medium of the present study does not completely simulate GI tract conditions. It is reported that biorelevant dissolution media could be used successfully to predict the in vivo performance of poorly water-soluble drugs. Strong correlations have been obtained with the poorly soluble drugs when of biorelevant dissolution medium is used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0020">20</xref>). Although in most cases the in vivo differences amongst MRT of the various formulations were statistically significant, they were not considerably significant to yield a strong correlation between MRT and MDT. Further studies are suggested with conventional and more sustained- release formulations using biorelevant dissolution medium. At a dose of 200 mg amiodarone HCl and aqueous solubility of 0.5 mg/ml, 400 ml of fluid are required to dissolve one dose of amiodarone HCl which results in a dosing number (D<sub>0</sub>) of 1.6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0010">10</xref>). Therefore, the volume of water which is taken initially with the dosage form will dissolve the drug to a great extent and reduces the dependency of drug absorption to the drug dissolution. This may result in a poor correlation which was obtained in this study.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="S0019"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>From the results of the present study, it may be concluded that bioequivalence studies should be conducted as the only acceptable means to ensure the interchangeability and in vivo equivalence of amiodarone generic drug products.
