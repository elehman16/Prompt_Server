In a meta-analysis of SBP reductions in 42 trials (<italic>N</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;10,698), the combination of any two medications from different BP-lowering drug classes was approximately five times more effective than doubling the dose of a single drug [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>The use of triple-combination therapy, targeting three different mechanisms of arterial hypertension pathogenesis, is becoming increasingly used to provide optimal BP control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] with fewer dose-related adverse effects.&#x000a0;In addition, each agent in the combination can lessen adverse effects of other components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. This may counteract the tendency of some physicians to prescribe lower than guideline-recommended doses of anti-hypertensive drugs because of concerns over tolerability, and the inevitable suboptimal dosing and inadequate dose titration required to achieve target BP goals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>When triple-combination therapy is required, the European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] and other guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] recommend the use of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) system inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) with a calcium channel blocker (CCB) and a diuretic as rational and effective. One such combination is perindopril, indapamide, and amlodipine. In addition to additive effects on BP control, each component of this combination has demonstrated protection of target organs at risk from hypertension including the heart, renal system, brain, and vasculature, in a wide range of patients with hypertension. The three components are also complementary in terms of tolerability: perindopril reduces the peripheral edema that is a dose-limiting side effect of CCBs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]; amlodipine reduces ACE inhibitor-related cough by decreasing prostaglandin synthesis that is induced by bradykinin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]; and indapamide is a metabolically neutral diuretic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Each individual component is associated with a large evidence base of use in arterial hypertension, and single-pill combinations have also been extensively evaluated: perindopril/indapamide has shown efficacy in patients with recurrent stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], diabetes mellitus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], and in octogenarians with hypertension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]; perindopril/amlodipine combination has been studied in detail in patients with hypertension at high cardiovascular risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p>Given the extensive experience with these agents as mono and dual therapy it was hypothesized that combining the three agents into a single-pill would maintain the established efficacy and safety of these agents while reducing dosing complexity. Knowing that some physicians may be reluctant to prescribe fixed-dose triple-therapy combinations due to concerns over tolerability, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of a triple combination of perindopril 5&#x000a0;mg/indapamide 1.25&#x000a0;mg/amlodipine 5&#x000a0;mg in a single-pill versus dual-pill combination perindopril 5&#x000a0;mg/indapamide 1.25&#x000a0;mg plus amlodipine 5&#x000a0;mg over 12&#x000a0;weeks, in treated patients with uncontrolled hypertension.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study Design</title><p>The study was an international, multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled trial conducted at 13 centers in Russia and four centers in Serbia.

These reductions were achieved in a population with treated hypertension remaining uncontrolled on maximal dose monotherapy or single-dose dual therapy (mean baseline 149.1/94.1&#x000a0;mmHg), and both treatment groups used low doses of the active components (perindopril 5&#x000a0;mg, indapamide 1.25&#x000a0;mg, amlodipine 5&#x000a0;mg). The majority of patients were responders: 89.2% (Per/Ind/Aml) and 87.1% (Per/Ind&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;Aml). The results indicate that therapy with therapeutic doses of three component antihypertensive therapies: ACE inhibitor (perindopril), CCB (amlodipine) and diuretic (indapamide) allows BP targets to be achieved in eight out of ten patients previously uncontrolled on mono or dual therapy.</p><p>Analysis of the secondary endpoints revealed that achievement of BP control was rapid. The full effect on supine SBP and DBP was attained by W4 and then maintained until the end of the study. The percentage of responders was already very high at W4, with a rate of 89% in the Per/Ind/Aml group compared with 83% in the Per/Ind&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;Aml group, and more importantly the rate of hypertension control was 88 versus 79%, respectively. Rapid attainment of target BP levels is an important goal of therapy and can lead to improved cardiovascular outcomes.&#x000a0;Results from several major cardiovascular clinical trials suggest that the risk of vascular events is significantly influenced by the time it takes to achieve BP control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p>Both triple-therapy regimens showed good tolerability and safety in the current study. The adverse events reported were in accordance with the known safety profile of the component drugs (perindopril, indapamide and amlodipine). Importantly there was no increased risk of hypotension with the use of triple therapy and no report of any peripheral edema or cough.</p><p>The study confirms previous observations from the PIANIST study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] conducted in a high-risk population, in whom target BP levels were also achieved in more than 80% patients who had previously taken two antihypertensive drug combinations, albeit at higher doses of the three components than in the present study. The results suggest that the triple-therapy Per/Ind/Aml combination is suitable for a wide spectrum of patients with hypertension at both low and high cardiovascular risk.</p><p>Neither the present study nor the PIANIST trial was designed to evaluate long-term outcomes. However, a post hoc analysis of data from ADVANCE (Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease: Preterax and Diamicron Controlled Evaluation) hints at possible advantages of a triple combination. In the blood pressure arm of ADVANCE, 11,&#x02009;140 patients with type 2 diabetes were randomly assigned to a fixed combination of perindopril/indapamide (4/1.25&#x000a0;mg) or placebo. Of these, 3427 patients were also receiving a CCB at baseline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Active treatment reduced the relative risk of death by 28% (95% CI [10%; 43%]) among patients with CCB at baseline compared with 5% (&#x02212;12 to 20%) among those without CCB (<italic>P</italic> homogeneity&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.02). The relative risk reduction for major cardiovascular events was 12% (&#x02212;8 to 28%) versus 6% (&#x02212;10 to 19%) for those with and without CCB at baseline although the difference was not statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> homogeneity&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.38). The benefit on total and cardiovascular death was seen independent of BP reduction because the group on CCBs had a 4.7&#x000a0;mm&#x02009;Hg SBP reduction, whereas the non-CCB group had a 6.2&#x000a0;mm&#x02009;Hg reduction. The treatment benefits were observed despite a higher risk profile among the patients receiving CCB, including a longer duration of type 2 diabetes, more elevated SBP and DBP, higher rates of antihypertensive drug treatment, and higher rates of previous cardiovascular disease. There was no detectable increase in adverse effects in those receiving a CCB.</p><p>The greater BP reductions achieved with antihypertensive drug combinations means that lower drug doses are required to reach BP goals with subsequent minimized adverse effects. Furthermore, one component of an antihypertensive combination therapy can reduce the occurrence of adverse events caused by a second component with a different mechanism of action. For example, thiazide diuretics lower BP by reducing volume, which may activate the renin&#x02013;angiotensin&#x02013;aldosterone system (RAAS) as a compensatory mechanism and in turn raise BP; a RAAS blocker counteracts this effect and provides additive BP control. RAAS blockers may also reduce the risk of CCB-induced edema by beneficial effects on post-capillary dilation and hydrostatic pressure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p>There are currently two other approved single-pill triple-therapy combinations available in Europe: olmesartan/amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] and valsartan/amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. However, these agents have no long-term outcome data and neither contains a diuretic that has proven efficacy in a clinical outcome trial, such as indapamide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] which is recommended by cardiology experts because of its strong morbidity and mortality data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. As the first single-pill triple-therapy combination incorporating an ACE inhibitor, Per/Ind/Aml fulfills a therapeutic need for many patients currently benefiting from an ACE-inhibitor based therapy who require an additional therapy with single pill. Clinically, ACE inhibitors and ARBs may appear similar. Both are used to treat cardiovascular risk factors and both reduce BP, stroke and symptoms of heart failure. However, the existence of clinical differences, in particular with regards to cardiovascular risk reduction, have been demonstrated by a number of authors. Recently, several meta-analyses have compared the effects of ACE inhibitors and ARBs demonstrating that ACE inhibitors prevent coronary events with reductions in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality endpoints while ARBs are, at best, efficient for the prevention of stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. One of these, which was fundamentally robust in terms of data quality and numbers analyzed (73,100 patients), showed that ACE inhibitors, but not ARBs, were associated with mortality reduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. This finding was confirmed in a further meta-analysis, performed&#x000a0;in 108,212 patients&#x000a0;without&#x000a0;heart&#x000a0;failure, but at high cardiovascular risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Parallel meta-analyses of ACE inhibitor and ARB trials vs. placebo or other active comparator, and meta-regression analyses that have adjusted for BP within the trials, have demonstrated that ACE inhibitors reduce the risk of myocardial infarction and mortality above and independently of BP lowering, whereas ARBs do not, reinforcing the need for an ACE inhibitor in a triple-therapy combination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. The meta-analysis of Ferrari et al. showed that perindopril-based trials accounted for a substantial part of the all-cause and cardiovascular mortality reduction observed with RAAS inhibitors in hypertension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].</p><p>A further benefit of a single-pill triple combination is that it reduces the complexity of the treatment regimen. The use of single-pill combinations has been shown to markedly improve patient adherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Improved adherence is associated with greater BP control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] and reduced cardiovascular events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. People with hypertension often suffer other comorbid conditions that may necessitate taking multiple medications. Healthcare providers and patients may therefore be less willing to accept additional pills to treat one condition or to increase the dose of a single agent because of concerns about increased side-effects. Single-pill triple-combination therapy can help overcome this clinical inertia by reducing dosing complexity at the same time as improving efficacy and tolerability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec16"><title>Limitations</title><p>Our study is subject to potential limitations. While randomized, the study was not conducted double blind according to the purpose of the study and its exploratory nature which compared fixed versus free combination regimens on a limited number of patients, consequently, no sample size calculation was performed and no formal power calculation were made. The type I error for statistical analyses was set at &#x003b1;&#x000a0;= 5% using a two-tailed test and no interpretation of statistical tests was provided. Due to the design of such randomized clinical trials, the enhanced compliance/adherence to treatment that would be expected with fixed combination cannot be determined; only a clinical study conducted in daily medical practice could address this issue. However, control of hypertension was demonstrated from the week 4 visit in 88% of patients on the single-pill triple-drug combination compared with 79% on dual therapy&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;amlodipine. Finally, only the lowest dose of this fixed combination was evaluated (Per/Ind/Aml 5/1.25/5&#x000a0;mg). Two higher, single-pill, triple-therapy dosages (10/2.5/5 and 10/2.5/10&#x000a0;mg) are also available on the market.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In patients with uncontrolled essential hypertension, single-pill triple therapy with perindopril 5&#x000a0;mg/indapamide 1.25&#x000a0;mg/amlodipine 5&#x000a0;mg was as effective as the same dose of a dual-pill combination of perindopril/indapamide plus separate amlodipine with earlier achievement of BP control.</p><p>Both dosing regimens produced clinically significant reductions in SBP and DBP at 1&#x000a0;month which were maintained until the end of the study.
