The Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory (NPSI, a 12-point questionnaire to evaluate different neuropathic pain symptoms) and patient global impression of change (PGIC) were also assessed at clinic visits.

As a result, the significance level for the final analysis of the primary variable was adjusted to &#x003b1;=0.049. No changes were made to the sample size, or any other analyses.</p><p>Safety variables including pharmacokinetic exposure measures were summarized using descriptive statistics for continuous variables and frequency and percentage for categorical variables. No formal hypothesis testing was performed to compare safety parameters.</p><p>The primary efficacy endpoint was the difference in mean change from baseline in mean daily pain score between the last week (week 3) of TV-45070 treatment and the last week of placebo treatment. Baseline for each treatment period was the average of the 7 mean daily pain measurements in the preceding patient-blind placebo run-in period. The mean daily pain scores for weeks 1, 2, and 3 of each treatment period were similarly defined. If the third week in a treatment period had &#x0003c;4 days of recordings, the last observation carried forward (LOCF) algorithm was used (ie, the average of the last 4 d with at least 1 pain score). The hypothesis that the mean change in mean daily pain scores from baseline would differ between TV-45070 and placebo was tested using a mixed effects analysis of covariance model, with period and sequence as fixed effects, patient within treatment sequence as a random effect, and the baseline pain score as a covariate.

LOCF indicates last observation carried forward.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ajp-33-310-g008"/></fig><p>Overall, the mean total number of rescue medication pills taken was slightly lower with TV-45070 treatment compared with placebo treatment (24.8 vs. 29.2 pills, not statistically significant).</p><p>Analyses of DSIS, NPSI, and PGIC did not demonstrate any significant differences between treatments. The LS mean change in DSIS score from baseline to week 3 with LOCF was &#x02212;0.84 on placebo and &#x02212;0.81 on TV-45070.

Forty-five of these patients were included in the efficacy evaluable population and contributed data to the exploratory R1150W subgroup analyses. Thirty-seven patients did not have the R1140W genotype, whereas 8 were heterozygous carriers of the Nav1.7 R1150W polymorphism. Given the small number of patients contributing data, no inferential analyses were performed and results were summarized.</p><p>Sixty-three percent of R1150W carriers achieved &#x02265;30% reduction in pain scores on TV-45070 treatment compared with 35% of wild-type patients, and 38% of R1150W carriers achieved &#x02265;50% reduction in pain scores compared with 24% of wild-type patients (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T6">6</xref>). In addition, the R1150W carriers showed a greater reduction in mean pain after 3 weeks of TV-45070 treatment compared with their response to placebo treatment (mean treatment difference=0.78 points).</p><table-wrap id="T6" position="float"><label>TABLE 6</label><caption><p>R1150W Mutation Status and Response to TV-45070</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ajp-33-310-g009"/></table-wrap></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>We conducted a proof-of-concept trial in 70 patients with PHN using TV-45070, a topical novel potent inhibitor of Nav1.7 and additional Navs.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Overall, TV-45070 was safe and well tolerated and unlike many commonly used orally active medications used to treat neuropathic pain, topically applied TV-45070 demonstrated an absence of drug-related central nervous system (CNS) TEAEs. This was an expected property of the product due to the low plasma concentrations (mean <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> was &#x0223c;2.1 ng/mL with a maximal individual <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> of &#x0223c;14 ng/mL) relative to plasma levels previously shown to mediate CNS effects (data not shown). The most common adverse events were local skin reactions where application site pain and pruritus were observed more frequently on placebo than TV-45070 treatment, suggesting that the TV-45070 API itself does not primarily cause dermal irritation. The local skin reactions were mostly mild (66%), with occasional moderate events (28%). These resolved spontaneously without intervention. Eight patients terminated because of an adverse event (5 during placebo treatment and 3 during TV-45070 treatment). Neither of the 2 SAEs reported in this trial were considered related to study treatment.</p><p>The PHN population studied was consistent with the typical demographic profile for other reported PHN trials with one major exception; the mean duration since diagnosis was substantially higher (76.6 mo) than reported in other PHN studies (&#x0223c;30 mo).<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Although some studies have been able to demonstrate efficacy in PHN patients who have failed prior therapies, in this study the longer duration of disease suggests a more refractory population that may have compromised the ability to demonstrate an overall treatment difference in this study.</p><p>Nevertheless, despite a potentially more refractory study population, while the primary efficacy analysis did not show differences between the treatment arms, statistical significance was observed for responder rate analyses. A statistically higher percentage of patients had a &#x02265;50% improvement in pain during TV-45070 treatment compared with placebo and a trend to &#x02265;30% improvement in pain during TV-45070 treatment compared with placebo was observed.</p><p>This positive responder rate observation suggests that a subpopulation of PHN patients exists that is more likely to have an analgesic effect and, further suggests the possibility exists that this response to topical TV-45070 could be mechanism based. Although the sample size is very small and definitive conclusions cannot be drawn, PHN patients who were carriers of the common gain-of-function R1150W polymorphism appeared more likely to experience a more robust response to TV-45070. An increase in the proportion of responders for both &#x02265;30% and &#x02265;50% improvement in pain was observed for heterozygous carriers compared with wild type. Interestingly, the placebo response was reduced in the R1150W carriers, further widening the effect size seen in this carrier subpopulation.</p><p>Although the Nav1.7 R1150W polymorphism has been associated with an increase in pain perception for a variety of painful disorders including both nociceptive and neuropathic pain as well as experimentally induced heat pain (mean increase in Visual Analog Scale of 2.0 for carriers vs. wild type),<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> these data have not yet been replicated.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Using in vitro electrophysiological testing in transfected dorsal root ganglion cells, the R1150W variant channel has previously been shown to demonstrate gain-of-function and hyperactivity.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> We postulate that enhanced pain perception mediated through an increased activity of the R1150W polymorphism may render patients more susceptible to pharmacological intervention by Nav1.7 inhibitors such as TV-45070 compared with their wild-type counterparts. These preliminary findings reported herein, when combined with the previously reported efficacy of the active ingredient of TV-45070 in IEM patients where the mutations in the <italic>SCN9A</italic> gene are known to cause a gain-of-function of Nav1.7 channel, support the continued evaluation of the R1150W polymorphism in larger clinical studies in common disorders of pain.</p><p>Human genetics has uncovered the vital importance of Nav1.7 in pain perception illuminating a critical mechanism for analgesic development.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Here, we show that topically applied TV-45070, which has potent Nav1.7 inhibition and is currently in clinical development, was safe, well tolerated, and devoid of drug-related CNS or cardiac toxicity. Although a mean difference between treatment groups was not detected, significant improvements were demonstrated with TV-45070 in a subset of PHN patients. Furthermore, based on a small analysis subpopulation, heterozygous carriers of the R1150W polymorphism appeared more likely to report a clinically meaningful response than their wild-type counterparts. These results support the potential clinical utility of pharmacological inhibition of Nav1.7 for the treatment of peripheral neuropathic pain. Given the favorable safety profile coupled with demonstrated efficacy in this PHN study, these data warrant further development of topical TV-45070 in larger, longer, parallel-design studies of patients with PHN or other peripheral neuropathic pain conditions.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>The authors would like to thank the following co-investigators and all of the site teams and Medpace Inc. personnel involved in conducting this study: Maxwell L.
