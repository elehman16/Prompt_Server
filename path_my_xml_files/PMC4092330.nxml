The REAC impulse was not administered during the scan, but after this, according to a protocol that has previously been demonstrated to be effective in improving motor control and postural balance, in healthy subjects and patients. The study was conducted on 33 healthy volunteers, performed with a 1.5&#x02005;T unit while operating a motor block task involving cyclical and alternating flexion and extension of one leg. Subsequently subjects were randomly divided into a treatment and a sham treatment control group. Repeated fMRI examinations were performed following the administration of the REAC pulse or sham treatment. The Treated group showed cerebellar and ponto-mesencephalic activation components that disappeared in the second scan, while these activation components persisted in the Sham group. This study shows that a very weak signal, such as 250 milliseconds Wi-Fi pulse, administered with REAC technology, could lead to lasting effects on brain activity modification.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>The Radio electric asymmetric conveyer (REAC) is a new technology for bio and neuro modulation. The REAC technology is based on the production of weak radiofrequency electromagnetic fields in the Wi-Fi bands (2.4&#x02013;5.8&#x02005;GHz) in order to generate a flow of electric micro currents in the body of the subject being treated. This current flow can be focused, as required, on specific areas through a probe-conveyor, peculiar of the REAC technology. In previous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref> on healthy subjects, brain activity has been shown to be sensitive to modulation by REAC treatment administered according to a protocol named Neuro Postural Optimization (NPO), which has been proven to be effective in the correction of motor disorders (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>). In fact REAC-NPO is thought to modulate and optimize motor<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref> and postural strategies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Also in patients with advanced Alzheimer's Disease<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>, REAC-NPO improved gait and number of steps &#x000d7; seconds. Cumulated experience derived from other studies supports the feasibility, safety and efficacy of this brain neuromodulation technique.</p><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Two subjects, one of NPO-Treated group and one of Sham group, were excluded during statistical analysis due to the presence of artifacts that degraded the functional images. The average patterns of activation areas before treatment were similar in the NPO-Treated and Sham groups in that they were concordant with regard to the topography of the areas activated<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. This similarity was expected given that the subjects in the two groups were performing an identical motor task. However, slight variations, statistically non-significant, between the groups with respect to the conspicuity and extent of activation were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref> vs.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">2b</xref>). Compared to the group-averaged activation patterns before REAC-NPO or sham treatment, those recorded for the two groups after NPO-REAC or sham treatment showed a decrease in the magnitude of activation, a reduction in the conspicuity of the activated areas, and a disappearance of the thalamic activation component<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figs. 3a</xref> vs.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">3b</xref>). These changes were more marked in the NPO-treated group than in the Sham group. Furthermore, the cerebellar and ponto-mesencephalic activation components that were present in the NPO-Treated group pretreatment images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figs. 4a</xref>), were completely absent in the NPO-treated post treatment images<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figs. 4b</xref>) This phenomenon was not observed when in the Sham group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figs. 4c, d</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The present randomized double-blind fMRI qualitative study, although it was conducted on 33 patients, could still be considered as a preliminary study. We chose to perform a double-blind study in order to avoid any form of conditioning of the experimenters and of the subjects. Since it was important to verify that the results could be observed regardless of variables like sex or age, we chose a simple randomization instead of a stratified randomization sampling. Consequently we accepted the risk of a numerical imbalance of the group sizes, since the essential aim of the study was the intra-group comparison of the pre- and post-procedure fMRI results.</p><p>The clinical results from previous studies on healthy subjects<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>, neurological patients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref> and subjects with advanced Alzheimer's disease<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref> seem to suggest the implementation of the same mechanism that we observe with fMRI after REAC-NPO to improve balance and gait. In this study, in both groups the post-treatment phase fMRI scans showed a reduction in the extension and in degree of activation in those areas activated during the leg motor task with respect to the first, pre-treatment phase scans.</p><p>As regards the sham group, one possible explanation of the decrease and change of activation in the parietal cortex and thalamus at the second scan, compared to the first scan, may be related to motor learning.</p><p>These reductions in activation were more pronounced in the REAC-NPO-treated group than in the Sham group. The most salient qualitative difference observed between the groups was that the REAC-NPO-treated group showed a disappearance of cerebellar and ponto-mesencephalic activation components following REAC-NPO, while these activation components persisted in the Sham group. These findings show that after REAC-NPO treatment, we obtain a reduction of the brain areas involved in the movement motor control. These results can be interpreted as a functional optimization of the brain structures that govern the coordination of motor control and balance. It is still unclear what are the mechanisms that make the effects of a single REAC-NPO treatment very stable over time, as verified in several clinical trials. Indeed, it is precisely this characteristic of long duration of the effect of REAC-NPO, which allowed us to carry out the administration of the treatment not during the fMRI scanning phase, as it happens in all other studies, conducted with different techniques<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>, but after this. Thanks precisely to the long duration of the effects of REAC-NPO, which greatly exceed the fMRI temporal resolution, we could then capture the effects of REAC-NPO treatment here showed. Probably the single REAC-NPO treatment could induce a neuromodulation of brain electrical activity and metabolism. Of course, as this study investigates a new phenomenology in the induction of neurological mechanisms in motor control and balance improvement, further studies will be needed.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Study cohort and study design</title><p>A total of 33 healthy, unpaid volunteers (19 females, 14 males), ranging in age from 19 to 54 years old (mean, 32.4 years) were recruited to participate in this double-blind randomized study.

We accepted the risk of a numerical imbalance of the group sizes, since the essential aim of the study was the intra-group comparison of the pre- and post-procedure fMRI results.</p><p>Before being subjected to the pre-treatment fMRI assessment, all subjects were investigated for the presence of functional dysmetria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>), so that at the end of fMRI examinations we could verify the clinical response to treatment in subjects treated compared to sham (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1e&#x02013;f</xref>).</p><p>All subjects underwent a pre-treatment brain fMRI examination while performing a motor task already used in a previous study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>). After the pre-treatment fMRI assessment of all the patients enrolled, a staff member allocated each patient by coin-tossing randomization, assigning subjects to the REAC-NPO treatment (NPO-Treated) group or to the sham treatment control group (Sham). The randomization procedure placed 20 subjects (15 females, 5 males) in the NPO-Treated group and 13 subjects (4 females, 9 males) in the Sham group. Then a different staff member administered the therapy, unaware if he was performing the treatment or sham. Subjects belonging to the NPO-Treated group were treated with our previously validated NPO-REAC procedure2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>), and Sham group subjects received a sham treatment. For the sham treatment, we followed the same procedures that were followed for the NPO-Treated subjects, except that the REAC device was not active. After the treatment phase, all subjects, after centering sequences, received a second fMRI examination while performing the same motor task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref>). Neither the subjects nor the radiologist nor those who have examined the data were aware of which subjects were REAC treated and which ones were Sham treated. The timing between the REAC treatment and the post-treatment fMRI scan was 20 minutes.</p><p>This study was performed in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration.

In neurological ambit, TMS is the most widely used technology<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. TMS involves the administration to the scalp of a short (~200&#x02005;ms) and powerful (0.2 to 4.0&#x02005;T) magnetic pulse through a coil.</p><p>This magnetic pulse induces in the cortical surface below the coil an electric transient current, which causes the depolarization of the cell membranes and the transinaptic depolarization of the population of cortical neurons.</p><p>The effects of TMS single pulse on the neural activity are short-term, up to about 200&#x02005;ms. TMS may also be administered with pulse trains. This mode of administration is called repetitive TMS (rTMS). The effects of rTMS persist longer than the single-pulse TMS, up to a few minutes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>.</p><p>TMS and REAC technology have in common only the fact that both induce currents in brain tissue, but the differences between these technologies are substantial.</p><p>In fact, the operating diagram of the REAC technology can be summarized as follows:</p><p>The REAC technology generates an emission of microwaves (2.4 or 5.8&#x02005;GHz) of very weak intensity (about 2&#x02005;mW at the emitter). Solely thanks to the conveyer (asymmetric probe) of the REAC technology, this emission interacts with the biological tissues of the human body. This interaction generates, also in deep tissues, radiofrequency micro-currents, variables according to the molecular characteristics of the tissues. The sum of these radiofrequency micro-currents gives rise to a resulting micro current which, concentrated by the conveyer-probe of the device, exerts its therapeutic effect.</p><p>In the brain, the REAC technology has no limits in the depth of action, unlike TMS.</p><p>Previous works and extensive clinical experience show that a single pulse REAC-NPO determines long-term effects. The persistence of these effects can be easily controlled by the stability of correction of the functional dysmetria.</p><p>The REAC technology has two main fields of application, neuromodulation and biomodulation.
