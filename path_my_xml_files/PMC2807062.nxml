Six chronic conditions were identified as criteria for inclusion in the program. Selected patients were randomized and allocated to a study group or control group.</p><p>An assessment interview was held on the phone at the outset of the Telecoaching program to assess patients' current healthcare situation. Patients were subsequently contacted by phone with a view to effecting an improvement in health in the short-term and thus preventing stays in hospital, e.g. via appointments with specialists, provision of a nurse, training on correct medication intake and regular self-control. Each patient was supervised for six months.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results</title><p>The LOH model was used to select a total of 9176 patients. One thousand and eighty of these were allocated to a control group.</p><p>Eighteen months later, the hospitalization rate for the six chronic indications was 25.3% in the study group and 28.3% in the control group. This corresponds to a relative reduction of 10.4%.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Whole patient health coaching is a suitable means of preventing hospitalization in comorbid patients.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>hospitalization</kwd><kwd>coaching</kwd><kwd>patients</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front></article>
