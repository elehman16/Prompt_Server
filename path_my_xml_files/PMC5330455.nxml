This burden is largely due to the five-fold increased risk for stroke that is associated with AF [<xref rid="pone.0170974.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. There is ample evidence that the efficacy of oral anticoagulation (OAC) in stroke prevention is excellent [<xref rid="pone.0170974.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0170974.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Nonetheless overtreatment should be avoided, as this can result in hemorrhaging, mainly intracerebral and gastrointestinal. Therefore, treatment strategies for stroke prevention have been optimized over recent years, and clinical practice guidelines describing these treatment strategies are publicly available [<xref rid="pone.0170974.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, adherence to these guidelines remains poor [<xref rid="pone.0170974.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0170974.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. This non-adherence is mainly related to underuse of OAC in patients with medium to high stroke risk. Two important reasons for OAC underuse are 1) the complexity of the decision rules used and 2) physicians&#x02019; concerns with the bleeding risk associated with OAC. However, the benefit of stroke prevention greatly outweighs the risk of bleeding due to OAC, and OAC should therefore not be withheld when indicated [<xref rid="pone.0170974.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0170974.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Studies have shown that clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) have the potential to improve guideline adherence [<xref rid="pone.0170974.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0170974.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], as these systems can make physicians aware of the guidelines when they lack the appropriate knowledge and eliminate inappropriate use of clinical decision rules. The overall effectiveness of CDSS on mortality has not been established, but a recent review did find a moderate improvement (RR = 0.82; 95% CI = [0.68, 0.99]) in morbidity outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0170974.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. CDSSs therefore present a possible solution for the issue of guideline non-adherence in stroke prevention among AF patients.</p><p>CDSS effectiveness varies by study and domain, and several studies have tried to determine what factors predict success or failure,[<xref rid="pone.0170974.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0170974.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] [<xref rid="pone.0170974.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] although it is hard to pinpoint these [<xref rid="pone.0170974.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].We have developed a CDSS that implements properties that appeared to have a positive effect on CDSS effectiveness, most notably: &#x0201c;implementing decision support as part of the workflow&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;during the time of decision making&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;optimized human-computer interface&#x0201d;[<xref rid="pone.0170974.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0170974.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Too many alerts will tend to result in all alerts being ignored, a phenomenon known as &#x0201c;alert fatigue&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pone.0170974.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Given the possible adverse effects of &#x0201c;alert fatigue&#x0201d; and interruption [<xref rid="pone.0170974.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], we considered the optimal interface to be one which minimized these effects.</p><p>In this study we investigate the effectiveness of our CDSS as measured by general practitioners&#x02019; adherence to the Dutch GP guideline for patients with atrial fibrillation. A secondary objective of this study is to gain insight into reasons for deviations from the guideline and to adjudicate these reasons with peers.</p><p>We hypothesized that the implementation of a non-obtrusive CDSS, integrated in the GP&#x02019;s workflow, will increase guideline adherence. Secondly, we expect GPs will often have valid reasons for guideline non-adherence.</p><p>This trial is registered with the Dutch Trial Register under registration number 3570. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.trialregister.nl/trialreg/admin/rctview.asp?TC=3570">http://www.trialregister.nl/trialreg/admin/rctview.asp?TC=3570</ext-link></p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec008"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>The trial protocol for this study, which was dubbed the &#x0201c;Expert-AF&#x0201d; trial, has been published elsewhere [<xref rid="pone.0170974.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Below, we will provide a short overview of the most important aspects of the methodology used.</p><sec id="sec009"><title>Design</title><p>A cluster-randomized controlled design was used.

GPs were aware that they were allocated to a variant of the system, but were blinded as to their allocation and how the variants differed.</p><fig id="pone.0170974.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0170974.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>The CONSORT flow diagram.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0170974.g001"/></fig></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Regulatory aspects</title><p>The medical ethics committee of the AMC deemed this study exempt from ethical approval because the intervention is a way of providing valid medical information to GPs and does not change medical treatment or use invasive procedures. Furthermore, only anonymized patient data was used for analysis. All GPs consented to participation in the trial.</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Population</title><p>We planned to include GP practices in the Netherlands that used the electronic health record (EHR) for which we developed a decision support plugin (an extra piece of software providing feedback that is not an integral part of the main system). All patients with AF (both incident and pre-existing) who had been in contact with their GPs during the length of the trial were evaluated. The GPs use ICPC-coded diagnoses for both care and reimbursement, thus we considered a patient to have AF if a coded diagnosis (&#x02018;K78&#x02019;) for AF was documented [<xref rid="pone.0170974.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. This method was chosen to exclude care avoiders (patients who actively avoid contact with their GP despite their condition) that could bias results.</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Intervention</title><p>We developed a CDSS for a single EHR system. This CDSS was automatically activated using event-based triggers, and responded to actions of the GP in real time [<xref rid="pone.0170974.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Our study ran concurrently with the <italic>ICOVE trial</italic> that contained 15 decision rules per randomization group [<xref rid="pone.0170974.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. For each decision rule that was not satisfied, notifications were shown in a floating notification window. The window could contain multiple notifications if multiple rules applied to the patient. Notifications contained a short (1- to 3-word) title (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0170974.g002">Fig 2</xref>). By clicking on a notification, a popup appeared that contained: background information, an actionable recommendation and two response buttons that allowed the GP to either accept or decline the advice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0170974.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Accepting or declining was logged by the plugin but had no effect on the EHR. Due to the fact that there were other notifications present in the system, GPs were likely unaware of their allocation. The Expert-AF notification was positioned at the top of the notification window. For intervention group 2 there was a small free text box that required the GP to enter a reason for deviating from the recommendation. The plugin was only active for GPs.</p><fig id="pone.0170974.g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0170974.g002</object-id><label>Fig 2</label><caption><title>The notification window in its expanded state, showing three notifications, with the AF notification at the top of the list that includes other notifications originating from other clinical rules.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0170974.g002"/></fig><fig id="pone.0170974.g003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0170974.g003</object-id><label>Fig 3</label><caption><title>The popup after clicking on a notification, containing background information, an actionable recommendation and response buttons that allowed the GP to either accept (1) or decline (2) the advice.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0170974.g003"/></fig></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Training and support</title><p>GPs were trained using three methods: a live demonstration, a PDF manual and a video demonstration. One live demonstration per GP practice was provided. Additionally, a detailed manual of the system was distributed in PDF format among all participants. Lastly, GPs were made aware per email of a 10-minute video demonstration of the system available online. Support was available during office hours via email and phone.</p></sec><sec id="sec014"><title>Decision rule</title><p>The computerized decision rule used in the Expert-AF system was based on the Revised Dutch GP guideline for atrial fibrillation, authored by the Dutch College of General Practitioners [<xref rid="pone.0170974.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. This guideline uses the CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score, which consists of 7 variables to predict risk of stroke [<xref rid="pone.0170974.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Patients can score from 0 to 9 points. All patients with a score &#x0003e;1 have an indication for OAC according to the current GP guideline. These same recommendations are made in the 2012 European Society of Cardiology guideline on atrial fibrillation [<xref rid="pone.0170974.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The HAS-BLED bleeding risk score [<xref rid="pone.0170974.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] was not yet formally introduced in the Dutch GP guideline for AF, and thus not included in the decision rule. However previous large bleeds, untreated hypertension, kidney failure and thrombotic disorders were included as contra-indications for VKA.</p></sec><sec id="sec015"><title>Baseline data collection</title><p>Baseline measurements were performed to determine the proportion of patients with AF who were treated in accordance with the guideline. Guideline adherence was determined by automatically evaluating the computerized decision rule on all patients in an anonymized copy of the GP&#x02019;s EHR databases.</p></sec><sec id="sec016"><title>Data collection during and after the study</title><p>Every action that related to the plugin was stored. Anonymized patient files were saved to confirm the system functioned properly and to determine what triggered the notifications.

The trial was conducted from October 1st, 2013 to September 1st, 2014, resulting in 240 active workdays.</p></sec><sec id="sec017"><title>Outcomes</title><p>We defined the primary outcome as the difference in the proportion of patients with AF treated in accordance with the guideline between the intervention and control groups.</p><p>A secondary outcome of the study was the reasons GPs provided for deviating from the guideline and the manner in which they responded to required justification (intervention 2).</p></sec><sec id="sec018"><title>Analysis</title><p>A power analysis accounting for clustering resulted in a required sample size of 500 patients for an effective sample size of 300 [<xref rid="pone.0170974.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>A chi-square test was used to compare between-group differences at baseline and differences in adherence rates post-study.

Four reasons for declining were related to the plugin not being able to detect Warfarin as active medication or not related to the guideline, thus only one reason for guideline non-adherence was presented, which was insufficient for further analysis.</p></sec><sec id="sec021"><title>Effectiveness</title><p>Guideline adherence, defined as the percentage of patients treated in accordance with the guideline, differed between the control and intervention groups at baseline (Control: 42%, Intervention: 50% chisq P = 0.04).

We did not find a significant difference in guideline adherence between the intervention and control groups.</p></sec><sec id="sec024"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>Strengths of this study included the decision support system feedback characteristics that built on evidence pertaining to effectiveness of decision support systems [<xref rid="pone.0170974.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0170974.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. We implemented a real-time CDSS that supported the GP during their contacts with patients by showing alerts in a non-obtrusive way. Our trial implemented many of the features that we should expect from decision support in the future. We reduced contamination by using clustered randomization. Lastly we studied a topic (prevention of stroke), that is considered highly relevant by the participating GPs.</p><p>However, this study was hampered in several ways. First, the vendor of the GP system that implemented the CDSS plugin stopped supporting it, thereby preventing us from enrolling more GPs in our trial. As initially, more GPs were included in the intervention arm, this lead to asymmetric randomization groups, reducing potential power of the study. Nonetheless the calculated sample size (n = 500) was reached, with more than 250 inclusions in each group post study. We would have preferred to develop a generic system that worked on any platform but were due to funding and organizational restrictions we were limited to working with a single vendor.</p><p>Lastly, the new guideline for the management of AF by the Dutch College of General Practitioners was introduced during the start of the trial. Combined with the fact that all GPs were trained in use of the system, it is likely there was a teaching effect, or at least a substantial increase in awareness of OAC under prescribing in patients with AF. This might have resulted in increased adherence in both groups. We selected guideline adherence as primary outcome, but perfect guideline adherence is undesirable as most guidelines do not account for complex patients with multi-morbidity and physicians often have good reasons for deviating from a guideline [<xref rid="pone.0170974.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Thus, using guideline adherence as outcome measure might have decreased the potential room for improvement of our intervention.</p></sec><sec id="sec025"><title>Comparison with existing literature</title><sec id="sec026"><title>Guideline adherence</title><p>Guideline adherence was poor both before and after the study, which is in line with other studies that specifically investigated this topic [<xref rid="pone.0170974.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0170974.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0170974.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Guideline non-adherence consisted of both under- and overtreatment, which was also present in other studies investigating OAC use [<xref rid="pone.0170974.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0170974.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0170974.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Nonetheless, the increased OAC use in both groups could indicate awareness of OAC underuse is increasing.</p></sec><sec id="sec027"><title>Effectiveness</title><p>We attribute the lack of effectiveness mainly to low usage (measured by interaction with the notifications), which had many reasons. These will be discussed in detail in a separate qualitative system evaluation. Briefly, barriers were mainly related to lack of time, too many alert notifications and limitations of the system&#x02019;s functionality. Participants in acknowledged the potential of CDSSs for the future of healthcare, but implementing these systems in daily practice for multiple domains remains challenging. Alert prioritization, user customization, tight EHR integration and strict selection of alerts might improve CDSS effectiveness. Eccles et. al. found similar low usage rates and attributed the limited effectiveness of their system to this lack of use [<xref rid="pone.0170974.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Lugtenberg et. al. recently published results on a process evaluation of &#x02018;NHGDoc&#x02019;, an EHR-integrated decision support system that was implemented in 65% of GP practices in the Netherlands. Usage of the system was as low as 0.24%, and it also did not lead to changes in outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0170974.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. A recent trial by Cook et. al. that attempted to improve prescription in AF by way of a CDSS also failed to show effectiveness of their intervention [<xref rid="pone.0170974.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. While Cook et al did not report on usage, low usage may have also hampered their study. All four studies (including ours) attempted to provide the user with a non-obtrusive system, integrated in daily workflow. To provide more insight on when CDSS might be more effective, we performed a sub-group analysis on patients with incident AF. Although this sample was too small to be adequately powered, there was a trend towards effectiveness in this sub-group (P = 0.09 vs P = 0.23), which could indicate that GPs might be more inclined to follow CDSS based recommendations when first treating a patient. However, this trend could also be due to the difference between the quality of old and new data or other biases, and should be investigated in detail in future studies.</p><p>It is still unclear what can be considered &#x02018;optimal timing&#x02019; in the busy daily practice. Its non-obtrusive nature may have been disadvantageous in a setting where patients, staff, e-mails and other matters compete for the GP&#x02019;s attention. Recent studies have indicated that systems which force the user to respond to the alert are more effective [<xref rid="pone.0170974.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], although clearly only a limited number of alerts can be presented in this way. Furthermore, physicians do not always agree with the guidelines these systems are based on,3 or have (valid) reasons for non-adherence [<xref rid="pone.0170974.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0170974.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0170974.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The number of declined recommendations (N = 44, 54%) we found in our study suggests that this is at least part of the problem. &#x02018;In terms of the recently-described &#x0201c;Two Stream Model&#x0201d;[<xref rid="pone.0170974.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], the lack of use can be attributed mainly to data quality problems and sub-optimal presentation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec028"><title>Implications for research</title><p>Guideline adherence in both the intervention and control groups increased during this trial investigating the effectiveness of a CDSS for stroke prevention. Our study could not demonstrate the effectiveness of our intervention, which was likely due to lack of use. The implementation of multi-domain CDSSs in clinical practice is challenging and future studies should investigate further improvements to facilitate effectiveness in a real-world setting. Stroke prevention in patients with AF is a field where much can be gained by following guidelines, and we therefore urge other researchers to dedicate their efforts to investigate how to effectively increase system use and guideline adherence.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec029"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0170974.s001"><label>S1 Checklist</label><caption><title>The Consort checklist for this study.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0170974.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0170974.s002"><label>S1 Dataset</label><caption><title>The cleaned dataset used for this paper.</title><p>(CSV)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0170974.s002.csv"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0170974.s003"><label>S1 Protocol</label><caption><title>The study protocol for the ExpertAF study.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0170974.s003.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0170974.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Chugh</surname><given-names>SS</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Havmoeller</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Narayanan</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Singh</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Rienstra</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Benjamin</surname><given-names>EJ</given-names></name>, <etal>et al</etal>
