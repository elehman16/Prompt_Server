One of the greatest contributors to the CS rate is elective repeat CS. Vaginal birth after caesarean (VBAC) is an option for many women; despite this the proportion of women attempting VBAC remains low. Potentially the relationship that women have with their healthcare professional may have a major influence on the uptake of VBAC. Models of service delivery, which enable an individual approach to care, may make a difference to the uptake of VBAC. Midwifery continuity of care could be an effective model to encourage and support women to choose VBAC.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>A randomised, controlled trial will be undertaken. Eligible pregnant women, whose most recent previous birth was by lower-segment CS, will be randomly allocated 1:1 to an intervention group or control group. The intervention provides midwifery continuity of care to women through pregnancy, labour, birth and early postnatal care. The control group will receive standard hospital care from different midwives through pregnancy, labour, birth and early postnatal care. Both groups will receive an obstetric consultation during pregnancy and at any other time if required. Clinical care will follow the same guidelines in both groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This study will determine whether midwifery continuity of care influences the decision to attempt a VBAC and impacts on mode of birth, maternal experiences with care and the health of the neonate. Outcomes from this study might influence the way maternity care is provided to this group of women and thus impact on the CS rate. This information will provide high level evidence to policy makers, health service managers and practitioners who are working towards addressing the increased rate of CS.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>This trial is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR): <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.anzctr.org.au/Trial/Registration/TrialReview.aspx?id=347744">ACTRN12611001214921</ext-link></p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Vaginal birth</kwd><kwd>Obstetrics</kwd><kwd>Caesarean section</kwd><kwd>Midwifery care</kwd><kwd>Vaginal birth after caesarean</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The rate of caesarean section (CS) in Australia has increased over the past decade and is now well above many similar countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. One of the greatest contributors to the overall CS rate is a woman having an elective repeat CS (ERCS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. In one Australian state, 76% of those with a previous CS who give birth at term have another CS, and one third of all CS involves women who have had a previous CS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. A National Review of Maternity Services undertaken in Australia highlighted concerns around the high rates of caesarean section and recommended that the Australian government &#x0201c;initiate targeted research aimed at improving the quality and safety of maternity services in select key priority areas, such as evidence around interventions, particularly caesarean sections&#x0201d; (page 14) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>Concerns about a high CS rate centre around growing evidence of increasing maternal morbidity associated with such operations for women, such as increased blood loss, blood clots, abdominal organ injury, need for hysterectomy and longer hospital stays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Repeat CS has also been associated with significantly higher maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality compared with caesarean or vaginal births for women who do not have a prior CS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Babies born by CS are at risk of respiratory distress syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], persistent pulmonary hypertension and admission to a neonatal intensive care unit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Neonatal mortality rates have been reported to be 1.7 to 1.9 times higher amongst babies born by CS compared with those born vaginally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Previous CS has also been associated with an increased risk of stillbirth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>As an alternative, women who have had a previous lower-segment CS, and an uncomplicated pregnancy, can be offered to attempt a vaginal birth after CS (VBAC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. However, a cross-sectional study undertaken in one Australian state (New South Wales) showed that, despite this, the rate of VBAC declined significantly between 1998 and 2006 (from 31% to 19%, respectively) and the proportion of women who attempted a vaginal birth also declined (from 49% to 35%, respectively) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In this study, more than half the women (59%) who attempted VBAC were successful [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>The best available international evidence suggests that VBAC does not increase the risk of hysterectomy or maternal mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Neonatal mortality rate, after adjustments are made for pre-existing fetal anomalies, has been reported to be 24 per 10,000 for women who planned a VBAC compared with 9 per 10,000 for those who planned a repeat CS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Although this results in an increased risk, the absolute risk is small, and comparable to the background risk of neonatal mortality for women having their first baby [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In the USA, a large prospective observational study involving nearly 46,000 women showed that planned VBAC was associated with a 1% increased risk of a blood transfusion, a 1% increased risk of endometriosis, and a 0.7% risk of symptomatic uterine rupture. Rates of uterine rupture for women who undergo a planned VBAC have been reported to be in the range of 22&#x02013;74 per 10,000, compared with a risk of 0.5&#x02013;2 per10,000 births in women with non-scarred uteri [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Other evidence shows a lesser increase in risk of perinatal mortality for VBAC, with a risk difference of 1.5 per 10,000 births compared with repeat caesarean section [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Therefore offering women the opportunity to attempt VBAC, in an appropriately staffed and resourced maternity unit, is a safe and ethical innovation to test.</p><p>Whereas no studies have examined the effects of midwifery continuity of care, some research has examined what influences women to choose VBAC. One study from the USA showed that the major influences were the woman&#x02019;s sense of control in the decision-making process and the clinician&#x02019;s encouragement of VBAC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Whereas these were not linked to a model of care, it is well established that midwifery continuity of care programs increase women&#x02019;s sense of control over decision making, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] hence the logical link in our hypothesis. Two randomised controlled trials evaluating different antenatal education interventions designed to increase VBAC rates have been published and neither intervention altered VBAC rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. One of the studies showed that consistent information using a decision-aid booklet reduced decisional conflict [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. We plan to build on this evidence by providing consistent antenatal information from a small group of midwives, together with continuity of care in labour and birth.</p><sec><title>The intervention: midwifery continuity of care</title><p>Midwifery continuity of care allows women to develop a relationship with the same caregivers throughout pregnancy, birth, and the postnatal period. Women have a midwife caring for them during labour and birth whom they have met before and feel that they know, and this trusting relationship increases their confidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Women with a previous CS are often included in trials of midwifery continuity of care although they have not been specifically studied or targeted.</p><p>Midwifery continuity of care per se has been widely studied. A systematic review in the Cochrane Library examining midwifery continuity of care included 11 trials (12,276 women). Women who had midwife-led models of care were less likely to use regional analgesia (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.73&#x02013;0.91) or have an instrumental birth (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.78&#x02013;0.96), and were more likely not to use intrapartum analgesia/anaesthesia (RR 1.16, 95% CI 1.05&#x02013;1.29), experience spontaneous vaginal birth (RR 1.04, 95% CI 1.02&#x02013;1.06), feel in control during labour and childbirth (RR 1.74, 95% CI 1.32&#x02013;2.30), and initiate breastfeeding (RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.03&#x02013;1.76) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Three trials have shown that midwifery continuity of care significantly reduced the CS rate: one small trial in Canada [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] and two in Australia, the most recent being published in 2012 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p><p>In preliminary work for this trial, we reviewed the outcomes of a midwifery continuity of care program at one NSW hospital and compared the VBAC rate in the program with the rates in the area health service (AHS) in which the hospital is situated. The rate of attempted VBAC was 62.5% in the midwifery continuity of care program compared with 27% for the AHS and the vaginal birth rate was considerably higher in the program (76% and 54%, respectively). There was no increase in adverse outcomes for mothers or babies, although the total numbers in this evaluation were small (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;377) (unpublished data). These data, although from a small number of women, provide some evidence to support the hypothesis to be tested in this trial, that is, that midwifery continuity of care will increase the proportion of women who attempt VBAC, increasing the overall rate of vaginal birth and reducing the CS rate.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>The study uses a two arm, un-blinded randomised controlled design, to compare the outcomes for women who had midwifery continuity of care compared with those who had standard maternity care.</p><sec><title>Aim and objectives</title><p>The primary aim is to determine whether midwifery continuity of care for women with a previous CS increases the proportion of women who attempt vaginal birth in their current pregnancy. The primary hypothesis is that women with a previous CS, who are eligible for a vaginal birth and receive midwifery continuity of care, will be 50% more likely to choose to attempt a vaginal birth in their current pregnancy than similar women receiving standard care.</p><p>The secondary aims are to determine whether midwifery continuity of care increases the proportion of women experiencing a vaginal birth, and affects neonatal health or the emotional outcomes for women; and to explore the differences in women&#x02019;s experiences of care and the decision making processes between the groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Study population</title><p>All eligible women booking maternity care at two study sites in Australia will be invited to participate.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample size</title><p>Our study of VBAC in NSW [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] showed that only 35% of women who are eligible for a vaginal birth following one previous CS attempted VBAC. The trial is designed to detect a clinically significant increase in the primary outcome, attempted VBAC, from 35% to 52.5%. In order to detect this difference 274 women will be required, providing 80% power with &#x003b1;&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.05. To allow for a 15% loss to follow-up, a total of 332 women will be required, 166 in each group. This sample size will also be sufficient to demonstrate a significant improvement in VBAC success rates from 53% to 70.5% (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;262).</p><p>The data informing the sample size calculations are drawn from a published cross-sectional study using population-based data from NSW [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] and descriptive data from the Obstetrix perinatal database at one of our study sites. Currently, midwives at this hospital providing continuity of care to women eligible for a VBAC are achieving attempt rates of 62.5% and success rates of 76%.</p></sec><sec><title>Control and intervention groups</title><sec><title>Intervention</title><sec><title>Midwifery continuity of care (CofC)</title><p>Women allocated to the intervention group will receive midwifery continuity of care from a small group of midwives.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] The midwives provide care during the antenatal, labour and birth, and postnatal periods (to two weeks postnatal). Midwives will adhere to The National Midwifery Guidelines for Consultation &#x00026; Referral [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. All women will have an appointment with an obstetric consultant during pregnancy (to re-assess VBAC suitability and discuss the birth plan). If a woman develops complications during pregnancy and requires additional care, she will continue with the midwifery continuity of care model while also attending obstetric or other consultations (this is the same for both groups). Labour and birth care will be provided at the hospital&#x02019;s birth unit/labour ward and postnatal care will be provided in hospital or the woman&#x02019;s own home following discharge from hospital.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Control</title><sec><title>Standard midwifery care</title><p>Women allocated to the control group will receive the current model of public maternity care at the two study sites.

This will be the first Australian and international randomised controlled trial of midwifery continuity of care that focuses on women who have had a previous CS. High level evidence on midwifery continuity of care shows that these models increase women&#x02019;s sense of control over decision making [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] hence the link in our hypothesis &#x02013; that is, increased control will impact on decision making and increase rates of attempted vaginal birth.</p><p>Pregnancy, birthing and early parenthood are profoundly important life experiences that directly affect almost 300,000 families in Australia each year. An increasing CS rate is of national and international concern. The Editor of the prestigious journal Birth wrote in 2007 &#x0201c;reducing the caesarean birth rate worldwide is a complex and difficult task that must be tackled on many fronts using multiple strategies&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. A key finding of the Maternity Services Review in Australia was that the CS rate was higher than many similar countries and this highlighted the need for more research in this area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The Australian National Maternity Services Plan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] has also drawn attention to the fact that the high rates of caesarean section are often compounded by a lack of support for vaginal births after caesarean section providing preliminary evidence that midwifery continuity of care will indeed increase VBAC.</p><p>This will be the first national and international trial that has tested midwifery continuity of care as an intervention to increase vaginal birth rates in women who have had a previous CS. Although a number of studies have focused on interventions that improve the rates of attempted and/or successful VBAC, they have not been able to demonstrate their effectiveness. This study will provide this evidence that can be used to improve maternal outcomes while maintaining the safety of Australian mothers and babies.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>CH, MF and DD hypothesized the link between midwifery continuity of care and VBAC uptake and designed the randomised controlled trial and contributed to drafts of the paper.
