Moreover, CVD-related death rates are considered an epidemic in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Research shows that cardiac rehabilitation (CR) participation reduces death and improves disability and quality of life. Given the growing epidemic of CVD in LMICs and the insufficient evidence about CR programs in these countries, a Randomized Control Trial (RCT) in Latin America is warranted.</p></sec><sec><title>Objective</title><p>To investigate the effects of comprehensive CR on functional capacity and cardiovascular risk factors.</p></sec><sec><title>Method</title><p>The design is a single-blinded RCT with three parallel arms: comprehensive CR (exercise + education) versus exercise-based CR versus wait-list control (no CR). The primary outcome will be measured by the Incremental Shuttle Walk Test. Secondary outcomes are risk factors (blood pressure, dyslipidemia, dysglycemia, body mass index and waist circumference); tertiary outcomes are heart health behaviors (exercise, medication adherence, diet, and smoking), knowledge, and depressive symptoms. The CR program is six months in duration. Participants randomized to exercise-based CR will receive 24 weeks of exercise classes. The comprehensive CR group will also receive 24 educational sessions, including a workbook. Every outcome will be assessed at baseline and 6-months later, and mortality will be ascertained at six months and one year.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This will be the first RCT to establish the effects of CR in Latin America. If positive, results will be used to promote broader implementation of comprehensive CR and patient access in the region and to inform a larger-scale trial powered for mortality.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords: </title><kwd>coronary artery disease</kwd><kwd>rehabilitation</kwd><kwd>patient education</kwd><kwd>randomized controlled trials</kwd><kwd>protocol</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="1"/><table-count count="1"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="30"/><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>BULLET POINTS</title><list list-type="bullet" id="L1"><list-item><p>CVD is growing in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Cardiac Rehabilitation (CR) programs are grossly underdeveloped.</p></list-item><list-item><p>There is insufficient evidence about CR programs in LMICs.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The effects of comprehensive CR will be evaluated in an RCT.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Results will be used to improve care of cardiac patients in Brazil.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The most prevalent non-communicable disease globally, namely cardiovascular disease (CVD), is also the leading cause of mortality, with over 80% of the deaths occurring in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs)<xref rid="B001" ref-type="bibr">

</xref>. A recent review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of CR in LMICs identified only two RCTs, neither of which was undertaken in Latin America<xref rid="B013" ref-type="bibr">

</xref>. To support broader CR delivery and service reimbursement, we must robustly demonstrate that CR is beneficial in this context. Accordingly, the objectives of this trial are to investigate pragmatically whether participation in a comprehensive CR program (i.e., exercise with education) in a Latin American MIC results in better functional capacity, cardiovascular risk factor control, health behavior, disease-related knowledge, depressive symptoms, and lower mortality when compared to exercise-only CR or wait-list control. It is hypothesized that participants randomized to comprehensive CR will have significantly better outcomes than those participating in exercise-based CR or not participating.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Method</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>The design is a single-blinded, single-site, pragmatic, superiority RCT with three parallel arms: comprehensive CR (education and exercise) <italic>versus</italic> exercise-based CR (no education, as delivered in Brazil) <italic>versus</italic> wait-list control (i.e., no CR).

Given the lower rates of screening and treatment of CV risk factors in the middle-income setting, we expect mortality rates and treatment effects to be higher than in high-income countries from where the RCTs summarized in the Cochrane review stemmed.</p></list-item></list><p>This data will be obtained from the center&#x02019;s health system records and will be supplemented by family report via phone to capture deaths that may have occurred outside the hospital.

</xref>. Conservatively assuming a 60% recruitment rate and a 70% retention rate (taking into consideration attrition due to death and loss to follow-up), we would need to approach 443 patients to achieve a sample of 267 at pretest and 186 at post-test (i.e., 62 per group).</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>First, session attendance of participants in the two CR arms will be explored as a manipulation check. Second, differences in participants&#x02019; sociodemographic and clinical characteristics will be compared between groups to identify any chance difference that may have occurred despite random assignment, using chi-square and analysis of variance as appropriate. Third, retention rate will be computed, and differences in the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of participants retained versus lost to follow-up will be compared using chi-square and t-tests as appropriate.</p><p>All statistical analyses will be performed considering the intention-to-treat analysis and a per protocol basis to mitigate bias. For the primary outcome of functional capacity, an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) will be performed, with group (i.e., comprehensive CR <italic>versus</italic> exercise-based CR <italic>versus</italic> wait-list control) and pre-test distance as the independent variables and the distance on the shuttle walk test at post-test as the dependent variable, adjusting for any clinical and sociodemographic biases based on retention. For risk factors, ANCOVAs will also be computed with post-test scores as the dependent variable, experimental group as the independent variable, and pre-test scores as covariates. Post-hoc tests will be performed where significant group differences are observed. A Bonferroni correction will be applied as there are multiple secondary outcomes.</p><p>A similar approach will be used to assess group differences in health behaviors, depressive symptoms and knowledge (except for smoking where a logistic regression model will be run). Finally, a chi-square test will be performed to evaluate mortality by group.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>It is anticipated that this trial will confirm the beneficial effects of CR in Brazil; however, the trial has not been powered for the tertiary outcome of mortality. To convince payers, namely governments and private insurance companies, to reimburse CR services, robust evidence demonstrating the CR participation results in reduced mortality, as well as unplanned readmissions would be compelling. Therefore, the results of the trial, if positive, will be used as the basis for sample size calculations for a larger trial powered to test the effects of CR (comprehensive or otherwise) on mortality, with re-hospitalizations as a secondary outcome. This trial would likely need to be multi-center to achieve the required sample size.</p><p>This trial as designed does have some limitations. First, it is a single-site study, which may limit generalizability. Potential addition of a second site is currently under consideration. Moreover, it is being undertaken in a publically funded center. The majority of Brazilians receive care in publically funded institutions increasing generalizability, but caution will be warranted in generalizing results to patients receiving cardiac care in privately funded settings. The benefit of undertaking the trial in the publically funded system is that all participants can receive the CR intervention without financial barriers. On a related note, as we are evaluating patients assisted by the public healthcare system, many will have low educational attainment and may have difficulty comprehending the questionnaires. Study staff will administer the scales to participants verbally in instances of low literacy or numeracy.</p><p>Third, participants may not fully adhere to the CR sessions; however, session attendance will be extracted from CR charts so that this can be considered in statistical analysis if appropriate. Fourth, there is no administrative source of data to ascertain our tertiary outcome of mortality, i.e., when patients die outside the clinical center where the trial is being undertaken. Unfortunately, many LMICs do not have strong systems of vital registration. For this reason as well, cause of death may not be ascertainable, and hence only total or all-cause mortality will be reported for the purposes of this trial. Nevertheless, mortality ascertainment via the center and family report should capture all events. Finally, the primary and secondary trial outcomes are all surrogate. If we observe improvements in functional capacity and risk factors, this will suggest potential mechanisms by which CR might improve survival and morbidity. There have been no CR trials in LMICs with mortality as an outcome and therefore this trial is a necessary preliminary step to achieving that.</p><p>Overall, if positive, the results of this trial will be used to advocate for greater implementation of CR and hence improve the care of cardiac patients in Brazil more broadly, as well as in other Latin American countries.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial status</title><p>Recruitment started March 2015. Between March 2015 and September 2015, 41 patients have consented to participate in this trial. Post-test assessments are now commencing. Recruitment has been slower than anticipated due to a strike by cardiopulmonary technicians.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to acknowledge Heart &#x00026; Stroke/Richard Lewar Centre of Excellence for providing fellowship funding for Gabriela Lima de Melo Ghisi during 2014/2015 and Canadian Institutes for Health Research (CIHR) during 2015-2017.
