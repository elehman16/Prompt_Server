Adult volunteers with JC pollinosis were divided into four groups: an MLK 7-day administration group (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;27), an MLK 3-day administration group (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;27), an MLK 1-day administration group (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;26), and a placebo group (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;26).

These results suggest that prophylactic administration of MLK is effective and safe in the treatment of SAR.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>Early intervention</kwd><x xml:space="preserve">, </x><kwd>Environmental exposure chamber</kwd><x xml:space="preserve">, </x><kwd>Japanese cedar pollinosis</kwd><x xml:space="preserve">, </x><kwd>Montelukast Clinical Trial Registration: UMIN Clinical Trials Registry number</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S5"><title>Introduction</title><p>The prevalence of seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR) has been increasing over the last decade and now affects up to about 30% of the Japanese population<sup><xref rid="C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. Since the land-shape of Japan is long in the north&#x02013;south direction and possesses four distinct seasons with different climates within the different regions, pollen from more than 4500 kinds of weeds and trees disperse all over the country. Although there are patients with pollinosis to each of these various pollens, Japanese cedar (JC) pollen is the cause of seasonal allergic rhinitis with the largest number of patients. A very large amount of JC pollen disperses over hundreds of kilometers from the beginning of February to late April<sup><xref rid="C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>.</p><p>According to a recent epidemiological study, the prevalence of JC pollinosis is 26.5% and an approximately 10% increase has been observed over the past 10 years<sup><xref rid="C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. In addition, the decrease in the age of onset is marked in urban areas. An increase in the amount of JC pollen in the past decade has been cited as one reason for this.</p><p>JC pollinosis patients suffer from very severe nasal and ocular symptoms as a result of pollen dispersal over a 2.5-month period. These symptoms develop and steadily grow with daily pollen dispersion, and decreases patients' quality of life<sup><xref rid="C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>.</p><p>Allergic rhinitis (AR) is a type I allergic disease, and its nasal symptoms consist of sneezing, nasal discharge and nasal obstruction. Immediate and delayed allergic reactions are associated with pro-inflammatory mediators such as histamine, proteases, cysteinyl leukotrienes (CysLTs), prostaglandins, and platelet activating factor, as well as infiltration of inflammatory cells. It has been suggested that not only histamine, but also CysLTs plays an important role in the pathogenesis of allergic rhinitis<sup><xref rid="C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. The actions of CysLTs released after allergen exposure in AR are mediated through the LT1 receptor, which include increased nasal vascular permeability and stimulation of mucous glands. The former produces edema formation in the nasal tissue which contributes to nasal obstruction and the latter increases mucous production and secretion which leads to rhinorrhea<sup><xref rid="C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>.</p><p>Montelukast (MLK) is a cysteinyl leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) that has been proved to be effective and tolerable in the treatment of SAR<sup><xref rid="C6" ref-type="bibr">6&#x02013;8</xref></sup>. It significantly improves daytime and nighttime nasal symptoms as compared with placebo. According to a systematic review of randomized trials of the effect of LTRA monotherapy, its efficacy in the treatment of SAR is better than that of placebo and equivalent to antihistamines<sup><xref rid="C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>.</p><p>Japanese guidelines for AR, developed by Japanese AR specialists, recommend treatment plans for patients with JC pollinosis in consideration of Japanese circumstances, one of which is administration of a second-generation antihistamine or LTRA before the start of pollen dispersal<sup><xref rid="C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. One clinical study investigating the efficacy of early intervention with LTRA in the prevention of JC pollen symptoms has shown the effectiveness of LTRA in reducing SAR symptoms throughout the JC pollen dispersal period<sup><xref rid="C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. However, there have been no studies on how many days before pollen dispersal it is optimal to start administration of this kind of drug.</p><p>The aim of this study was to assess the optimal duration of early intervention with MLK 10&#x02009;mg in the treatment of allergen-induced symptoms in patients with JC pollinosis using a pollen exposure chamber (OHIO chamber).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="S6"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S0006-S2001" disp-level="2"><title>Study population</title><p>Adult volunteers with JC pollinosis were recruited to participate in the study.

The following medications were prohibited throughout the study periods: steroid injections, oral or intranasal steroids, antihistamines, all other LTRA, or tranquilizers, or topical decongestants.</p><p>Subjects who were considered ineligible by the physician in charge were excluded as well.</p><p>This study was conducted in conformity with good clinical practice guidelines and the Declaration of Helsinki of 1995 (as revised in Edinburgh in 2000). The study protocol was reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board of the Shinanozaka Clinic (Tokyo, Japan).

During screening and treatment periods, the subjects were exposed to JC pollen in a temperature- and humidity-controlled pollen exposure chamber (OHIO chamber)<sup><xref rid="C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. The OHIO chamber, located in the Samoncho Clinic in Tokyo, is a specialized room capable of accommodating a maximum of 14 persons that was set up for the purpose of dispersing a fixed concentration of JC pollen. Subjects are exposed to JC pollen at a concentration of 8000&#x02009;grains/m<sup>3</sup> for 3 hours, and were instructed to grade and record the severity of their nasal symptoms (sneezing, nasal discharge, nasal obstruction, and itchy nose) every 15&#x02009;minutes according to the following 5-point scale: 0&#x02009;=&#x02009;none (no symptoms); 1&#x02009;=&#x02009;mild (symptoms present but easily tolerated); 2&#x02009;=&#x02009;moderate (awareness of symptoms, bothersome but tolerable); 3&#x02009;=&#x02009;severe (definite awareness of symptoms; difficult to tolerate but does not interfere with the activities of daily living); 4&#x02009;=&#x02009;very severe (difficult to tolerate and interferes with the activities of daily living).</p><fig id="F0001" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.&#x02002;</label><caption><p>Study design.

The screening exposure in the OHIO chamber was performed in order to ensure they would respond adequately to the pollen stimulation. The TNSS of the subjects during the last 1 hour was assessed. Subjects were enrolled in the study if their TNSS score was at least 3 and their score for nasal obstruction was at least 2 on one occasion.</p></sec><sec id="S0006-S2004" disp-level="2"><title>Treatment period</title><p>Administration of the study drug was commenced 14 days (&#x000b1;1&#x02009;day) after the completion of the screening period. The actual drug consisted of capsules filled with MLK 10&#x02009;mg and crystalline lactose. The placebo consisted of capsules containing crystalline lactose alone, whose external appearance was indistinguishable from that of the actual drug. The subjects were randomly divided into the following four groups who took one capsule daily at bedtime (from day 1 to day 7): a group that took MLK 10&#x02009;mg for 7 days (7-day group); a group that took the placebo for 4 days and then took MLK 10&#x02009;mg for 3 days (3-day group); a group that took the placebo for 6 days and then took MLK 10&#x02009;mg for 1&#x02009;day (1-day group); and a group that took placebo for 7 days (placebo group). Subjects were exposed to pollen in the OHIO chamber on the morning of the last medication (day 8). The exposure started at 9&#x02009;a.m. The use of rescue drugs such as antihistamines, LTRA, systemic or intranasal steroids, and vasoconstrictor was not allowed during the treatment period.</p></sec><sec id="S0006-S2005" disp-level="2"><title>Endpoints</title><p>The primary efficacy endpoints were evaluated by comparing the changes from baseline in the TNSS of the subjects during the last hour of allergen exposure.

The amount of nasal discharge was measured by collecting previously weighed facial tissues every 30&#x02009;minutes. The weight difference between the tissue before and after use was considered the amount of nasal discharge (g). The number of sneezes was counted and self-reported by each subject every 15&#x02009;minutes.</p></sec><sec id="S0006-S2006" disp-level="2"><title>Safety</title><p>Safety was evaluated throughout the study period.

To explore the dose&#x02013;response pattern, the contrast coefficient vectors of administration [placebo, 1-day, 3-day, and 7-day] were set as follows: (1) a linear [3&#x02002;1&#x02002;&#x02212;1&#x02002;&#x02212;3], (2) plateau by 3-day administration [5&#x02002;1&#x02002;&#x02212;3&#x02002;&#x02212;3], and (3) plateau by 1-day administration [3&#x02002;&#x02212;1&#x02002;&#x02212;1&#x02002;&#x02212;1]. The error covariance was estimated with a repeated-measure analysis of covariance model with the baseline score as the covariate. The analysis model was included in the interaction between administrations and time point. <italic>P</italic>-value was calculated with adjustment of multiplicity by concurrent analysis of three patterns. The significance level was set at the one-sided 2.5%. The differences between the placebo group and the active treatment groups had been confirmed beforehand after calculation of the average of the mean TNSS scores during the last hour of allergen exposure and the two-sided 95% confidence interval (CI). The same method was applied to analyze the mean changes in the individual nasal scores (sneeze, nasal discharge, and nasal obstruction).</p><p>In the comparison of treatment groups, the statistical superiority of each of the three treatment groups (7-day, 3-day, or 1-day) compared with placebo was analyzed by following a hierarchy of conditions (step-down procedures). First, the 7-day administration group was compared with placebo (unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test, values of <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05 were considered to be statistically significant). If the 7-day administration was superior to placebo, the second analysis set was performed. In the second set, the 3-day administration group was compared with placebo, in the same manner as in the first step. If the 3-day administration was superior to placebo, the third analysis set was be performed. In the third analysis set, the 1-day administration group was compared with placebo, in the same manner.</p><p>The analyses were performed using SAS for Windows Ver.8.2 (SAS Institute, Inc., Japan).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Results</title><sec id="S0007-S2001" disp-level="2"><title>Study subjects</title><p>Out of a total 230 subjects who were screened for eligibility, 106 subjects (45 males and 61 females), who satisfied the inclusion criteria and did not have exclusion criteria, completed the study.

Ten adverse events were documented, of which mild drowsiness in two subjects were regarded as being possibly related to MLK. All of the adverse events were mild and were resolved without any medication.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study was conducted to investigate how many days from JC pollen dispersal to the start of administration of LTRA is sufficient in order to suppress symptoms induced in an artificial pollen exposure chamber. Nasal and ocular symptoms induced by constant but high concentrations of pollen for a short duration in the strictly controlled chamber are the result of an acute allergic reaction, whereas symptoms elicited during the natural pollen season are the result of the repeated exposure of pollen over a long duration<sup><xref rid="C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. However, a recent study demonstrated that symptoms elicited in the chamber are similar to those observed during the pollen season<sup><xref rid="C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. Thus this study model was considered to be suitable one. The maximum contrast method is a statistical procedure first introduced to analyze dose&#x02013;response patterns for biomedical or toxicological studies to determine the minimum effective dose in clinical trials, the minimum toxic dose in toxicity studies, or a plausible dose&#x02013;response pattern in dose&#x02013;response studies<sup><xref rid="C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. We applied this method to investigate the optimal duration of administration of the study drug in the prevention of SAR symptoms. The study demonstrated that significant suppression in TNSS during exposure of pollen were observed in the MLK-treated groups, regardless of the number of days of administration, as compared with the placebo group. As for individual symptoms, nasal obstruction and nasal discharge but not sneezing were suppressed in MLK-treated groups and showed a similar pattern to the TNSS profile. Interestingly, the effect for nasal obstruction was shown to be significantly lower in the MLK groups, irrespective of the number of days of administration, compared to the placebo group. These findings indicate that administration of MLK 10&#x02009;mg at least 1&#x02009;day prior to pollen exposure reduces the development of nasal symptoms in the subjects with JC pollinosis.</p><p>Several studies have been published evaluating the clinical efficacy and safety of MLK monotherapy or combined with antihistamine in the treatment of SAR under natural pollen exposure<sup><xref rid="C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. According to a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized studies, treatment with MLK for 2&#x02013;4 weeks reduced daytime and nighttime nasal symptoms, rhinoconjunctivitis quality of life, and eye symptoms compared with placebo<sup><xref rid="C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. On the other hand, an environmental exposure unit (EEU) study in which the efficacy of MLK was evaluated and compared with levocetirizine in the subjects with SAR<sup><xref rid="C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>, treatment with MLK showed significant improvement in the nose and eye symptoms, especially in nasal obstruction, as compared with placebo. Also, it showed an early onset of action of MLK after 1.5 hours of administration and remained effective for 24 hours.</p><p>In the present study, the effects of MLK on individual nasal symptoms showed that there was no significant difference in sneezing, but it suppressed nasal discharge and nasal congestion during pollen exposure and a significant difference in nasal obstruction was found in the last hour of exposure. CysLts have multi-functional properties in the pathogenesis of AR<sup><xref rid="C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. Direct challenge of LTD4 on the nasal mucosa in patients with AR significantly increased nasal secretions within 5&#x02009;minutes with increased nasal mucosal blood flow and nasal resistance<sup><xref rid="C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. CysLts also increased vascular permeability which results in nasal obstruction<sup><xref rid="C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>, a symptom which causes a deterioration in QOL the most in the patients with SAR. Since LTRA does not stimulate the sensory nerves<sup><xref rid="C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>, sneezing seems not to be a correlated symptom. Although treatment with MLK showed significant improvement in sneezing in clinical studies of patients with AR<sup><xref rid="C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>, its mechanisms have not been clearly demonstrated. Our findings, that a significant suppression of nasal obstruction and discharge in MLK groups was observed compared with that in placebo, appears to be consistent with the pharmacological features of this drug<sup><xref rid="C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>.</p><p>Reduction in the number of eosinophils is known to be another pharmacological action of LTRA<sup><xref rid="C22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. After treatment with MLK in patients with mild asthma, a significant decrease in the number of eosinophils was observed in a randomized, double-blind crossover study<sup><xref rid="C23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. Thus, MLK taken several days in advance suppresses the infiltrations of inflammatory cells, especially eosinophils, into the nasal mucosa, which may be attributable to a reduction in the nasal obstruction.</p><p>Treatment with a second-generation antihistamine just before pollen dispersal has been popular in Japan in the management of SAR and its ability to suppress the symptoms or delay the onset of symptoms has been superior to treatment which was started after the appearance of SAR symptoms during the pollen dispersion period<sup><xref rid="C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. Several studies published in Japanese journals have confirmed the prophylactic effects of antihistamines<sup><xref rid="C24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. In contrast, there have been only two studies of LTRAs in the prophylactic treatment of SAR compared with placebo or antihistamine<sup><xref rid="C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="C25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. Both randomized controlled studies were conducted with grass/cereals pollinosis or JC pollinosis patients under natural pollen exposure. One study, in which the number of participants was not large enough, showed that cetirizine or MLK monotherapy administered 6 weeks prior to the beginning of pollen season did not show significant improvement in rhinitis symptoms, whereas the treatment with combined these two drugs was effective in preventing in-season symptom<sup><xref rid="C25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. The other study conducted in Japan, however, showed that LTRA started before the pollen season was significantly effective in reducing SAR symptoms and deterioration of QOL as compared with placebo<sup><xref rid="C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. In the present study, using a JC pollen exposure chamber, MLK administered prior to pollen exposure significantly suppressed allergen induced symptoms. Since limited data are available regarding the prophylactic efficacy in the treatment of SAR with LTRA, a study in large number of participants would be needed in a clinical setting.</p><p>Onset of action of MLK in SAR under natural pollen exposure has been investigated in double-blind placebo controlled trials. The results of these showed that significant relief in daytime and nighttime symptoms can been achieved starting on day 2<sup><xref rid="C26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>. Although our study is an acute environmental exposure model, the results showing suppression of symptoms in response to administration of MLK for at least 1&#x02009;day appear to be valid. The short duration of taking drugs before pollen dispersal would be beneficial to patients with SAR because of the large quantity of JC pollen which disperses for a long time period.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, MLK 10&#x02009;mg treatment started 1 or more days in advance before pollen exposure significantly suppressed the nasal obstruction and discharge induced in the OHIO chamber. This study is the first one to investigate assessing the preventive effects of MLK using a pollen exposure chamber. Our results indicate that SAR due to JC pollen would be more effectively controlled by pre-seasonal treatment with MLK in a clinical settings.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors thank the staff at Samoncho Clinic for their help in conducting this study.</p></ack><sec id="S10"><title>Transparency</title><sec id="s1a"><title>Declaration of funding</title><p>This study was supported by a grant from Public Health Research Foundation, Tokyo Japan.</p><p><bold>Declaration of financial interest</bold></p><p>The authors have no relevant financial relationships to disclose.</p></sec></sec><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="C1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="web">Committee of Practical Guidelines for the Management of Allergic Rhinitis.
