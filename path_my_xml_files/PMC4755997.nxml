control of the lower-extremity, balance and walking endurance could be clinically applied
to subacute stroke inpatient group therapy. [Subjects and Methods] Twenty subacute stroke
patients were randomly assigned to the intervention group (n=10) or the control group
(n=10). The intervention consisted of a structured, progressive, inpatient circuit
training program focused on mobility and gait training as well as physical fitness
training that was performed for 90 minutes, 5 days a week for 4 weeks. The control group
received individual physiotherapy of neurodevelopmental treatment for 60 minutes, 5 days a
week for 4 weeks. Outcome measures were lower-extremity motor control, balance, gait
endurance and activities of daily living before and after 4 weeks. [Results] There were no
significant differences at baseline between the two groups. After 4 weeks, both groups
showed significant improvements in all outcome measures, but there were no significant
differences between the two groups during the invention period. [Conclusion] In spite of
the small sample size, these findings suggest that task-oriented circuit training might be
used as a cost-effective and alternative method of individual physiotherapy for the motor
recovery of lower-extremity, balance and walking endurance of subacute stroke
patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Stroke</kwd><kwd>Rehabilitation</kwd><kwd>Circuit training</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Stroke is a common, serious, and disabling health-care problem throughout the world<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Intensive rehabilitation therapy in the
subacute phase of stroke recovery is essential for recovery of functional ability<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. In Korea, most patients want to receive
intensive conventional rehabilitation therapy, based on neurodevelopmental treatment (NDT),
but intensive rehabilitation therapy is time-limited and requires the presence of one
therapist per patient. Thus, it is only possible in a rehabilitation inpatient setting due
to the limited rehabilitation service resources of service providers in the Korean medical
insurance system. On the other hand, circuit training that is composed of individual
programs that focus on functional tasks can be provided in a group setting of two or more
patients by a physiotherapist and is potentially cost saving, because it involves a low
therapist-to-patient ratio, compared with conventional physiotherapy<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>There is growing evidence that circuit training is effective at improving the walking
competency of patients in the chronic phase of stroke<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Although only one study has demonstrated the effectiveness of
circuit training as an alternative to individual physiotherapy for stroke patients receiving
inpatient rehabilitation<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>, few studies
have researched how to conduct circuit training for patients in the subacute stage of stroke
in inpatient rehabilitation facilities.</p><p>Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the feasibility of circuit training
during inpatient rehabilitation in this country, and investigate whether a 90-min
task-oriented circuit training program that concentrates on improving mobility and gait
training is effective for the recovery of lower-extremity motor control, balance and walking
endurance and how it can be conducted for subacute phase of stroke patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Twenty patients (13 males and 7 females; mean age, 65.6 &#x000b1; 9.2&#x02005;years) with subacute stroke
(i.e., within 3 months of stroke) were selected for this study. Patients were recruited from
the Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation of Jeju National University Hospital
between August 2012 and October 2013. All the patients had first-ever cerebral stroke that
involved the cortical or subcortical area. Lesions were confirmed through magnetic resonance
imaging or computed tomography. The eligibility criteria were: a clinical diagnosis of a
first stroke confirmed by neuroimaging (computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging);
a hemiparesis; a time interval between stroke and recruitment of 3 months or less; the
ability to comprehend the instructions for the testing procedures; and mild to moderate
walking deficit, as indicated by Functional Ambulation Category (FAC) between 3 and 4<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Exclusion criteria were as follows: a severe cognitive impairment (K-MMSE &#x02264;10) or aphasia;
previous stroke history; not independent &#x02018;sit to stand&#x02019; activity (Berg Balance Scale score
&#x0003c;18)<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>; acute systemic illness or
infection; a significant orthopedic condition or pain that limited participation in
exercise; and visual impairment or vestibular system deficit that caused balance
impairment.</p><p>After subjects passed the screening criteria, they provided their informed consent to
participation in this study. The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the
Institutional Review Board of Jeju National University Hospital.</p><p>This was a randomized, single-blind study. Participants were randomly allocated in a 1:1
ratio to the two study groups: 10 patients to the circuit training group and another 10
patients to the control group. The randomization was performed using a sealed envelope
technique. The examiner was blinded as to whether the participants were in the experimental
group or control group. Multidisciplinary rehabilitation programs except for physiotherapy
were provided equally to both groups per usual practice.</p><p>The lower limb score from the Fugl-Meyer assessment (FMA-LL) was used to evaluate the motor
function of both lower extremities including the hip, knee and ankle. The FMA-LL is widely
used for comprehensive clinical examination of leg motor function, and the maximal score is
34 points<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The 6&#x02005;min walk test (6MWT) was used as a measure of gait endurance. Subjects performed the
6&#x02005;min walk test, in which they were instructed to cover as much distance as possible in
6&#x02005;min<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Subjects walked around a
circuit marked in a 50&#x02005;m hallway and were allowed to stop and rest if necessary.</p><p>Balance function was evaluated using the Berg Balance Scale, which measures balance while
performing a variety of functional tasks that are common in everyday life<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Each task is rated on a five-point scale (range, 0&#x02013;4). The maximum score is 56, and high
scores indicate better balance. The tasks progress from sitting to comfortable standing,
tandem standing, and single leg standing, and assess both static and dynamic balance by
using tasks that involve reaching and weight transfer.</p><p>The Korean version of the Modified Barthel Index was used to evaluate activities of daily
living (ADL) function<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. The Korean
version of the Modified Barthel Index is a reliable, valid tool for measuring the ADL of
patients in Korea and has a maximal score of 100 indicating complete independence in
ADL.</p><p>All evaluations were conducted at baseline and repeated after completion of the 4 week
intervention.</p><p>In the circuit training group, participants participated in 90-min circuit-training
classes, 5 times per week for 4 weeks. At least two patients under the supervision of one
physiotherapist attended to all the classes of circuit training. Circuit training consisted
of a 5-min warm-up period, five classes of 15-min duration of complex exercises interspersed
by 1-min rest, and a 5-min cool-down period. The total duration of the structured protocol
was, therefore, 90&#x02005;min. All instructions were standardized and provided to the patients
using multimedia and instruction (video and color instruction guideline brochure) by a
physical therapist.</p><p>There were five categories of complex exercises including trunk exercise and active sitting
practice, sit-to-stand practice, standing and walking practice, aerobic exercise training
and strengthening training.</p><p>Categories 1&#x02013;3 were core activities including mobility-related tasks that address key
impairments and functional limitations, similar to the study of Dean et al.<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>, and categories 4 and 5 were physical
fitness training activities. The core activities were active sitting (easiest; category 1),
sit-to-stand from chairs of various heights (more difficult; category 2), and standing and
walking (most difficult; category 3).The core activities were individually adapted for each
patient according to their functional levels and progress, such that the level of complexity
was appropriate for the ability of the patient. Participants&#x02019; progress was continuously
monitored. When a patient completed an easier stage (category 1 or 2), or showed increased
level of walking independence during the intervention, they were permitted to move up to the
next category of core activities in the next 15&#x02005;min exercise period. However, if a patient
could not perform the activities in a category by himself, that patient was not permitted to
attempt the next category of the core activity and was instructed to repeat the previous
category. For example, until a patient was able to walk overground with minimal assistance,
they did not attempt the exercises in category 3, and performed only categories 1 and 2. The
core activities were performed in the first three 15-min periods of the circuit training
class after warm-up.</p><p>The physical fitness training activities were aerobic exercise training (category 4;
performed in the fourth 15&#x02005;min period of the circuit training class) and strengthening
training (category 5; performed in the fifth 15&#x02005;min period). Aerobic exercise was performed
on a treadmill and workload was increased by increasing treadmill speed or adding an
inclination. When a patient could not perform a treadmill activity safely, a stationary bike
was used and the workload was increased by increasing bicycle resistance.</p><p>For strengthening training, participants performed the following targeted movements: hip
abduction/flexion, knee flexion/extension and ankle dorsiflexion. A Thera-Band<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>
(Hygenic Corporation, Akron, Ohio, USA) was used to provide resistance, and participants
performed two sets of 8&#x02013;15 repetitions of each exercise. Progression was achieved by
increasing the number of repetitions or load according to subjective tolerance.</p><p>Participants in the control group received conventional individual physiotherapy for 30&#x02005;min
twice a day (total 60&#x02005;min), 5 days a week for the 4 weeks. The content of the individual
physiotherapy sessions was based on neurodevelopmental treatment for motor recovery<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>For Statistical analysis, descriptive statistics were used to calculate means and standard
deviations (SD). Wilcoxon&#x02019;s signed-rank test was used to compare the baseline values between
two groups. The change in each outcome measure from pre- to post-treatment was evaluated
separately in each group using the Wilcoxon signed rank test. The change in each outcome
measure from pre- to post-treatment was compared between the two groups using a Mann-Whitney
test. A p value less than 0.05 was considered significant. Statistical analyses were
performed using SPSS for Windows version 20 (IBM-SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The baseline demographic characteristics of both groups are presented in <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of the participants</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="middle" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th valign="middle" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Circuit training group</th><th valign="middle" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Control group</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Numbers</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (years)</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">65.2 &#x000b1; 10.1</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">66.0 &#x000b1; 8.8</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Gender (male)</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Height (cm)</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">165.0 &#x000b1; 9.7</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">166.1 &#x000b1; 7.8</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Weight (kg)</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">63.7 &#x000b1; 11.8</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">67.9 &#x000b1; 9.5</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Body mass index</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">23.2 &#x000b1; 2.1</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">24.5 &#x000b1; 2.4</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Stroke type</td><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle" style="padding-left:10pt" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Ischemic</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle" style="padding-left:10pt" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Hemorrhagic</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Affected side</td><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle" style="padding-left:10pt" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Left</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle" style="padding-left:10pt" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Right</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Stroke duration (days)</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">30.1 &#x000b1; 21.8</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">29.9 &#x000b1; 20.3</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">FMA-LL<sub>paretic</sub></td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">25.4 &#x000b1; 7.5</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">22.9 &#x000b1; 7.9</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">BBS</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">36.3 &#x000b1; 11.7</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">39.0 &#x000b1; 8.7</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6MWT, m</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">167.5 &#x000b1; 121.8</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">157.5 &#x000b1; 64.0</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">K-MBI</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">65.7 &#x000b1; 23.3</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">57.4 &#x000b1; 22.4</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Values are numbers or mean &#x000b1; standard deviation.

by setting up each task such that it provides a concrete goal and intrinsic feedback
regarding its correct completion<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. For
more appropriate participation in active rehabilitation practice in this study, we provided
repetitive education and standardized guidelines were provided through a printed color
manual and multimedia instruction on a set of core activities.</p><p>The mechanisms behind the circuit training eliciting similar degrees of improvement in
lower-extremity motor control, balance, walking competency and basic ADL are uncertain, but
there is evidence of a dose-response relation in the amount of early physical therapy after
stroke and recovery of function<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Several studies have proposed that although circuit training provide less opportunity for
direct supervision and assistance, the total time spent in circuit training program is
greater than in individual physical therapy, and that circuit training is highly effective
at increasing the amount of time spent by subjects in active rehabilitation practice<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The findings of the present study are in line with the findings of English et al.<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>
who also studied patients in an inpatient setting. Similar circuit-training protocols were
used in several other trials. However, the circuit-training program in the present study can
be discriminated for several reasons. (1) The intervention was performed by subacute stroke
patients who were receiving inpatient rehabilitation. (2) The subjects of this study were
able to perform &#x02018;sit-to-stand&#x02019; activity, but required physical assistance or supervision by
one person, while those of English et al.<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>
had the ability to walk a minimum of 10 meter without physical assistance. (3) In order to
compensate for less opportunity of participation in active practice, we provide standardized
therapy guidelines using a printed color manual and multimedia instruction on a set of core
activities in addition to supervision and verbal feedback during the circuit training.</p><p>English et al. conducted a study of the amount of walking practice which was usually
reported as 10-min duration in the previous studies<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>, and confirmed that the duration of walking practice per circuit
class therapy sessions was 10.5&#x02005;min, and that of individual physiotherapy sessions was
11.8&#x02005;min<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The walking practice in our circuit training protocol was mainly distributed between
categories 3 and 4 and a extent of treadmill or a stationary bicycle was used as an
alternative method due to slow walking speed, poor balance control or safety issues. Thus,
the duration of walking practice in our circuit training protocols lasted between 5 and 20
minutes depending on individual functional capacity.</p><p>The improvement in functional outcomes in the present study were comparable to those
observed following circuit training by people who were living in the community<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. It was assumed that the activities of
sitting with graded reaching tasks in category 1 would induce load on the hemiparetic lower
limb eliciting motor recovery. Task specific practice, such as weight-bearing activities in
category 2 is effective at promoting safe and independent mobility<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. The result suggest that activities with low functional
level in our circuit training may be an appropriate substitution for practicing walking with
maximal assistance by individual physiotherapy and they also indicate that circuit training
might be appropriate for subacute stroke patients in both inpatient rehabilitation and
outpatient settings. Inpatient rehabilitation services for stroke patients are increasingly
limited by cost concerns<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup> as well as the
current Korean healthcare environment. The circuit training program has the potential to
provide longer therapy times with a lower staff-to-patient ratio, and it could be used as a
cost effective strategy in rehabilitation services and as an alternative method to
individual physiotherapy for stroke patients receiving inpatient rehabilitation.</p><p>There were several limitations to our study. First, the sample size was a relatively small,
and subgroup analysis according to severity or type of stroke was not performed. Second,
there was relatively short follow-up; therefore, the long-term effects of circuit training
on walking competency after discharge remain unclear. Third, gait pattern or efficiency were
not evaluated. The NDT adopts the current concepts as a problem solving approach to the
assessment and treatment of individuals with disturbances of function, movement, and
postural control due to a lesion of the central nervous system, and aims to identify and
analyze problems individually within functional activities and participation in everyday
life, as well as the analysis of movement components and underlying impairments<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Despite the standard circuit training
guideline, our circuit protocol cannot be generalized to all stroke cases.</p><p>In conclusion, our circuit training program consisting of physical fitness training as well
as mobility-related tasks with longer therapy time is feasible and had a high compliance
rate among subacute stroke patients receiving inpatient rehabilitation who were at least
able to stand independently. Thus, in the case of limited inpatient rehabilitation resource,
circuit training therapy could be used as a cost-effective or alternative method to
individual physiotherapy for improving lower-extremity motor control, balance, walking
competency and basic ADL.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by the research grant of the Jeju National University in 2012.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Chang</surname><given-names>WH</given-names></name><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>YH</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Robot-assisted therapy in stroke
