respiratory muscles, and this results in decreased ventilation, leading to a vicious
circle. Therefore, the present study investigated the effects of an intervention program
to enhance the pulmonary function and muscle activity of elderly smokers. [Subjects and
Methods] Participants were randomly assigned to one of two experimental groups or a
control (CG) group. The experimental groups performed exercises three times per week for
six weeks, whereas the CG performed no exercises. One of the experimental groups performed
a Feedback Breathing Exercise (FBE) for 15 minutes, and the other repeated three sets of
Balloon-Blowing Exercises (BBE) with sufficient rest of more than one minute between sets.
[Results] In the experimental groups, FVC, FEV1/FVC, PEF and muscle activity of the rectus
abdominis significantly improved after four weeks, but no significant differences were
observed in FEV1 or VC after six weeks. [Conclusion] The results show that FBE and BBE
improved the pulmonary functions of elderly smokers, demonstrating the potential benefits
of the development of various training methods using balloons, and group programs,
including recreational factors, for increasing respiratory muscles strength.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Feedback Breathing Training</kwd><kwd>Balloon Blowing Training</kwd><kwd>Elderly smokers</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>South Korea&#x02019;s aging society will lead to an increase in the population aged over 65
years<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Elderly persons are vulnerable
to risk factors such as chronic diseases, impaired physical condition, and functional
limitations, as well as cardiopulmonary dysfunction and muscle weakness. Thus, it is
important that the elderly should perform aerobic and strengthening exercises, and to manage
the risk of falls in order to ensure their health<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Furthermore, the elderly have age-related diseases and reduced of
body functions, which are accompanied by changes in posture. Changes in posture during
Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) can affect respiratory activities and cause difficulties
with physical movement<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>For the elderly, the maintenance of cardiopulmonary function is a fundamental element of
ADL. Reduced cardiopulmonary fitness among the elderly has significant effects, through
sarcopenia and physical disability due to aging<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Cardiopulmonary function is an important factor for exercise capacity, and pulmonary
ventilation and respiratory strengthening can increase exercise capacity by reducing
respiratory fatigue<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. If the cardiopulmonary function required for long-term activities
can be maintained, elderly persons can continue to participate in indoor activities as well
as community activities such as shopping, leisure activities, and walking, which enhance
quality of life<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Smoking can damage pulmonary functions and lead to oxygen insufficiency in cells as a
result of elevated carbon monoxide in the blood and decreased hemoglobin oxygen-carrying
capacity. Additionally, smoking can reduce fitness and the ability to perform exercises<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Smoking is also considered to be one of the
major causes of death, because the harmful substances contained in just one cigarette can
shorten life by 11 minutes<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Approximately 90% of smokers begin smoking before the age
of 25<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Smoking among young people has
continued to increase, thereby causing pulmonary function problems at an early age<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In order for smokers to increase their intake of air, it is necessary to maintain
coordination among the muscles involved in breathing. These muscles increase rib expansion
and diaphragm descent during inspiration, thereby increasing air influx into the lungs, and
discharging air via relaxation of the respiratory muscles during expiration<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Weakness of breathing muscles can induce dyspnea and reduce the ability to perform
exercises. Thus, therapeutic interventions are needed to improve breathing and exercise
ability through enhancement of respiratory muscle functions<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Aerobic exercise can
increase muscle strength and the endurance of respiratory muscles as well as respiratory
functions<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Elderly smokers undoubtedly suffer reduced respiratory activity. Elderly people also
experience a reduction in chest diameter because of the weakening of respiratory muscles,
resulting in ventilation decrease, leading to a vicious circle. Therefore, the present study
investigated the effects of an intervention program to enhance the pulmonary function and
muscle activities of elderly smokers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The study recruited 30 smokers aged over 65&#x02005;years of age. Participation was voluntary, and

Dongshin University (IRB No. 201406-BM-001-02).</p><p>The participants were divided into four groups (each n=10): a control group (CG), a
feedback breathing exercise group (FBEG), and a balloon-blowing exercise group (BBEG). Group
allocation was random, using three tickets (ticket 1=CG, 2=FBEG, 3=BBEG). The CG performed
no exercises. The exercise program was conducted three times per week for six weeks, and no
exercise was conducted during the final two weeks. Since the study subjects were all
elderly, the exercise program included conditioning and sufficient rest. The feedback
breathing exercises involved the use of a SPIRO TIGER<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> for 15 minutes, while the
BBEG repeated three sets of balloon-blowing exercises with sufficient rest of more than one
minute between sets.</p><p>The pulmonary functions of the experimental groups were measured after the four weeks of
breathing exercises were completed, and a follow-up test was conducted two weeks later,
without further training. Breathing exercises were conducted while taking care to avoid
heart pain and dizziness.</p><p>Pulmonary function was measured using a Cardio Touch 3000S (Bionet Co., Ltd., South Korea),
while subjects were seated in a chair. The pulmonary functions measured were: forced vital
capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), FEV1/FVC, peak expiratory
flow (PEF), and vital capacity (VC). FVC, FEV1, and FEV1/FVC are used to determine
obstructive and restrictive lung diseases; and PEF is used to determine airway
resistance.</p><p>To ensure accurate and reliable data, the pulmonary functions were measured in triplicate
with the understanding and cooperation of the subjects with the method, and the highest
values were selected<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Surface EMG measurements were made using a POCKET EMG (BTS Co., Italy) of muscles related
to breathing on the left and right sides of the rectus abdominis via four channels. During
deep breathing, three muscle activity measurements were conducted with a one-minute rest
between measurements, and the mean value was calculated.</p><p>Statistical processing employed Predictive Analytics Software (PASW, version 18.0).
Subjects&#x02019; general characteristics were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA).
Significance effects of time within a group were tested using repeated-measures ANOVA, and
the Bonferroni test was conducted as a the post hoc test. If there was a significant effect

after 4 weeks, but the increase was not maintained in VC after 6 weeks. In the BBEG group,
FVC, FEV1, FEV1/FVC, PEF, VC, and rectus abdominis had significantly increased after 4
weeks, but the increases were not maintained in FEV1 and VC after 6 weeks. As a result of
medical advances and economic development, the elderly population has been increasing, and
in tandem with this the number of respiratory patients, such as those with chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has also been increasing<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. In a previous study,
respiratory physical therapy was conducted for 40 minutes five times per week for four weeks
for stroke patients aged around 60, and it elicited increases in FVC<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. This result was similar to the finding of the present
study, in which the FBEG and BBEG groups of elderly smokers showed significant increases in
pulmonary functions after four weeks of exercise. The effects of breathing exercises
performed by stroke patients and the elderly have been reported in previous studies;
however, the present study is more meaningful, because our subjects were older.
Nevertheless, despite the significant benefits observed at the end of the four-week exercise
program, the FBEG and BBEG groups showed significantly reduced pulmonary function after the
two-week period of no intervention. This indicates that for lasting improvement, exercise is
required for a period longer than four weeks.</p><p>It was previously reported that, following endurance training of the respiratory muscles of
COPD and spinal cord injury patients, FEV1/FVC increased significantly<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. A study of pulmonary functions of spinal cord injury
patients, measured during inpatient rehabilitation and following hospital discharge, showed
that only FEV1/FVC increased during the inpatient rehabilitation period<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. This result is similar to the finding of the present
study, in which the FBEG and BBEG groups of elderly smokers showed significant increases in
pulmonary function after four weeks, but significant decreases after no intervention during
the subsequent two weeks. In summary, breathing exercises are effective for COPD patients,
spinal cord injury patients, and the elderly. Therefore, it is necessary to study exercise
methods that can continuously maintain the effects of breathing exercises.</p><p>Measurement of PEF is a method of evaluating the level of peak airway obstruction. PEF
significantly increased in chronic stroke patients who performed FBE three times per week
for eight weeks<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the present study
of elderly smokers, PEF also increased significantly after four weeks of FBE and BBE. This
result indicates that the effects of exercise were apparent earlier than in the above-noted
study of breathing exercises, conducted over 8 weeks with chronic stroke patients.</p><p>Intervention programs should last a minimum of 12 weeks in order to see effects on physical
activities with respect to respiratory functions, including cardiovascular functions<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the present study, the beneficial
effects of the intervention training were observed after four weeks, but declined
significantly once the intervention was stopped. If the interventions had continued for more
than 12 weeks, the effect may have been maintained.</p><p>It was previously reported that breathing training for stroke patients induced diaphragm
movements and contractions in the internal intercostalis muscles as a result of active and
strong contractions in the rectus abdominis, thereby further facilitating respiratory
activity and increasing respiratory muscle activities<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. In a study of subjects with spinal cord injuries, electrical
stimulation was applied to the rectus abdominis and muscles around the abdomen, and it
improved and tidal volume and pulmonary ventilation<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the present study, increases in the muscle activity of the
rectus abdominis an accessory muscle of respiration occurred and accessory muscles affect
the diaphragm, thereby influencing the internal intercostalis, which is a respiratory
muscles. The increased in rectus abdominis activity supports the measurement of muscle
activity in the rectus abdominis as a means of examining the effects of breathing exercises
on pulmonary function. In a study of patients with lower back pain, muscle activities of the
abdominal obliques, erector spinae, and rectus abdominis increased following abdominal
breathing exercises conducted five times per week for 6 weeks<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>. These results show that breathing exercises not only strengthen
the rectus abdominis, but also improve trunk stability by strengthening the erector spinae,
which is an antagonist muscle of the trunk. On the basis of the results cited above,
breathing training for elderly patients increases the muscle activity of the rectus
abdominis, thereby increasing core stability and reducing the risk of falls, improving their
quality of life.</p><p>Inspiration in the normal state expands the rib cage above and below the rib portions as a
result of contraction of the diaphragm and other respiratory muscles. This is a result of
reduced pressure inside the chest, followed by the promotion of inspiration<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup>. Respiratory exercise can induce
contraction of the muscles involved in breathing, including the intercostalis and the rectus
abdominis, leading to increased activity among respiratory muscles.</p><p>The FBE program utilized in the present study can train inspiration and expiration muscles,
and the BBE exercise of inflating a balloon can adjust the volume of expiration after strong
inhalation followed by exhalation. Diaphragm respiratory exercises significantly increased
tidal volume, inspiratory reserve volume, inspiratory capacity, and breathing capacity of
long-term male smokers<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup>. This increase
in six-minute walking distance would increase the ability to engage in everyday activities,
thereby having a positive effect on quality of life.</p><p>A limitation of this study was that the ratio of male to female subjects was very large,
because of the social characteristics of smoking. It also did not set a criterion for daily
smoking amount and did not analyze subjects who had smoked for more than 65&#x02005;years, or their
length of time as smokers. Future research should address these limitations.</p><p>This study showed that FBE and BBE increased the pulmonary function of elderly smokers. The
BBE results show that pulmonary function can be improved without the use of specialist
equipment and that the use of balloons, which can be easily purchased, regardless of
location, had a positive effect. Thus, we emphasize the need for the development of various
training methods using balloons, and the importance of group program development, including
recreational factors, to increase the function of respiratory muscles.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="ths"><person-group><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>SK</given-names></name></person-group>: Effect of Aerobic Exercise on the Improvement in Middle Aged Women.
