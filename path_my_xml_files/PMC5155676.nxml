Severe maternal vitamin D deficiency during pregnancy can result in symptomatic hypocalcaemia in the neonate (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Associations have been reported between maternal 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) and obstetric complications, including preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, preterm birth, and offspring anthropometry, although the findings are inconsistent (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) and require confirmation in randomized controlled trials. Nonetheless, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) has suggested that risk of vitamin D insufficiency, defined as a 25(OH)D less than 50 nmol/L, should be avoided during pregnancy (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), and this is supported by the recent Global Consensus on the Prevention of Rickets (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Indeed many national guidelines recommend universal antenatal vitamin D supplementation to prevent vitamin D insufficiency (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p><p>Risk factors for vitamin D insufficiency are well described, and include ethnicity, extensive skin covering and liberal use of sun protection, overweight/obesity, low dietary vitamin D intake, and smoking (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), in addition to the seasonal variation that is observed at temperate latitudes (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Although vitamin D supplementation can improve maternal 25(OH)D status (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), little is known about how maternal characteristics might influence the 25(OH)D achieved after supplementation. In nonpregnant adults, baseline 25(OH)D concentration, body weight/adiposity and age are important determinants of the incremental rise in 25(OH)D after vitamin D supplementation (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). During pregnancy, maternal hemodilution is accompanied by a number of physiological changes to both vitamin D metabolism (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) and maternal body composition (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>); such adaptations might lead to differences in the determinants of response to vitamin D supplementation between pregnant and nonpregnant women. Clinically, understanding how individuals respond could lead to individualized antenatal counseling regarding vitamin D supplementation to ensure vitamin D repletion is achieved without increasing the risk of vitamin D toxicity. We therefore undertook this study to determine maternal characteristics associated with achieved 25(OH)D after antenatal vitamin D supplementation in the context of a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>The Maternal Vitamin D Osteoporosis Study (MAVIDOS)</title><p>The MAVIDOS study is a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of vitamin D supplementation in pregnancy. The primary outcome was neonatal bone mass. A detailed description of the study methods (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) and primary findings relating to offspring and maternal outcomes have been published previously (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). The study was approved by the Southampton and South West Hampshire Research Ethics Committee. MAVIDOS was registered prospectively (ISRCTN 82927713; EUDRACT 2007-001716-23); full approval from United Kingdom (UK) Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Authority was granted, and written, informed consent was obtained from all participants.</p><p>Briefly, women attending one of 3 UK hospitals (University Hospital Southampton National Health Service (NHS) Foundation Trust, Southampton, UK [latitude 50.9&#x000b0; North]; Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Oxford, UK [latitude 51.8&#x000b0; North]; Sheffield Hospitals NHS Trust [University of Sheffield], Sheffield, UK [latitude 53.4&#x000b0; North]) for early pregnancy ultrasound screening (11&#x02013;14 wk of gestation) were invited to participate in the study. Inclusion criteria were: age over 18 years, singleton pregnancy, and gestation less than 17 weeks based on last menstrual period and ultrasound measurements. Women with known metabolic bone disease, renal stones, hyperparathyroidism or hypercalciuria, those taking medication known to interfere with fetal growth, fetal anomalies on ultrasonography, and women already using more than 400 IU/d vitamin D supplementation were excluded. A screening blood sample was obtained and analyzed on the local NHS platform (all 3 laboratories [Southampton, Oxford, and Sheffield] participate in Vitamin D External Quality Assessment Scheme vitamin D quality assurance system [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.deqas.org/">http://www.deqas.org/</ext-link>]). Women with 25(OH)D between 25 and 100 nmol/L and serum calcium less than 2.75 mmol/L were eligible to enroll fully in the study.</p><p>Participants were randomized to either cholecalciferol 1000 IU/d or matched placebo (Merck KGaA/Sharp Clinical Services [previously DHP-Bilcare]), which was commenced before 17 weeks of gestation. The study medication was provided in a blister pack in a single box containing all medication for the whole pregnancy. All participants received standard antenatal care and could continue self-administration of dietary supplements containing up to 400 IU/d vitamin D.</p></sec><sec><title>Maternal assessments during pregnancy</title><p>Before commencing the study medication, and again at 34 weeks of gestation, the women attended the research center for a detailed assessment of diet (including supplement use), lifestyle (smoking, physical activity participation, employment), and health (past medical history, current medication use) using interviewer-led questionnaires. Ethnicity was determined by participant self-report and subsequently categorized as White or non-White.</p><p>Anthropometric measurements included height, measured to the nearest 0.1 cm using a stadiometer, and weight, assessed to the nearest 0.1 kg using calibrated electronic scales. Four site (triceps, biceps, subscapular, and suprailiac) skinfold thicknesses were measured to the nearest 0.2 mm using a Harpenden skinfold caliper. Pregnancy weight gain was calculated as the difference between the weights at commencing study medication and 34 weeks of gestation.</p></sec><sec><title>Compliance with study medication</title><p>Participants were asked to bring any remaining study medication to each assessment. The pills were counted and compliance calculated as number consumed/expected consumption based on number of days since medication was dispensed and expressed as a percentage. The 34 week visit was used for the calculation of compliance, and the count at 19 weeks was used if a 34-week count was not available.</p></sec><sec><title>Assessment of 25(OH)D status</title><p>On the day that the study medication was dispensed and at 34 weeks of gestation, a nonfasted venous blood sample was obtained, and serum was stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C. 25(OH)D was assessed by RIA (Liaison RIA automated platform; Diasorin). All samples were analyzed in a single batch at the end of the study at Medical Research Council Human Nutrition Research. Details of assay performance and quality control through participation in Vitamin D External Quality Assessment Scheme, National Institute of Standards and Technology, and United Kingdom National External Quality Assessment Service are given elsewhere (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Women who had a measurement of 25(OH)D at both 14 and 34 weeks of gestation and delivered a live-born infant were included in the analysis (because pathology associated with fetal death might influence 25(OH)D concentrations). Maternal characteristics were compared between the women who did and did not complete the study using <italic>t</italic> tests, Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> tests, and &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> tests for normally distributed, nonnormally distributed, and categorical variables, respectively. Linear regression was used to assess the association between maternal characteristics and 25(OH)D at 34 weeks of gestation for each treatment group separately. Multivariate linear regression was subsequently performed including all variables with a <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .2 from the linear regression. Additionally, maternal factors associated with achieving a vitamin D replete status (&#x0003e;50 nmol/L) were determined using Poisson regression with robust standard errors (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). The cut-point of 50 nmol/L as the definition for vitamin D replete status was chosen to reflect the IOM guidelines (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Additionally, we considered a 25(OH)D more than 125 nmol/L as indicating risk of toxicity, as suggested by the IOM (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). In the primary trial analysis, we classified season of birth according to the UK Meteorological office recommendations (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.metoffice.gov.uk">www.metoffice.gov.uk</ext-link>) with winter (December&#x02013;February), spring (March&#x02013;May), summer (June&#x02013;August), and autumn (September&#x02013;November). Because 25(OH)D concentrations are nonlinearly associated with season, to facilitate ready comparison, we collapsed this classification into 2 groups with a notional &#x0201c;winter&#x0201d; (the months in which 25(OH)D concentrations tended to be lowest, December-May) and a &#x0201c;summer&#x0201d; (the months in which 25(OH)D concentrations tended to be highest, June-November). Finally, in sensitivity analysis, we excluded women who reported having taken any additional vitamin D-containing supplements within 90 days of the late pregnancy blood sampling. All analyses were performed in Stata v14 (Statacorp). <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .05 was considered statistically significant.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>A total of 829 women, who delivered a live born infant and had measurements of 25(OH)D at both 14 and 34 weeks of gestation, were included in the analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>).

Similarly, 81.0% of women randomized to cholecalciferol were vitamin D replete at 34 weeks of gestation, compared with 29.4% of women randomized to placebo (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .001). The maternal characteristics associated with 25(OH)D at 34 weeks of gestation and achieving vitamin D replete status were similar to those observed in the whole cohort.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We have assessed anthropometric and demographic factors associated with the response to antenatal supplementation with 1000 IU/d cholecalciferol. This dose achieved vitamin D repletion in over 80% of women, without leading to 25(OH)D levels potentially associated with vitamin D toxicity (at least within the included baseline of 25&#x02013;100 nmol/L 25(OH)D). However, gaining less weight during pregnancy, having a higher 25(OH)D in early pregnancy, delivering in summer and having higher compliance with supplementation were independently associated with achieving a greater 25(OH)D concentration in late pregnancy among women randomized to vitamin D supplementation. Thus, those women who are at risk of vitamin D insufficiency in early pregnancy, gain greater weight, and deliver in winter might need supplementation with a higher dose of cholecalciferol to achieve similar 25(OH)D concentrations. However, when vitamin D replete status was considered as the outcome, only non-White maternal ethnicity and delivery in winter were significant predictors of vitamin D nonreplete status after supplementation.</p><p>To our knowledge, the factors which determine the response to vitamin D supplementation in pregnancy have not previously been assessed. However, our findings are consistent with those in nonpregnant adults (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). It is well recognized that individuals who are overweight or obese are at higher risk of vitamin D insufficiency, and this is similarly observed in pregnancy (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Studies in nonpregnant adults have also shown that obese individuals achieve a lower 25(OH)D with the same dose of supplementation as nonobese individuals (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Metaanalysis of vitamin D supplementation studies has suggested that over 50% of the variance in 25(OH)D increment in response to supplementation is explained by body weight (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Although the relationship between body weight and 25(OH)D increment after supplementation could reflect sequestration in adipose tissue, we found that in multivariate analysis, prepregnancy BMI and late pregnancy triceps skinfold thickness (as a marker of adiposity), were not associated with 25(OH)D after supplementation, but that pregnancy weight gain was negatively associated. Similarly, we have previously demonstrated that greater gestational weight gain is associated with a decline in 25(OH)D status during pregnancy, independent of supplement use (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Weight gain in pregnancy represents not only increased fat mass but also feto-placental tissues and hemodilution (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>); our data, therefore, suggest that overall volume of dilution, and not just adiposity, may be important for response to vitamin D supplementation. However, importantly, when using a 25(OH)D more than 50 nmol/L as a cut-point for repletion, pregnancy weight gain was not an independent predictor of achieving vitamin D repletion.</p><p>Despite receiving 1000 IU cholecalciferol per day, 25% of mothers delivering in winter had a 25(OH)D less than 50 nmol/L. This is a higher nonrepletion rate than that reported in other recent pregnancy supplement studies (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). However, it is notable that there were marked differences in baseline 25(OH)D concentrations between these investigations, and we observed that initial 25(OH)D status was positively associated with both the likelihood of achieving vitamin D replete status and absolute 25(OH)D status at 34 weeks of gestation. Importantly, the difference between the 25(OH)D achieved at 34 weeks of gestation in women randomized to placebo compared with cholecalciferol decreased with increasing baseline 25(OH)D. This is consistent with previous studies in adults, which have shown that the incremental response to vitamin D supplementation is higher in vitamin D insufficient than replete subjects (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) and that the increase in 25(OH)D relative to supplementation dose is negatively associated with dose of vitamin D supplement (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). This suggests that physiological processes such as saturation of the hepatic 25-hydroxylase involved in the conversion of cholecalciferol to 25(OH)D or conversion to 24- or 4-OH metabolites, together with renal catabolism, limit attainment of very high 25(OH)D concentrations (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). This mechanism might be important in preventing hypervitaminosis D. However, studies comparing the effectiveness of differing doses of vitamin D in pregnancy have shown that 4000 IU/d can achieve a higher 25(OH)D than 400 IU/d (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>), but whether these higher doses are of clinical benefit is yet to be demonstrated (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>) and at the general population level, lower doses would be compatible with keeping 25(OH)D below a concentration which might be concerning.</p><p>It is evident from our findings that 1000 IU/d cholecalciferol in pregnancy does not eliminate the seasonal variation in 25(OH)D status observed in pregnant women in the UK (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Similarly, non-White ethnicity was associated with a higher risk of not achieving vitamin D replete status in the supplemented women. Hollis et al similarly found that even with 4000 IU/d vitamin D during pregnancy, African-American women had lower 25(OH)D in late pregnancy than Caucasian or Hispanic women (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Thus, future studies should aim to determine the dose required to achieve optimal 25(OH)D status among women of non-White ethnicity and among those who deliver in winter months. Maternal age was also positively associated in univariate analyses with 25(OH)D achieved at 34 weeks of gestation in women who received vitamin D supplementation. It has previously been shown in pregnant women that age is positively associated with 25(OH)D status (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Although lower uptake of supplementation in younger women (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) could partly explain this observation, our finding would additionally suggest that even in younger women who do use supplements, the achieved 25(OH)D is lower. Data from healthy and hospitalized adults have similarly shown that older individuals achieve a higher 25(OH)D after vitamin D supplementation (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). As such, young pregnant women might particularly require advice on the need for, and compliance with, vitamin D supplementation.</p><p>Although our findings are novel, and may enable the development of individualized advice for antenatal vitamin D supplementation, there are a number of limitations which should be considered in the interpretation of this study. Firstly, we could not, as a result of stipulations made during the ethics approval process, include participants with 25(OH)D concentrations less than 25 nmol/L or more than 100 nmol/L. As baseline 25(OH)D was associated with the likelihood of achieving vitamin D replete status, it is likely that women with very low levels of 25(OH)D at baseline will require a higher supplementation dose to achieve vitamin D repletion. However, this needs to be confirmed in future studies. Secondly, only a small proportion of the women included in this study were of non-White ethnicity. This reflects the local populations and care should be taken in translating these findings to a more ethnically diverse population. Thirdly, we did not examine genetic determinants of the response to vitamin D supplementation. It has been demonstrated previously that the incremental rise in 25(OH)D after supplementation differs by single nucleotide polymorphisms in vitamin D binding protein (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>) and 25-hydroxylase genes (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Although this genetic information can enable a more comprehensive understanding of the biochemical response to vitamin D supplementation, the current inability to undertake genotyping on a widespread population basis means this additional information would not allow for alterations to current clinical practice regarding vitamin D supplementation in pregnancy. Finally, during pregnancy, a number of physiological changes occur to vitamin D metabolism, including an increase in vitamin D binding protein and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), indices that we were not able to include in our analysis.</p><p>In conclusion, we have demonstrated that women who gain more weight during pregnancy, have lower 25(OH)D in early pregnancy, or deliver in winter tend to achieve a lower 25(OH)D in late pregnancy when supplemented with 1000-IU/d cholecalciferol than do women with the converse attributes. Future studies should aim to determine appropriate doses to enable consistent repletion of 25(OH)D during pregnancy, and our findings support the notion that clinical approaches to vitamin D repletion may be informed by individual characteristics. As such, personalized vitamin D supplementation advice might become part of future antenatal care.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group content-type="abbreviations"><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations:
