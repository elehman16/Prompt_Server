There is no guarantee that effects of treatments remain unchanged beyond the study. Here, we illustrate the feasibility, benefits and cost-effectiveness of enriching standard trial design with electronic follow up. We completed a 5-year electronic follow up of a RCT investigating the impact of probiotics on asthma and eczema in children born 2005&#x02013;2007, with traditional fieldwork follow up to two years. Participants and trial outcomes were identified and analysed after five years using secure, routine, anonymised, person-based electronic health service databanks. At two years, we identified 93% of participants and compared fieldwork with electronic health records, highlighting areas of agreement and disagreement. Retention of children from lower socio-economic groups was improved, reducing volunteer bias. At 5 years we identified a reduced 82% of participants. These data allowed the trial&#x02019;s first robust analysis of asthma endpoints. We found no indication that probiotic supplementation to pregnant mothers and infants protected against asthma or eczema at 5 years. Continued longer-term follow up is technically straightforward.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Follow up of trial participants on routine electronic health care databases offers great potential to maximise the economic efficiency of trials and allow access to a fuller range of study outcomes and potential adverse events<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Thus, the future use of electronic databases in clinical trials has been heralded as one of the major benefits to follow construction of nationwide electronic health records systems. To date, however, few studies have demonstrated this benefit, or formally assessed the relationship between traditional fieldwork data and electronic health care databases. Here, we report on the feasibility and efficiency of electronic follow up, and compare traditional trial fieldwork follow up with electronic follow up. We show new insights gained from outcomes electronically recorded 3 years after the end of the trial, and the congruence between fieldwork and electronic data.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>The PROBAT Trial</title><p id="Par3">The randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial on which this follow-up is based was an assessment of the impact of a probiotic food supplement on prevention of the atopic conditions asthma, and eczema in young children. Healthy pregnant women were recruited between 2005 and 2007 to take supplement, or placebo, from 36 weeks&#x02019; gestation, and then administer it to their infants during their first 6 months of life. The supplement consisted of <italic>lactobacilli</italic> (<italic>Lactobacillus salivarius</italic> CUL61 NCIMB 30211 and <italic>Lactobacillus paracasei</italic> CUL08 NCIMB 30154) and <italic>bifidobacteria</italic> (<italic>Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis</italic> CUL34 NCIMB 30172 and <italic>Bifidobacterium bifidum</italic> CUL20 NCIMB 30153) strains, administered at 1&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>10</sup>&#x02009;cfu per day<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. The trial preparations were not marketed, but it remains a limitation that children or breastfeeding mothers in both arms may have taken commercial probiotics or live yoghurts during the extended follow up, however our primary hypotheses were based on elucidating the impact of very early exposure to specified organisms. Participants completed researcher-administered questionnaires, and attended clinics at regular intervals. Information was sought on health status, risk factors and symptoms of atopy, and adverse events<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Outcomes included associations between the probiotic supplement and reports of eczema and asthma at or before 2 years of age (see Tables&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>, <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref> in Supplementary Material).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Linking trial and health service electronic data</title><p id="Par4">The trial location allowed access to person-based routinely-collected electronic data collected by the National Health Service (NHS) and other public sector organisations in the UK, maintained at the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage (SAIL) databank at Swansea University Medical School<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Following ethical approval from South West Wales Research Ethics Committee on behalf of NHS Wales (project ref. 2004024), participants gave signed informed consent to 5-year follow up through medical records. This randomised, double blind, parallel group, placebo controlled trial is registered with Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN 26287422. The medical information accessed from General Practice (GP) and primary care records included all prescriptions and diagnoses. SAIL links a wide range of person-based datasets using robust irrevocable anonymisation, offering a valuable research resource whilst complying with UK data protection legislation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> and ensuring confidentiality. Following Information Governance Review Panel approval (reference number 0028), data were acquired from the databank in 2013 (after the last participant was 5 years old), and analysed 2014&#x02013;15. All methods were performed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Research Ethics Committee and Governance approvals (above).</p><p id="Par5">Unique personal identifiers in PROBAT were trial study numbers linked to original recruitment records. Within SAIL, the identifier is known as an anonymised linkage field (ALF). The ALF is encrypted by a trusted third party [NHS Wales Informatics Service] and linked to clinical records within SAIL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. These two pieces of information were combined thus uploading the fieldwork into SAIL alongside health service data. In linking the data sets it was straightforward to retain blinding of study groups for all analysis, an advantage over open label study follow up. Confidentiality is maintained by the trusted third party anonymisation process, which includes reducing birthdates to week of birth and address to local area units of approximately 1500 people and if necessary aggregation of data across individuals. The area information allows calculation of Townsend indices of social deprivation. Data cannot be extracted from SAIL if patient anonymity can be compromised<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, and published summary statistics must not identify a group of individuals less than 5 in number. Once all individual data is analysed in SAIL, odds ratios may need to be approximated (smoothed to a lower number of decimal points or significant figures) to ensure this. In our study, this was a very minor issue. On occasions we needed to restrict the odds ratio precision to 1 decimal point; these are indicated in the tables as &#x02018;approximate&#x02019; statistics.</p><p id="Par6">SAIL data were examined for NHS 5-byte version 2 Read codes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> relating to diagnoses of asthma and eczema, asthma related medicines, and antibacterial prescriptions. Asthma diagnosis in childhood is complex, and becomes more reliable as a child ages. As a primary outcome definition, rather than simply reported (Read coded) diagnoses at this young age (2&#x02013;5 years); we accessed and included prescribed medication, specifically: more than one prescription of a beta2 agonist, or, a recorded diagnosis (Read code) of asthma plus at least one single prescription of a beta2 agonist. For sensitivity analysis, we also considered a range of 5 definitions, representing increased likelihood of a true positive diagnosis, classified according to British Thoracic Society guidelines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> (Tables&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>, <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref>). Asthma definitions were run as Structured Query Language (SQL) queries based on lists of Read codes for (anonymised) trial participants in the databank. Eczema diagnosis was relatively straightforward, defined as presence of Read codes for diagnoses of infantile eczema, flexural eczema, infected eczema, atopic dermatitis/eczema, and eczema not otherwise specified.</p><p id="Par7">A crucial factor is the extent of electronic data coverage. In the setting of this trial, GP practices are incentivised to accurately code certain medical conditions under the Quality and Outcomes Framework<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, a process of financial reward based on points systems for certain clinical indicators, including long term monitoring of patients with asthma. Like many study resources, electronic records have missing information. However, unlike a designed study, one cannot easily identify missing cells. A gap in the electronic record can reflect failure of the record, or simply absence of any clinical event at that time. We defined &#x02018;Good&#x02019; data coverage, and therefore successful follow up, according to an algorithm based on: the frequency of any event in the GP practice in the period being at least 10% of that measured from Jan 1<sup>st</sup> to Dec 30<sup>th</sup> 2009 (a period known to have good coverage); the absence of gaps in the individual&#x02019;s or GP practice&#x02019;s record of greater than 30 days. It is noted that the algorithm is <italic>ad hoc</italic>, but serves to identify GP practices that do not submit data regularly and individuals who have deregistered from their primary care practices, for example by moving away from the area.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p id="Par8">For children (trial subjects) present with good data coverage at 2 and 5 years, trial outcomes and covariates were assessed using binary logistic regression. Any variables identified as statistically significant (5% level) using univariable analysis were investigated in multivariable logistic regression adjusted models, with a final model chosen by likelihood ratio tests (with a variable retained in the final model if the model showed a significant improvement in fit). To explore the sensitivity of the conclusions to issues of trial compliance and uncertainty in the definition of asthma we undertook ITT (intention to treat) and PP (<italic>per protocol</italic>) analyses for asthma and eczema at 5 years, in combination with all 5 reasonable asthma classifications. We defined good compliance as infants taking &#x0003e;70% of the treatment (30 or more treatments)&#x000a0;by 6 weeks of age.</p><p id="Par9">Comparison of electronic and field data was made using Cohen&#x02019;s Kappa, with levels of agreement as defined by Landis <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. In all tables we report p-values without adjustment for multiple comparisons. This was due to the high degree of correlation between endpoints (for example the different, but nested, definitions of asthma) making formal adjustment difficult. However we note that without any adjustment, P-values should be treated with the usual caution, and interpreted within the context of the number of tests performed. All analyses were completed before treatment group allocation was un-blinded.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec7"><title>Feasibility of electronic follow-up</title><p id="Par10">435 of 452 (96%) trial participants were located in the SAIL databank.

The number of participants remaining in the PP analyses was considerably reduced (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), which was a consequence of a strict definition of compliance (&#x0003e;30 treatments), providing a clear contrast with the ITT groups.

One odds ratio was exactly 1.0; 9/17 showed an odds ratio greater than one, and 7/17 showed an odds ratio below one. Thus there was no consistent evidence for a probiotic effect.

We note, given our loss to follow up is 18% at 5 years, that additional biases related to inclusion in databases may still be present. However, this is within the 80&#x02013;90% follow up rates that are generally considered acceptable<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par18">Electronic medical records are increasingly used in observational studies to detect safety issues, such as adverse drug events<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> and prescription errors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. SAIL has been used as a cost-effective resource for trial recruitment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>, and evaluation of complementary and alternative medicines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. In SAIL cohort studies (ankylosing spondylitis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>, psychotic disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>), 80% of patients were located within the electronic records, comparable figures to our study at 5 years.</p><p id="Par19">The level of agreement between data sources is difficult to interpret, especially where fieldwork involves reliance on carer recall. Neither fieldwork nor the electronic record can be considered the gold standard. Some endpoints are better suited to traditional fieldwork, and others to electronic health records. Fieldwork data are vulnerable to misunderstandings of questionnaires, perceptions or definitions of illness. Although prescription recording is accurate, the prescription itself may not be redeemed or used by the carer (see Gadkari <italic>et al</italic>.)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Asthma has been identified as a condition for which compliance with primary care prescription is low<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Here, we propose the asthma endpoints are generally more reliable in the electronic follow up, due to the older age of the children and also the risk of bias or unreliability in carer-reported outcomes, where a range of concerns might be designated &#x02018;asthma&#x02019;. This might be reflected in the high proportion of children with fieldwork-reported asthma, yet no evidence of any prescription of asthma medicines. Antibiotic usage is likely a case where the more objective electronic data is preferred, due to difficulty in recalling medicine up to 12 months ago in the fieldwork, or misunderstandings over the term. On the other hand, electronic data may also be compromised by in-hospital prescription not recorded in the GP data. In contrast, certain outcomes such as atopic eczema cannot easily be reproduced in the electronic follow up, as the link to prescription medicines is less clear.</p><sec id="Sec11"><title>Impact of probiotics on Clinical Outcomes</title><p id="Par20">The electronic data at 2 years were in agreement with the original trial, and other literature, in failing to find a preventive role for probiotics on asthma outcomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. We identified a possible increased asthma prevalence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>, though this should be interpreted with caution as several endpoints were analysed in sensitivity analyses. Our study is the first to address longer term electronic follow up of infants exposed <italic>in utero</italic> and suggests that even if there are any associations, they tend to diminish over time.</p><p id="Par21">In the original trial, at 2 years, the probiotic supplementation appeared to confer some benefits by reducing atopic eczema (not &#x02018;any eczema&#x02019;)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. This diagnosis required skin prick testing and was therefore unsuited to electronic follow up. Meta-analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup> of studies investigating probiotics&#x02019; impact on more widely defined eczema, as investigated here, suggests a possible preventative effect. This was not supported by any statistically significant findings in our study. We note that our estimated effect sizes were consistent with published pooled relative risks of between 0.62 and 0.78, however we also found that the odds ratio in our study moved closer to 1 between 2 and 5 years follow up.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Strengths and Limitations</title><p id="Par22">The advantages of electronic follow up include minimisation of reporter, recall, social desirability response bias or mis-understandings in questionnaires. However, constraints or missing values in health records may include: absence of medicines prescribed in secondary care (soon to be available in SAIL) or privately purchased; absence of free text clinical notes; prescriptions given &#x02018;just in case&#x02019;; non-adherence to prescription regimens; quality of coding; absence of confounding variables (although many demographic variables can be recorded, trials will often require additional information). We acknowledge that prescriptions of asthma medicines at 2 and 5 years may not indicate a formal diagnosis of asthma; rather, they are functional measures of primary care practitioners&#x02019; perceptions of respiratory illness. Extension to beyond 7 years is straightforward (with ethical approval) and would offer a definitive asthma endpoint and further illustration of the advantages of the enriched trial.</p><p id="Par23">Electronic follow up is likely to be cost-effective. Health informaticians can match and extract data quickly, here, some 6 months of analyst&#x02019;s time, plus statistical re-analysis, research governance approvals, checking against data held by the Office of National Statistics (ONS), and checking with fieldwork data. We estimate the cost to be $80k ($57k in human resources), ~$200 per participant, which compares favourably with a mean of $24,727 per participant for patient retention in phase 3 pharmaceutical trials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. Although full cost-benefit analysis would require quantification of data quality, unlike traditional methods, the cost of follow-up using routine data is potentially relatively small and crucially does not increase with the number of participants. However, an infrastructure must be in place and meet exacting safeguarding standards<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. SAIL, for example, is a large project supported by data scientists and significant computing hardware. This approach is still cost-effective over even a small number of trials. Given the cost of a suite of trials (our experience with PROBAT was approximately $2000 per participant) it is imperative that as much information, over a period as long as possible, is utilised. The potential bias introduced whenever there is loss of data within the trial framework must always be considered, however we suggest that the benefits of updating and re-testing trial hypotheses are such that trial funders should routinely recognise and support infrastructure for long-term follow up, using centres offering comprehensive electronic follow up<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Key Points</title><p id="Par24">
