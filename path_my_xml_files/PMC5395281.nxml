The pharmacokinetics of the sildenafil 100 mg orodispersible film (IBSA) was compared to that of the conventional marketed 100 mg film-coated tablet (Viagra<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) after single-dose administration to 53 healthy male volunteers (aged 18&#x02013;51 years) in a randomized, open, two-way crossover bioequivalence study. Each subject received a single oral dose of 100 mg of sildenafil as test or reference formulation administered under fasting conditions at each of the two study periods according to a randomized crossover design. There was a washout interval of &#x02265;7 days between the two administrations of the investigational medicinal products. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis were collected up to 24 h post-dosing. The primary objective was to compare the rate (peak plasma concentration; C<sub>max</sub>) and extent (area under the curve [AUC] from administration to last observed concentration time; AUC<sub>0&#x02013;t</sub>) of sildenafil absorption after single-dose administration of test and reference. Secondary endpoints were observed to describe the plasma pharmacokinetic profiles of sildenafil and its metabolite N-desmethyl-sildenafil relative bioavailability and safety profile after single-dose administration. The mean sildenafil and N-desmethyl-sildenafil plasma concentration&#x02013;time profiles up to 24 h after single-dose administration of sildenafil 100 mg orodispersible film and film-coated tablet were nearly superimposable. The bioequivalence test was fully satisfied for sildenafil and N-desmethyl-sildenafil in terms of rate and extent of bioavailability. Adverse events occurred at similar rates for the two formulations and were of mild-to-moderate severity. The results suggest that the new orodispersible film formulation can be used interchangeably with the conventional film-coated formulation.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>sildenafil</kwd><kwd>pharmacokinetics</kwd><kwd>bioequivalence</kwd><kwd>orodispersible film</kwd><kwd>PDE5 inhibitor</kwd><kwd>N-desmethyl-sildenafil</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The first-in-class selective inhibitor of cyclic guanosine monophosphate-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), sildenafil, has become well established as a safe and effective treatment for male erectile dysfunction since the approval of Viagra<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (Pfizer Ltd, Tadworth, UK) by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1998. Guidelines on male sexual dysfunction established by the European Association of Urology recommend oral pharmacotherapy with PDE5 inhibitors as first-line therapy for erectile dysfunction.<xref rid="b1-dddt-11-1183" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></p><p>The PDE5 inhibitors sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil, and avanafil are currently approved for use for erectile dysfunction. Each PDE5 inhibitor has an individual pharmacokinetic and side effects profile, although no significant differences in efficacy among therapies are evident.<xref rid="b1-dddt-11-1183" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b5-dddt-11-1183" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> The onset of action after oral administration of the available PDE5 inhibitors may be within 30 min; however, most men require at least 60 min delay after taking the medication (up to 2 h with tadalafil, while avanafil and vardenafil have the shortest onsets of action). Avanafil reaches peak plasma concentration (C<sub>max</sub>) 30&#x02013;45 min after oral dosing and has a t<sub>1/2</sub> of 1.1&#x02013;1.23 h. Tadalafil has the longest t<sub>1/2</sub> (~17.5 h), and the t<sub>1/2</sub> for sildenafil and vardenafil is ~4 h.</p><p>More than 25 years of clinical experience has confirmed the risk/benefit profile of sildenafil and established it as an effective treatment option for erectile dysfunction. Sildenafil could also be taken by men with comorbidities, such as hypertension, stable coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, traumatic spinal cord injury, obstructive sleep apnea, multiple sclerosis, renal dysfunction, prostate cancer, Parkinson&#x02019;s disease, depression, and traumatic stress disorders.<xref rid="b6-dddt-11-1183" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> It is usually administered in doses of 25, 50, and 100 mg, with the recommended starting dose of 50 mg to be adapted according to response and side effects.<xref rid="b1-dddt-11-1183" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Commonly reported adverse events (AEs) with sildenafil, as with the other available PDE5 inhibitors, include headache, flushing, dyspepsia, dizziness, and vision disturbances and are generally mild in nature and self-limiting.<xref rid="b1-dddt-11-1183" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></p><p>Since the expiry of Pfizer&#x02019;s patent on sildenafil citrate for the treatment of erectile dysfunction in a number of European countries in 2013, several different formulations of sildenafil have become available. Orally disintegrating film and tablet formulations of PDE5 inhibitors that disintegrate in the patient&#x02019;s mouth without the need for swallowing with water have been developed.<xref rid="b7-dddt-11-1183" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b12-dddt-11-1183" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Orodispersible films are defined as single or multilayer sheets of suitable materials, to be placed in the mouth where they disperse rapidly,<xref rid="b13-dddt-11-1183" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> requiring only a small amount of saliva on the tongue to dissolve within a few minutes of administration. In addition to not requiring water for administration, orodispersible films share the advantages of tablet formulations (accurate dosage and ease of administration) with those of liquid dosing forms (ease of swallowing and rapid bioavailability due to bypassing the hepatic first-pass effect when the absorption of active substance occurs mainly through the oral mucosae).</p><p>Although orodispersible formulations have particular relevance by improving compliance in special patient populations, such as children, geriatric patients, and dysphasic patients who have difficulty in swallowing tablets or capsules, their convenience, superior dosing accuracy, and rapid onset of action contribute to strong patient preference over conventional solid dosage forms across a wide range of patient groups.<xref rid="b14-dddt-11-1183" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b16-dddt-11-1183" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Rapid dissolution, absorption, and onset of drug action are useful in motion sickness and sudden episodes of allergic attack of coughing, bronchitis, and asthma. Some drugs are absorbed from the mouth, pharynx, and esophagus: pre-gastric absorption can improve bioavailability with consequent reduction of dosage and unwanted effects.</p><p>Orodispersible films have advantages over orally disintegrating tablet formulations, which may require more complicated and expensive manufacturing processes, have issues of hardness and friability during manufacturing, storage, handling and administration, and may present a risk of choking.<xref rid="b16-dddt-11-1183" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Orodispersible films are thin and flexible, can be manufactured in a range of sizes and shapes, and are easily transported and stored. Research has shown that four out of five patients prefer orally disintegrating dosage forms over conventional solid oral dosage forms.<xref rid="b15-dddt-11-1183" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> As orodispersible film formulations do not require administration with water, they may provide additional benefit where comorbid conditions such as renal impairment, congestive heart failure, or other disorders impose a restriction on fluid intake, or where dysphagia creates difficulty with swallowing conventional film tablet dosage forms. Drugs that have potency at low doses are most suitable for orodispersible film administration, as technical considerations limit the incorporation of the drug; generally, between 1% and 30% w/w of the active pharmaceutical ingredient can be introduced in film formulation.<xref rid="b17-dddt-11-1183" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p><p>Taste is an important factor in the development of oral pharmaceutical products to ensure patient acceptability and compliance and is one of the prime factors determining market penetration and commercial success of oral formulations. Palatability and pleasant taste are necessary for fast dissolving films, and various techniques are available to mask drug taste. Flavors, sweeteners, and amino acids can be added to the formulation, generally in association with other taste-masking components. The classical sources of sweeteners are sucrose, dextrose, fructose, glucose, liquid glucose, and maltose.</p><p>A pharmacokinetic comparison of an orally disintegrating film formulation of sildenafil marketed in South Korea suggested that the pharmacokinetics of the orodispersible formulation was similar to that of the conventional film-coated tablet and met the criterion of assumed bioequivalence according to Korean FDA regulatory criteria.<xref rid="b18-dddt-11-1183" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> In the study, the 90% confidence interval (CI) of the geometric mean ratio of test/reference for the area under the curve (AUC<sub>0&#x02013;last</sub>) for the sildenafil 100 mg dose was 101.68%&#x02013;114.78% and the 90% CI was 93.76%&#x02013;109.76% for C<sub>max</sub>.<xref rid="b18-dddt-11-1183" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Both the formulations were well tolerated, and no serious AEs were observed. Roh et al noted that the new formulation could be used interchangeably with the tablet formulation and may be preferred because of enhanced dosing convenience.<xref rid="b18-dddt-11-1183" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p><p>An orodispersible film formulation of sildenafil 100 mg has been developed by Institut Biochimique SA (IBSA, Pambio-Noranco, Switzerland). The aim of this study was to assess the bioequivalence between the new sildenafil 100 mg orodispersible film and the conventional marketed 100 mg film-coated tablet after single-dose administration to healthy male volunteers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><p>According to the Biopharmaceutics Classification System, sildenafil is classified as a class II drug substance (high permeability and low solubility).

Orodispersible films (variously termed as quick dissolving film, thin strips, oral films, orally dissolving film, etc) disintegrate in patients&#x02019; mouth without the need for water and consist of a thin oral strip comprising a hydrophilic, film-forming polymer, and the active pharmaceutical ingredient. The film is hydrated by saliva when placed on the tongue or oral cavity, and disintegrates rapidly to release the medication for local (oromucosal) and systemic (gastrointestinal) absorption.</p><p>Ideally, film-forming hydrophilic polymers for use in orodispersible films should be nonirritant, nontoxic, and tasteless; quickly disintegrate, possess sufficient peel, shear, and tensile strength; and inexpensive and stable.<xref rid="b14-dddt-11-1183" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> The hydrophilic polymers are combined with other excipients to improve the physical properties (eg, plasticizers), to incorporate active pharmaceutical substances (eg, surfactants) and to improve palatability. The films are formulated using various methods, including solvent casting, hot-melt extrusion, semisolid casting, solid dispersion extrusion, and rolling; solvent casting and spraying methods are most commonly used.<xref rid="b14-dddt-11-1183" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="b16-dddt-11-1183" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p><p>The pharmaceutical development of the IBSA 100 mg orodispersible film was based on the use of maltodextrins as the film-forming agent, glycerin as a plasticizer, and water as a solvent. Polyvinyl acetate was introduced to improve the mechanical properties and tensile strength of the films. The sildenafil IBSA 100 mg orodispersible film was prepared by the solvent casting method, consisting of spreading and drying of a viscous mixture composed of active principle and excipients in a suitable solvent. The mixture, homogeneous and without bubble and clumps, is spread on a liner and dried, allowing the production of a film with a homogeneous and smooth surface and a thickness of ~220 &#x000b5;m. The resulting film is then cut into pieces of required size. The novelty of the IBSA orodispersible film is described in the patent WO 2014/049548.</p><p>Unlike many of the films that have been considered to be state-of-the-art, the sildenafil IBSA orodispersible film does not use pullulan, an ingredient that is expensive and difficult to source, as the film-forming component. Formulations based on other film-forming polymers are available, but with some limitations in terms of physical properties or dissolution behavior. Maltodextrins, defined as non-sweet, nutritive saccharide mixtures with a dextrose equivalent (DE) of &#x0003c;20,<xref rid="b20-dddt-11-1183" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> are obtained from the partial hydrolysis of starch with suitable acids and/or enzymes and are a suitable ingredient for manufacturing orodispersible films. They can differ in average molecular size, with the DE value (ie, the proportion of reducing sugars relative to dextrose expressed as a percentage on a dry basis) commonly used in classification. However, maltodextrins usually require the addition of a hydrocolloid at concentrations &#x0003e;10% to reduce dissolution time. However, hydrocolloids tend to become a gel when they are in contact with saliva; thus, they give the sensation of poor dissolution in the mouth. On the contrary, oral films based on maltodextrins without hydrocolloids tend to have poor physical properties, with hardening during storage. The current IBSA formulation avoids hardening of the films based on maltodextrin and plasticizer by incorporating a homopolymer of vinyl acetate into the composition and is thus able to replace pullulan while maintaining its benefits, conferring advantages in terms of solubility and film formation to the sildenafil orodispersible film product.</p><p>Manufacturing an orodispersible film with the tensile properties required for packaging and handling procedures is a critical issue in the development of orodispersible films. The flexibility and strength of the film could affect cutting, film formation, and packaging during the manufacturing process. To facilitate handling, the oral film should be flexible while exhibiting a tensile strength that guarantees a suitable stiffness. Elongation at break should be low to avoid deformation of films during the manufacturing process. During the development of the IBSA orodispersible film, tensile properties were evaluated, and tensile strength, elongation at break, and tensile energy to break were calculated to determine the appropriate tensile properties.</p><p>The study described in this paper was conducted to compare the pharmacokinetic and safety profiles of the new sildenafil 100 mg orodispersible film formulation in healthy male volunteers. In the study, the 90% CIs for sildenafil C<sub>max</sub>, AUC<sub>0&#x02013;t</sub>, and AUC<sub>0&#x02013;f</sub> were within the range of 80%&#x02013;125% used for the assessment of bioequivalence according to the current European guidance on the investigation of bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1/Corr**, January 20, 2010). Therefore, the sildenafil 100 mg orodispersible film (test) and the 100 mg film-coated tablet (reference) were found to be bioequivalent with respect to sildenafil rate and extent of absorption. Bioequivalence was also shown in terms of rate and extent of bioavailability of the sildenafil metabolite, N-desmethyl-sildenafil. The time to reach peak drug concentration of sildenafil and N-desmethyl-sildenafil did not differ significantly between the two investigational products.</p><p>Safety data confirmed a favorable safety profile of the test and reference investigational products, administered as a single oral dose of 100 mg sildenafil. AEs occurred at similar rates between the two formulations and all AEs were of mild or moderate severity. There were no serious AEs and no subjects withdrew because of treatment-related AEs.</p><p>Patient satisfaction with erectile dysfunction treatments is a complex and personal issue, and there is no clearly established and robust evidence base to demonstrate a preference between different PDE5 inhibitors.<xref rid="b3-dddt-11-1183" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b21-dddt-11-1183" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b24-dddt-11-1183" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> The needs and expectations of patients vary widely, and involving the patient and, if possible, his sexual partner in the decision-making process by providing relevant information about the therapy options, including expected benefits and possible adverse effects or complications, is important in deciding on the most appropriate approach for treating erectile dysfunction.<xref rid="b1-dddt-11-1183" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Patient satisfaction is determined not only in terms of erectile response and side effects, but also in how well the treatment meets patient needs and expectations and the dynamics of the relationship. Therefore, follow-up evaluation to review the success of the intervention, identify any side effects, discuss patient satisfaction with treatment, and revisit their expectations are essential to ensure optimal long-term treatment strategy.</p><p>The availability of alternative oral dosage forms that offer advantages over conventional tablet formulations broadens the prescribing options of physicians. The IBSA sildenafil orodispersible film was developed to provide a safe, efficacious, and stable orodispersible film formulation that was pharmaceutically equivalent to the conventional marketed branded film-coated tablets. As noted, orodispersible films have the advantages of conventional tablets (precise dosage and ease of administration) and those of liquid dosage forms (ease of swallowing and rapid bioavailability). The IBSA formulation offers a convenient, discrete method of intake with a rapid onset of action and the added patient convenience and acceptability of a dosage form that does not require administration with water, of particular benefit for men who have difficulty with swallowing conventional film tablet dosage forms or in whom daily fluid intake is restricted, as the orodispersible film does not require administration with water.</p><p>The orodispersible film formulation of sildenafil 100 mg was developed by IBSA to recognize the advantages of an orodispersible formulation that dissolved rapidly in the oral cavity without drinking or chewing and to provide an alternative to the current marketed products for the treatment of erectile dysfunction. This study has demonstrated that the sildenafil IBSA 100 mg orodispersible film can be used interchangeably with the conventional film-coated tablet formulation. However, as is the nature of most bioequivalence and pharmacokinetic studies, this study was conducted in a limited number of healthy, relatively young, subjects; therefore, the findings cannot be directly extended to patients with comorbidities or the elderly.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The pharmacokinetics of the sildenafil 100 mg orodispersible film formulation and the 100 mg film-coated tablet were shown to be without statistically significant difference. The results suggest that the new orodispersible film formulation could represent a valid alternative to the current marketed products for the treatment of erectile dysfunction.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors thank Ray Hill, an independent medical writer, who provided medical writing support funded by IBSA Institut Biochimique SA, Pambio-Noranco, Switzerland.
