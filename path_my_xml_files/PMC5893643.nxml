However, this local hyper-immune reactivity cannot be predicted before vaccination, nor is its association with protection against leprosy known. In this study we investigated the occurrence of adverse events after BCG (re)vaccination in contacts of leprosy patients and analyzed whether the concomitant systemic anti-mycobacterial immunity was associated with these skin manifestations.</p></sec><sec id="ST2"><title>Methods</title><p>Within a randomized controlled BCG vaccination trial in Bangladesh, 14,828 contacts of newly diagnosed leprosy patients received BCG vaccination between 2012 and 2017 and were examined for adverse events 8 to 12&#x02009;weeks post-vaccination. From a selection of vaccinated contacts, venous blood was obtained at follow-up examination and stimulated with <italic>Mycobacterium leprae</italic> (<italic>M. leprae</italic>) antigens in overnight whole-blood assays (WBA). <italic>M. leprae</italic> phenolic glycolipid-I-specific antibodies and 32 cytokines were determined in WBAs of 13 individuals with and 13 individuals without adverse events after vaccination.</p></sec><sec id="ST3"><title>Results</title><p>Out of the 14,828 contacts who received BCG vaccination, 50 (0.34%) presented with adverse events, mainly (80%) consisting of skin ulcers. Based on the presence of BCG scars, 30 of these contacts (60%) had received BCG in this study as a booster vaccination. Similar to the pathological T-cell immunity observed for tuberculoid leprosy patients, contacts with adverse events at the site of BCG vaccination showed elevated IFN-&#x003b3; levels in response to <italic>M. leprae</italic>-specific proteins in WBA. However, decreased levels of sCD40L in serum and GRO (CXCL1) in response to <italic>M. leprae</italic> simultaneously indicated less T-cell regulation in these individuals, potentially causing uncontrolled T-cell immunity damaging the skin.</p></sec><sec id="ST4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Skin complications after BCG vaccination present surrogate markers for protective immunity against leprosy, but also indicate a higher risk of developing tuberculoid leprosy.</p></sec><sec id="ST5"><title>Clinical Trial Registration</title><p>Netherlands Trial Register: NTR3087.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>adverse events</kwd><kwd>BCG (re)vaccination</kwd><kwd>biomarker profiles</kwd><kwd>household contacts</kwd><kwd>protective immunity</kwd><kwd>leprosy</kwd><kwd><italic>Mycobacterium leprae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="4"/><table-count count="3"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="45"/><page-count count="11"/><word-count count="7859"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction" id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Despite effective treatment of leprosy patients with multidrug therapy (MDT), the global number of new cases has not declined during the past decennium (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). A plausible explanation for this <italic>status quo</italic> could be that contacts of leprosy patients are prolonged and repetitively exposed to <italic>Mycobacterium leprae</italic> (<italic>M. leprae</italic>) before treatment of index cases is initiated, leading to continued bacterial transmission. Therefore, new tools and methodologies, such as immuno- and chemoprophylaxis regimens, are needed to interrupt transmission.</p><p>BCG vaccination offers variable protection against tuberculosis (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>) and other mycobacterial diseases such as leprosy (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>) and Buruli ulcer (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Moreover, recently it has become clear that BCG can modulate the innate immune system also leading to protection through a mechanism referred to as trained immunity (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). The protective effect against TB thus induced in children by neonatal BCG vaccination influences cytokine responses to heterologous pathogens, an effect that is reported to be characterized by decreased anti-inflammatory cytokine responses, but increased IL-6 (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p><p>In a previous study, immunoprophylaxis by BCG vaccination of contacts of newly diagnosed leprosy patients in Bangladesh conferred 56% protection, but was not affected by previous childhood BCG vaccination (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p><p>Although chemoprophylaxis does not protect a given individual from subsequent exposure to bacilli, the use of a single-dose rifampicin (SDR) in contacts in that study showed prevention of 56% in the first 2 years after chemoprophylaxis and treatment of the index case (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Strikingly, if contacts had received BCG vaccination as part of a childhood vaccination program (as determined by the presence of a BCG-scar), the protective effect of SDR even reached 80%.</p><p>To investigate whether the effects of SDR and BCG can be complimentary, a cluster randomized controlled BCG vaccination trial is currently conducted in Bangladesh, analyzing the potential synergetic effect of these chemo- and immunoprophylactics by comparing the effect of BCG vaccination alone versus BCG followed by SDR after 8 to 12&#x02009;weeks to prevent leprosy in contacts of new leprosy cases (designated the MALTALEP trial) (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).</p><p>In Bangladesh, BCG is routinely given to infants as part of the neonatal vaccination scheme as a prophylactic vaccine against tuberculosis. The coverage of BCG vaccination is estimated to be 98%<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1"><sup>1</sup></xref>. Based on the visibility of BCG vaccination scars, 8,430 out of 14,779 contacts (57%) within this trial had received BCG vaccination at birth. However, since not all individuals receiving BCG develop a visible scar (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), this number is probably higher.</p><p>BCG vaccination has been reported to cause adverse effects within BCG childhood vaccination programs in endemic areas (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) as well as in BCG na&#x000ef;ve individuals in leprosy and TB non-endemic areas (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). In the current study, we investigated the number and nature of adverse events occurring after BCG vaccination in the MALTALEP trial.</p><p>In addition, to investigate whether these adverse events can provide further insight into the protective effect of BCG, we analyzed cytokine production in <italic>M. leprae</italic>-antigen-stimulated whole-blood assays (WBA) of 13 contacts developing adverse events and 13 contacts matched for age and gender, lacking such complications.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S2-1"><title>Study Population</title><p>Newly diagnosed leprosy patients and their household contacts (HCs) were recruited on a voluntary basis between 2012 and 2017 (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Leprosy was diagnosed based on clinical and bacteriological analysis and classified according to Ridley and Jopling (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>).

Contacts of consecutively diagnosed new leprosy patients were included in the districts of Nilphamari, Rangpur, Thakurgaon, and Panchagarh, in the northwest of Bangladesh (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Each contact group consisted of around 15 contacts and were randomly assigned to receive BCG or BCG plus rifampicin. Immunization with BCG was given to all included contacts, when the index case received the second dose of MDT. At intake, before BCG vaccination, all contacts were examined for a BCG scar on the left upper arm. After 8 to 12&#x02009;weeks, vaccinated contacts were reviewed for adverse events during follow-up examination. Contacts were categorized as household members (sharing either roof, kitchen or both) or direct neighbors.

In approximately 70% of the cases, ulceration with drainage occurs at the vaccine site after about 6&#x02009;weeks, resulting in a lesion of about 5&#x02009;mm in diameter. Lesions usually heal within 3 months with permanent residual scarring at the vaccination site. Rare local abscesses and ulcers usually occur between 1 and 5 months post-vaccination, but adverse events have also been reported after longer periods of time (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Lymphadenopathy occurs in the drainage area of the vaccinated site, so is most common in the axilla and sometimes in the cervical lymph nodes (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Even more uncommon are serious adverse events such as osteitis, osteomyelitis and disseminated infection (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>).

Although not statistically significant, adverse events after booster vaccinations were approximately twice the rate compared with primary vaccination with BCG. The median time to onset of complications was 26&#x02009;days, 12&#x02009;days shorter than observed in Bangladesh. Similarly, 0.38 out of 1,000 vaccinated individuals developed complications in a study in the Brazilian Amazon (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).

In this study, we used the absence of a BCG scar to designate the lack of previous (childhood) vaccination. However, since 16&#x02013;24% of BCG vaccinated individuals do not develop a scar, it could be that a larger number of individuals actually received a BCG booster in the MALTALEP trial than is estimated solely based on the presence of a scar.</p><p>The development of leprosy after BCG vaccination can be considered an ultimate adverse event. In a previous study (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>), we observed an unexpectedly high proportion of new leprosy patients (mainly PB and leprosy type-1 reactions) among apparently healthy HCs of leprosy patients within the first 3 months after BCG vaccination (0.4% of vaccinated contacts). Of these, 43% had a BCG scar before vaccination in the trial. However, it remains unclear whether BCG vaccination merely catalyzes the formation of clinical symptoms in individuals who are bound to develop leprosy, or whether patients would not have developed the disease without this vaccination.</p><p>Several recent studies show that BCG alters the innate immune system by trained immunity (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). The protective effect against TB induced by neonatal BCG vaccination coincides with protection against heterologous pathogens. This effect is characterized by decreased anti-inflammatory cytokine responses, but increased IL-6 in unstimulated samples (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). In another study, a BCG vaccination-induced increase in IL-6, EGF, and PDGF-AB/BB and decrease in IP-10, IL-2, IL-13, IL-17, GM-CSF, and GRO was observed in response to various non-specific innate immunity stimuli (PAM3Cys, <italic>C. albicans</italic>, and <italic>S. aureus</italic>). Along with this cytokine biomarker signature, increased CD69 expression on NK cells was observed as well (Dockrell, 2017 #483).</p><p>T-helper 1 (Th1) host-cellular immunity is generally considered to be key in controlling mycobacterial infections (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). However, clinical presentation of tuberculoid leprosy as well as type-1 (reversal) reactions also coincides with strong <italic>M. leprae</italic>-specific Th1 immunity and high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>).</p><p>Despite the apparent homology between the mycobacteria, BCG but not <italic>M. leprae</italic> can stimulate monocytes to initiate a protective type-1 cascade (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Moreover, <italic>in vitro</italic> exposure of monocytes from healthy donors to <italic>M. leprae</italic> (or <italic>M. leprae</italic> PGL-I) reduced levels of Th1-type cytokines and expression of macrophage type-1 (M&#x003d5;1) cell surface markers (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). In contrast, <italic>ex vivo</italic> stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with BCG or purified protein derivative of tuberculin (PPD) from 10-week-old infants in South Africa, who had received neonatal BCG vaccination, showed upregulation of m&#x003d5;1-associated genes whereas m&#x003d5;2 associated genes were down-regulated (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>), indicating BCG-induced protective immunity. Also, in response to <italic>M. leprae</italic>, monocytes from these infants released higher levels of inflammatory cytokines TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-1&#x003b2; compared with monocytes from unvaccinated infants (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Similarly, cytokine profiles of infants from the United Kingdom receiving BCG vaccination (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>) showed that a higher number of IFN-&#x003b3;<sup>+</sup> TNF-&#x003b1;<sup>+</sup> IL-2<sup>+</sup> multifunctional CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were associated with growth inhibition of mycobacteria. Although T-cell activation (HLA-DR<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells) was a risk factor for TB disease, increased numbers of BCG-specific T cells secreting IFN-&#x003b3; were detected in BCG vaccinated infants without TB (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). These studies indicate that pro-inflammatory Th1 immunity, although not the only factor, is associated with BCG-induced protection against tuberculosis. Similarly, the Mitsuda reaction measures whether an adequate immune response to an intradermal injection of the heat-killed leprosy bacilli (lepromin) is initiated, as it has a good prognostic value for susceptibility (when negative) or resistance (when positive) to the lepromatous form of leprosy (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). In line with that it was also observed that individuals that showed large local reactogenicity after intradermal BCG administration or lepromin injection are reported to have less risk for leprosy onset (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>).</p><p>In a BCG vaccination study in 12 tuberculin skin test (TST) and Quantiferon negative, BCG- na&#x000ef;ve adults in The Netherlands, local skin reactions varied strongly between individuals (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). It was observed that BCG vaccination induced significant Th1-type immunity (CD4<sup>+</sup> IFN-&#x003b3;<sup>+</sup>, IL-2<sup>+</sup> TNF-&#x003b1;<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> IFN-&#x003b3;<sup>+</sup> T cells) in those that presented with high local inflammation responses, with a peak 8-week post-vaccination. Of note is that BCG vaccination significantly increased regulatory CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells such as CD25<sup>+</sup> Foxp3<sup>+</sup> CD39<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells as well as CD25<sup>+</sup> Foxp3<sup>+</sup> CD39<sup>+</sup> LAG-3<sup>+</sup> CCL4<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in low inflammation responders.</p><p>Similarly, individuals who developed (skin) complications in Bangladesh also produced higher levels of IFN-&#x003b3; in response to <italic>M. leprae</italic> antigens around 8&#x02009;weeks (average 7.9) post-vaccination, although at least 8 out of 13 contacts with BCG complications were not BCG-na&#x000ef;ve and the <italic>a priori</italic> chance of exposure to mycobacteria was considerably larger. In contrast to the Dutch cohort, CRP levels were high in both groups and did not differ significantly (Figure S2 in Supplementary Material).</p><p>Of note in the current study are the lower levels of sCD40L<sub>NIL</sub> and GRO<sub>WCS</sub> that were significantly associated with BCG complications, concomitantly with elevated IFN-&#x003b3; levels in response to <italic>M. leprae</italic> unique proteins (IFN-&#x003b3;<sub>Mlep</sub>). GRO (CXCL1) is expressed by macrophages, neutrophils and epithelial cells and has neutrophil chemoattractant activity. Although the role of GRO in leprosy pathology has not been investigated, increase in GRO levels can reduce severity of multiple sclerosis (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). This neuroprotective role for CXCL1 could well be consistent with the onset of complications upon its reduction after <italic>M. leprae</italic> WCS stimulation as observed in our study. Moreover, in UK-born, BCG-vaccinated infants the levels of GRO in response to non-specific innate immunity stimuli were suppressed as well, in line with our finding in Bangladesh (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).</p><p>Recently, it was shown that higher levels of sCD40L present in serum of patients with Beh&#x000e7;et&#x02019;s disease caused a strong stimulus on the production of reactive oxygen species (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Thus, the reduction in sCD40L observed in contacts with complications could indicate a weaker ability to combat BCG bacilli locally leading to tissue destruction at the vaccination site.</p><p>Besides induction of activated T cells, BCG vaccination can also induce regulatory T cells (Tregs), in particular CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells which dampen the inflammatory response to mycobacteria (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>) and lead to inadequate killing of mycobacteria (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). Likewise, Tregs have been isolated from lepromatous leprosy patients, who in contrast to tuberculoid patients display reduced Th1 immunity and capacity to kill <italic>M. leprae</italic> bacteria (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). The breakdown of T-cell regulation, in favor of inflammation, underlies the etiology of tissue damage in tuberculoid leprosy and leprosy reactions (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>).</p><p>Regulatory T cells can suppress Th1&#x02009;cells through the secretion of CC chemokine ligand 4 (CCL4) (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). In this study, a reduction in CCL4 (although not significant) could indicate decreased T-cell regulation in individuals with complications, causing a shift in the equilibrium toward excessive Th1-type immunity with corresponding inflammation at the BCG vaccination site. However, further research will be required to identify in detail the cellular subtypes involved. Furthermore, the leprosy contacts with high inflammatory responses after BCG vaccination could therefore also be more likely to develop tuberculoid leprosy. In line with this hypothesis are the two cases out of the 50 contacts in this study with BCG complications, who developed border line tuberculoid leprosy (BT).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The rate of documented adverse events after BCG vaccination in the studied Bangladesh cohort of leprosy patients&#x02019; contacts was low (0.34%), and comparable to studies in other countries.</p><p>Contacts with BCG complications showed increased <italic>M. leprae</italic>-specific Th1-type immunity but a tendency of reduced T-cell regulation in WBA with corresponding inflammation at the BCG vaccination site indicating improved protection against<italic>M. leprae</italic>. In addition, these individuals may also be at a higher risk of developing tuberculoid leprosy after <italic>M. leprae</italic> infection.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>The MALTALEP trial is performed according to standard Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines.
