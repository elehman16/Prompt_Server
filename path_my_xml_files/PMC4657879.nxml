Yet, HspB5 can also stimulate human antigen-specific memory T cells to release IFN-&#x003b3;, a cytokine with well-documented detrimental effects during MS. In this study, we explored in a Phase IIa randomized clinical trial the therapeutic application of HspB5 in relapsing-remitting MS (RR-MS), using intravenous doses sufficient to support its protective effects, but too low to trigger pathogenic memory T-cell responses. These sub-immunogenic doses were selected based on <italic>in vitro</italic> analysis of the dose-response profile of human T cells and macrophages to HspB5, and on the immunological effects of HspB5 in healthy humans as established in a preparatory Phase I study. In a 48-week randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind Phase IIa trial, three bimonthly intravenous injections of 7.5, 12.5 or 17.5 mg HspB5 were found to be safe and well tolerated in RR-MS patients. While predefined clinical endpoints did not differ significantly between the relatively small groups of MS patients treated with either HspB5 or placebo, repeated administration especially of the lower doses of HspB5 led to a progressive decline in MS lesion activity as monitored by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which was not seen in the placebo group. Exploratory linear regression analysis revealed this decline to be significant in the combined group receiving either of the two lower doses, and to result in a 76% reduction in both number and total volumes of active MRI lesions at 9 months into the study. These data provide the first indication for clinical benefit resulting from intervention in RR-MS with HspB5.</p><p>

While the cause of MS remains obscure, the recurrent development of inflammatory lesions in the CNS leading to demyelination and axonal damage is a key feature of the condition. Equally consistent are findings of both focal and diffuse biochemical and histological abnormalities in the CNS, in association with signs of oxidative stress [<xref rid="pone.0143366.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. One of these abnormalities is the selective accumulation of the stress-inducible small heat-shock protein HspB5 in myelin-forming oligodendrocytes during MS, which is part of an anti-apoptotic response by these cells to oxidative stress [<xref rid="pone.0143366.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Several studies have clarified that HspB5 levels regularly increase up to 20-fold during MS [<xref rid="pone.0143366.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0143366.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], also in areas of the CNS that are not yet visibly affected by inflammation and myelin damage [<xref rid="pone.0143366.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. It has now gradually become clear that this remarkable accumulation of HspB5 serves broader functions that just protection from oxidative stress.</p><p>Over the last decade, evidence has accumulated for the broad neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory activity of HspB5, both as an endogenous protective factor in the CNS and as an exogenous protein with therapeutic qualities [<xref rid="pone.0143366.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0143366.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. HspB5 counteracts neuronal and glial cell apoptosis, mitigates inflammation, reduces tissue damage, and promotes recovery in a variety of animal models for neuroinflammatory disorders such as autoimmune demyelination, stroke, spinal cord injury and optic nerve damage. HspB5 exerts these beneficial effects as the result of its ability to act as a molecular chaperone [<xref rid="pone.0143366.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] as well as an activator of Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2-mediated anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective and tolerogenic responses in CD14-expressing cells such as microglia and macrophages [<xref rid="pone.0143366.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0143366.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>As previously documented by us using genome-wide microarray transcript profiling, HspB5 induces in human microglia and macrophages the production of large amounts of IL-10, some IL-6 and TNF-&#x003b1;, but no IL-1&#x003b2; or IL-12, consistent with an M2-like protective response profile [<xref rid="pone.0143366.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0143366.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In addition, HspB5 induces a cocktail of tolerogenic human macrophage factors including CD274 (also known as PD-1 ligand), the TIGIT ligand CD155, the adenosine A2A receptor, the TGF-&#x003b2;-releasing integrin &#x003b1;V&#x003b2;8, the tryptophan-degrading enzymes indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase-1 and kynureninase, tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1;-stimulated gene 6, Epstein-Barr virus-induced 3 and the combination of IL-15 and the IL-15 receptor.</p><p>Apart from exerting beneficial effects, however, production and release of large amounts of HspB5 by oligodendrocytes during MS also poses a risk. The protein not only ends up in surrounding microglia but also in perivascular macrophages and B cells that act as functional antigen-presenting cells [<xref rid="pone.0143366.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0143366.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Since a normal adult human immune repertoire contains HspB5-reactive memory T cells that engage in routine immune surveillance of the CNS as much as any other memory T cell [<xref rid="pone.0143366.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], HspB5 produced by oligodendrocytes can ultimately activate these T cells when it is produced at sufficiently high concentrations. As shown before [<xref rid="pone.0143366.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], and as confirmed in the present study, when HspB5-reactive human T cells do become activated, they will start to release IFN-&#x003b3; which is a cytokine with well-known detrimental effects in MS patients [<xref rid="pone.0143366.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. IFN-&#x003b3; profoundly changes the otherwise protective TLR2-mediated response to HspB5 of microglia and macrophages, and turns it into a destructive classical response [<xref rid="pone.0143366.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. HspB5-induced IL-10 production is inhibited by IFN-&#x003b3;, and production of TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-12 and reactive oxygen species is strongly enhanced. By subverting the ongoing signaling function of HspB5 in this way, release of IFN-&#x003b3; by HspB5-reactive T cells within the CNS can spark the development of inflammatory demyelinating lesions during MS.</p><p>This dual function of HspB5 during autoimmune demyelination suggests that its combined anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective actions may be exploited for therapeutic purposes in humans provided that the dose at which it is administered remains below the concentration threshold required for T-cell activation. At such sub-immunogenic doses, intravenous HspB5 is likely to promote tolerance to itself as well, eventually eliminating the potentially pathogenic effects of T-cell activation altogether. To select doses of intravenous HspB5 that would be suitable for such an approach in humans, we first performed a Phase I dose-escalation study, as well <italic>in vitro</italic> tests of the dose-response profile of human T cells and macrophages to HspB5. As shown here, the combined data from these studies led to the definition of a sub-immunogenic dose range of HspB5 that was considered suitable for testing in a subsequent randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind Phase IIa study in RR-MS patients. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate safety and tolerability of periodically repeated intravenous administrations of HspB5 at these dose levels. Secondary objectives included evaluation of the pharmacokinetic profile of HspB5, and its immunological and clinical effects. Results presented here demonstrate the safety and tolerability of HspB5 treatment in humans, and provide the first indication for clinical benefit in RR-MS patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Both Phase I and II studies were performed according to International Conference on Harmonisation of Good Clinical Practice (ICH-GCP) requirements, and in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.

The study was registered under EudraCT 2011-004475-36. After the study was concluded, it was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov under <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02442570?term=NCT02442570&#x00026;rank=1/NCT02442570">NCT02442570</ext-link>; this was not done previously since the study was performed in Europe (see <xref rid="pone.0143366.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 CONSORT</xref> Checklist). At entry, patients were randomized 1:1:1:1 to receive an intravenous bolus injection of either 7.5 mg, 12.5 mg, 17.5 mg HspB5 or an identical volume of PBS as placebo. A placebo-controlled design rather than the use of a comparator drug was chosen to avoid the double-dummy design that would otherwise have been required to maintain blinding, given that no comparator drug can be given by intravenous bolus injection. The use of a placebo was considered acceptable since for MS patients involved in the study, participation offered a treatment option that was otherwise not available. Administration of HspB5 or placebo was repeated twice with 2-month intervals during the treatment period of 24 weeks, after which the patients entered a follow-up period of an additional 24 weeks. During the treatment period, patients returned to the clinic for examinations at weeks 1, 2 and 4, and monthly thereafter. The follow-up period involved clinical examination after 36 and 48 weeks. The primary analysis was performed on data collected in the treatment period, and was performed after all patients had completed 24 weeks into the study. An additional analysis was performed once all patients had completed the full 48 weeks of the treatment and follow-up periods. Patients, clinical site personnel as well as CRO personnel involved in the conduct of the study remained blinded during the follow-up period. After 12 and 24 patients completed 4 weeks into the study, and after 24 patients had completed 12 weeks of follow-up, a partially blinded safety review was conducted by an independent drug safety monitoring board to verify safety of the intervention in MS patients. At no point did this lead to any recommendation to change methods used in the study, or to terminate it.</p><sec id="sec006"><title>Inclusion and exclusion criteria, randomization and measurements</title><p>At screening, information on gender, date of birth, race, body weight, height and smoking habits were recorded, along with a review of the patient&#x02019;s complete medical history.

As recently shown by us, IFN-&#x003b3; changes the otherwise IL-10-dominated protective TLR2-mediated of microglia and macrophages to HspB5 into a destructive classical response that is dominated by the production of large amounts of TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-12 and reactive oxygen species [<xref rid="pone.0143366.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].

Upon screening 76 healthy subjects prior to treatment in our Phase I study, a mean &#x000b1; standard deviation (SD) of 6.4 &#x000b1; 7.6% of all memory T cells were found to accumulate as CFSE<sup>dim</sup> cells after 9 days in culture with HspB5, including both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> memory T cells in variable ratios. On average, the mean fluorescence signal in this population was reduced about 250-fold relative to the non-proliferated CFSE<sup>bright</sup> population, which is indicative for about 8 cycles of division.

In Fig 2A, the existence of a substantial HspB5-reactive memory T-cell repertoire in humans is illustrated by a representative fresh PBMC sample from a healthy subject. Proliferative responses to HspB5 of CD45RO<sup>+</sup> memory T cells in this sample are reflected by proliferation-induced dilution of the fluorescent tracer CFSE over 9 days in culture. With CFSE<sup>dim</sup> CD45RO<sup>+</sup> T cells representing proliferated memory T cells, <xref rid="pone.0143366.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref> illustrates that a substantial part of all human memory T cells, an estimated one in about every 4,000 cells, do indeed respond to HspB5. In Fig 2B, it is illustrated, again with a representative example, that human T cells are triggered by HspB5 to release IFN-&#x003b3;, but only when the HspB5 concentration exceeds a threshold of about 20 &#x003bc;g/mL. The protective macrophage response, on the other hand, is already activated by markedly lower &#x003bc;g/mL-concentrations of HspB5, as exemplified by IL-10 secretion as marker for protective responses. At these low sub-immunogenic concentrations, HspB5 can therefore be therapeutically exploited in humans. In <xref rid="pone.0143366.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>, it is shown that single intravenous doses of up to 37.5 mg HspB5 leads to such sub-immunogenic peak serum concentrations in humans, remaining well below the 20-&#x003bc;g/mL threshold. <xref rid="pone.0143366.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref> shows the mean &#x000b1; standard deviation peak serum concentrations of HspB5 found in groups of 8 healthy subjects 10&#x02013;20 min after receiving varying amounts of intravenous HspB5 during the Phase I study.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0143366.g002"/></fig><p>As illustrated in <xref rid="pone.0143366.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>, and in line with our previous findings [<xref rid="pone.0143366.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], this natural repertoire of HspB5-reactive human memory T-cells consistently release significant amounts of IFN-&#x003b3; in response to their antigen. At least <italic>in vitro</italic>, however, this occurs only when the concentration of HspB5 exceeds a threshold of approximately 20 &#x003bc;g/mL. The dose-response profile of human macrophages to HspB5, which in the absence of IFN-&#x003b3; leads to release of protective factors such as IL-10, indicated a markedly greater sensitivity of the TLR2-mediated response to HspB5 by these cells. Already at HspB5 concentrations well below 20 &#x003bc;g/mL, macrophages start to release protective factors such as IL-10 (<xref rid="pone.0143366.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>). No marked differences were observed in these dose-response relationships for cells obtained from different healthy donors. This comparison indicates that at low &#x003bc;g/mL concentrations, HspB5 selectively activates protective macrophage responses without already triggering release of IFN-&#x003b3; by memory T cells too.</p><p>In a dose-finding randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind Phase I study, we next tested the effects of both single and three consecutive daily intravenous administrations of HspB5 in escalating doses starting at 4 mg, and going up to 37.5 mg. As summarized in <xref rid="pone.0143366.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>, pharmacokinetic analysis demonstrated that such doses lead to maximum serum concentrations of HspB5 between means &#x000b1; SD of 1.1&#x000b1; 0.27 and 12.1&#x000b1; 2.13 &#x003bc;g/mL, respectively, with a half-life of approximately 60&#x02013;75 min at all doses tested. These peak serum concentrations are therefore well below the 20-&#x003bc;g/mL threshold for T-cell activation, but do reach the low &#x003bc;g/mL-levels that are adequate for triggering protective responses by macrophages. Of note is further that the systemic dose of HspB5 that has been repeatedly been found to exert therapeutic effects in animal models is 10 &#x003bc;g [<xref rid="pone.0143366.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0143366.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], which in normal mice will result in maximum serum concentrations between approximately 4 and 7 &#x003bc;g/mL, again within the same sub-immunogenic range.</p><p>To confirm that HspB5 at intravenous doses between 4 and 37.5 mg remains at sub-immunogenic levels in humans, we tested proliferation of both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD45RO<sup>+</sup> memory T cells against HspB5 and the control antigen tetanus toxoid in all subjects at various points in time after administration of either HspB5 at different dose levels, or placebo. This evaluation confirmed that none of the single doses of HspB5 led to any significant increase in T-cell reactivity for a period of at least 28 days, similar to the lack of any T-cell activation in response to placebo. Intriguingly, data obtained after administration of a 12.5-mg dose even indicated a significant and sustained reduction in CD4<sup>+</sup> (p = 0.0004) as well as CD45RO<sup>+</sup> (p = 0.021) T-cell reactivity to HspB5, as illustrated in <xref rid="pone.0143366.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>. Especially for CD45RO<sup>+</sup> memory T cells, HspB5&#x02019;s impact on anti-tetanus responses was markedly less pronounced. In contrast, three consecutive daily administrations of HspB5 at these dose levels did lead to increased T-cell responses on day 28 (not shown).

One of the AEs, a brief circulatory collapse in a female 17 h after receiving 7.5 mg HspB5 was considered by the investigator to be related to treatment. During the follow-up period, five AEs were reported in HspB5-treated patients, and one in the placebo group, none of which were considered to be related to HspB5 treatment. Five HspB5-treated patients reported serious AEs as compared to one in the placebo group. None of the serious AEs were considered to be related to HspB5 administration. One patient in the 12.5-mg group and one in the 17.5-mg group reported a serious AE during the follow-up period. The most commonly reported AEs included the occurrence of an MS relapse, asthenia, influenza-like illness and viral infection. None of the patients withdrew because of an AE. In addition, no clinically relevant changes were recorded in hematological parameters, vital signs or ECG parameters. In conclusion, three bimonthly intravenous administration of HspB5 up to 17.5 mg was found to be safe and well tolerated in MS patients.</p><table-wrap id="pone.0143366.t003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0143366.t003</object-id><label>Table 3</label><caption><title>Treatment-emergent adverse events occurring during the Phase IIa study in RR-MS patients.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone.0143366.t003g" xlink:href="pone.0143366.t003"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">placebo</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7.5 mg</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">12.5 mg</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">17.5 mg</th></tr><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">System organ class</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Preferred term</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">N = 8</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">N = 8</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">N = 8</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">N = 8</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">

In the Phase IIa study, however, such background fractions of proliferated CFSE<sup>dim</sup> T cells recorded in the local laboratory selected to perform the analysis were consistently between 5 to 10%, while the presence of either tetanus toxoid or HspB5 as a stimulatory antigen led to only marginal, non-significant increases in these fractions.

Especially in subjects receiving the two lower doses of HspB5, mean numbers and total volumes of all active Gd<sup>+</sup> T1 lesions, as well as of newly-emerging lesions, tended to decline relative to baseline only after repeated HspB5 administration.

In the four consecutive 3-month intervals of the study, the numbers of relapses in all HspB5-treated patients were 4, 2, 1, and 0, respectively.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec020"><title>Discussion</title><p>While progress has been made in reducing relapse rates and slowing down disease progression in MS, several important challenges remain. Of particular concern is the long-term safety of current MS drugs that obstruct adequate functioning of large subpopulations of human immune cells by hampering their normal trafficking, or even by completely eliminating them. Evidence has accumulated that a normal functioning adaptive immune system is critical for a normal functioning CNS, as well as for restoration of homeostasis following CNS injury [<xref rid="pone.0143366.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Such considerations underpin the notion that more selective therapy in MS, for example by selectively targeting only pathogenic T cells while not affecting the vast majority of immune cells, may offer an attractive alternative. As previously explained by us in detail [<xref rid="pone.0143366.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], ample evidence suggests that the small heat shock protein HspB5 plays a pivotal role in lesion development during MS. Given its high levels of expression within an MS-affected CNS and its ability to trigger IFN-&#x003b3; release by the natural repertoire of HspB5-reactive human memory T cells, HspB5 is likely to be an important driver of pathogenic T-cell responses within the CNS during MS. It is of interest to note that like MS itself, the existence of a substantial pool of HspB5-reactive memory T cells is a trait unique to humans, and associated with Epstein-Barr virus infection [<xref rid="pone.0143366.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p><p>In several animal models for neuroinflammation, intraperitoneal or intravenous administration of HspB5 has been found to exert powerful therapeutic effects due to its beneficial chaperone functions as well as its ability to trigger protective TLR2-mediated responses in microglia, monocytes and macrophages [<xref rid="pone.0143366.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0143366.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. At the same time, intravenous administration of protein antigens is a time-honored method to induce tolerance at the level of conventional peripheral T-cell responses. As well as in other autoimmune models, its application in the animal model for MS has been well documented [<xref rid="pone.0143366.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0143366.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. A large number of studies on the subject have clarified that as a rule, low sub-immunogenic doses of intravenous antigen lead to tolerance by activating peripheral antigen-specific regulatory T cells [<xref rid="pone.0143366.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0143366.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. As explained in the introduction, the TLR2-mediated human macrophage response to HspB5, inducing factors such as PD-1 ligand, the TIGIT ligand CD155, IL-10, indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase-1, tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1;-stimulated gene 6 and TGF-&#x003b2;, actively supports such tolerance induction [<xref rid="pone.0143366.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. More recent data have highlighted that in order to induce functional tolerance in memory T cells, at least two intravenous doses of antigen are required [<xref rid="pone.0143366.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Once induced, peripheral human regulatory T cells are likely to be limited in their actions by a finite life span of several months [<xref rid="pone.0143366.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p><p>When considering the outcome of the present Phase IIa study, apart from the intravenous route of HspB5 administration, the use of sub-immunogenic dose levels, and the active induction of tolerogenic macrophage factors by HspB5, also the temporal profile of clinical responses to treatment in MS patients is therefore consistent with tolerance induction via activation of peripheral regulatory T cells. The reduction in MRI lesion load in MS patients required several HspB5 administrations to become apparent, and subsided again about 4&#x02013;5 months after the last administration of HspB5. Based on these considerations and our Phase I data as illustrated in <xref rid="pone.0143366.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>, and despite the inconclusive outcome of CFSE assays performed during the Phase IIa study, we favor the idea that tolerance induction via antigen-specific regulatory T cells is an important contributing factor to the clinical effects of intravenous HspB5 in RR-MS patients.</p><p>While the small sample size and limited duration of the present study in RR-MS patients preclude definitive conclusions with regard to clinical efficacy of HspB5 treatment, the current MRI data demonstrate progressively suppressive effects on lesion development in patients. These effects become apparent after several intravenous administrations of the lower doses of HspB5, and they are not seen in the placebo group. Along with the favorably safety profile, these data encourage further exploration of the therapeutic use of HspB5 in MS. As explained in the introduction, HspB5 also exerts direct and broad neuroprotective and regenerative effects in several animal models of neuroinflammation. By combining selective suppression of pathogenic T cells with such complementary neuroprotective effects, HspB5 may well offer benefit in the management not only of relapsing, but also progressive forms of MS.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec021"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0143366.s001"><label>S1 CONSORT Checklist</label><caption><title>CONSORT 2010 checklist of information to include when reporting a randomised trial.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0143366.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0143366.s002"><label>S1 Protocol</label><caption><title>Clinical study protocol.</title><p>A Phase I, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and T-cell tolerizing effect of DC-TAB in healthy volunteers.</p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0143366.s002.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0143366.s003"><label>S2 Protocol</label><caption><title>Clinical study protocol.</title><p>A Phase IIa, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, exploratory, dose-ranging study to evaluate the safety, effectiveness and pharmacokinetics of three courses of DC-TAB treatment in patients with multiple sclerosis.</p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0143366.s003.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are grateful to all volunteers as well as all MS patients, their physicians and caregivers for participation in our studies.
