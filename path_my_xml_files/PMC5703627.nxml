In various populations, the prevalence of migraine is about 6% in men and 18%of women aged between 15-45 yr old. Lifetime prevalence of migraine, is 8%-13% in women and 25%-33% in men (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>).</p><p>With regard to occurring the migraine headaches after the stressful periods and the adverse effects of migraine headaches on psychological life of the sufferers and also the role of stress as the headache trigger, cognitive-behavioral therapy of headaches has been considered since 1970 (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Over 50 years, improving many behavioral problems has been affected by cognitive-behavioral therapy. Behavioral therapy approaches developed in 1950 when empirical behavior basis was used to modify the behavior. Moreover, cognitive processes recognized and considered as an important treatment aspect in 1970 and finally it integrated with behavioral approaches named cognitive-behavioral therapy to improve psychological disorders (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Over three decades, beneficial researches were conducted to reveal a number of behavioral therapy particularly Relaxation and Biofeedback and cognitive-behavioral therapy in the unpleasant form of tension and migraine headaches (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). </p><p>The self-sufficiency on frequency, intensity, and in capability were relating to migraine among a sample of teens having migraine. The self-sufficiency is reversely related to the intensity and incapability of headache but it is not related to the frequency of headache. A research titled &#x0201c;A Meta-analytic review on pharmaceutical and behavioral therapies of migraine headaches&#x0201d; was performed and after studying 191 articles about the effectiveness of therapies on migraine headache, the whole tested therapies had similar effects and the level of effectiveness of all therapies on reducing migraine was 0.6-0.75.</p><p>Pain is usually temporary, but in some people, it persists over time -chronic pain. Chronic pain may lead to drug dependency, cause emotional distress and effect on people ability to engage in personal, social or recreational activities (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Therefore, health care providers often prefer do not rely on chemical treatments and non-opioid analgesics to control long-term pains for two reasons: 1) Drugs often have undesirable side effects and may lead to psychological and physical dependency, 2) Chemical methods usually are insufficient to control pain and other approaches are required to help patients (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Thus, the overall logic of cognitive-behavioral methods in treatment of migraine headaches stems from observing the ways that people cope with stresses of everyday life causing triggering, escalating or continuing of migraine attacks (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). </p><p>Therefore, if the effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral therapy on migraine headaches is proved, it is possible for physicians, therapists, psychologists, psychiatrists to use this method as an appropriate guideline in order to improve supporting of patients with little side effects, and migraine sufferers receive the most benefit. Thus, this study aimed to examine the effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral therapy on reducing migraine headaches in sufferers. </p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>The outpatients of public hospitals (Emam Khomeini &#x00026;Taleghani) in IlamCity, southwestern Iran were examined since 2010. Out of 635 patients who were willing to cooperate, 30 migraine sufferers were selected regarding several factors: no pregnancy, lack of heart disease, minimum literacy and older than 15 yr old. These participants were divided into two experimental and control groups. The participants of experimental group received both drug and cognitive-behavioral therapy, and the participants of control group only received drug. The pre-test was conducted for both groups. The number of migraine attacks, duration of attacks, severity and the number of taking pain relief pills were controlled by phone within 4 wk. Eleven cognitive-behavioral therapy sessions were held for experimental group.</p><p>The study was approved by Ethics Committee of the university and informed consent was taken the patients.</p><p>The key issues trained in form of therapy sessions by the researcher included: Cognitive Restructuring (learning how to recognize the cognitive errors and replacing the positive and efficient thinking with negative and inefficient thinking), training the relaxation methods (abdominal breathing, imagination, progressive muscle relaxation), doing tasks and activities progressively regarding the time duration based on the resting/activity periods (without doing excessive activities ), assigning the home works in order to reduce the activities and resuming an active and effective life style.</p><p>Two participants of control group and one participant of experimental group discontinued the research processes. After the implementation of the independent variable, headache indicators (frequency, severity and the number of taking medicine) were measured within 8 wk. The results were analyzed using SPSS software (Chicago, IL, USA) and multivariate analysis of covariance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Various descriptive indicators such as mean, standard deviation, and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov normality test results showed that the distribution of various scores tends to a normal distribution (regarding the score distribution of frequency, duration, and severity of headache symptoms and the degree of taking drug in post-test of both control and experimental groups after 8 wk) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>)</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Summary of statistical indicators relevant to the scores of frequency, duration and severity of headache symptoms and the degree of taking drug in posttest of both control and experimental groups (N=27)</p></caption><table frame="box" rules="all"><thead><tr><th style="background-color:#C4BC96;" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">

Another study showedrelatively small reduction of migraine headache indicators (with the exception of symptoms duration) (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). The results of another study showed that there was no significant difference between experimental groups, besides; there was recovery between experimental groups but not in control group within 6 weeks(<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).Holroyd et al., conducted a study on 36 patients for 12-week treatment that 17 patients were taking drug (Amitriptyline in doses of 25, 50 and 75 mg) and 19 patients were treated by cognitive-behavioral therapy emphasizing on relaxation and problem-solving skills to cope with headaches(<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Both treatment methods were effective in reducing chronic headaches. However, cognitive-behavioral therapy has more effects on the improvement of life quality of the patients. In the current research also, cognitive-behavioral therapy wasrelatively effective in simultaneous reducing of post-scores of both control and experimental groups.

Furthermore, cognitive-behavioral therapy helps patients to restart their activities rather than feel disability due to their pain (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). However, cognitive-behavioral therapy instructs patients to change their dysfunctional and maladaptive thoughts. Psychologists and patients plan together to prevent and relieve the pain and compare this method of treatment with other types.
