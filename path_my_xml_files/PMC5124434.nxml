To improve adherence, measures that reduce adverse events (AEs) have been considered in the area of dosage form design, and the administration method has been modified. Drugs that suppress various symptoms have also been developed and used as supportive therapies to prevent AEs. Two examples of supportive therapies include antiemetics, which mitigate nausea, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), which treats neutropenia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. However, AEs are still difficult to control, and further development of supportive therapies is needed.</p><p>Cystine and theanine is a supplement that contains 700&#x000a0;mg cystine and 280&#x000a0;mg theanine; it is available in Japan and the United States. Cystine consists of two molecules of cysteine, which is a sulfur-containing amino acid, that are connected by a disulfide bond, and it is reduced and converted to cysteine in the cell. Theanine breaks down into glutamic acid and ethylamine after it is absorbed. In the cell, cysteine and glutamic acid are synthesized with glycine to form the tripeptide glutathione (GSH) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. GSH is reportedly the most potent antioxidant in the body, and its levels have been shown to decrease after exercise and surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The need for GSH is thought to increase under these conditions. We previously described that the intake of cystine and theanine for 10&#x000a0;days during the perioperative period led to the early resolution of high postoperative levels of interleukin (IL)-6 and C-reactive protein (CRP) and early recovery from changes in neutrophil and lymphocyte counts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Cystine and theanine has also been shown to produce similar effects in mouse digestive tract surgery models and to prevent decreases in intestinal GSH; these effects were considered to be partly explained by the supply of GSH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>Justino et al. showed that the GSH concentrations in the epithelial cells of the gastrointestinal mucosa in mice decreased after the administration of 5-FU; they also found that administering the intestinal bacterial species <italic>Saccharomyces boulardii</italic> prevented the decrease in GSH and alleviated diarrhea, an AE associated with the administration of 5-FU [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>Preliminary studies using cystine and theanine have shown that this treatment reduced the severity of stomatitis caused by various chemotherapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], suggesting that cystine and theanine is a promising supportive therapy. Therefore, we performed a prospective randomized trial in patients undergoing surgery for either colon cancer or gastric cancer with postoperative S-1 adjuvant chemotherapy to determine the preventive effects of cystine and theanine against AEs caused by chemotherapy and to evaluate the usefulness of cystine and theanine as a supportive therapy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Patients and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Patients</title><p>This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Sendai City Medical Center (approval number: 2012-0010), and consent was obtained from each patient after the study was sufficiently explained. The study was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The subjects comprised patients who underwent R0 surgery for either colon or gastric cancer at the surgery department of the Sendai City Medical Center and who were expected to receive postoperative S-1 adjuvant chemotherapy for 4&#x000a0;weeks with a 2-week drug-free interval. Patients were enrolled in the study if they were in PS0 or PS1, were 20&#x000a0;years of age or above, submitted written consent, and fulfilled the following criteria on their pre-registration laboratory tests: white blood cell (WBC) count &#x0003e;3,000/mm<sup>3</sup>, neutrophil count &#x0003e;1,500/mm<sup>3</sup>, platelet count &#x0003e;100,000/mm<sup>3</sup>, hemoglobin level &#x0003e;9.0&#x000a0;g/dl, total bilirubin level &#x0003c;2.0&#x000a0;mg/dl, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level &#x0003c;100&#x000a0;IU, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level &#x0003c;100&#x000a0;IU, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &#x0003e;60&#x000a0;ml/min. The patient registration period lasted from July 2012 to June 2014, and the intended number of enrolled subjects was 70.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study design and data collection</title><p>The study design was a prospective randomized trial, and the subjects were allocated using the envelope method. The administration of S-1 (Taiho Pharmaceutical, Tokyo, Japan) was scheduled to be initiated within 6&#x000a0;weeks after surgery. The subjects in the C/T group were orally administered an amino acid supplement, which contained 700&#x000a0;mg cystine and 280&#x000a0;mg theanine (total weight, 1.7&#x000a0;g; Ajinomoto, Tokyo, Japan), once a day starting 1 week before and ending at the same time as the administration of S-1 (a total of 35&#x000a0;days) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The control group received S-1 without cystine and theanine. The subjects in both groups were examined at the outpatient clinic immediately before starting S-1 chemotherapy. They underwent blood sampling, and it was confirmed that they fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The subjects visited the hospital 14&#x000a0;days after starting S-1 chemotherapy and at the end of the first treatment course (28&#x000a0;days after starting S-1 chemotherapy); during the visits, they underwent blood sampling and answered questions about AEs. The subjects were observed until the end of the first treatment course. A physician in charge of the outpatient clinic graded the AEs according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0. If AEs that were of a grade 2 severity or more severe occurred during the chemotherapy, the administration of S-1 was suspended or discontinued, and the period in which S-1 was administered at the prescribed dose (i.e., not including the period when the dose was reduced) was recorded. Consultations regarding AEs were given by telephone and during hospital visits, and the administration of S-1 was immediately discontinued if the AE was judged to be of a grade 2 severity or more severe. The evaluation items included the incidence of AEs, which was determined through blood tests and medical interviews, and the completion rate of the first course of chemotherapy at the prescribed dose.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Administration schedules of S-1 and cystine and theanine after R0 surgery</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10147_2016_996_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>
</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>The hypothesis was that the completion rate of the first course of chemotherapy would be increased from 45&#x000a0;% (less than half) to 80&#x000a0;% by administration of cystine and theanine. It was calculated that 66 samples would be required. Expecting the loss of several samples, 70 samples were included in this study.</p><p>All data were expressed as a percentage or the mean&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;standard deviation (SD).

A study in Japan that assessed the regimen of orally administering uracil, tegafur, and leucovorin (UFT/LV) as an adjuvant chemotherapy after colon cancer surgery found that it was not inferior to intravenous 5-FU and levofolinate (5-Fu/LV) therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. UFT/LV is recommended in the guidelines; however, the ACTS-CC study demonstrated that S-1 is not inferior to UFT/LV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The results of this study demonstrated that S-1 adjuvant chemotherapy was effective following surgery for gastric or colon cancer.</p><p>AEs associated with the administration of S-1 have been shown to affect the duration of the administration period; S-1 administered was continued for 12&#x000a0;months with suspensions and dose reductions in 65.8&#x000a0;% (340/517) of the patients after gastrectomy in the ACTS-GC study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and for 6&#x000a0;months in 76.5&#x000a0;% of the patients after large bowel resection in the ACTS-CC study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. As dose reductions were necessary because of the occurrence of AEs in 46.5&#x000a0;% (158 patients) of the 340 patients who completed the therapy in the ACTS-GC study, the percent of patients who completed the therapy without dose reductions was 35.2&#x000a0;% (182/517 patients) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In a study by Maekawa et al., S-1 was administered for 12&#x000a0;months in 65&#x000a0;% of the 40 patients after gastrectomy, and only 23&#x000a0;% of the patients did not require a change in the administration schedule or a reduction in dose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. According to sub-analyses of the ACTS-GC study results, the outcomes were more favorable among the patients who could continue receiving treatment for 12&#x000a0;months and the patients who received 70&#x000a0;% or more of the planned dose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Therefore, how well AEs can be controlled and how much of the scheduled dose can be administered within the scheduled treatment period are considered to markedly affect the therapeutic outcomes of S-1 adjuvant chemotherapy.</p><p>In the present clinical trial, cystine and theanine was shown to alleviate the AEs associated with the use of S-1. Moreover, during the first course of S-1 therapy, cystine and theanine significantly increased the number of days on which S-1 could be administered and significantly improved the completion rate of the therapy at the prescribed dose from 35.5&#x000a0;% to 75.0&#x000a0;%. Especially, the completion rate of colon cancer patients improved from 41.7&#x000a0;% to 90.9&#x000a0;%. The findings also suggest that cystine and theanine alleviates all AEs, in contrast to drugs such as antiemetics, that target particular symptoms. No study has yet demonstrated improvements in the completion rate of anticancer regimens through the use of particular supportive therapies. With respect to the specific symptoms, significant suppression was observed only for diarrhea; however, the effects on the other symptoms may also be significant in large-scale studies. The AEs associated with S-1 most frequently occur during the first few treatment courses. If cystine and theanine can improve the completion rate of the first treatment course, its suppressive effects on AEs may be sustained in subsequent courses in patients who continue to take it. In a previous study, we were able to administer the S-1 regimen as scheduled without AEs by the continuous administration of cystine and theanine in a small number of patients.</p><p>With respect to the dose, the final dosage form of the cystine and theanine amino acid supplement, which contained 700&#x000a0;mg cystine and 280&#x000a0;mg theanine, weighed 1.7&#x000a0;g, and it was readily ingested even by patients with gastrointestinal symptoms, which is a major advantage. The findings of all the clinical trials to date are based on the combination of 700&#x000a0;mg cystine and 280&#x000a0;mg theanine; future studies should evaluate the optimal dose. In an experiment using mice, its effects were not intensified at higher doses, suggesting that there is an optimal dose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>Although the action mechanism of cystine and theanine has not yet been elucidated in detail, it likely involves an increase in the cellular concentration of GSH in the organs that are involved in the AEs which occur. Cystine and theanine provides cysteine and glutamic acid to cells, and in combination with glycine, they increase intracellular GSH concentrations. The use of an anticancer agent is expected to increase oxidative stress in cells and to reduce the concentration of GSH, which is a potent antioxidant. Because the administration of cystine and theanine for 5&#x000a0;days before laparotomy suppressed decreases in GSH in the small bowel mucosa and Peyer&#x02019;s patches of mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], this may be the mechanism responsible for alleviation of the AEs caused by anticancer chemotherapy. A previous study involving 14 patients who had colorectal cancer and underwent adjuvant chemotherapy with 5-FU and oxaliplatin reported that the incidence of sensory neuropathy was significantly lower in 5 patients who were orally administered N-acetylcysteine, a GSH precursor, at 1200&#x000a0;mg than in the 9 patients who were not administered the supplement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Another study found that among 52 patients who had colorectal cancer and underwent oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy, a significantly stronger neuroprotective effect was observed in the group that received intravenous GSH at 1500&#x000a0;mg/m<sup>2</sup> before the administration of oxaliplatin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The regimens evaluated in these clinical studies also aimed to alleviate the AEs caused by chemotherapy by increasing the GSH concentration in normal cells.</p><p>In conclusion, the intake of the amino acids cystine and theanine at 700 and 280&#x000a0;mg, respectively, alleviated the AEs caused by the anticancer drug S-1, reduced the frequency of therapy suspension or discontinuation caused by AEs, and improved the completion rate of the first course of therapy.
