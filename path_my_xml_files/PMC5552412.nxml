Brain volume fractions of grey matter, WM, hippocampus and lateral ventricles are shown in <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c&#x02013;f</xref>, and were highly similar between groups. The grey matter volume fraction decreased in all groups from term to 1 month old and remained stable from 1 month to 6 months of age. From term age to 6 months old, the volume occupied by WM increased in all groups. No significant differences were observed between IAI and control groups in volume fraction of hippocampus and lateral ventricles.</p><p id="P27">Neuroimaging indices of white matter maturation are shown for the internal capsule (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a,c</xref>) and frontal WM (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b, d</xref>). As expected, the water T2 decreases with age (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a, b</xref>), and FA increased with age (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6c, d</xref>) over the first six months of life. Within both regions displayed, the average value for the water T2 was slightly longer in IAI animals compared to controls at term-equivalent age, and the average value for FA was slightly lower in IAI animals compared to controls at one month of age. These findings suggest perturbed WM maturation in IAI animals relative to controls, however neither of these differences reached statistical significance.</p></sec><sec id="S25"><title>Infant Behavioral Assessments</title><p id="P28">IBAS testing was performed on preterm and term neonates with most &#x0201c;survival&#x0201d; and motor reflexes present within the first two postnatal weeks of life.

When comparing post-conception age between preterm and term infants in our study (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>), term control animals reached criterion at significantly later post-conception age (but similar postnatal age) for startle, rooting, suckling, righting, grasp, clasp and auditory orient reflexes when compared to both preterm groups (P&#x0003c;0.05). Criterion for grasp reflex developed significantly earlier post-conception age in IAI animals compared to control (P&#x0003c;0.001), potentially due to earlier gestational age at delivery in this group as postnatal ages at criterion were similar. Unlike survival and motor reflexes that assess maturity of spinal and subcortical nervous system functions, the placing reflex and sensorimotor visual reflexes that require more complex neural mechanisms developed at a similar post-conception age for both term and preterm cohorts despite differences in gestational age at birth.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="S26"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p id="P29">This study outlines the successful expansion of our maternal-fetal model of intra-amniotic <italic>U. parvum</italic> infection to allow postnatal assessments of NHP infant outcomes following preterm birth. Neonatal NHP studies, including those of respiratory therapies and brain development in the preterm baboon and behavioral development in pigtail macaques have previously demonstrated the value of NHP models for the study of important perinatal outcomes that are difficult to assess clinically <sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>. By combining our established catheterized pregnant monkey model <sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> with our newly developed NHP Special Care Nursery we are able to examine longitudinal outcomes in preterm rhesus monkeys across the fetal and postnatal periods. The long-term goal of these studies is to assess more complex aspects of postnatal cognitive development following infection-associated preterm birth and the safety of potential antenatal antibiotic treatments.</p><p id="P30">This study demonstrates our ability to perform serial <italic>in vivo</italic> fetal and postnatal MRI studies of the developing rhesus brain. Fetal MRI is a valuable diagnostic tool for predicting future neurobehavioral outcomes in preterm infants with reduced white and grey matter volumes indicative of fetal brain injury and insults such as periventricular leukomalacia <sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>. While our studies have not identified significant differences by MRI, minor changes in brain volume and development warrant further investigation. By combining clinically relevant MR imaging modalities and advances in technology and analysis techniques with an experimental NHP model of intrauterine infection we are able to leverage the power of a controlled experimental setting with data that is highly translatable to clinical practice.</p><p id="P31">We also provide early neonatal reflex data for infant monkeys following infection-associated preterm birth. In the current study, development of reflexes requiring simpler neural processing, such as the &#x0201c;survival&#x0201d; reflexes, were associated with postnatal age in term and preterm infants. These reflexes were present soon after birth despite differences in gestational age. However, more complex reflexes requiring integration of sensory and motor functions across a number of brain regions, such as visual following and placing <sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>, developed at similar post-conception ages in both term and preterm control or IAI infants. This suggests that premature birth and/or infection in these monkeys did not delay development of these later neonatal reflexes. Small differences in gestational age and bodyweight at birth between animals in the preterm control and IAI groups are a potential source of variation between the groups. However, no associations between birth weight and the acquisition of neonatal reflexes were identified (data not shown). Additionally, the necessary use of postnatal antibiotics to treat <italic>Ureaplasma</italic> infected infants (and therefore also preterm controls) and clinical use for treatment of NEC may be considered a potential confounder, but represent normal clinical outcomes and practice. While we have not identified marked differences in early reflex outcomes, ongoing examination of recognition and procedural memory, which require more advanced prefrontal cortex, striatal and cerebellar maturity may identify functional differences in preterm infants not observed in the early neonatal period.</p><p id="P32">The current study characterizes a chronic intra-amniotic infection resulting in long-term exposure of the fetus to infection and inflammation. We have previously inoculated rhesus monkeys with 10<sup>7</sup>CFU/mL or 10<sup>5</sup>CFU/mL <italic>U. parvum</italic> at 128 or 138dGA, respectively <sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. Despite differences in inoculum size, AF colony counts reached similar peak levels around 10<sup>6</sup>CFU/mL across studies <sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. Ammonia produced by <italic>Ureaplasma spp.</italic> has been shown to reach inhibitory concentrations in <italic>in vitro</italic> culture media <sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> and likely inhibits growth in AF. However, we also observed a muted response in AF pro-inflammatory mediator concentrations in the chronic model compared to short-term infection. Gestational age may mediate this effect, with the inoculation-to-delivery interval and production of pro-inflammatory mediators decreasing as age at inoculation increased <sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. This is consistent with increased sensitivity of the uterus to inflammatory (pro-labor) mediators and heightened uterine contractility as gestation progresses. Chronic exposure to inflammation, beginning at an earlier gestational age likely mimics clinical cases of intrauterine infection, with microorganisms detected in AF as early as 16 weeks gestation in women, many weeks before the onset of labor <sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>. The length of <italic>in utero</italic> exposure to <italic>U. parvum</italic> and inflammation may also mediate the severity of fetal brain injury and level of postnatal functional deficits associated with intrauterine inflammation <sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup>. The mechanisms of perinatal inflammatory brain injury remain poorly understood. Co-morbidities including prematurity, hypoxic-ischemic insults, intrauterine growth restriction, neonatal resuscitation efforts and polymicrobial infection further complicate our understanding of these processes, particularly with respect to the &#x0201c;second-hit hypothesis&#x0201d;, in which perinatal inflammation may increase vulnerability to injury from other fetal or postnatal sources.</p><p id="P33">These studies have focused on the need to characterize the neurodevelopmental consequences of intrauterine infection. However, the authors recognize the importance of perinatal infection in the etiology of preterm lung injury and bronchopulmonary dysplasia <sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup>. A technical limitation of this study is that volume-targeted ventilation was not used. Our use of respiratory support was determined by the clinical needs of each infant based on Neonatal Resuscitation Guidelines <sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. Steps were taken to reduce the FiO<sub>2</sub> and duration of intubation and invasive respiratory support. Continuous mask CPAP was not required beyond the resuscitation period but CPAP was used intermittently (5min intervals) in the first 48hrs of life in response to apneic events or precipitous drop in SpO<sub>2</sub>. Whilst lung inflammation and pathology have not been reported in this study, future work will include assessments of lung injury and function in these animals, including consideration of the greater level of respiratory support required by IAI infants and the consequences this may have on both lung and brain development <sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P34">We have previously shown in a fetal rhesus study that intra-amniotic <italic>U. parvum</italic> infection leads to a robust lung inflammatory response and that maternal azithromycin treatment can ameliorate this injury and also eradicate <italic>U. parvum</italic> from the AF, fetal tissues, resulting in a prolongation of gestation <sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. However, the importance of providing clear evidence of functional outcomes for such treatments has been highlighted by the Oracle Trials and the potential effect antenatal antibiotic exposure may have on neurodevelopmental outcomes <sup><xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup>. Correlating functional and histological findings is a priority of future studies utilizing this new NHP model in order to examine the long-term safety of antimicrobial interventions for premature birth.</p><p id="P35">The development of this fetal-neonatal model demonstrates our ability to study the intra-uterine environment, during infection and pharmaceutical or physiological interventions, providing direct physiological measurements across gestation.
