tissue blood flow changes in the lumbopelvic region and lumbopelvic stability compared to
placebo treatment and controlled intervention among patients with chronic non-specific low
back pain. [Subjects and Methods] A total of 25 participants (7 males, 18 females; mean
age, 33.3 &#x000b1; 14.4&#x02005;years) participated in this within-subject, repeated-measures,
double-blind, placebo-controlled comparison trial. The participants randomly underwent
three types of interventions that included lumbopelvic stabilization training, placebo
treatment, and controlled intervention with 48 hours between sessions. Lumbopelvic
stability and tissue blood flow were measured using a pressure biofeedback device and a
laser Doppler flow meter before and after the interventions. [Results] The
repeated-measures analysis of variance results demonstrated a significant increase in
tissue blood flow over the lumbopelvic region tissues for post- versus pre-lumbopelvic
stabilization training and compared to placebo and control interventions. A significant
increase in lumbopelvic stability before and after lumbopelvic stabilization training was
noted, as well as upon comparison to placebo and control interventions. [Conclusion] The
current study supports an increase in tissue blood flow in the lumbopelvic region and
improved lumbopelvic stability after core training among patients with chronic
non-specific low back pain.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Low back pain</kwd><kwd>Tissue blood flow</kwd><kwd>Lumbopelvic stability training</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Chronic low back pain is an increasing health problem that leads to lost work time and
income<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Core stabilization of the lumbar spine has been highlighted as one
of the key factors that provides spinal stability and prevents lumbopelvic region
injury<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Increasing evidence suggests that
lumbopelvic core stabilization training (LPST) provides beneficial effects in the treatment
of low back pain<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. In contrast, many studies have argued these potential findings<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. An
important clinical question arises in practice about whether the pain relief effects from
LPST are due to improved blood flow to the lumbopelvic region or improved lumbopelvic
stability. Although the mechanical effects of LPST on the core stabilizing muscles have been
proven, the circulatory effects of LPST in the lumbopelvic region have not been well
established. A well-controlled design is needed to prove the clinical benefits of core
stabilization exercises in terms of circulatory effects and lumbopelvic stability. Any
knowledge of the circulatory effects and mechanical effects of LPST will enable researchers
and clinicians to understand their clinical benefits and apply LPST in patients with chronic
low back pain.</p><p>Considerable attention has been given to the various aspects of LPST and lumbopelvic
stability. Evidence has shown the importance of lumbopelvic core stability among patients
with low back pain. The timely activation of lumbopelvic core stability is reportedly
necessary to proper lumbopelvic region function<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,
<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Many studies have proven that the
core muscles including the transversus abdominis, multifidus, and lower fibers of the
internal oblique contract effectively on time prior to activation of the trunk movements
that cause a protective feed-forward mechanism in the spine<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. Some other studies pointed out that the motor control of the
lumbar region contributes to compression of the pelvic ring through the activation of force
closure muscles<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Several other studies supported the hypotheses that aberrant
lumbopelvic stability (LPS) remains a main cause of ongoing pain in chronic lumbopelvic
presentations<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. In such cases, LPST reportedly produced therapeutic benefits to
patients by relieving pain and improving motor control<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. While the theoretical
concepts such as motor control strategies, core muscles contractility, and therapeutic
benefits of LPST are well explained, a paucity of knowledge exists in the literature over
the claimed circulatory effects such as LPST-induced tissue blood flow (TBF) changes in
patients with chronic low back pain.</p><p>In clinical reasoning, the circulatory effects and related mechanical effects of LPST
become topics of interest when chronic non-specific low back pain improves after LPST.
First, it is important to reflect on the potential mechanism behind the circulatory effects
that add therapeutic claims to LPST. Second, it is necessary to quantify the LPS if the
motor control improves due to LPST. The vicious cycle theory proposes that muscle
activity&#x02013;induced ischemia from vascular compromise causes the accumulation of pain
metabolites and becomes a source of further pain<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, it is possible that the same phenomenon of the vicious
cycle theory may occur in patients with chronic non-specific low back pain and lead to
vascularity impairments of the lumbopelvic sources that may further lead to inflammatory
metabolite accumulation and ongoing nociception. TBF is an element that is indicative of
tissue health and the potential for tissue healing after injury<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. The blood flow to the tissues is also advocated as a
measure of the physiological effects of therapeutic treatments<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. A lack of TBF may induce acidity in the working muscle,
which can cause further pain<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>. In this
context, it may be appropriate to monitor the TBF changes on the lumbopelvic muscle along
with lumbopelvic region stability changes after LPST.</p><p>To our knowledge, a collective understanding on the circulatory effect and mechanical
effect of LPST among patients with chronic non-specific low back pain has not been
established to date. Therefore, the main aim of this study was to investigate the effects of
LPST on TBF changes and LPS among patients with chronic non-specific low back pain. The
current study hypothesized that LPST might significantly improve TBF and LPS compared to
placebo exercise intervention using a passive automated cycling and resting condition as a
controlled intervention. The findings of such a study might enhance the general clinical
understanding of the circulatory-mechanical effects of LPST in patients with chronic
non-specific low back pain.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>A total of 25 participants (7 males, 18 females; mean age, 33.33 &#x000b1; 14.37&#x02005;years) with
chronic non-specific low back pain voluntarily participated in this within-subject,
repeated-measures, double-blind, and placebo-controlled comparison trial. All of the
participants were recruited from the community and university area using pre-defined
inclusion and exclusion criteria, while the study was conducted in an outpatient
physiotherapy department of a university teaching hospital. The inclusion criteria included:
age 20&#x02013;55&#x02005;years old, mild to moderate back pain, visual analog scale pain score of 2&#x02013;7 of
10, pain present for &#x0003e;3 months in the area between the 12th rib to the gluteal folds. The
exclusion criteria were as follows: referred pain or neurological involvement in the lower
limbs, history of past surgery, and history of injury in the previous 3 months. All of the
participants were instructed not to take stimulants, medications, or alcohol or participate
in heavy physical activities at least 8 hours prior to the test. All participants gave
written informed consent to join the study and a university ethical committee approved the
study per the standards of the Declaration of Helsinki, Finland.</p><p>In terms of interventions, the participants randomly underwent 15 minutes of three
different experimental conditions of LPST, placebo (passive cycling), and control (rest)
with a 48-hour interval between sessions. All of the experimental sessions were conducted in
a controlled environmental room (i.e., temperature of 24.5 &#x000b1; 0.5&#x02005;&#x000b0;C, relative humidity of 60
&#x000b1; 5%). All three exercise interventions were administered with the participants in a supine
crook-lying position. The LPST was performed on a Pilates Power Gym Transformer (Thane
Fitness, UK) per an established training protocol<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. An air pressure biofeedback unit was placed beneath the lumbar
spine from L2 to S1 and inflated to 40 mmHg. A total of seven different core stability
training positions were employed in the study to train the participants&#x02019; core muscles. These
seven different positions and movements were as follows: core with alternate hip abduction,
core with alternate knee raise, core with both arms adducted, core with both arms extended,
core with alternate arm lifts, core with alternate leg lifts, and core with alternate leg
and arm lifts. All of the movements were performed using core muscle contraction through
abdominal hollowing and co-contraction of the trunk muscles in conjunction with leg and arm
movements. Each exercises was repeated 10 times and increased in difficulty until the
subject could not maintain the registered air pressure at 40 &#x000b1; 10 mmHg.</p><p>In the placebo exercise intervention, the participants performed automated cycling exercise
on an automatic bicycle (Reck Motomed Viva; RECK Technik, Germany). The participants were
relaxed in a supine crook-lying position on the Pilates Power Gym Transformer while their
legs were attached to the pedals of the automatic bicycle. Passive alternate legs movements
were induced by the automatic bicycle at a speed of 30 revolutions per minute<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In the control intervention, the participants laid down in a supine crook-lying on the
Pilates device but performed no exercises. The participants remained in this position for 15
minutes while both knees were maintained at 70&#x000b0; of hip flexion and 90&#x000b0; of knee flexion with
the support of a pillow. An experienced musculoskeletal physiotherapist applied the exercise
interventions and randomized the order of the application of the treatment, placebo, and
control conditions. Another independent investigator measured the experimental outcome
measures and was blinded to the applied exercise conditions in the laboratory. The therapist
remained blinded to the results of the outcome measures. The participants&#x02019; blinding was
performed by recruiting participants with no previous experience with core stability
exercises, and the real aim of the study was not revealed to the participants. Instead, the
participants were informed that the study was to investigate the effects of various
positioning on pain threshold. Thus, careful measures were taken to maintain the blinding of
the therapists and participants in the study.</p><p>One of the main study outcome measure, the measurement of TBF, was performed per a
previously established protocol<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. A
laser Doppler blood flow meter (DRT4; Moor Instruments, UK) was used to measure the TBF in
fluxes per minute. The participants laid down in the prone position by placing their arms by
the sides of their bodies. The target tissue at the most tender spot on the posterior aspect
of the lumbosacral area between first lumbar and fifth sacral vertebrae was identified and
marked on the body. The electrode of the laser Doppler blood flow meter was put over the
center of the target area on the marked body area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig.
1</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Measurement of tissue blood flow using LASER Doppler flowmeter device</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jpts-28-635-g001"/></fig>). The TBF was measured for every minute for a period of 5 minutes during pre- and
immediately post-experimental conditions. The mean value of the TBF was used for the
analysis.</p><p>Another outcome measure, lumbopelvic stability, was measured with all of the participants
in the supine crook-lying position per an established protocol<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. The hip was flexed to 70&#x000b0; to maintain the lumbar spine in
the neutral position. A series of seven LPS tests was performed for each participant based
on their lumbopelvic control ability. Lumbopelvic control was monitored using a pressure
biofeedback device that was inflated to 40 mmHg and placed underneath between each
participant&#x02019;s second and fourth lumbar vertebrae. The participants performed a unilateral
leg lift in the sagittal plane as the test movement at the end of exhalation after breathing
in and out while holding the abdominal hallowing action throughout the test movement. A
successful performance was defined as the ability to maintain the registered pressure at 40
mmHg during the testing movement. The LPS test was stopped when the participants were not
able to hold 40 &#x000b1; 2 mmHg in the biofeedback device.</p><p>A total of 25 participants were included after we calculated the sample size with the
G*power program for an &#x003b1; level of 0.05 and power analysis of 0.80 with an estimated effect
size of 0.54. The study data were analyzed using SPSS for Windows version 20.0 (SPSS, USA).
Examination of the normality of the data using the Shapiro-Wilk test showed normal TBF and
LPS data distributions. The changes in the TBF within and between the groups were analyzed
using repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). The percentage change in the TBF and
LPS values were measured by calculating the variations between pre- and post-change data
divided by 100.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>A total of seven men and 18 women (mean age, 33.33 &#x000b1; 14.37&#x02005;years) participated in this

participants was 40.36 &#x000b1; 35.55 months with a reported pain intensity of 4.29 &#x000b1; 1.81 on the
pain visual analog scale. There were no significant differences noted in any of the baseline
variables in the three exercise conditions (p &#x0003e; 0.10). The repeated measures ANOVA
results demonstrated a significant increase in blood flow throughout the tissues of the
lumbopelvic region after LPST (p &#x0003c; 0.05) and a total increase of almost 54% in the TBF
after LPST (p &#x0003c; 0.001). Also, the observed trend of increased blood flow throughout the
tissues in the lumbopelvic region was significantly higher than the placebo (p &#x0003c;0.05) and
control intervention (p &#x0003c;0.05). A similar pattern of a significant increase in LPS level

physiological changes by improving TBF by approximately 54%, a value that was significantly
greater than that of the placebo and control conditions. Increased TBF to the pathological
area may help facilitate the healing process by supplying more oxygen, nutrients, and
hormones to the affected area as well as removing waste products and irritant substances
from the sensitive tissues. LPST also provided specific core stability in the lumbopelvic
region. Thus, the current study observed an increase in the circulatory and mechanical
effects as evidenced by significant improvements in the TBF and LPS levels among patients
with chronic non-specific low back pain. Previous studies suggested that LPST improves motor
control within the lumbopelvic region and can induce inter-segmental stiffness, prevent
shear force that causes injury to the lumbar spine, and alleviate pain among patients with
chronic low back pain<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. The current study added
knowledge to the above notion that increased TBF may be one clinical reason behind the
improvement in pain symptoms and LPS levels among patients with chronic low back pain. Two
important theories, namely the vicious cycle theory and a new pain adaptation theory, may
support such interactive clinical reasoning behind the observed circulatory-mechanical
effects of LPST<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The vicious cycle theory proposes thoughts for clinical reasoning regarding the ischemic
spasm induced in the muscles of the lumbopelvic region due to vascular compromise<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. The ischemic spasm might contribute to
the accumulation of pain substances in the tissues that may cause pain within the
lumbopelvic region. As per the vicious cycle theory, pain may trigger the excitability of
gamma motor neurons and lead to the development of increased muscle tension or spasm<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. In turn, the pain may further prevent
free movements within the lumbopelvic region, leading to further spasm-pain-spasm cycles. On
the other hand, the pain adaptation theory suggests that pain reduces lumbopelvic muscle
contractility, thereby making them work inefficiently. Such inefficiency may reflected by
several dysfunction of the lumbopelvic region, including a reduced ability to activate the
agonist muscles, time delay in the feed-forward mechanism, and a reduced maximum output from
the agonist muscle<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. This may eventually
lead to poor function of the lumbopelvic muscles and poor lumbopelvic stability. One of the
interesting findings in the current study is that both LPS and TBF increase after LPST.
Exercise training reportedly increases skeletal muscle oxygenation by increasing the
capillary network, improves adenosine triphosphate production, and decreases lactic acid
production in the muscles and blood<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Therefore, improved TBF over the lumbopelvic muscles may have resulted in improved low back
pain condition and LPS and vice versa. Furthermore, the findings substantiated the role of a
circulatory mechanism behind LPS improvement as an additional reason to those such as
improved proprioception, promotion of the tissue healing process, dorsal horn inhibition,
and descending pain control inhibition<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Nevertheless, the above stated vascular and mechanical changes did not occur in the placebo
and control group since those participants did not perform any voluntary exercises of the
lumbopelvic muscles.</p><p>One of the important factors that modulates nociceptor sensitivity is the acidity (pH) of
the surrounding tissue in the lumbopelvic region<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>. An altered pH of the local muscles of the lumbopelvic region is
related to the accumulation of inflammatory soup and mechanical sensitization of the
peripheral and central nociceptors among patients with chronic non-specific low back
pain<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, the goal of rehabilitation is to increase circulation
and movements to the lumbopelvic region to wash out the retained inflammatory mediators and
facilitate muscle activation. In such instances, exercise interventions such as motor
control and movement strategy training were recommended to influence muscle activation of
the lumbopelvic region<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. The similar
above stated principle could be applicable to the current study since LPST improved
movements that in turn improved TBF, which might reduce inflammatory mediators and stressors
and subsequently improve the movement pattern and LPS in patients with chronic non-specific
low back pain. To prove this theory, future studies should investigate the circulating
inflammatory marker serotonin and stress marker cortisol after LPST in patients with chronic
non-specific low back pain.</p><p>The current study may have some limitations. First, it investigated only the immediate
effects of LPST on TBF and lumbopelvic stability. Second, since it lacked long-term
follow-up, the long-term circulatory-mechanical therapeutic effects of LPST cannot be fully
understood in patients with chronic non-specific low back pain. However, in the current
study, the specific mechanism of LPST on the TBF and LPS was also pointed out by the
addition of a placebo exercise intervention and rest intervention as controlled comparisons.
Therefore, the current study potentially provides some understanding of the notion of
improved TBF as one of the mechanism behind LPS and low back pain improvement. LPST has
clinical implications through mechanical and chemical effects. LPST might help reduce muscle
spasms, remove waste metabolites, improve blood circulation, and reduce nociceptive
stimulants in the back muscles. The mechanical implications of LPST might include reduced
irritation of mechanical structures and improved afferent discharge through the gaining of
lumbopelvic region motor control.</p><p>In conclusion, the current study&#x02019;s findings support an increase in TBF in the lumbopelvic
region and improvement in LPS after LPST among patients with chronic non-specific low back
pain. Hence, clinicians might consider LPST an additional therapeutic approach to managing
lumbopelvic pain and dysfunction.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We express our gratitude to all of the study participants as well as the Thailand Research
