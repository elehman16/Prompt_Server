In this study, we evaluate the efficacy and safety of combine and alone use of paroxetine hydrochloride and tamsulosin on the treatment of lifelong PE.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>352 cases of men with 18&#x02013;65 years of age, a history of lifelong PE and an intra-vaginal ejaculation latency time (IELT) &#x0003c;120 sec were included in this study. The patients were randomized divided into three groups. Group A were treated by paroxetine hydrochloride 20 mg/d for 8 weeks; group B were treated by tamsulosin 0.2 mg/d for 8 weeks; group C were treated by paroxetine hydrochloride and tamsulosin at the same dosage as above for 8 weeks. The effects were evaluated by the mean change and folds increase in geometric mean IELT and the mean change in all four measures of the premature ejaculation profile (PEP), the adverse events (AEs) and vital sign measurements were recorded at each visit. All the data were statistically analyzed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The reliable data from 322 patients were achieved. The geometric mean IELT in group A was significantly increased from 1.15 to 8.13 min after treatment (P&#x0003c;0.001); the geometric mean IELT in group B was significantly increased from 1.26 to 2.78 min after treatment (P&#x0003c;0.01); the geometric mean IELT in group C was significantly increased from 1.18 to 9.52 min after treatment (P&#x0003c;0.001). The increased folds of geometric mean IELT in group C (8.07 folds) was significantly higher than that in group B (2.21 folds) and group A (7.07 folds) (P&#x0003c;0.001). The mean PEP scores that include measures of perceived control over ejaculation, satisfaction with sexual intercourse, ejaculation-related personal distress, and ejaculation-related interpersonal difficulty were significantly improved in all groups after treatment (P&#x0003c;0.001). The mean PEP scores in group C have more significant improvements than that in group A and B (P&#x0003c;0.01). The prevalence of AEs in group A, B, C were 9.26% (10 cases), 3.81% (4 cases) and 8.26% (9 cases), respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Paroxetine hydrochloride combined with tamsulosin produce more better therapeutic effects than use them separately. It could be a priority for the treatment of lifelong PE.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><title>Keywords: </title><kwd>Premature ejaculation (PE)</kwd><kwd>paroxetine hydrochloride</kwd><kwd>5-HT</kwd><kwd>tamsulosin</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front></article>
