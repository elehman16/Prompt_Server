Unrestrictive availability of safe and effective blood products is presumed by treating physicians as well as patients. Pathogen reduction technology potentially offers the opportunity to enhance safety by reducing bacterial and viral contamination of platelet products along with a potential reduction of alloimmunisation in patients receiving multiple platelet transfusions.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>To test efficacy, a randomised, single-blinded, multicentre controlled trial was designed to evaluate clinical non-inferiority of pathogen-reduced platelet concentrates treated by the Mirasol system, compared with standard plasma-stored platelet concentrates using the percentage of patients with WHO grade &#x02265;2 bleeding complications as the primary endpoint. The upper limit of the 95% CI of the non-inferiority margin was chosen to be a &#x02264;12.5% increase in this percentage. Bleeding symptoms are actively monitored on a daily basis. The adjudication of the bleeding grade is performed by 3 adjudicators, blinded to the platelet product randomisation as well as by an automated computer algorithm. Interim analyses evaluating bleeding complications as well as serious adverse events are performed after each batch of 60 patients. The study started in 2010 and patients will be enrolled up to a maximum of 618 patients, depending on the results of consecutive interim analyses. A flexible stopping rule was designed allowing stopping for non-inferiority or futility. Besides analysing effects of pathogen reduction on clinical efficacy, the Pathogen Reduction Evaluation and Predictive Analytical Rating Score (PREPAReS) is designed to answer several other pending questions and translational issues related to bleeding and alloimmunisation, formulated as secondary and tertiary endpoints.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>Ethics approval was obtained in all 3 participating countries.

Bleeding and refractoriness to platelet transfusions are prominent issues in patient management, and clinicians face the challenge of choosing the most appropriate transfusion strategy. Meeting the demands of 24&#x02005;h availability of safe platelet products is a logistic challenge, since the maximum storage time of platelets in the blood bank is 5&#x02005;days.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Platelets are stored at room temperature, which places them at higher risk of bacterial contamination as compared with other blood components.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Extended storage of platelet concentrates for up to 7&#x02005;days has been approved in Europe for clinical use, but requires a post-marketing surveillance phase and 100% bacterial testing.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Bacterial outgrowth to high titres, associated with longer storage times, has prompted a further search for techniques that warrant safe platelet products. Currently, in the Netherlands, 0.44% of all platelet products are found to be contaminated.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Transfusion-transmitted bacterial infections with clinical consequences are rare, with estimated incidence of 1 in 70&#x02005;000 to 1 in 118&#x02005;000 cases.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Pathogen-reduction strategies aim to reduce the risk of bacterial contamination of stored platelet products.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> A recent review assessing the effectiveness of pathogen-reduced platelet products in general concluded that pathogen-reduced platelets did not differ from standard platelets with regard to clinically significant or severe bleeding complications or adverse reactions.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Although the use of pathogen-reduced platelet products (PR-platelet concentrates) is not formally accepted as standard of care everywhere, gradually these products are being implemented in transfusion centres worldwide. Experts in the field of transfusion recently elucidated reasons for either implementing pathogen-reduction techniques or postponing decision-making on implementation.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> These reasons consist of the absence of regulatory approval, and concerns on safety and increment of pathogen-reduced platelets.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Mirasol pathogen reduction technology (Mirasol PRT) is a treatment system designed for plasma and platelet products. This technology uses riboflavin, a naturally occurring vitamin B<sub>2</sub>, which interacts with nucleic acids leading to a chemical reaction when exposed to ultraviolet (UV) light.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Riboflavin-based photochemical treatment has been shown to be effective against a broad range of pathogens.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> In addition to reducing the infectious risk of viruses and bacteria for which blood is currently tested, this technology also offers a safety benefit by protecting against unknown and/or emerging pathogens, or pathogens that cannot be detected otherwise in an early phase of infection (window phase). Until now, only one randomised study evaluating Mirasol PRT, comparing corrected count increments (CCIs) of treated versus untreated apheresis or buffy coat-derived plasma&#x02013;platelet concentrates, has been performed.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> This trial showed acceptable 1&#x02005;h CCIs for both methods of preparation and no difference in platelet or red cell usage, suggesting no increase in bleeding tendency. Besides effective pathogen reduction, another important (pre)clinical premise concerning Mirasol treatment is potential effectiveness in reducing alloantibody formation. Indeed, the &#x02018;trial to reduce alloimmunisation to platelets study group&#x02019; showed evidence in patients suffering from acute myeloid leukaemia that UV-B illumination of platelets is equally effective as leukofiltration in preventing generation of alloantibodies, as well as alloantibody-mediated refractoriness to platelets.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p><sec id="s1a"><title>Rationale</title><p>Policymakers, product providers and investigators agree that substantial changes in platelet production, such as pathogen reduction technologies, should also be validated for their clinical efficacy, including an assessment of bleeding.

Three countries involving 10 centres are participating in PREPAReS. In the Netherlands, there are three academic centres and one non-academic hospital participating. In Norway, one academic centre participates and in Canada, one academic centre and four general hospitals participate. In all of these hospitals, there are facilities for haematological intensive care for patients with acute leukaemia, and autologous and/or allogeneic stem cell transplantation for haemato-oncological diseases. Sanquin Blood Supply, the Dutch Blood Bank, is the study sponsor. Patient enrolment started in 2010 and is expected to end in 2016.

This may be following intensive chemotherapy or a conditioning regimen prior to haematopoietic stem cell transplantation, due to aplastic anaemia or a result of the bone marrow disease crowding out megakaryopoiesis. Exclusion criteria include microangiopathic thrombocytopaenia and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP); bleeding grade &#x0003e;2 at randomisation; known immunological refractoriness to platelet transfusions; HLA and/or HPA alloimmunisation or clinical relevant autoantibodies; pregnancy; indications to use hyperconcentrated platelets; prior treatment with pathogen-reduced blood products; known allergy to riboflavin or its photoactive products. Sites that routinely perform HLA/platelet antibody screening when immunological refractoriness is suspected will base this decision on a positive screening test result. Sites that do not routinely carry out this screening will base this decision on clinical judgement. With regard to patients presenting with a bleeding condition of grade &#x0003e;2 before enrolment, a template was designed to support decision-making, primarily enabling the enrolment of patients with old bruises (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2015010156F3">figure 3</xref>). Patients previously treated with pathogen-reduced platelet products using other technologies are also excluded.</p></sec><sec id="s1e"><title>Randomisation</title><p>Patients who meet the eligibility criteria are randomised to receive either standard plasma-stored, or Mirasol-treated platelet products, during a transfusion period (for definition of &#x02018;transfusion period&#x02019;: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2015010156F1">figure 1</xref>). Randomisation takes place using a web-based tool, as part of ProMISe (Project Manager Internet Server). The ProMISe system, developed at the Leiden University Medical Center, provides custom-made databases for scientific medical research as well as an application for online data entry, quality checks and reporting. The treatment allocation scheme&#x000a0;is created within ProMISe and is generated by the computer, ensuring concealment of treatment allocation. The randomisation method uses permuted blocks of variable size, randomly varying from 2 to 6 participants. Stratification factors in the randomisation are: centre, diagnosis (acute myeloid leukemia (AML) vs no AML) and treatment phase (transplant vs no transplant).<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Patients are randomly assigned to the treatment allocation at the time that they are expected to require their first platelet transfusion. All eligibility criteria will be checked with an electronic checklist during randomisation. Randomisation will be requested by the staff member responsible for recruitment. Each patient will be given a unique patient study number, which will be given immediately by the randomisation provider (ProMISe) and confirmed by email. This email is sent to the staff member requiring randomisation as well as to the general PREPAReS email address, controlled by the principal investigator. Patients may be re-randomised in a subsequent transfusion period (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2015010156F1">figure 1</xref>) following a next intensive chemotherapy course or a pre-transplant conditioning regimen and the statistical analysis will account for multiple randomisations per individual.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p></sec><sec id="s1f"><title>Treatment arms</title><p>All platelet products are produced by local blood suppliers (Sanquin Blood Bank in the Netherlands, Haukeland University Blood Bank in Norway and Canadian Blood Services in Canada). Platelet concentrates are all prepared from pooled buffy coats and are re-suspended in plasma. The pooled platelet concentrates are leukoreduced by filtration. All platelet products are stored with gentle agitation at 20&#x02013;24&#x000b0;C up to 7&#x02005;days in the Netherlands and Norway, and for a maximum of 5&#x02005;days in Canada. Patients randomised to the standard platelet product arm of the study receive platelet products prepared in this manner.</p><p>The platelet products transfused to patients in the pathogen-reduced arm of the study are prepared as follows: 500&#x02005;&#x003bc;M riboflavin is added to the leukoreduced plasma&#x02013;platelet concentrates within 28&#x02005;h of platelet collection, mixed and exposed to UV-B light (wavelength 280&#x02013;315&#x02005;nm) for 5&#x02013;10&#x02005;min (depending on the volume of the platelet concentrate) with constant agitation at 120&#x02005;rpm, giving a total dose of 6.2&#x02005;J/mL. Following treatment, the platelets are stored in the same way as the untreated platelets, making sure that the products are not exposed to direct daylight. In all participating centres, a standardised automated culture method is used to detect bacterial contamination of the platelet product.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p><p>Products are &#x003b3;-irradiated if indicated by the requesting centre, even though the Mirasol procedure is licensed for white cell inactivation to prevent graft versus host disease, making &#x003b3;-irradiation unnecessary. The rationale for &#x003b3;-irradiation in this trial reflects a logistical concern that two different policies of irradiation based on the treatment arms of the study could increase the risk of error. It could result in patients in the standard treatment arm incorrectly receiving non-irradiated products, or patients in the treatment arm receiving non-irradiated products in case of an off protocol transfusion.</p><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2015010156TB1">Table&#x000a0;1</xref> shows characteristics of the platelet products in the participating countries. In Canada, platelet concentrates are routinely prepared from four buffy coats, with on average 300&#x000d7;10<sup>9</sup> platelets per unit. The SPRINT trial had shown that pathogen-reduced platelet units with fewer than 300&#x000d7;10<sup>9</sup> per unit were associated with a significantly shorter transfusion interval and lower CCIs (though not an increased bleeding risk) compared with untreated platelet concentrates with &#x0003c;300&#x000d7;10<sup>9</sup> platelets per unit.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>
<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Since there was a chance that the platelet content in a four buffy coat pool would be below this threshold, the Canadian sites provided a five buffy coat platelet pool for patients allocated to the PR arm, increasing the number of platelets by 25%. The Canadian hospitals wanted to maintain four buffy coats in the control arm, as this is the current standard of practice to which the PR arms should be compared. Differences in platelet numbers could potentially lead to a bias in the study. Therefore, before the final decision was made, quality control data from Canada and the Netherlands for the year 2011 were compared. The Dutch untreated units from five buffy coats (n=5068) contained, on average, 380&#x000b1;55&#x000d7;10<sup>9</sup> platelets. Treated units from five buffy coats (n=347) contained 366&#x000b1;55&#x000d7;10<sup>9</sup>, that is, about 5% lower than untreated ones. Canadian untreated platelet concentrates from four buffy coats (n=1302) had an average of 312&#x000b1;54&#x000d7;10<sup>9</sup> platelets. Therefore, five buffy coats would theoretically give 390&#x000d7;10<sup>9</sup> platelets, but with the 5% decrease due to the handling associated with Mirasol treatment, the expected average would come to 371&#x000b1;64&#x000d7;10<sup>9</sup> platelets. Assuming that Canada would include one-third of the patients, and the Netherlands and Norway two-thirds, the overall distribution of platelet numbers per concentrate was estimated. This estimation was based on the following facts: platelet concentrates in the untreated group were derived from four buffy coats for Canada and Norway, and five buffy coats for the Dutch sites; in the Mirasol group, they were four buffy coats for Norway and five buffy coats for all other sites. Under these conditions, it was calculated that the platelet counts would largely overlap, although in the untreated group, about 23% would contain &#x0003c;300&#x000d7;10<sup>9</sup> vs 7% in the Mirasol group.

<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> There is general agreement that substantial changes in platelet production and processing should not only be validated by CCI measurement, but, also, clinical validation for their haemostatic effectiveness is needed. Haemostatic assessment ideally is performed using a consistent and well-described manner.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Several large randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that were published in recent years used the WHO bleeding scale.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25&#x02013;28</xref> The WHO bleeding scale can be regarded as a grading method that classifies the seriousness of bleeding. In the WHO bleeding scale, grade 0 is absence of bleeding; grade 1 bleeding generally is considered not to be clinically relevant, in the grade 2 bleeding category, bleeding of variable clinical relevance is encountered (skin, mucosal membranes, bleeding at invasive sites, etc), whereas grades 3 (bleeding requiring red cell transfusions) and 4 bleeding (central nervous system bleeding and fatal bleeds) are the most serious. In a pilot study where daily bleeding was assessed in the Dutch centres that currently participate in the PREPAReS, we found that 54% of patients present with grade &#x0003e;2 bleeding at some point in their clinical course.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> As this is comparable to the STOP trial, published in 2009, we used these pilot data for the power calculation of the PREPAReS.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></p><p>Secondary outcomes contribute to the evaluation of non-inferiority of pathogen-reduced platelet products in this patient population: the frequency of 1 h and 24&#x02005;h post-transfusion platelet increment failures (defined as 1&#x02005;h CCI &#x0003c;7.5 and 24&#x02005;h CCI &#x0003c;4.5), the percentage of days that bleedings &#x02265;WHO grade 2 occur, the incidence of adverse reactions, the transfusion requirement of red cells and platelets, and the platelet concentrate transfusion interval, and the incidence of HLA alloimmunisation. The evaluation of whether in vitro measures relate to in vivo outcome measures as the 1&#x02005;h and the 24&#x02005;h CCI is also defined as secondary outcome, and is incorporated in several tertiary outcomes as explained ahead.</p></sec><sec id="s1i"><title>Tertiary outcome measures; linking in vitro quality tests to in vivo outcomes</title><p>The large cohort of patients randomised in the PREPAReS being closely watched for bleeding symptoms, creates possibilities for additional research questions. Outcome measures, focusing on the connection of preclinical and clinical outcomes with respect to safety issues (decrease of microbial transmission and HLA antibody formation) as well as other translational aspects, are addressed in the PREPAReS trial. Prediction of individual bleeding episodes on clinical grounds, or with the aid of laboratory measurements, remains a blind spot in the aim of maximal prevention strategies.</p><sec id="s1i1"><title>In vitro platelet quality testing and relation with CCI</title><p>Currently, provided the pH is above the threshold for product release (pH<sub>22</sub>&#x025e6; &#x0003e;6.2), there are no in vitro measurements available that accurately predict platelet recovery, survival or haemostatic function in platelet concentrates.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30&#x02013;32</xref> A combination of individually well-established metabolic, activation and functional parameters of platelet concentrates, combined into one &#x02018;rating score&#x02019;, may predict either the 1&#x02005;h and/or the 24&#x02005;h CCI. For such an in vitro rating value, we selected assays that can be performed shortly before transfusion of the platelet concentrates. We selected three parameters for this rating system, each of which could play an independent role in predicting in vivo effectiveness of stored platelet concentrates, for reasons discussed below.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> First, we considered CD62P expression, an activation marker, on the platelet surface. A higher CD62P expression has been associated with enhanced platelet clearance from the circulation.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34&#x02013;37</xref> Second, impaired platelet survival in animals was found to be associated with the apoptosis marker annexin A5 binding.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>
<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> The third assay is the lactate concentration (as surrogate for lactate production) as a low lactate production rate is considered a good indicator of mitochondrial function.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>

By relating the in vitro rating scores with CCI values and haemostatic assessment data of the transfusion day, and the day after, the relation between this combination of metabolic (lactate concentration), activation (CD62P) and apoptosis (annexin A5) parameters of transfused platelet concentrates, and the usefulness of combining these into one &#x02018;rating&#x02019; value, will be evaluated. Other laboratory tests for platelet responsiveness of the product will be performed and linked to clinical outcome, including thromboelastography and dynamic light scattering (ThromboLUX, LightIntegra, Canada).<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> We apply the same tests also on patient samples prior to and after transfusion, to investigate if there is an improvement in these platelet function assays and how that relates to the tests performed on that platelet concentrate.

<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref> Hence, the PREPAReS trial is not powered to detect prevention of transmission of pathogens. Commensal viruses in the blood supply are not screened for, as they are present in healthy blood donors, and are thought to be non-pathogenic, albeit this may not be the case for (premature) infants and immunocompromised patients. Because of their universal presence in humans, commensal viruses can therefore serve as surrogate markers for pathogen-reduction efficacy. Transmission of commensal viruses during transfusion can be most efficiently tracked using the highly genetically diverse commensal anelloviruses, of which numerous strains can be readily distinguished by their distinct DNA sequences. Genetic comparisons of the strains of anelloviruses in donor and recipient samples, therefore, offer a sensitive system to confirm viral transmission during transfusion and to detect its elimination in patients who receive Mirasol-treated platelet units.<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref></p></sec></sec><sec id="s1j"><title>Assessment of bleeding</title><p>During the transfusion period, patients are screened for bleeding every day by a member of the study team.

The assessments are performed by physical examination and patient interviews, as well as checking hospital medical and nursing charts. In Canada, a validated patient self-assessment form is used on weekends,<xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref> with additional follow-up at the beginning of the week by reviewing the patient's medical record and communicating with the care givers who were on service over the weekend period, to ascertain if bleeding has occurred.</p><sec id="s1j1"><title>Blinding</title><p>Because the Mirasol-treated platelet products show a colour difference that does not allow proper blinding to the treatment arm, the study is not blinded for research personnel evaluating bleeding signs and symptoms.

Thus, non-inferiority will be concluded when the upper limit of the two-sided 95% CI for the difference between the risk of a &#x02265;grade 2 bleeding in the Mirasol group compared with the control group is below 12.5%. Under the assumption of 50% risk in both groups, the required number of patients to demonstrate non-inferiority with 80% power is 618 (309 per arm), taking into account the stopping rule as well as a 7% drop out of patients. For safety reasons, interim analyses are planned in this study after every 60th inclusion. A flexible stopping rule based on &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; spending functions was designed, allowing stopping for non-inferiority or futility.

Patients can contribute more transfusion episodes to the study and the outcomes of different transfusion periods may be correlated within patients. Furthermore, the probability of a &#x02265;grade 2 bleeding might depend on the number of the episode within a patient. The primary effect parameter is estimated according to a generalised estimating equation (GEE) approach using a generalised linear model with identity link and independence working correlation. Covariates in the model will be the treatment group, the episode number (dichotomised as first or later) and the interaction between these two covariates. The primary treatment effect is then calculated as a weighted mean of the effect in first episodes and in later episodes, where the weights are proportional to the numbers of first and later episodes in the study. If the upper bound of the two-sided 95% CI is &#x0003c;12.5%, the reduced platelet treatment will be concluded to be non-inferior to standard plasma-stored platelet concentrates.</p></sec><sec id="s1o2"><title>Secondary outcomes</title><p>We only briefly describe the analysis of the most important secondary outcomes.
