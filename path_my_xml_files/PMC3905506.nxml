According to official statistics, the number of opioid addicts ranged from 1,200,000 to 2,000,000 in Iran, although non-official statistics estimated a total of 4,000,000.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0001">1</xref> At this time our country has the most opiate substance users in the world.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0002">2</xref> Detoxification is the first step in treating these patients. Various methods are used in opioid detoxification in the recent years. Alpha adrenergic agonists such as clonidine act on locus coeruleus nucleus and suppress the overwork of adrenergic system in the detoxification phase, however they produce side effects including hypotension, dizziness, drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, xerostomia (dry mouth) and do not completely eradicate the symptoms of withdrawal.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0004">4</xref> It is speculated that clonidine is responsible for the death of two heroin-dependent patients which necessitated close observation and limitation in the use of this drug.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0005">5</xref> The use of opioid agonists such as methadone also has limitations due to the death risks associated to its overuse and uncontrolled consumption.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0007">7</xref> Buprenorphine is a semi-synthetic thebaine derivative with partial agonist actions at the Mu opioid receptor and weak antagonist actions at the kappa opioid receptors. It has certain advantages over methadone such as lower death risk due to overdose and lower respiratory depression.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0006">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0008">8</xref> Roughly, all the bioavailability of oral buprenorphine is eliminated due to very high first pass metabolism and therefore, buprenorphine as detoxificant is administered as liquid solution or sublingual tablet containing buprenorphine alone or in conjunction with naloxone 1:4. The latter form has a lower risk of substance abuse with IV injection and lower associated side effects such as AIDS and hepatitis transmission in heroin-dependents.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0009">9</xref> The initial elimination of buprenorphine takes place in 3-5 hours and the final elimination has a half-life of over 24 hours and is slowly released from the receptor making it possible for an every other day administration.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0010">10</xref> In October 2002, the food and drug administration (FDA) approved subutex and suboxone sublingual tablets for this purpose.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0010">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0012">12</xref></p><p>Effective monitoring of signs and symptoms of withdrawal is a crucial step in preventing the recurrence of drug abuse and should begin in 6 to 8 hours after the last usage of drug. Buprenorphine, as a control for withdrawal symptoms, is used in dose-tapering regimens over a few weeks or shorter periods such as 7 to 10 days, all of which had desirable clinical outcomes and therefore, make it difficult to select a regimen with minimum effective buprenorphine.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0013">13</xref> With respect to the growing number of opioid abusers and its adverse consequences for health care units and other social services, the use of a detoxification method along with the best control of withdrawal symptoms, lower side effects. Lower period, lower amount of drugs and higher reliability seem to be necessary. Therefore, the present study as a randomized, double-blind clinical trial, evaluated the impact of sublingual buprenorphine and clonidine in controlling the signs of heroin withdrawal in a short-term period, to compare the efficacy of sublingual buprenorphine and clonidine in controlling the symptoms of heroin withdrawal and to assess recurrence in a 6-month maintenance treatment using naltrexone following detoxification.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="S0002"><title>Methods</title><p>This study, as a double-blind clinical trial, was carried out on a group of opioid-dependent patients seeking detoxification admitted to Kerman's Shaid Beheshti hospital (in the south-east of Iran) from the year 2007 till 2009. This study was conducted with the support of the neuroscience research center. Participants were men aged 18 to 40 years and were diagnosed with opioid-dependent according to the DSM IV criteria<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0014">14</xref> having their first visit for detoxification. Exclusion criteria included acute hepatitis, liver disease (SGOT&#x0003e;50), diabetes, acute psychotic disease, personality disorder, concomitant abuse of methadone, beta-blockers, and calcium channel blockers, any medical condition interfering with clonidine such as cardiovascular disease, renal disease and finally, a history of allergy to clonidine, buprenorphine and naltrexone. In addition, patients with a blood pressure below 90/60 and a pulse below 60 per min during treatment were excluded from the study. Patients were able to read and write the questionnaire and were thoroughly informed before being placed into two groups. After signing a written consent form, they were put in either of the two detoxification groups, clonidine and buprenorphine, using randomization method. To ensure ethical principles, the ethical committee of Kerman's neuroscience research center devoted the code K/87/2 to this study. Initially, 50 patients seeking addiction therapy were evaluated, from which, 15 subjects were excluded due to lack of participation criteria or unwillingness to participate and an overall 35 subjects entered the study. Psychiatric interview, clinical examination and medical history taking were done by the psychiatric resident. CBC tests, kidney and liver function tests, hepatitis and HIV tests were also obtained. In order for the researcher and patient to be unaware of the type of therapy, the placebo of each drug was given in the other drug group and each drug was assigned with a code, kept by a third party not involved in the study. The first group received sublingual buprenorphine hydrochloride, 2 mg tablets, and the placebo of clonidine and the second group received clonidine and the placebo for buprenorphine. In group one oral clonidine placebo tablets and buprenorphine were administered 2, 4, 6, 4 and 2 mg/day during days 1 to 5, respectively. In some cases, depending on the severity of symptoms, a 2-4 mg buprenorphine was added in the withdrawal phase.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0015">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0017">17</xref> In group two, oral clonidine, 0.2 mg tablets, and sublingual buprenorphine placebo were administered in days 1 to 5 with one tablet twice in the first day, one tablet three times in the second and third days, one tablet in the fourth day and one tablet in the fifth day and if indicated, 0.2 0.4 mg/day additional drug was administered.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0018">18</xref> The placebo for both drugs was provided by the pharmacology department of Kerman University of Medical Sciences.</p><p>Vital signs were controlled four times a day. Also, before administration of each dosage, the patient was monitored by the nurse and physician for appearance of side effects.</p><p>The main outcomes investigated in this study included the clinical opiate withdrawal scale (COWS) above 12 in day 5, the success rate of detoxification with naltrexone two days after the end of detoxification phase, the rate of remaining in treatment with naltrexone in a 6-month monitoring period and also, the rate of positive urinary samples for opioids at the end of 6 months. The intensity of signs and symptoms of withdrawal in the detoxification phase and the desire for substance abuse were also evaluated in these patients. In order to assess the intensity of signs, the COWS was applied which consists of 11 items (each item having 0 to 4 or 5 points). A total of 5-12 points indicate a weak withdrawal sign, 13-24 stand for moderate withdrawal sign, 25-36 show moderate to severe withdrawal sign and points above 36 demonstrate a severe withdrawal sign.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0020">20</xref> The intensity of psychiatric withdrawal signs was evaluated using the adjective rating withdrawal scale (ARWS) consisting of 16 items rated 0 to 9 by the patient.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0021">21</xref> The desire for substance abuse was assessed using a visual analogue scale (VAS) in which a 10 cm line was marked by the patient indicating the desire for substance abuse. One end indicated lack of interest for substance abuse and the other end indicated the highest desire for substance abuse.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0022">22</xref> COWS questionnaire was filled out by the psychiatric technician at 9 AM in days 1, 2, 3 and 5 and the ARWS questionnaire was filled out by the patient.</p><p>Vital signs were controlled four times a day and before administration of each drug dose, and the patient was evaluated by physician and nurse for appearance of side effects according to various references. Urine test for opioid substance was performed using thin layer chromatography. To ensure the success of detoxification, patients were administered naltrexone two days following detoxification and then, discharged with administration of naltrexone 25 mg/day for 6 months. They were monitored every 2 months by questioning the patient and his/her family on the phone in terms of continuing the use of naltrexone and maintaining the treatment. In cases of contradiction between the statements of patient and his/her family, the family was considered to be the main reference.</p><p>It should be noted that the validity and accuracy of self-proclaimed statements expressed in different studies are dependent on the confidentiality of the data and that the data should be collected in a safe place within acceptable limits.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0023">23</xref> Previous studies indicated the accuracy of self-proclaimed data in Iran.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0024">24</xref> Monitoring was completed at the 6<sup>th</sup> month in person through obtaining urine tests.

Niagam et al and Cheskin et al also<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0015">15</xref>, reported the superiority of buprenorphine to clonidine in controlling the signs and symptoms of withdrawal from opioids. Gowing et al found that buprenorphine was more effective in eliminating the signs of withdrawal compared to clonidine or lofexidine and patients completed the detoxification period more effectively. Although there was no significant difference in the appearance of side effects with these drugs, it seems that more patients abandoned the study due to side effects in the group receiving clonidine.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0025">25</xref> In contrast, Telias et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0005">5</xref> reported a success rate of 73% in 82 subjects in detoxification and withdrawal at the end of a 10-day detoxification period detoxified with buprenorphine and 81% in 32 subjects detoxified with clonidine, although buprenorphine was more accepted by patients. The difference with the results of the present study may be due to different number of samples, consumption of opioids with stronger effects, and differences in detoxification periods during regimens and also, different drug metabolism in subjects. A study performed on 4 detoxification groups (outpatient and inpatient buprenorphine and outpatient and inpatient clonidine) showed that inpatients received buprenorphine had a better chance of following the therapy compared to those received clonidine and compared to the outpatients. Also, they had milder signs of withdrawal and better maintenance in treatment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0023">23</xref> Therefore, the current study was performed on patients admitted to the hospital. The prevention of recurrence of drug abuse is a crucial step following detoxification which is achieved by drug or non-drug methods, independent or combined. Due to the wide range of social workers and substance abuse and its legal consequences, studies on the efficacy of these methods are different in various communities and do not have a certain criteria.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0009">9</xref> The excessive desire for drug abuse is related to the euphoria caused by opioids which is mediated by the mu receptors.</p><p>Naltrexone, an antagonist of the mu receptor, is approved by the united states FDA for treatment of alcohol dependence and blockade of the effects of opioids.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0026">26</xref> In the present study, 19% of the subjects detoxified with clonidine and 34% subjects detoxified with buprenorphine continued taking naltrexone for one month. Although this difference was considerable, it was not statistically significant and it may be related to better family support and better personal skills in dealing with stress after detoxification with buprenorphine.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0027">27</xref> In the current study, 52% of subjects detoxified with clonidine and 53.5% of subjects detoxified with buprenorphine entered the maintenance treatment. The days remaining in therapy and the withdrawal from drug abuse was not significantly different in a 6-month follow-up. A study conducted by O'connor et al reported that withdrawal from drug abuse in three drug groups receiving clonidine, clonidine with naltrexone and buprenorphine was not significantly related to the types of drug used for detoxification which is in agreement with the results of our study.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0007">7</xref> Ling et al also suggested that regardless of the type of drug used for detoxification of heroine, the rate of recurrence of drug abuse is almost identical.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0028">28</xref> The two main limitations to this study was the relatively small volume of samples which is justified considering the difficulty in obtaining the samples with the required characteristics and the lack of cooperation from patients at the follow-up period after detoxification which made it sometimes impossible to contact some patients. With respect to maintaining the treatment with the use of naltrexone, our results were in agreement with other investigations avoiding non-drug methods including Vining et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0029">29</xref> and also Bearn et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0030">30</xref> but success rate was lower compared to studies involving non-drug programs such as group therapy, family therapy or socio-therapy. This shows the advantage of these methods in controlling the signs of opioid withdrawal. Thus, the main disadvantage of naltrexone consumption may be the lack of a mechanism to induce patients to continue taking the drug.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0009">9</xref> Although the rate of recurrence was considerably high in this study, it could be due to the nature of the disease which is associated with high recurrence<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0009">9</xref> or the limitations of the study. It may be better to use non-drug programs in addition to the use of naltrexone.</p><p>Although buprenorphine has been more effective than clonidine in controlling the withdrawal syndrome in this study, the method of detoxification applied did not significantly affect the results of withdrawal maintenance. Perhaps it is better to choose the method of detoxification on the basis of patient's physical condition, patient's desire, available facilities, treatment expenses and clinical judgment of the physician. In order to appropriately maintain the treatment and decrease the rate of recurrence following detoxification, naltrexone should be administered in addition to sufficient control and observation along with consideration of the personal, psychological and community factors. It is suggested that in subsequent studies in addition to naltrexone consumption, non-drug programs such as individual psychotherapy, behavior therapy, cognitive therapy, family therapy, supportive groups and social skill training also be taken into account. The maintenance treatment of addiction coupled with strict community supervision probably obtains more appropriate therapeutic results.</p></sec></body><back><sec id="S0005"><title>Conflict of interest:</title><p>The Authors have no conflict of interest.</p></sec><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="CIT0001"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Mokri</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Brief overview of the status of Drug.
