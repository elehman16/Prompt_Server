We assessed the effect of exclusive breastfeeding promotion by peer counsellors in Uganda and Burkina Faso, on cognitive abilities, social emotional development, school performance and linear growth among 5&#x02013;8 years old children.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><p>Children in the PROMISE EBF trial (2006&#x02013;2008) were re-enrolled in the follow-up PROMISE Saving Brains (SB) study (2013&#x02013;2015). Caretaker interviews captured sociodemographic characteristics and social emotional development using the parent version of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Overall cognition and working memory were assessed using the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children, second edition (KABC2), cognitive flexibility was measured with the Child Category Test (CCT), and attention with the Test of Variables of Attention (T.O.V.A), while school performance was measured by a standardized test on arithmetic and reading. Country-pooled, age adjusted z-scores from each of the above outcomes were entered into a linear regression model controlling for confounders.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Results</title><p>The number of children re-enrolled in the intervention and control arms were: 274/396 (69.2%) and 256/369 (69.4%) in Uganda and 265/392 (67.6%) and 288/402 (71.6%) in Burkina Faso. Assessment of cognitive ability showed small and no significant differences, of which general cognition (z-scores, 95% CI) showed the largest mean difference: -0.17 (-0.40; 0.05). Social emotional symptoms were similar across arms. There were no differences in school performance or linear growth for age detected.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Peer promotion for exclusive breastfeeding in Burkina Faso and Uganda was not associated with differences at 5&#x02013;8 years of age in a range of measures of child development: cognitive abilities, emotion-behaviour-social symptoms or linear growth. This study from sub Saharan Africa did not reconfirm findings elsewhere that have shown an association between exclusive breastfeeding and cognitive performance. This might be due to a number of methodological limitations inherent in the current study. For example since the majority of the children were breastfed, the benefits of the intervention could have been diluted. Other factors such as the mental and HIV status of the mothers (which were not assessed in the current study) could have affected our results. Hence regarding the effect of exclusive breastfeeding on measures of child neurocognitive development in sub Saharan Africa, the jury is still out.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01882335">NCT01882335</ext-link></p></sec></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>Grand Challenges Canada (CA): Saving Brains Program</institution></funding-source><award-id>0064-03</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3422-7460</contrib-id><name><surname>Tumwine</surname><given-names>James K.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>Research Council of Norway</institution></funding-source><award-id>See the Child</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Engebretsen</surname><given-names>Ingunn Marie Stadskleiv</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The study was funded by Grand Challenges Canada&#x02019;s Saving Brains programme from 2012: Saving Brains in Uganda and Burkina Faso (PROMISE SB) project number: 0064-03 with James Tumwine, Makerere University (Uganda), as the Principal Investigator.

In light of this there is a need to find ways to deliver interventions which promote healthy nutrition and child development [<xref rid="pone.0191001.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0191001.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) promotion has been recommended as one of the key interventions for a good start in childhood [<xref rid="pone.0191001.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Even if breastfeeding has been the norm in sub-Saharan Africa, exclusive breastfeeding has not been common [<xref rid="pone.0191001.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], and recent studies elude to country variations and lack of data for many sub-Saharan countries [<xref rid="pone.0191001.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The average exclusive breastfeeding prevalence in the sub-Saharan countries with high diarrhea prevalence based on the last DHS reports was 34%, where a prevalence of 25% and 63% were seen in Burkina Faso and Uganda, respectively [<xref rid="pone.0191001.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>Over the last decade a causal relationship between breastfeeding and cognitive performance in childhood has been debated and a recent meta-analysis supported such a relationship [<xref rid="pone.0191001.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The authors of the review described a causal relationship between breastfeeding and intelligence and discussed the role of publication- and selection bias, maternal intelligence, home environment and stimulation. That was an update of prior work done in 2007 [<xref rid="pone.0191001.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and 2013 [<xref rid="pone.0191001.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] also concluding that breastfeeding had long term positive effects on intelligence, school performance and adult income. The review from 2015 included eighteen cohort studies of which 16 were from high-income countries [<xref rid="pone.0191001.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Similar findings have recently been supported among toddlers in a cohort from Singapore [<xref rid="pone.0191001.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and from a prospective cohort studying intelligence, educational attainment and income in adulthood from Brazil [<xref rid="pone.0191001.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. On the other hand, another review, consisting, mostly, of studies from high income countries, argued that the observed effect is mainly due to confounding and suggests alternative study design and a better control for confounders [<xref rid="pone.0191001.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Nonetheless, there is a paucity of information from sub-Saharan Africa, especially from randomised controlled trials promoting EBF. PROBIT, the largest EBF promotion trial, evaluated clinic based breastfeeding promotion in Belarus and found the intervention was positively related to cognitive development [<xref rid="pone.0191001.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0191001.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Generally, breastfeeding follow-up studies done in LMICs have reported on morbidity and mortality outcomes rather than cognitive performance indicators. Recently, a systematic review was published on differential infant feeding modalities on infection-related and all-cause mortality for children aged 0&#x02013;23 months in LMICs suggesting an inverse relationship in risk for mortality with exclusive breastfeeding [<xref rid="pone.0191001.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. One study on breastfeeding and school achievement in five adult cohorts, none from Africa, found varying association between the five countries. This illustrates how important context is for this type of assessment. Further, the authors attributed the differences to confounding factors, particularly gender, maternal age, schooling, smoking during pregnancy, birthweight, socio-economy and father&#x02019;s occupation and in some sites skin colour and urbanity [<xref rid="pone.0191001.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Maternal schooling was the strongest positive predictor for school achievement and an observed effect between infant feeding and school achievement changed or disappeared on adjustment for confounding variables.</p><p>The PROMISE Saving Brains (PROMISE SB) is a follow-up study of children from the cohorts in Burkina Faso and Uganda enrolled in the PROMISE EBF cluster randomised trial [<xref rid="pone.0191001.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] that investigated cognitive and behaviour development and linear growth at 5&#x02013;8 years of age. The objective of the PROMISE SB study was to assess the effect of peer counselling for EBF in the first six months of life on cognitive abilities, social emotional development, school performance and linear growth among 5&#x02013;8 years old children in Uganda and Burkina Faso. During the EBF trial, mother-infant pairs in the intervention clusters received peer support for breastfeeding, and the primary endpoints of the trial were the effect of peer counselling on exclusive breastfeeding and diarrhoea prevalence ratios [<xref rid="pone.0191001.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Results from this trial suggested that peer counsellors effectively contributed to promotion of exclusive breastfeeding. The 7-day recall showed an improvement in the intervention arm in Burkina Faso and Uganda, respectively, of 77% versus 23% (prevalence rate, 95% confidence interval of 3.3, 2.1&#x02013;5.0) and 77% versus 34% (2.3, 2.0&#x02013;2.7). The follow-up study is justified by the need to understand the relationship between EBF promotion and long term outcomes in sub-Sharan Africa. To the best of our knowledge, none of the studies on breastfeeding promotion conducted in sub-Saharan Africa have measured the long term effects on cognitive abilities, behavioural symptoms, school performance or linear growth in school age children.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec007"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec008"><title>Site, population, randomisation and sampling</title><p>This study was conducted among participants of the PROMISE-EBF trial [<xref rid="pone.0191001.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] which was a community-based, cluster-randomized trial promoting peer counselling for exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) in the first six months of life. The PROMISE-EBF trial was conducted from 2006 to 2008 in Uganda, Burkina Faso, Zambia and South Africa. Burkina Faso and Uganda were chosen for follow-up as these two countries had the largest, and similar effects from peer support, increasing the EBF prevalence rates around two-fold at 12 weeks and more than three-fold around 24 weeks [<xref rid="pone.0191001.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>In Burkina Faso, the study site was located in and around Banfora, with a population of 94,000 people and lying 85 kilometres south west of Bobo-Dioulasso, the second largest city in the country, with an agricultural and gold mining base to the economy.

In Burkina Faso, the 24 clusters were predominantly rural. In both countries, clusters were selected in close collaboration with the community leaders.

The pre-inclusion criteria were that the woman resided in the selected cluster; was at least 7 months or visibly pregnant and had no intention of leaving the study area for at least one year. Following delivery, a pre-included mother-infant pair was included if it was a single birth with no severe malformation that could interfere with breastfeeding. Exclusion criteria included any condition which could hamper informed consent in the mother and intention to replacement feed. In Burkina Faso, the mother-infant pairs included for data collection for the PROMISE EBF trial were randomly done (see page 8 web-appendix [<xref rid="pone.0191001.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]) in the intervention clusters as the mothers receiving the intervention exceeded the sample size needed.

Summation of these four outcomes gives the Mental Processing Index (MPI), a measure of overall cognitive ability. Ten sub-scales were used for 7 years and above, and eleven for younger than seven years. The Rebus-subscale was used in Uganda, but not in Burkina Faso. In this study the KABC-II was used to assess overall cognitive ability using the MPI and Working Memory using the Sequential Processing score. The KABC-II has been used in various African rural populations [<xref rid="pone.0191001.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0191001.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and requires minimal use of language during its administration.

The TOVA is a computer assisted continuous performance measure of attention. The child is required to press a switch immediately as the target stimulus appears on the screen and refrain from pressing when the non-target appears. It measures the child&#x02019;s response time, impulsivity (pressing when the non-target appears), inattention (failing to press when the target appears) and D Prime (a measure of overall attention ability). Impulsivity was used as a proxy measure of inhibition in the present study. Following instructions and practice trials, TOVA takes about 11 minutes for children younger than 5 and a half years of age and 22 minutes to administer for children 5.5 years and older.</p><p>Cognitive flexibility was assessed using the children&#x02019;s category test (CCT <sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) [<xref rid="pone.0191001.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].

The SDQ is a widely used screening tool for mental health symptoms in children.</p><p>It is composed of 25 items about the child&#x02019;s behaviour, rated on a 3-point Likert scale (0 = Not true, 1 = somewhat true, 2 = certainly true) which the caregiver responds to. These items are summarized into five scales; 1) emotional symptoms, 2) conduct problems, 3) hyperactivity, and 4) peer relationship problems. There are five questions for each domain. Item 1&#x02013;4 constitutes the mental health problem symptoms and can be aggregated into a single total difficulties score (TDS). The entire questionnaire took about 30 minutes. English and French are the administrative languages in Uganda and Burkina Faso, respectively, and they are taught in school. All the written material was in these two languages. The relevant local languages, <italic>Lumasaaba</italic> and <italic>Diola</italic>, respectively, were not systematically taught in school so a written version of it was hard to use for the data collectors who spoke the local languages. We translated the questionnaire material items immediately underneath the English and French items so we had a standardised content validity translation of all items. This was done in group work to ensure concept validity across different local dialects. Back-translation was also done.</p><p>School performance was assessed by an age appropriate school test that was made up by and corrected by two qualified teachers. It embraced all the expected fields: Literacy, Writing, English and Maths. The test was consistent with the national curriculum and the lay-out was similar to the usual school tests given in the study area. The test took about 20&#x02013;30 minutes for the children and was done only in Uganda.</p><p>Height was measured to the nearest 0.1cm using a Seca stadiometer<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> in the 263 series.

For the assessment of socio-economic status, a rank was constructed based on the multiple component analysis function in Stata. The modelling included assets such as mobile phones, radios, bikes, scooters and house construction characteristics (roofing materials, window, walls and doors). If the variable had no &#x02018;variance&#x02019; (&#x0003c;10 owned it or &#x0003e;90% owned it), it was considered as not adding value to the model and was withdrawn. The rank was divided into quintiles and the distribution presented by arm. To address content validity the quintiles were tabulated against goods such as electricity, car, tap water, computer and mobile phones to ensure that those items were distributed in the top quintiles. This was the case for our final model that explained 89.7% of the first dimension.</p></sec><sec id="sec015"><title>Assessment</title><p>The data collection was carried out by different types of data collectors. For example, the neuro-psychological tests were done by personnel holding at least a university degree in psychology or a similar subject.

The psychometric tests were done in the mornings, and snacks and refreshment were provided during the day to the caregiver-child pair. The SDQ was incorporated into the larger questionnaire.

Categorical variables were summarized with percentages while means, medians, standard deviations, ranges and interquartile ranges were used for continuous variables. The main exposure variable was to have been randomized to an EBF peer counselling cluster in the first six months of life. The main outcomes, all of them continuous, were child&#x02019;s cognitive function, behavioural symptoms, school performance, and physical growth. Age adjusted z-scores for the cognitive assessment and emotion-behaviour-social symptoms were generated from the control group. We estimated the association between the exposure and each of the continuous outcomes using linear regression. Potential confounding variables that were imbalanced at baseline and were associated with the outcomes with a p-value &#x0003c;0.25 were adjusted for using multivariable linear regression models. The country datasets were pooled and all final regression analyses were adjusted for clustering.</p><p>While regression analyses were limited to participants with complete data on all covariates, there were covariates with missing data including height-for-age z-scores.

The funder of the study facilitated regular meetings where grantees could attend and discuss selection of tools, methods and results. The intention was that this could ease comparability on the effectiveness of the interventions that got funding for follow-up. A set of indicators were thus agreed upon and the outcome measures selected for the PROMISE SB study were done in order to harmonise the study with these requirements. However, the researchers were free to select the tools according to our skills and experience.

As none of the neuro-psychological tests and questionnaire based instruments were normed in sub-Saharan Africa, all scores were converted into age specific age bands of 1 year z-scores that were compared between arms.</p><p>Our main findings suggest no association between EBF promotion and the studied outcomes. Separate country assessment did not show any relationship, and pooling the data did not &#x0201c;wash out&#x0201d; a minor effect in any site. As the large sample size made this a study with high power we think &#x02018;type II&#x02019; error (not rejecting H0 when H0 is not true) is less likely. We provided post-hoc calculations in an earlier paper on secondary outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0191001.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], however, this is not a recommended practice [<xref rid="pone.0191001.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and is strongly discouraged in the literature. Looking at the confidence intervals, they all narrow and contain zero. Looking at national, pooled, sub- and aggregated scales increases our confidence that there were no differences detected in cognitive abilities and social-emotional development from the peer support breastfeeding promotion on those mental health aspects at 5&#x02013;8 years. We provided intra-cluster correlation coefficients for future sample size calculations (Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0191001.t006">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0191001.t007">7</xref>) when stratifying on EBF-practice at 12 weeks. We also re-ran our models stratifying for sex. There wereno sex difference on the cognitive performance tests or social-emotional development in the pooled data. Both children in the intervention and control arms were equally distributed in terms of socio-demographic characteristics, except with a socio-economic favour of the control arm. Controlling for that did not change our results. Further, the children re-enrolled shared similar characteristics to the children lost to follow-up, so we did not expect a major selection bias. Our findings are contrary to findings from other countries where EBF promotion has been associated with child cognitive development [<xref rid="pone.0191001.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, EBF promotion has not yet been identified as an intervention that can improve cognitive performances among children in sub-Saharan Africa. Even though we did not find an association between EBF promotion and children&#x02019;s test performance, social emotional development and linear growth outcomes in the present study, there are possible explanations that might be related to the characteristics of the intervention and the control arm in the studied cohort.</p><p>First, the majority of our children in the cohort were breastfed, as breastfeeding is the norm [<xref rid="pone.0191001.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. It may be harder to detect an effect where the frequency of EBF varies in a population predominantly breastfed compared to studies comparing breastfeeding to non-breastfeeding practices [<xref rid="pone.0191001.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Thus, the beneficial effect of the intervention could have been diluted. This problem of comparing the best (exclusively breastfeeding) to the second best option (any breastfeeding) was also mentioned in the PROBIT trial follow-up published in 2008, where exclusive breastfeeding promotion of varying time durations were compared [<xref rid="pone.0191001.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, they managed to detect favourable outcomes related to the intervention. If we only look at the outcome measures by the primary outcome of the trial, exclusive breastfeeding at three months using a one week recall, we still do not find any difference in cognition, except some improvement in the adjusted analysis for inhibition (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0191001.t006">Table 6</xref>). This was not present when we looked at the six months EBF status. As the inhibition was the only significant different finding, we interpret that with care. Similarly, a recent cohort study from South Africa among HIV exposed and unexposed children [<xref rid="pone.0191001.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] only found improved cognition among boys who had been breastfed for more than 5 months compared to less than one months, indicating that in order to detect a difference, the feeding behaviour needs to be substantially different.</p><p>Factors such as nutrition, home environment, parental education and family income have been identified as contributing to improve cognitive abilities among children in sub-Saharan Africa [<xref rid="pone.0191001.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0191001.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0191001.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Domestic violence, harmful substance use, extreme poverty, sickness or undernutrition do affect children performances negatively [<xref rid="pone.0191001.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Children in the cohort may have been exposed to some of these conditions and challenges that may have wiped out any smaller detectable benefit from the intervention.</p><p>Particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, breastfeeding promotion and large Unicef/WHO initiatives such as the baby-friendly-hospital initiative were challenged by the HIV-epidemic since mother-to-child transmission of breastfeeding was described in the early nineties [<xref rid="pone.0191001.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The frequent shifts in the WHO recommendations on HIV and infant feeding, after the millennium, was appreciated for its scientific progress, but often created confusion and stress [<xref rid="pone.0191001.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In 2006, when the PROMISE EBF trial started, the 2004 WHO HIV and infant guideline [<xref rid="pone.0191001.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] emphasized the so called &#x0201c;AFASS&#x0201d; criteria (acceptable, feasible, affordable, sustainable and safe) for replacement feeding to be recommended. In case of any HIV infection, the likelihood for the woman to be tested and included in a prevention-of-mother-to-child program was limited [<xref rid="pone.0191001.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The PROMISE EBF research team did not have the capacity to include HIV assessment or management as a component in the initial trial. That we were not be able to stratify our results by HIV-exposure status is a major limitation. A strength however was the one-week recall period of Exclusive Breastfeeding and concurrent follow-up. This makes us confident in describing the feeding practice.</p><p>It may also be that the intervention was not intensive or long enough. We know that the intervention was pro-poor [<xref rid="pone.0191001.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] attracting the poorest women most towards adapting it. These women might thus have prolonged EBF into the recommended period of complementary feeding which our intervention did not cover.</p><p>Even if we attempted, through stringent supervision and training in psychometric testing, to get as good data as possible one has to remember that none of the tests were normed in Uganda or Burkina Faso. However, they have been successfully used and reported with good construct validity in western and eastern Africa, including Uganda [<xref rid="pone.0191001.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. We believe that the conversion into z-scores, which were then compared between the two arms, would have allowed a detection of any substantial arm differences. We did not control for parental or caregivers cognitive performance or mental health status either, however, we believed that this was handled with randomisation.</p><p>Moreover, child cognition and behaviour are not static, but are part of a developmental process. As we cannot control for all time dependent variables, we cannot conclude with confidence that there were no beneficial effects of the EBF promotion intervention except behavioural change [<xref rid="pone.0191001.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Mothers reported satisfaction with the intervention [<xref rid="pone.0191001.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] which also matters. Rather it might be correct to say that we were not able to notice differences between EBF promotion and control arms for tested outcomes after 5&#x02013;8 years&#x02019; follow-up.</p><p>Further, our results suggest no association between EBF promotion and children schooling outcomes in the two arms, although children in the control arm were better at attending kindergarten. It is hard to interpret how this can be related to the intervention, and there is a need to consider other factors in place for more accurate interpretation, such as capturing of socio-economic status.</p><p>No behavioural problems were associated with the EBF promotion intervention. In Burkina Faso and Uganda, no advantageous effects of EBF promotion were noticed on child growth at six months, rather a small negative development [<xref rid="pone.0191001.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] even after adjusting for socio-economic status. The current study did not find any difference in HAZ between the intervention and control arms. This suggest a temporal fluctuation and the absence of any harm from the intervention.</p><p>This study had some limitations related to our study population. The main limitation is related to the selected tools, which were not normed in the settings, may not have given a correct picture of the children&#x02019;s ability to perform or were not culturally sensitive to their behavioural symptoms. All children have lots of capabilities and capacities we are not measuring like humour, self-esteem, belief-systems, risk-taking and trust. There is a need for improved culturally-sensitive contextually relevant and normed instruments which can be used particularly for evaluating interventions and detecting treatment gaps in children.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec027"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Peer promotion for exclusive breastfeeding in Burkina Faso and Uganda was not associated with differences at 5&#x02013;8 years of age in a range of measures of child development: cognitive abilities, emotion-behaviour-social symptoms or linear growth. This study from sub Saharan Africa did not reconfirm findings elsewhere that have shown an association between exclusive breastfeeding and cognitive performance. This might be due to a number of methodological limitations inherent in the current study. For example since the majority of the children were breastfed, the benefits of the intervention could have been diluted. Other factors such as the mental and HIV status of the mothers (which were not assessed in the current study) could have affected our results. Hence regarding the effect of exclusive breastfeeding on measures of child neurocognitive development in sub Saharan Africa, the jury is still out.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec028"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0191001.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Baseline characteristics of the children studied in PROMISE Saving Brains and those not re-enrolled.</title><p>Continuous variables.</p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0191001.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0191001.s002"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>Baseline characteristics of the children studied in PROMISE Saving Brains and those not re-enrolled.</title><p>Categorical variables.</p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0191001.s002.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0191001.s003"><label>S3 Table</label><caption><title>Post hoc power assessment.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0191001.s003.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0191001.s004"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>CONSORT checklist: USE_CONSORT Checklist_August_2017.doc.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0191001.s004.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0191001.s005"><label>S2 File</label><caption><title>Protocol for the Saving Brains study in Burkina Faso and Uganda: USE_PROTOCOL_Saving Brain_BFA_UGA.doc.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0191001.s005.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The study was funded by Grand Challenges Canada&#x02019;s Saving Brains programme from 2012: Saving Brains in Uganda and Burkina Faso (PROMISE SB) project number: 0064&#x02013;03 with James Tumwine, Makerere University (Uganda) as the Principal Investigator.
