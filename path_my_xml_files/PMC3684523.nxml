One of the increasingly common, healthier snacks includes Greek-style yogurt, which is typically higher in protein than regular yogurt. This study evaluated whether a 160&#x000a0;kcal higher-protein (HP) Greek-style yogurt snack improves appetite control, satiety, and delays subsequent eating compared to an isocaloric normal protein (NP) regular yogurt in healthy women. This study also identified the factors that predict the onset of eating.</p></sec><sec><title>Findings</title><p>Thirty-two healthy women (age: 27&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2y; BMI: 23.0&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.4&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>) completed the acute, randomized crossover-design study. On separate days, participants came to our facility to consume a standardized lunch followed by the consumption of the NP (5.0&#x000a0;g protein) or HP (14.0&#x000a0;g protein) yogurt at 3&#x000a0;h post-lunch. Perceived hunger and fullness were assessed throughout the afternoon until dinner was voluntarily requested; ad libitum dinner was then provided. Snacking led to reductions in hunger and increases in fullness. No differences in post-snack perceived hunger or fullness were observed between the NP and HP yogurt snacks. Dinner was voluntarily requested at approximately 2:40&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0:05&#x000a0;h post-snack with no differences between the HP vs. NP yogurts. Ad libitum dinner intake was not different between the snacks (NP: 686&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;33&#x000a0;kcal vs. HP: 709&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;34&#x000a0;kcal; p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.324).

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. In fact, approximately 30% of daily intake is comprised of snacking, which is defined as any eating occasion outside of a typical meal time
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Additionally, women tend to snack more frequently than men
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Over the past 30y, yogurt has become a popular afternoon snack
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. More recently, Greek yogurt was introduced into the U.S. market which has led to further increases in yogurt consumption
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. One of the unique qualities of Greek yogurt is the higher quantity of dietary protein compared to regular yogurt (20&#x02013;25 vs. 5-7&#x000a0;g protein/serving, respectively)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Increased dietary protein has been shown to be an effective dietary strategy to promote improvements in appetite control, satiety, and the regulation of energy intake
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. However, the majority of existing data comes from the comparison of normal protein vs. high protein meals consisting of 240-1400&#x000a0;kcal/meal, containing 35-50&#x000a0;g protein

On day 4 of each pattern, the participants consumed a standardized 300&#x000a0;kcal breakfast (15% protein/60% CHO/25% fat), at home, and reported to the Brain Imaging Center 1&#x000a0;h prior to lunch to begin the 8&#x000a0;h testing day. Each participant was placed in a separate room, absent of time cues. During the testing days, the participants were permitted to relax and engage in numerous (sedentary) activities. Some of these include reading, watching movies, homework etc. as long as the task was devoid of time cues. The testing day began with the consumption of the standardized 500&#x000a0;kcal lunch meal (15% protein/55% CHO/30% fat) and 8&#x000a0;oz water. The respective snack pattern was completed 3&#x000a0;h after lunch and the participants had 15&#x000a0;min to consume the snack and 8&#x000a0;oz water. Snack palatability and sensory characteristics (i.e., appearance, aroma, flavor texture and overall liking) were assessed for each snack using visual analogue scales (VAS). The questions were worded as &#x0201c;how strong is the&#x02026; or how much do you like the&#x02026;&#x0201d; with anchors at extremely dislike/low or extremely like/high. Validated perceived appetite (hunger, desire to eat, prospective food consumption, &#x00026; fullness) questionnaires incorporating a 100&#x000a0;mm horizontal line rating scale for each response were given randomly as well as incrementally (every 30&#x000a0;min) using computerized VAS throughout the afternoon

For perceived hunger and fullness measures, a repeated measure ANOVA was performed to determine main effects of time, snack condition, and interactions. Additionally, post-snack Area Under the Curve (AUC) for perceived hunger and fullness were calculated using the trapezoidal rule
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Paired-sample t-tests were applied to compare differences in snack palatability and sensory characteristics, post-snack AUC for perceived sensations, time to dinner request, and dinner intake between snack conditions. To examine the predictors of eating initiation, Pearson correlation analyses were performed on each post-snack time point for the following continuous variables: perceived hunger, fullness, desire to eat, and actual time of day as well as the categorical variable, habitual dinner time, which was collected from screening food records. For the later variable, at each time point, we enter &#x02018;Yes&#x02019; this is the habitual time in which the participant typically eats dinner or &#x02018;No&#x02019; this is not the habitual time in which the participant typically eats dinner. These variables were correlated with another categorical variable, time to dinner request. For this variable, at each time point, we entered either &#x02018;Yes&#x02019; dinner was requested or &#x02018;No&#x02019; dinner was not requested. A multivariate regression was then performed using the previously stated variables found to be associated with time to dinner request.

In a previous snack study comparing low protein (~5&#x000a0;g protein) vs. high protein (~20&#x000a0;g protein) snacks of 20&#x02013;80&#x000a0;kcal also found no differences in post-snack hunger, desire to eat, prospective food consumption, or fullness
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The lack of differences observed in this study as well as the current study might be due to either the small energy content of the snacks consumed or the relatively small difference in protein content between the low vs. high protein snacks (5-15&#x000a0;g protein differential between snacks)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In another study that incorporated a larger snack (i.e. 287&#x000a0;kcal) with similar protein quantities (3 vs. 10&#x000a0;g) as the previously discussed and current study, consumption of the snack with 10&#x000a0;g protein resulted in decreased hunger and increased fullness up to 60&#x000a0;min post-snack. This study also observed a lack of difference in time to dinner request between the two snacks
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. An additional study that incorporated larger snacks (i.e. 240&#x000a0;kcal) with greater protein quantities (26&#x02013;46&#x000a0;g protein), substantial increases in hunger and reductions in fullness were observed compared to normal protein versions
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Because a larger snack size (i.e. energy content) typically occurs simultaneously with larger protein quantities, it is unclear as to which factor has the greatest impact on appetite control and satiety.</p><p>In addition to perceived sensations of fullness over time, another indicator of satiety includes the onset of subsequent eating (i.e., eating initiation). Most of the current research utilizes a fixed meal design resulting in the consumption of a subsequent meal without taking into consideration the motivational state of the individual (i.e., whether the individual is sufficiently hungry enough to want to eat again and/or would have requested dinner at that time)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Only a limited number of studies, including the current study, incorporate this approach by identifying the time to voluntary dinner request
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Of these, only a subset were snack studies
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], and only one study previously evaluated the effects of normal vs. high protein snacks
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. As shown in Marmonier, et al.
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], a high protein afternoon snack led to a 30&#x000a0;min delay in voluntary request for dinner compared to consuming high carbohydrate or high fat snacks
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The lack of difference in the onset of subsequent eating in the current study might again be attributed to the smaller absolute protein quantities (5 vs. 14&#x000a0;g) or the smaller protein differential (9&#x000a0;g) between our snacks compared to the Marmonier et al. study which compared 26&#x000a0;g vs. 46&#x000a0;g protein with a 20&#x000a0;g differential. Therefore, dose-dependent studies of varying protein quantities in varying snack sizes are warranted.</p><p>Lastly, by allowing the timing of dinner to fluctuate, we were able to determine that perceived hunger is the best predictor of voluntary eating initiation. Further, in healthy women, perceived hunger reaching a value of approximately 80&#x000a0;mm was sufficient to elicit the onset of eating. Thus, it is now possible to incorporate this data into fixed meal designs based on a specific hunger threshold.</p><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>In the current study, several factors exist which might have influenced the overall study findings. Dietary restraint was not specifically assessed, or used as part of the screening criteria. However, individuals who were clinically diagnosed with an eating disorder, those that displayed rapid weight gain and/or loss over a short period of time (&#x02264; 6&#x000a0;months), those that had a-typical eating behaviors and/or patterns (1 meal/day; 6 meals/day, etc.), or those who infrequently or never snacked were excluded from the study. We sought to include a sample size that would be representative of a healthy female population even though it might have included restrained eaters. Menstrual cycle phase was also not controlled. Currently there is conflicting and limited data as to the extent that menstrual cycle phase influences acute appetite control and food intake
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Recent data from our laboratory suggests that there is no effect of menstrual cycle on these outcomes
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. However, by randomizing the order of the snack conditions between subjects, it is likely that we had an equal distribution of testing days that fell in the follicular and/or luteal menstrual phases. The relatively small energy protein differential of these snacks may not be sufficient enough to elicit protein-related improvements in appetite control, delays in eating initiation, and subsequent energy intake. Lastly, we recognize that these results are specific to healthy premenopausal women and cannot be extrapolated to other populations. Thus, further research to determine a &#x0201c;protein threshold&#x0201d; to elicit the proposed protein-related improvements in a more diverse population is warranted.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>No differences in post-snack appetite control, satiety, eating initiation, or subsequent food intake were found when comparing two commonly consumed afternoon yogurt snacks, varying in protein content. Thus, these data suggest that the additional 9&#x000a0;g of protein contained in the higher protein Greek yogurt was insufficient to elicit protein-related improvements in appetite control and satiety in healthy women.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>NP: Normal Protein; HP: Higher-Protein; AUC: Area Under the Curve.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>HJL, LCO, HAH, and SMD have no conflict of interest.
