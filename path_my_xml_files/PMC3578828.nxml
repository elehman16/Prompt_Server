Our objective was to identify CD4 threshold values to confirm clinically-determined ART failure when VL is unavailable.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>3316 HIV-infected Ugandan/Zimbabwean adults were randomised to first-line ART with Clinically-Driven (CDM, CD4s measured but blinded) or routine Laboratory and Clinical Monitoring (LCM, 12-weekly CD4s) in the DART trial. CD4 at switch and ART failure criteria (new/recurrent WHO 4, single/multiple WHO 3 event; LCM: CD4&#x0003c;100 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>) were reviewed in 361 LCM, 314 CDM participants who switched over median 5 years follow-up. Retrospective VLs were available in 368 (55%) participants.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Overall, 265/361 (73%) LCM participants failed with CD4&#x0003c;100 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>; only 7 (2%) switched with CD4&#x02265;250 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>, four switches triggered by WHO events. Without CD4 monitoring, 207/314 (66%) CDM participants failed with WHO 4 events, and 77(25%)/30(10%) with single/multiple WHO 3 events. Failure/switching with single WHO 3 events was more likely with CD4&#x02265;250 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> (28/77; 36%) (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.0002). CD4 monitoring reduced switching with viral suppression: 23/187 (12%) LCM versus 49/181 (27%) CDM had VL&#x0003c;400 copies/ml at failure/switch (p&#x0003c;0.0001).

Current WHO guidelines<xref rid="pone.0057580-World1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> define failure by virological (&#x0003e;5,000 copies/ml), immunological (CD4 below pre-therapy baseline; 50% fall from on-treatment peak; persistently &#x0003c;100 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>) or clinical criteria after 6 months on ART. Low-income countries differ in their ability to provide laboratory tests to identify first-line failure and support routine follow-up; if available at all, CD4 testing is most common with viral loads (VL) sometimes used to confirm clinical/immunological failure<xref rid="pone.0057580-World1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Routine virological monitoring is rarely available or feasible<xref rid="pone.0057580-Abongomera1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Such approaches differ markedly from individualised management in high-income countries, where routine VL monitoring is used to modify initial or subsequent therapy and many drugs are available.</p><p>WHO 2010 definition of clinical failure includes WHO 4 and certain WHO stage 3 conditions. Without VLs, it is strongly recommended that immunological criteria confirm clinical failure (noting moderate quality of evidence), but no CD4 threshold value is proposed. We therefore evaluated switches from first to second-line ART in the DART trial<xref rid="pone.0057580-DART1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057580-DART2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, particularly considering the unique group randomised to clinically-driven monitoring (CDM) and managed without CD4 counts, but for whom CD4s (and some VLs) were available for retrospective analysis. The aims were to investigate the characteristics of immunological/clinical failures determined without routine VL monitoring and with or without routine real-time CD4 monitoring; and to identify optimal CD4 thresholds to confirm clinical failure and switch to second-line ART when VLs are unavailable.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>Informed written consent was obtained from each participant and the trial was approved by ethics committees in Uganda, Zimbabwe and the UK.</p><p>DART was a randomised controlled trial comparing routine Laboratory (CD4 and toxicity) plus Clinical Monitoring (LCM) with CDM in 3316 symptomatic (WHO stage 2/3/4) HIV-infected ART-na&#x000ef;ve adults initiating combination ART with CD4&#x0003c;200 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> in Uganda/Zimbabwe (ISCRTN13968779)<xref rid="pone.0057580-DART1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Participants were enrolled January 2003-October 2004 and initiated co-formulated zidovudine/lamivudine with either tenofovir, abacavir or nevirapine<xref rid="pone.0057580-DART3" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p><p>All participants were reviewed 4-weekly by a nurse, and saw a doctor and had routine lymphocyte subsets (CD4, CD8) at screening, weeks 4 and 12, then 12-weekly. All results from LCM participants were returned to clinicians, whereas for CDM participants CD4 counts were measured but never returned. For all participants, if clinically indicated, diagnostic and other tests could be requested (excluding CD4/total lymphocytes in CDM) and concomitant medications prescribed. VLs were not performed in real-time, but were measured retrospectively on stored plasma samples using Roche Amplicor v1.5.</p><p>Participants could substitute alternative antiretrovirals from the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI)/non-NRTI classes in first-line regimens for toxicity, TB-treatment or other reasons; these substitutions did not count as first-line failures. The decision to switch to a second-line bPI-containing regimen for first-line failure was based on clinical criteria in both groups (new/recurrent WHO 4 event (per-protocol); or single or multiple WHO 3 events at clinician discretion), or confirmed CD4&#x0003c;100 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> on ART (&#x0003c;50 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> before July 2006) for LCM. Switching was discouraged before 48 weeks on first-line. Clinician's decision to switch also took account of adherence and social circumstances, following standard clinical practice. VL at switch was assayed in all participants enrolling in nested second-line studies from 2007 onwards<xref rid="pone.0057580-Gilks2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057580-Mambule1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, plus a random sample of other second-line switches (including switches during 2004&#x02013;2006; 85% assayed on day of switch, 93% within 4 weeks, all within 4 months previously). 336/459 (73%) participants switching after 1 January 2007 chose to join one or both studies. As per the DART protocol, all reported WHO 4 events (but not WHO 3 events) were reviewed against pre-specified criteria by an independent Endpoint Review Committee(ERC) blinded to randomised allocation. This was done retrospectively and did not impact clinical decision-making.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Switch from first- to second-line ART for clinical or immunological failure (the latter only in LCM participants being managed using routine CD4 counts) was the primary outcome of interest. Participants were followed under CDM/LCM strategies until 31 December 2008; this analysis includes only switches to this timepoint and is an exploratory analysis of trial data not specified in the original trial protocol. We used Kaplan-Meier methods to evaluate the time delay from first meeting WHO 4 criteria for switch (in all patients with WHO 4 events after 44 weeks on ART, see below), and actual change in regimen. Although the protocol discouraged switching before 48 weeks, we chose 44 weeks as the cut-off for this analysis to include a small number of patients who switched just before 48 weeks because they returned early for their 48 week visit. The secondary outcome was mortality following switch to second-line. Main exposures considered in those who switched were reported reason for switching, CD4 and VL at switch. Analyses of VL included all available VL which had been measured retrospectively on a subset of participants (see above). Where LCM participants met both immunological (CD4&#x0003c;100 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>) and clinical failure criteria, they were counted as immunological failures. Where CDM participants had both WHO 4 and WHO 3 events, they were counted as WHO 4 failures. Categorical variables were compared using chi-squared/exact tests, continuous variables using t-tests/rank-sum tests. To inform clinical practice when &#x02018;tiebreaker&#x02019; VL tests are not available to confirm that clinical/immunological failure has occurred with detectable VL<xref rid="pone.0057580-World1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, we used receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) curves to identify the most sensitive and specific (equal weighting) CD4 threshold cut-off for detecting suppressed VL at the point of clinical/immunological first-line failure.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Patients monitored clinically without CD4 (or VL) results</title><p>1660 CDM participants initiated ART with median(IQR) CD4 86(31&#x02013;139) cells/mm<sup>3</sup> and were clinically monitored without CD4 counts for median 5 years. 314(19%) switched to bPI-containing second-line for first-line failure after median(IQR) 3.4(2.5&#x02013;4.2) years on first-line (only 2 before 48 weeks when switching was discouraged, both at 46 weeks). In those who switched, median(IQR) pre-ART CD4 was 47(14&#x02013;104) cells/mm<sup>3</sup> and age at switch 39(34&#x02013;44) years; 193(61%) were female.</p><p>223(13%) CDM participants had new/recurrent WHO 4 events accepted by the ERC after 44 weeks on ART: 187/223 (84%) switched to second-line, 14(6%) died on first-line before switching and 22(10%) had not switched before trial closure. The Kaplan-Meier median(IQR) time to switch after meeting failure criteria was 7(1&#x02013;23) weeks. The most commonly reported reasons for delaying switch for &#x0003e;8 weeks/not switching were that the WHO 4 event was judged unrelated to ART failure by the clinician (45%) or because of drug-drug interactions between rifampicin and bPI (32%) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0057580-t001">Table 1</xref>; n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;44).

However, our data clearly confirm that monitoring for clinical failure alone over-identifies immunological failure, potentially resulting in unnecessary and premature switching to more costly second-line ART<xref rid="pone.0057580-Walker1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057580-vanOosterhout1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>: 20% of clinical failures/switches had CD4&#x0003e;250 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>. The low CD4 nadir in DART participants (10% had pre-ART CD4 &#x0003c;10 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>) may have contributed to this, with patients at long-term risk for events such as lymphoma, despite immune reconstitution. Furthermore, 12% of CD4-monitored and 27% of clinically-monitored participants had suppressed VL at failure/switch, as previously reported<xref rid="pone.0057580-vanOosterhout1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>-<xref rid="pone.0057580-Reynolds1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Discordance between clinical, immunological and virological failure at any single timepoint is expected, as they track different processes. Nor is failure always absolute: eg 50% of patients with virological failure and genotypic NNRTI resistance in one South African cohort re-suppressed while receiving an NNRTI<xref rid="pone.0057580-Hoffmann1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. In resource-limited settings with access to single confirmatory laboratory tests, the challenge of how to deal practically with discordance remains.</p><p>Whilst relatively short periods on ART leading to incomplete immune reconstitution may account for some discrepancies in previous studies<xref rid="pone.0057580-vanOosterhout1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057580-Kantor1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, the 18 participants switching with CD4&#x0003c;110 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> and VL&#x0003c;400 copies/ml in DART had been on first-line ART for median 3.4 years. Some had variable CD4 responses on first-line, with periods of low CD4 without documented non-adherence; others had never responded immunologically, similarly to Kantor <italic>et al</italic> where 3/7 patients with persistent CD4&#x0003c;100 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> had undetectable VL<xref rid="pone.0057580-Kantor1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Most DART participants with VL&#x0003c;400 copies/ml but very low CD4 at failure benefited considerably immunologically from second-line switch; however 22% (4/18) died shortly after switching. Given increased mortality risks at CD4&#x0003c;100 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> even with suppressed VL in resource-rich<xref rid="pone.0057580-Mocroft1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057580-Loutfy1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> and resource-limited settings<xref rid="pone.0057580-Brennan1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, there may be clinical benefits from switching this specific group of discordant responders with very low CD4 from an NRTI/NNRTI-based first-line to a bPI-based second-line regimen. Of interest, we also observed relatively high mortality in participants switching with <underline>high</underline> CD4 counts and WHO 4 events, possibly reflecting that developing such events despite apparently high absolute CD4 counts may indicate underlying functional immune deficits that may themselves impact mortality risk.</p><p>Those &#x02018;failing ART&#x02019; clinically with only single WHO 3 events can be viewed in two ways. The fact that nearly 40% had CD4&#x0003e;250 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> and 33% VL&#x0003c;400 copies/ml demonstrates lack of sensitivity of these events for ART failure, probably because of their frequency in the underlying population irrespective of HIV status. Whilst our results suggest single WHO 3 events should not trigger switch in isolation, conversely 64% of this group had CD4&#x02264;250 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> and 67% VL&#x0003e;400 copies/ml, greater than the wider population on first-line. Targeting them for confirmatory tiebreak CD4 testing could therefore identify additional ART failures whilst avoiding premature switching. Of note, participants switching with <underline>multiple</underline> WHO 3 events had lower CD4 and higher VL at switch than single WHO 3 events. Adding WHO 3 (single or multiple) events to the WHO 4 criteria for clinical failure increased the numbers identified by about 50%.</p><p>One potential limitation of our study is that clinical monitoring was conducted by nurses and clinicians in relatively well-supported, staffed and supervised sites with no ART stock-outs. DART had excellent retention (just 7% loss to follow-up over five years) and 5-year survival (87% CDM, 90% LCM). Among participants randomised to CDM, CD4s were measured but not returned and health-workers remained blinded to CD4s throughout the trial. This enabled us to perform analyses impossible outside a trial design such as DART. Whilst several WHO 4 events triggering switch in DART were not considered to meet criteria for trial endpoints on independent review, we included them in these analyses. In ART programmes, more WHO 3/4 events might be over-diagnosed (with clinicians conservatively ascribing clinical episodes as WHO 3/4 events), but these would likely occur with high CD4 and VL&#x0003c;400 copies/ml supporting generalisability of our findings. DART participants were severely immune-compromised (median 86 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>) when initiating ART: generalizability to programmes initiating ART earlier is unknown. However, such patients would take longer to fail on first-line therapy, and therefore it is plausible that a greater (rather than smaller) proportion of clinical events on first-line would be single WHO 3 rather than multiple WHO 3 or 4 events, in whom we found greatest VL suppression. Our findings may therefore be more, rather than less generalizable, to such settings.</p><p>The DART protocol only included one of the three WHO immunological failure criteria (confirmed &#x0003c;100 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>) for LCM participants (although a small number of participants switched for other CD4 concerns before this). The other criteria require a series of CD4s (50% decline from peak) or a pre-ART CD4 (drop below pre-ART baseline) and were not included in the protocol because they were judged impractical in settings with limited access to CD4 testing and are anyway not validated; it was considered that switching should be determined only by known predictors of mortality on ART (ie overall CD4, not declines or drops below baseline). These other immunological failure criteria also generally lead to switch at higher CD4 counts and might be expected to be associated with higher rates of VL suppression at switch than demonstrated here, but we cannot assess this. In addition, as real-time VL monitoring was not performed, we cannot evaluate the VL&#x0003e;5000 copies/ml WHO criteria for switching without immunological or clinical failure<xref rid="pone.0057580-World1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, nor investigate the performance of CD4 criteria in identifying this threshold value. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0057580-g001">Figure 1</xref> shows that most participants switching for immunological/clinical failure with VL&#x0003e;400 copies/ml had values around or above this threshold.</p><p>The unique opportunity afforded by the DART trial design to evaluate the value of using CD4 testing parsimoniously to support clinical monitoring when VL monitoring is unavailable, provides clear evidence that a single CD4 tie-breaker at clinical failure with a 250 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> threshold can identify patients who have suppressed VL, providing the potential to reduce unnecessary switching to costly second-line ART. Adding a single CD4 count in those failing clinically could therefore improve the specificity (and positive predictive value) of clinically identified failure for virological failure: clearly a single count cannot improve the sensitivity for detecting virological failure in patients without clinical events. Our results further suggests that multiple (but not single) WHO 3 events should be considered as well as WHO 4 events in the definition of clinical failure when CD4 testing is unavailable. If limited CD4 testing is possible, targeting this to patients with a single WHO stage 3 event could identify additional failures with detectable VL whilst still avoiding premature, costly switching to second-line. Programmes in low-income countries that are considering how to scale-up laboratory services to rationally support regular clinical follow-up can use these results to plan how to widen access to CD4 monitoring taking advantage of new point-of-care technologies.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>
