By 2040, it is expected that this figure will rise to 642 million (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Complications, including atherosclerosis, nephropathy, neuropathy, and retinopathy, make diabetes a major cause of morbidity, mortality, and costs. Although treatments for type 2 diabetes continue to improve, clinicians and public health experts agree that the most effective way to reduce its sequelae is through its prevention (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Type 2 diabetes is preceded by a prolonged phase of insulin resistance and mildly elevated blood glucose levels, sometimes referred to as prediabetes. This opens the possibility for preventive strategies, with most focusing on improving insulin resistance as a core pathophysiological defect (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Weight loss and several drugs, including metformin and thiazolidinediones (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), have been effective in preventing (or delaying) the onset of diabetes. However, no therapy other than lifestyle changes has gained wide acceptance in part because of a lack of confirmed benefit on clinical cardiovascular outcomes, despite the fact that prediabetes is a recognized risk factor for cardiovascular disease (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).</p><p>The purpose of this report is to examine the effect of the thiazolidinedione pioglitazone on prevention of diabetes in patients with recent cerebrovascular event who were enrolled in the Insulin Resistance Intervention after Stroke (IRIS) trial. The primary aim of IRIS was to test the hypothesis that pioglitazone reduces the risk of cardiovascular events in patients without diabetes who had insulin resistance along with a recent ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Prevention of diabetes was a planned secondary outcome. As previously reported, IRIS found that pioglitazone, compared with placebo, reduced the hazard of stroke or myocardial infarction by 24% (hazard ratio [HR] 0.76 [95% CI 0.62&#x02013;0.93]; <italic>P</italic> = 0.007) (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Pioglitazone also reduced the hazard of diabetes by 52% (HR 0.48 [95% CI 0.33&#x02013;0.69]; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001 (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). More than half of IRIS participants had fasting plasma glucose (FPG) &#x0003c;100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L) at baseline, and 35% had an HbA<sub>1c</sub> level &#x0003c;5.7% (39 mmol/mol), both cut points used to define the presence or absence of prediabetes. In this analysis, we report in greater detail on metabolic outcomes in IRIS and the efficacy of pioglitazone in preventing diabetes according to baseline glycemic measures.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Research Design and Methods</title><sec id="s3"><title>Overall Study Design</title><p>A summary of the trial methods, full protocol, and statistical plan have been previously published (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Briefly, the IRIS trial was funded by the U.S. National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) of the National Institutes of Health. Pioglitazone and matching placebo were provided by Takeda Pharmaceuticals International, Inc., which had no role in protocol development, trial conduct, data interpretation, or manuscript drafting. Clinical research activities, central pharmacy operations, data collection, regulatory compliance, and site monitoring were coordinated by the Yale School of Medicine. Enrollment and follow-up of participants occurred at 179 sites in Australia, Canada, Germany, Israel, Italy, the U.K., and the U.S. Trial operations at research sites were approved by local institutional review boards. The trial was conducted according to a protocol that was approved by an independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board appointed by the NINDS.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Study Participants</title><p>Eligible patients were at least 40 years of age with a qualifying ischemic stroke or TIA within 6 months prior to randomization. Additional major eligibility criteria were the biochemical demonstration of insulin resistance on a screening blood test. We defined insulin resistance with the HOMA of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) score (calculated as [fasting insulin, &#x003bc;U/mL &#x000d7; fasting glucose, mmol/L]/22.5) (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). A HOMA-IR threshold of &#x0003e;3.0 was chosen to define the qualifying level of insulin resistance because this value represented the highest quartile of values among populations without diabetes (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Because insulin sensitivity could conceivably be impaired transiently after stroke due to tissue inflammation or acute decrease in physical activity, the screening was performed &#x02265;14 days after the index event. Patients were excluded if they had previously diagnosed diabetes and were using pharmacological antihyperglycemic therapy or if, at the screening visit, the HbA<sub>1c</sub> was &#x02265;7.0% (53 mmol/mol) or the FPG was &#x02265;126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L), repeated and confirmed. These trial criteria were developed in 2004. In 2010, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) updated its diagnostic criteria for diabetes to include an HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x02265;6.5% (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). It was initially recognized that the protocol might allow patients with early or mild diabetes to enroll. Potential randomization to placebo was felt to be justified, however, because their baseline HbA<sub>1c</sub> was below the level of 7.0% (53 mmol/mol), which many would consider a reasonable threshold for the initiation of glucose-lowering therapy.</p><p>As previously detailed (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), excluded conditions included heart failure, bladder cancer or high risk for bladder cancer, moderate to severe dependent pitting edema, irreversible medical condition with predicted survival &#x0003c;4 years, and oral corticosteroid use.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Study Procedures</title><p>Eligible participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive pioglitazone or placebo. During the first 3 months, researchers contacted participants every 2 weeks to assess adherence to study drug and potential adverse or outcome events. The initial study drug dose was 15 mg daily or matching placebo. For participants who reported no new or worsening edema, shortness of breath, or excessive weight gain, study medication was increased to 30 mg daily at week 4 and then to 45 mg at week 8.</p><p>Beginning at month four, researchers contacted participants quarterly. Participation ended at 5 years or the last contact before trial end in July 2015. Annual in-person visits included detailed medication review and physical examinations. At the baseline and first annual visit, blood was drawn fasting for insulin, glucose, lipids, and alanine aminotransferase. FPG was measured at subsequent annual visits. Patients with values &#x02265;126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L) were asked to return to the study site for a repeat test for confirmation. HbA<sub>1c</sub> was not measured beyond the screening visit (used to exclude those with levels &#x02265;7.0% [53 mmol/mol]). Oral glucose tolerance testing (OGTT) was not performed.</p><p>If participants reported new or excessive weight gain or edema or shortness of breath, researchers managed them according to algorithms developed by the IRIS Operations Committee. These included instructions for study drug dose reduction if weight gain or edema persisted despite usual interventions or to assist in the ongoing participation of the patient in the trial. However, study drug was permanently discontinued for heart failure (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), bladder cancer (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), or a second low-energy bone fracture. If diabetes was diagnosed during follow-up, patients could remain on study drug unless open-label thiazolidinedione was prescribed by their personal physicians.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Diabetes Outcome Definition</title><p>The diagnosis of diabetes was a prespecified secondary outcome, adjudicated by an independent committee of diabetes experts blinded to treatment assignment.

The effect of pioglitazone relative to placebo was estimated as an HR (with 95% confidence limits) from the Cox model (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Cumulative event-free rates were calculated by the method of Kaplan-Meier (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) and tested by the log-rank statistic using a type I error of 0.05. The Hochberg procedure was used to adjust significance levels and CIs using an overall type I error of 0.05 (two-sided) (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). The effect of pioglitazone on development of diabetes was further assessed within selected baseline subgroups and according to the degree of adherence to the study drug. These subgroup analyses were not prespecified in the IRIS protocol and have not been adjusted for multiple comparisons. SAS version 9.3 was used for all analyses (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s8"><title>Results</title><sec id="s9"><title>Study Population</title><p>A total of 3,895 patients were randomized at 179 sites in seven countries between February 2005 and January 2013.

During a median follow-up of 4.8 years, 117 of 1,939 participants assigned to pioglitazone and 110 of 1,937 participants assigned to placebo withdrew consent. During the same interval, 58 and 41 were lost to follow-up in each group, respectively.

This appeared to be predominately driven by a larger effect in participants with greater risk of progression to diabetes, such as individuals with prediabetes or worse insulin resistance at baseline. The absence of a statistically significant interaction between baseline FPG or baseline HbA<sub>1c</sub> and treatment effect does suggest that pioglitazone may prevent not only the conversion of prediabetes to diabetes but also the development of diabetes in normoglycemic individuals who have insulin resistance. The absolute risk reduction in the latter category is, however, small.</p><p>In previous trials, troglitazone (Diabetes Prevention Program [DPP]) (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), rosiglitazone (Diabetes REduction Assessment with ramipril and rosiglitazone Medication [DREAM]) (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), and pioglitazone (Actos Now for Prevention of Diabetes [ACT NOW]) (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) reduced the progression to diabetes in patients with impaired glucose tolerance or IFG by 60&#x02013;75% over a period of 0.9&#x02013;3 years (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Another trial (TRoglitazone in the Prevention of Diabetes [TRIPOD]) (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) in women with previous gestational diabetes and an abnormal OGTT showed that troglitazone reduced progression to diabetes by 55% over 2.5 years. These previous diabetes prevention studies enrolled participants with prediabetes but without overt cardiovascular disease. The IRIS trial documents the preventive effect of thiazolidinediones in patients with cerebrovascular disease and insulin resistance.</p><p>The IRIS study design did not include any glycemic assessments after conclusion of the randomized treatment period, so we do not know if pioglitazone had a sustained preventive effect or a temporary suppressive effect on the progression of hyperglycemia. The former was demonstrated with troglitazone in the TRoglitazone in the Prevention of Diabetes trial and was attributed to preservation of the &#x003b2;-cell function. In contrast, however, in the Diabetes Prevention Program, Diabetes REduction Assessment with ramipril and rosiglitazone Medication, and Actos Now for Prevention of Diabetes trials, the effect of therapy did not appear to persist after drug discontinuation (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>).</p><p>We initially hypothesized that, through its insulin-sensitizing effects, pioglitazone therapy would result in both a reduction in cardiovascular events and the incidence of diabetes (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Our results are consistent with this hypothesis. The mechanism(s), however, by which pioglitazone improved cardiovascular outcomes in IRIS (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) remains uncertain. Our findings to date cannot easily elucidate the extent to which insulin sensitization may have mediated the observed cardiovascular benefits. However, it seems unlikely that glucose lowering in this range or diabetes prevention per se can be directly credited, based on prior studies involving the therapy of early diabetes in patients at high cardiovascular risk (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Given the relatively small number of events for both cardiovascular outcomes and the development of diabetes, further statistical inquiry into their potential relationship will be difficult to interpret. In fact, pioglitazone demonstrated several other benefits beyond glucose control. It lowered blood pressure and C-reactive protein and increased HDL cholesterol, each of which might have promoted cardiovascular health (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Previous studies involving direct measures of atheroma volume in patients with and without diabetes have suggested a possible direct vascular effect of pioglitazone (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). It is therefore also possible that pioglitazone attenuates the progression of atherosclerosis through peroxisome proliferator&#x02013;activated receptor-&#x003b3; activation in the vasculature (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>) and/or in inflammatory cells (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>), concurrent with (but not necessarily stemming from) its metabolic actions mediated through peroxisome proliferator&#x02013;activated receptor-&#x003b3; in adipocytes, skeletal muscle, and the liver.</p><p>IRIS was designed primarily as a secondary stroke prevention trial and has obvious limitations as regards to metabolic assessment of participants. First, some patients likely already had mild diabetes at study initiation because we did not perform OGTTs. We also did not use this test to monitor for diabetes during follow-up. Had we performed OGTTs at baseline and annually, it is likely that more patients would have been excluded for diabetes at screening, and more participants would have converted to diabetes during follow-up. However, it seems unlikely that our findings would have changed substantially based on the similar risk reductions observed in previous thiazolidinedione studies that did use the OGTT (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). At a practical level, few clinicians routinely use OGTT in surveillance for development of diabetes, so the IRIS results may better reflect the outcomes that would be seen in the real-world setting. Second, we also did not use HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x02265;6.5% as an exclusion, nor did we measure HbA<sub>1c</sub> beyond the screening visit, because this test was not sanctioned for diabetes diagnosis by the ADA until 2010 (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). It is also likely that conversion to diabetes would have been detected in more of our participants if we had measured HbA<sub>1c</sub> during follow-up. In an ancillary analysis, however, using the updated diagnostic criteria outside of trial testing, the effect of pioglitazone on diabetes onset was unchanged. Third, our definition of diabetes permitted the diagnosis by the patient&#x02019;s personal physician or during hospitalizations based on prespecified criteria. This required a nonstandardized adaption of prevailing diagnostic criteria through which we attempted to balance accuracy with the pragmatic considerations of a large, multicenter trial.</p><p>Adherence to study drug was also not ideal in IRIS, a reflection of the known side effect profile of pioglitazone (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>), increasing media attention about possible risks (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), and our cautious approach in discontinuing study drug in participants experiencing or felt to be at high risk for adverse events. In our cohort of older patients with cerebrovascular disease, we observed more weight gain, edema, and bone fracture in pioglitazone compared with placebo-treated patients. However, we did not observe an increase in heart failure events, a concern with all thiazolidinediones (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>), likely due to our conservatism in the selection and management of participants as well as the low prevalence (&#x0223c;12%) of known coronary artery disease in in the IRIS cohort (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Incident bladder cancer, a topic with conflicting evidence concerning this medication (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>), as well as any cancer occurred with similar frequency between the two groups, although IRIS was not powered to assess the effect of pioglitazone on specific neoplasms. Overall, our adherence rates were not dissimilar to those reported in large observational studies of a variety of glucose-lowering drugs in patients with type 2 diabetes (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>) as well as from diabetes prevention trials with this class of medication (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). As suggested by our analysis of adherent versus nonadherent participants, if adherence to the study drug had been higher, we might have observed a larger risk reduction for diabetes but also, of course, potentially more adverse effects.</p><p>In summary, pioglitazone approximately halved the risk of developing diabetes in patients with insulin resistance and cerebrovascular disease. The absolute diabetes risk was highest in those with IFG, increased HbA<sub>1c</sub>, higher HOMA-IR (indicating more insulin resistance), and metabolic syndrome, so the preventive effect of pioglitazone was predominately driven by patients in these higher risk categories. Pioglitazone is the first pharmacological agent demonstrated in a single trial to both prevent diabetes and improve cardiovascular outcomes in patients at increased risk for these sequelae. More broadly, our results lend support to the notion that diabetes prevention through insulin sensitization could potentially be associated with important cardiovascular benefits.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><p>Clinical trial reg. no.
