This metabolic disorder causes serious damages to vital organs such as eyes, kidneys and nerves in the long term. Its complications are among the main causes of mortality and morbidity in the world. During 2005 to 2030, the diabetes-related deaths are projected to be doubled in theworld (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). The World Health Organization report in 2014 shows that 347 million people in the world had diabetes of whom 4.581 million were living in Iran with a 8.6% prevalence (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p><p>This metabolic disease imposes a significant cost of 12% of the health expenditures (i.e.1330 USD per person) in the world. It is 11% in Iran (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).</p><p>Diabetes as a chronic disease has no definite cure but providing good metabolic control could prevent or delay its complications (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Thus, health systems and professionals should be prepared to detect and manage the disease and its sequelae. Also, a new role of home-based care is needed to be delegated to patients with chronic diseases management (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>).</p><p>The demand for home health care has gined increasing currency in recent years. Aging population and the push for more efficient delivery of hospital services have fueled this growing demand. Therefore, an alternative strategy to expensive hospital-based care is home and community-based care because of their cost containment (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). As evidence is needed to provide information for efficiency and effectiveness of hospital or home-based care, this research was designed to compare these two strategies in terms of their cost effectiveness for control of type 2 diabetes mellitus.</p><p>In Iran, a national program for prevention and control of type 2 diabetes was designed in 1996 (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). The diabetes care was integrated in three levels of the Iranian health system. Early detection and treatment of diabetes are usually made at the first level (i.e. rural and urban health centers) by general physicians and allied health staff. All diabetic patients recognized in health centers are referred to district diabetes clinics located in general hospitals as the second level to early detection and control of complications. In these clinics, patients are visited by internists (or endocrinologist) and get care by nurses and nutritionist staff. Patients needing more specific treatments are referred to the diabetes centers foung in the provincial hospitals, which manage diabetes complications and provide educational support.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><p><bold>Study Design:</bold> This research was a quasi-experimental, pre-test and post-test study conducted in 2013. The setting was a diabetes clinic in an Iranian teaching hospital. The study population were patients with type-2 diabetes getting care from a diabetes clinic in Tabriz, Iran. The subjects included diabetics who needed to change oral anti-diabetic therapy to insulin injection according to the internal specialists' orders. The diabetics with co-morbid conditions such as acute infections, thromboembolic diseases, getting glucocorticosteroids and recent surgery or trauma were excluded. The eligible subjects were randomly assigned into two equal groups to receive home-based or conventional hospital-based care.</p><p>The patients within the intervention group received home care and frequent follow-up of nurse visits and consultations at home. The control group patients received routine care, including inpatient services in hospital and subsequently monthly visits to the diabetes clinic. <italic>Figure 1</italic> illustrates a flowchart of the two approaches in this study.</p><fig id="F1" fig-type="illustration" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>the Flowchart of home and hospital care approaches</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EJHS2706-0651Fig1"/></fig><p><bold>Sample size:</bold> To calculate the sample size, an estimate of the mean and variance of HbA1c from a similar study was used (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Therefore, the total sample size with the attrition rate of 20% was calculated to be 60 patients (N= 60).</p><p><bold>The measure:</bold> HbA1c was used to assess cost-effectiveness of two employed strategies. It is an index of overall glycemic exposure and risk for long-term complications of diabetes mellitus (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). This test is performed to approximate metabolic control over the previous 2&#x02013;3 months and to help treatment decisions (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).</p><p>A satisfaction measuring questionnaire with 20-items and five Likert scale was developed by researchers reviewing some diabetes treatment satisfaction tools (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). The participants' knowledge relating to the insulin injection, self- monitoring, hypoglycemia and complications was examined by employing a researcher-designed questionnaire with 15 closed-ended questions. Three internists confirmed the validity of the questionnaire. Besides, two process metrics, including hypoglycemia episodes and time needed to achieve the glycemic control were measured during a three-month period. The diagnosis of hypoglycemia was based on personal experience of patients with at least one physical symptom (e.g. shakiness and fast heartbeat) as well as psychological (e.g. anxiety) and neuroglycopenic (e.g. confusion) states. The index of the time needed to achieve the glycemic control was compared with the target level of blood glucose (FBG=70&#x02013;130 mg/dl or blood glucose 2 hours after meal &#x0003c;180 mg/dl).</p><p><bold>The schedule of diabetes care:</bold> The patients in the home-based group received visits and consultations by a team consisting of nurses and endocrinologists. The intervention was focused on encouraging participants to engage in activities that protect and promote health such as modifying behavior, and change in diet, medication and blood glucose monitoring. The cases received three personal home-visits (first day of the experiment and two with monthly intervals) and ten follow-up phone calls (twice in the first week and eight at weeks 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12) provided by a nurse. Home visits and calls averaged 45 and 14 minutes each, respectively. Five telephone consultations led by medical specialists were performed per case.</p><p>The patients in the control group received regular services based on a conventional programme of diabetes control in Iran. They had insulin injection therapy in hospital, to control their glucose levels, and monthly physician appointment in diabetes clinics.</p><p><bold>Data gathering:</bold> Data gathering was performed by a paper data sheet for recording the background characteristics (age, gender and the literacy level of subjects) and the indices showing the quality of diabetes care during the 3-month period of the study (the frequency of hypoglycemia episodes and time needed to achieve the glycemic control).</p><p>Two indexes including, HbA1c and patients' diabetes knowledge were measured twice at the beginning and end of the study (after three months). Also, patients' satisfaction was assessed with two approaches.</p><p>Individual table-sheets were used to register the direct costs of diabetes care for patients. The costs in the conventional approach included charges of outpatient care (i.e. physician visits, lab tests, medications and allied health care) and inpatient hospitalization. The costs calculated for the intervention group were the outpatient care, home visits, telephone consultations and endocrinologists consultations. The main non-medical cost for both groups was the travel costs.</p><p><bold>Statistical analysis:</bold> Descriptive statistics was used to summarize the characteristics of participants. Parametric and nonparametric tests were used according to Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for normality. Paired and independent t-tests were performed to verify the pre-post differences within the groups and differences between groups. We used the Mann-Whitney U or Wilcoxon test for data which were not normally distributed. Also, analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to compare quantitative variables between the two groups when adjusting for another covariate was needed.</p><p><bold>Ethical approval:</bold> Ethical approval was obtained from the Local Research Ethics Committee of the Tabriz University of Medical Sciences. A written informed consent was taken before randomization of subjects into home-based and hospital-based group. Informed consent was obtained from all individual participants for whom identifying information is included in this article.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Due to the attrition of five participants, data of 55 subjects were analyzed. The mean age of patients in the two groups of home-based and hospital-based were 53.15 &#x000b1; 8.25 and 58.41&#x000b1;13.68, respectively. The ratio of males in home-based participants (15 0f 26; 58%) and hospital-based group (10 out of 29; 34%) was not similar (P&#x0003c;0.05). Also, illiterate participants were more prevalent in hospital-based groups (69% vs. 46%) (P&#x0003c;0.05), but the mean weight in home-based group (71.52&#x000b1;11.66 kg) was not significantly different from hospital-based one (71.41&#x000b1;13.68 kg) (P&#x0003c;0.05).</p><p>This study was also found that the mean HbA1c dropped significantly in the home-based group (paired t test: t = 8.80, df = 23, P &#x0003c; 0.001), but it did not change in the hospital-based group (paired t test: t = &#x02212;0.72, df = 25, P &#x0003c; 0.47). Also, the majority of the home-based patients experienced at least once hypoglycemia event whereas this experience was very rare in the alternative group (53.8% vs. 3.4%) (p&#x0003c;0.001).

The interventional cases experienced a mean of 37% reduction in their HbA1c levels (from 11.4 to 7.3) after three months. Such a finding came in agreement with several studies that reported a significant decrease in HbA1c of diabetics getting a nurse-led home diabetes management program compared with the control group (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>).

Comparing the mean time (in days) to achieve the optimum level of blood glucose in patients was statistically similar in the two groups; but, almost four and a half days shorter in the intervention than control group. The home-care strategy was dominant over the conventional strategy in terms of less cost, but more effect on reducing the time (days) needed to achieve the glycemic control in diabetics.</p><p>The tarticipants in the experimental group reported more hypoglycemic episode than the control group. This is in contrast with a study has been done by Piette et al. (<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). These results should be taken with caution, since the use of a self-reporting approach for data collection constitutes a potential source of bias in the form of underestimating the true numbers of hypoglycemia episodes especially in usual care subjects due to lack of any scheduled supervision by health staff.</p><p>Finally, the participants in the experimental care demonstrated more satisfaction than the usual care which is inconsistent with a study done by Navicharern et al. (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). It can be concluded that home-based model of diabetes care generates better outcomes at lower costs than conventional care, that encourages integration of home health care into the usual program of diabetes prevention and control.</p><p>It seems that the home-based approach by reinforcing the team work through nurses' home visits and phone calls plus physicians' phone counseling has potentially positive effects on diabetes control in adults with insulin-treated diabetes type 2 that in turn could prevent or delay the complications. Further research is needed to clarify the optimum number of home visits and nurse or physician phone counseling needed to achieve the maximum outcomes in diabetics and to investigate the long term consequences of home care compared with the usual care.</p><p>The limitations of this study include the following issues:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Patients who received the intervention had higher literacy levels at baseline than the control subjects. This would have resulted in an overestimation of the increased diabetes knowledge at the end of the study.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Due to limited resources, the time to follow the participants up was not continued after three months. Two measures of diabetes control estimates (i.e. time needed to achieve the glycemic control and hypoglycemic episodes) were based on self-reports, i.e., their direct measures by health staff were not available to validate data.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The mean value of HbA1c level at baseline was almost similar among the experimental and the control groups, indicating the strength of the finding that the remarkable reduction of noted index in the home-care was true.</p></list-item></list></p></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="R1"><label>1</label><element-citation
