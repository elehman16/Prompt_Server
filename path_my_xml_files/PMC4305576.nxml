exercise with an abdominal drawing-in maneuver (ADIM) performed with different surface
conditions on abdominal muscle thickness. [Subjects] Thirty subjects were randomly divided
into an unstable bridge exercise group (UBE group, n=15) and a stable bridge exercise
group (SBE group, n=15). [Methods] After 6 weeks of performing bridge exercises
accompanied by ADIM, the change in the muscle thicknesses of the transverse abdominis
(TrA) and internal oblique abdominis (IOA) muscles was assessed using ultrasonography.
[Results] After 6 weeks of exercise, the TrA was significantly altered in the SBEG, and
the TrA and IOA were both significantly changed in the UBEG. [Conclusion] When performing
bridge exercises to increase the Tra and the IO muscle thicknesses, exercising on an
unstable surface is recommended.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Transversus abdominis</kwd><kwd>Bridge exercise</kwd><kwd>Abdominal drawing-in maneuver</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Patients with lower back pain have weaker deep muscles compared with those without such
pain. Loss of position sense due to deterioration in proprioception causes spinal
instability and subsequent pain<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Therefore, stability exercise is clinically applied as a treatment for lower back pain. The
purpose of the stability exercise is to recover control, and a high level of local muscle
exercise maintains appropriate torso stability<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The bridge exercise (BE), a closed kinetic chain weight-bearing exercise, is applied to
improve the muscle strength of the gluteus maximus and hamstring, which are hip extensors.
It is also used clinically to improve lumbar stabilization in patients with lower back
pain<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Furthermore, the bending
positions of the knee and hip joints during the BE are pain-alleviating positions for
patients with lower back pain<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. However,
if deep muscle co-contraction is not performed first, excessive lumbar lordosis can occur to
compensate for the lack of muscle co-contraction. To prevent excessive lumbar lordosis, this
exercise must be preceded by the abdominal drawing-in maneuver (ADIM)<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Such activation of the abdominal muscle is required for
stability of the pelvis, as it counters the pulling of the hip joint muscles<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>There have been many studies on building deep muscles while performing the ADIM in a supine
position and on building deep muscles and lower extremity muscle strengthening while
performing BE<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, there is an
insufficient number of studies on the ADIM and BE as a combination exercise based on surface
conditions. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine the impact of BE with
the ADIM performed under different surface conditions on abdominal muscle thickness.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Thirty male and female university students were selected as subjects. The subjects were
randomly assigned to one of two groups: 15 students (2 male, 13 female) to the unstable
bridge exercise group (UBEG) as the experimental group and 15 students (2 male, 13 female)
to the stable bridge exercise group (SBEG) as the control group. Subjects with muscle,
frame, or nervous system issues, those with lower back and pelvic pain, and those unable to
engage in BE due to knee or ankle pain were excluded from the study. This study was approved
by Korea Nazarene University&#x02019;s Institutional Review Board, and the safety of all subjects
was protected during all parts of the experiment. All subjects understood the purpose of
this study and provided written informed consent prior to participation in accordance with
the ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinki.</p><p>The age, height, and weight ranges of subjects in the SBEG were 21.7&#x000b1;0.3&#x02005;years,
162.8&#x000b1;5.3&#x02005;cm, and 56.3&#x000b1;8.2&#x02005;kg, and in the UBEG, they were 22.6&#x000b1;0.4&#x02005;years, 162.1&#x000b1;3.5&#x02005;cm, and
55.5&#x000b1;7.6&#x02005;kg, respectively. The &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test was used for sex analysis, and the
independent t-test was used to analyze ages, heights, and weights. These analyses showed
statistically insignificant (p &#x0003e;0.05) differences between the groups, and the two groups
could therefore be considered homogeneous.</p><p>The starting position for the BE on the stable surface was the supine position with the
knees bent at 90&#x000b0;, hip joints bent at 60&#x000b0;, legs shoulder width apart, hands resting crossed
on the chest, head and neck straight, and eyes on the ceiling. The BE was preceded by the
ADIM. The Inter-abdominal pressure increased during abdominal hollowing, selectively
contracting the transverse abdominis (TrA) and internal oblique abdominis (IOA) rather than
the rectus abdominis (RA).</p><p>At the cue &#x0201c;pelvis up&#x0201d;, the subjects lifted their pelvises while keeping the hip joint at
0<sup>&#x003bf;</sup>, maintained the position for 15 seconds at the cue &#x0201c;hold&#x0201d;, and then brought
down their pelvises at the cue &#x0201c;pelvis down&#x0201d; for 10 seconds of rest. The routine was
designed to repeat 10 times per set. Six sets of each exercise were performed 3 times a week
for 6 weeks. The BE on an unstable surface was performed in the same way but with a balance
pad (Balance-pad, AIREX, Sins, Switzerland) under the feet to increase the degree of
exercise intensity and instability.</p><p>Muscle thickness of the TrA and IOA was measured using ultrasound imaging (MySono U5,
Samsung Medison, Seoul, Republic of Korea). During measurement, the subjects were in a
relaxed supine position with a relaxed abdomen, and the measurer positioned the probe
parallel to the top of the iliac crest and then moved it to the center of the abdomen. When
the external oblique abdominis (EOA), IOA, and TrA were visible in their entirety, the
screen was put on hold. The muscle thickness of the IOA and TrA was measured 13&#x02005;mm away from
the meeting point of the IOA and TrA muscles<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Measurement of abdominal muscle thickness</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jpts-27-255-g001"/></fig>). All measurements were performed by a single skilled measurer trained in operating
the ultrasonography imaging system.</p><p>The measured data were analyzed by the SPSS 12.0 KO statistical program, and the collected
data are presented as means and standard deviations. The paired t-test was used as a
significance test in each group before and after the experiments, and an independent t-test
was used as a significance test for between-group differences. The significance level, &#x003b1;,
was set at 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>According to the pre- and post-intervention comparisons in the SBEG and UBEG, only the TrA

small movement<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. The IOA and TrA, which
are responsible for lumbar stability, provide fine-tuning and spinal segmental stability.
McGill et al. reported<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup> that regulating
the mobilization method of the superficial and deep muscles, that is, the first mobilization
of the deep abdominal muscles, is important for maintaining lumbar stability.</p><p>According to the pre- and post-intervention comparison in the SBEG and UBEG, only the TrA
was significantly altered in the SBEG, but both the TrA and IOA showed significant changes
in the UBEG. This means that the BE on a stable surface has an impact on building the TrA
muscle only, while the the BE on an unstable surface has an impact on building both the TrA
and IOA. It is considered that the co-contraction of muscles occurs across body segments to
maintain balance on unstable surfaces. Furthermore, exercising in an unstable surface
environment stimulates proprioceptors and areas of the cerebrum responsible for locomotion,
maximizing the sense of equilibrium and ability to maintain balance and resulting in
improved core stability<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. The findings
of no statistically significant differences between the SBEG and UBEG in the pre- and post-
intervention measurements and in the changes between the pre- and post- intervention
measurements indicate that while unstable BE is effective, it is insufficient to generate
statistically significant changes when compared with the BE on a stable surface. Stevens et
al.<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that when healthy
subjects are performing the BE, the IOA and EOA exhibit proportionally higher activation
than the RA, a large muscle group. In addition, Ha et al.<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that during the BE, application of the ADIM selectively
activates the abdominal core muscles.</p><p>The BE accompanied by the ADIM is helpful for muscle activation as a stability exercise.
However, performing the BE for the purpose of building both the TrA and IOA muscles is more
effective on an unstable surface than on a stable surface and is thus recommended for
stability exercise in the clinical setting for the purpose of strengthening deep abdominal
muscles.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This research was supported by Korea Nazarene University Research Grants in 2014.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>O&#x02019;Sullivan</surname><given-names>PB</given-names></name><name><surname>Burnett</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Floyd</surname><given-names>AN</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Lumbar repositioning deficit in a specific low back pain
