We analysed data from 2401 multi-ethnic sexually active female students aged 16&#x02013;27 years who were recruited to a randomised controlled trial of chlamydia screening &#x02013; the prevention of pelvic infection trial in 2004&#x02013;2006. At recruitment, all participants were asked to provide self-taken vaginal swabs for chlamydia testing and to complete a sexual health questionnaire including quality of life (EQ-5D). Most women (69%) had an EQ-5D of one representing &#x02018;perfect health&#x02019; in the five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. We therefore compared the proportion of women with an EQ-5D score&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;1 implying &#x02018;less than perfect health&#x02019; in women with and without chlamydia infection, and women with symptomatic chlamydia versus the remainder. The proportion of women with EQ-5D score&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;1 was similar in women with and without undiagnosed chlamydia: 34% (47/138) versus 31% (697/2263; RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.41). However, more women with symptomatic chlamydia had EQ-5D score&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;1 than the remainder: 45% (25/55) versus 31% (714/2319; RR 1.47, CI 1.10 to 1.98). In this community-based study, EQ-5D scores were similar in women with and without undiagnosed chlamydia. However, a higher proportion of women with symptomatic chlamydia infection had &#x02018;less than perfect health&#x02019;.

EQ-5D scores in people with and without chlamydia might be useful for exploring the health cost of chlamydia and whether screening is worthwhile. It could also inform wider debates around the impact of chlamydia on quality of life. To date, there have been no UK studies looking at health-related quality of life associated with chlamydia in sexually active, young, multi-ethnic women recruited outside healthcare facilities.</p><p>We have baseline cross-sectional EQ-5D scores, sexual health questionnaires and chlamydia test results from 2401 women who took part in the prevention of pelvic infection (POPI) chlamydia screening trial.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-0956462416650095" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bibr3-0956462416650095" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Our aims were:

Participants randomly allocated to the intervention group had their swabs tested for chlamydia in the next week, and those with positive tests were referred for treatment. Samples from participants allocated to the deferred screening group were frozen at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C and were tested after 12 months.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-0956462416650095" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> The sexual health questionnaire was developed by the researchers and included questions on demographics, number of sexual partners and on four symptoms that may be associated with PID: pelvic discomfort, pain during sexual intercourse abnormal vaginal discharge and bleeding between periods.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-0956462416650095" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Women who reported all four of these symptoms were counted as &#x02018;symptomatic&#x02019; in the analysis.</p></sec><sec id="sec5-0956462416650095"><title>Health-related quality of life (EQ-5D)</title><p>Questionnaires assessed health-related quality of life using the EQ-5D tool.

The EQ-5D has five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression.

(The questionnaire comprised an A4 sheet with questions on lifestyle on the first page and the EQ-5D on the second page. It is likely that many of the 128 participants who did not complete EQ-5D did not turn over the questionnaire before sealing it in the envelope.)

Findings may help to inform wider debates around the impact of chlamydia on quality of life.</p><p>The main limitation is that the EQ-5D was not completed at time of chlamydia diagnosis. Since participants did not know if they had chlamydia, the findings can only relate to symptoms and not to the implications of a positive diagnosis with the possible associated effect on relationships, stigma and anxiety regarding infertility.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-0956462416650095" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bibr5-0956462416650095" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> In addition, we did not assess the effect on quality of life of long-term potential complications of chlamydia such as PID, chronic pelvic pain, tubal factor infertility or ectopic pregnancy. The EQ5-D may be less suitable for a young population who are unlikely to have problems in three of the five domains: mobility, self-care and usual activities. We therefore divided participants into those EQ-5D&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;1 versus the remainder. This approach is novel and might stimulate debate. However, results were similar using the standard method of EQ-5D analysis. We did not use data from the EQ-VAS visual analogue scale as these were skewed. Findings may not be generalisable and may not apply to other groups such as men in whom chlamydia infection may be more likely to cause symptoms. Although the study was completed almost ten years ago, this is one of the few available with data on STIs and EQ-5D.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-0956462416650095" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Finally, these results only allow us to comment on associations &#x02013; we cannot infer any causality from reported EQ-5D scores.</p></sec><sec id="sec14-0956462416650095"><title>Comparison with other studies</title><p>A previous analysis in the same cohort showed that women who developed pelvic infection had lower quality of life scores than those who did not at both baseline and follow-up. However, pelvic infection did not appear to reduce EQ-5D scores further.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-0956462416650095" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> By contrast, most previous studies of the psychological or physical impact of chlamydia infection have been qualitative and have focused on participants with a current or recent diagnosis of chlamydia. Duncan et&#x000a0;al.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-0956462416650095" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> found that women had three main concerns: stigma surrounding the infection, anxiety about future fertility and apprehension about their partner&#x02019;s reaction. Interviews with participants in the CLASS population-based screening studies showed similar findings.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-0956462416650095" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Interestingly, no one regretted being screened for chlamydia. However, there appears to be a paucity of studies on quality of life related to sexual health in a student population.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-0956462416650095" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup></p><p>Finally, some studies<sup><xref rid="bibr6-0956462416650095" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> have used health utility weights for chlamydia based on the 1999 Institute of Medicine report.<sup><xref rid="bibr7-0956462416650095" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Models simulating the natural history of chlamydia may be combined with cost and utility data to estimate the number of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) associated with chlamydia. Economic models estimate the QALYs lost if chlamydia is untreated, in order to estimate the QALY gains associated with treating/preventing chlamydia. Crucially, these models include potential long-term sequelae such as tubal infertility. By contrast, our study focused only on short-term health-related quality of life.</p></sec><sec id="sec15-0956462416650095"><title>Implications</title><p>Having asymptomatic undiagnosed chlamydia did not seem to affect EQ-5D scores in the short term in this group of young women, although symptomatic chlamydia was associated with &#x02018;less than perfect&#x02019; quality of life.
