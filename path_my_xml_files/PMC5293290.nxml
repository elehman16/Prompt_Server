NLFs were evaluated using the validated 5-point photonumeric Allergan NLF Severity Scale (0 is &#x0201c;no wrinkle&#x0201d; and 4 is &#x0201c;very deep wrinkle&#x0201d;). Investigator-assessed responder rates (primary outcome at 6 months), NLF mean improvements, and subject-assessed responder rates and preference were assessed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 124 subjects randomized, 122 completed the 6-month visit.

Investigator-assessed responder rates were 90.4% for Juv&#x000e9;derm Ultra Plus and 89.6% for Restylane, establishing noninferiority of Juv&#x000e9;derm Ultra Plus. Mean (SD) improvements in NLF Severity Scale scores from baseline at 6 months were 1.5 (0.75) for Juv&#x000e9;derm Ultra Plus and 1.6 (0.73) for Restylane. Subject-assessed responder rates were similar to investigator-assessed rates (87.3%, Juv&#x000e9;derm Ultra Plus; 83.9%, Restylane). Of subjects reporting a preference, 62.1% preferred Juv&#x000e9;derm Ultra Plus. The most common treatment site responses were swelling and tenderness; most were mild or moderate in severity and resolved without intervention.

Subjects were randomly allocated to receive Juv&#x000e9;derm Ultra Plus (24&#x02009;mg/mL) in 1 NLF and Restylane injectable gel (20&#x02009;mg/mL) in the other (ie, right or left NLF). Treatment was performed with a 27-gauge needle for Juv&#x000e9;derm Ultra Plus and a 30-gauge needle for Restylane based on the respective directions for the use of each product. Subjects were allowed 1 touch-up treatment 1 month after initial treatment (maximum total volume, 1.5 and 0.5&#x02009;mL per NLF for initial and touch-up treatments, respectively). Treatment and safety assessments were performed by the treating investigator, and NLF severity ratings were assessed by an evaluating investigator.</p><p>Evaluating investigators and subjects were blinded to treatment assignment. Subjects were blindfolded during treatment, and treating investigators were instructed to use injection techniques that they deemed suitable based on their clinical experience and to use similar injection techniques on both NLFs.</p></sec><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>Subjects were eligible for inclusion if they were more than 18 years of age and had fully visible, approximately symmetrical NLFs with bilateral severity scores of 3 (evaluating investigator&#x02019;s assessment) on the NLFSS. Subjects were excluded if they had facial hair that would interfere with visual assessments of NLF severity, noticeable acne scarring, active infection, cancerous or precancerous lesions, or an unhealed wound in the NLF area. Additional exclusion criteria included lipoinjection (fat), facial plastic surgery, or any type of facial or cosmetic procedure (including but not limited to tissue augmentation with temporary dermal fillers) within 6 months before study treatment if treatment was not administered near the NLFs; if treatment was administered near the NLFs, the washout period was at least 12 months before study treatment. The study was approved by individual ethics committees, and subjects signed an ethics committee&#x02013;approved consent for study participation.</p></sec><sec><title>Assessments and Endpoints</title><p>Follow-up visits for effectiveness occurred at 1, 3, and 6 months after the last NLF treatment (ie, initial or touch-up treatment, if performed). The evaluating investigator and subject independently evaluated NLF severity using the NLFSS<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) before and after treatment.

AE severity was reported by the treating investigator. A protocol amendment extended safety follow-up assessments to visits at 9 and 12 months after the last NLF treatment.</p><p>The primary effectiveness measure was the responder rate at 6 months, with responders defined as the percentage of subjects with a greater than or equal to 1-point improvement for each NLF versus baseline on the NLFSS as assessed by the evaluating investigator. The responder rate based on subject assessments of NLF severity using the NLFSS at baseline and 6 months for Juv&#x000e9;derm Ultra Plus and Restylane and subject assessments of preferred NLF for overall treatment outcome at 6 months were secondary effectiveness measures. Additional effectiveness measures included evaluating investigator and subject assessments of NLF severity over time (months 1, 3, and 6). To assess product handling characteristics, treating investigators were asked to evaluate the ease of product handling by selecting &#x0201c;very easy,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;moderately easy,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;not too easy or difficult,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;moderately difficult,&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;very difficult.&#x0201d; Treating investigators were asked to indicate if there were any problems with the device or needle by answering &#x0201c;yes&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;no&#x0201d; to the question: &#x0201c;were there any device/needle problems or malfunctions?&#x0201d;</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analyses</title><p>The primary effectiveness endpoint was a noninferiority comparison of Juv&#x000e9;derm Ultra Plus versus Restylane based on responder rates at 6 months. Statistical noninferiority was confirmed if the upper limit of a one sided 98.75% confidence interval (CI) for the difference in proportions of NLFs retaining a greater than or equal to 1-point improvement at 6 months was less than 15%. The primary effectiveness analysis was performed in the per-protocol population, defined as all subjects who were randomized, received at least 1 study treatment, provided primary effectiveness assessments at 6 months, and did not have any major protocol violations. The primary effectiveness analysis was also performed in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population (defined as all subjects who were randomized and received at least 1 treatment) as a sensitivity analysis. Other effectiveness analyses were performed in the ITT population. Comparison of injection volume for Juv&#x000e9;derm Ultra Plus versus Restylane was assessed using the paired <italic>t</italic> test. Comparison of subject treatment preference for Juv&#x000e9;derm Ultra Plus versus Restylane was assessed using the exact binomial test assuming that the preference probability for Juv&#x000e9;derm Ultra Plus was 0.5. Safety was assessed in the safety population, defined as all subjects who received at least 1 treatment based on the actual treatment received for each NLF.</p><p>Secondary effectiveness analyses included responder rates with 95% CIs at 6 months for Juv&#x000e9;derm Ultra Plus and Restylane based on subject assessments of NLF severity and summary of subjects&#x02019; NLF preference for overall treatment outcome at 6 months.

There were no serious AEs or deaths reported in the study.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>This study met its primary effectiveness endpoint: Juv&#x000e9;derm Ultra Plus treatment was noninferior to Restylane treatment for correction of severe NLFs in Chinese subjects. Evaluating investigator and subject NLFSS responder rates were similar and remained high at all timepoints through the 6-month period of effectiveness assessments. Of the 47% of subjects who expressed a preference, a greater number preferred Juv&#x000e9;derm Ultra Plus over Restylane, and treating investigators indicated that Juv&#x000e9;derm Ultra Plus injections were easier to handle than Restylane injections in this trial. Ease of handling could have contributed to the overall treatment experience of subjects resulting in greater preference for Juv&#x000e9;derm Ultra Plus. Furthermore, because facial aesthetic injections require technical precision to achieve optimal treatment outcomes,<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> a filler that is very easy to handle provides an advantage in facilitating the achievement of both physician and patient treatment goals.</p><p>The superior effectiveness of Juv&#x000e9;derm Ultra Plus compared with a bovine collagen filler in correcting severe NLFs was demonstrated in a 6-month U.S. study conducted primarily in white subjects with moderate or severe NLFs by Baumann et al.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Analysis of a subset of subjects with severe NLFs from the same study by Lupo et al<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> showed findings consistent with the current study for subjects treated with Juv&#x000e9;derm Ultra Plus, with a mean NLFSS score at 6 months of 1.3 compared with 1.5 in the current study; that study also showed clinically significant improvement beyond year 1 in 81% of severe NLFs treated with Juv&#x000e9;derm Ultra Plus. A prospective randomized study by Goodman et al<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> investigated the effectiveness of a single administration of Juv&#x000e9;derm Ultra Plus versus Perlane (Medicis Aesthetics Inc., Scottsdale, Ariz.), a 20&#x02009;mg/mL HA particulate gel, in correcting severe NLFs. Results were consistent with those of the current study: at months 1 and 6, respectively, 98.8% and 90.0% of NLFs had improved greater than or equal to 1 point on the NLFSS compared with 99.1% and 90.8% in the current study based on evaluating investigator assessment. Juv&#x000e9;derm Ultra Plus also demonstrated long-term maintenance of clinically significant correction at 12 months in the study by Goodman et al.<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup></p><p>Treatment site response rates were similar between products although Juv&#x000e9;derm Ultra Plus treatment resulted in fewer severe treatment site responses than Restylane. Juv&#x000e9;derm Ultra Plus was well tolerated, and treatment site responses were generally mild or moderate in severity and resolved without intervention. These safety results are consistent with other studies reporting on NLF correction with Juv&#x000e9;derm Ultra Plus.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Treatment site responses with Juv&#x000e9;derm Ultra Plus tended to last longer than Restylane, which may have been a result of the larger needle size used with Juv&#x000e9;derm Ultra Plus.</p><p>One plausible limitation of this study is that treating investigators may have been influenced in their assessments of product characteristics or the way they treated each NLF because they were not blinded. However, evaluating investigators were blinded to treatment.</p><p>In conclusion, this study demonstrates that Juv&#x000e9;derm Ultra Plus is safe and effective for correcting severe NLFs in Chinese subjects and served as the basis for approval of Juv&#x000e9;derm Ultra Plus in China. Safety and effectiveness profiles were similar compared with studies enrolling mainly non-Asian subjects.</p></sec><sec><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>The authors thank the staff at the 7 centers for their contributions to this study.
