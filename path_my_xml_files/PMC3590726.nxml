Because of the complex anatomy of the roots and contours of the lesion, mechanical periodontal treatment alone may not be effective, and sufficient in the reduction of the bacterial load to make the tooth surface biologi cally acceptable. Moreover, the success of mechanical periodontal treatment is closely related to the patient's oral hygiene performance. Recurrent periodontal tissue destruction is almost inevitable in patients who fail to achieve an acceptable plaque control during treatment or maintenance phase of periodontal therapy.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>]</p><p>Adjunctive administration of systemic antimicrobials has been useful in treating periodontal pockets. However, the dose necessary to achieve sufficient local concentrations of antimicrobials in the periodontal environment might be associated with undesirable side effects. Local administration therefore may be considered as an alternative to overcome these problems. The local delivery device consists of a drug reservoir and a limiting element that controls the rate of the medicament release. The goal is to maintain effective concentrations of chemotherapeutic agents at the site of action for longer periods.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>]</p><p>Local delivery devices can be divided into two classes according to the duration of the medicament release:</p><p>
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>sustained release devices</p></list-item><list-item><p>controlled delivery devices</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>Sustained release formulations are designed to provide drug delivery for less than 24 h. On the other hand, controlled delivery systems should have duration of drug release that exceeds 1 day.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>]</p><p>Chlorhexidine has long been used as an effective antimicrobial agent. Its mechanism of action relates to reduction in pellicle formation, alteration of bacterial adherence to teeth and an alteration of bacterial cell wall causing lysis. Chlorhexidine is effective against subgingival plaque bacteria when delivered via a sustained-release device for 9 days. The antimicrobial effects were evident up to 11 weeks after treatment, and clinical efficacy in terms of reduced probing depth, clinical attachment levels, and reduction of bleeding on probing was evident. A biodegradable chip for sustained and direct delivery of chlorhexidine to the periodontal pocket has been developed.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>]</p><p>The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a controlled-release chlorhexidine chip (PerioCol&#x02122; -CG) as an adjunct to scaling and root planing when compared with scaling and root planing alone in the treatment of chronic periodontitis.</p><p>PerioCol&#x02122;-CG is manufactured by Eucare pharmaceuticals (P) Ltd. PerioCol&#x02122;-CG is a small, orange- brown rectangular chip. It is rounded at one end for easy insertion into periodontal pockets. Each PerioCol&#x02122;-CG contains approximately 2.5 mg of chlorhexidine gluconate in a biodegradeable matrix of Type 1 collagen derived from fish sources. PerioCol&#x02122;-CG releases chlorhexidine <italic>in vitro</italic> with a release profile of approximately 40-45% within 24h and afterward in linear fashion for 7-8 days. The release profile may be explained by initial burst effect due to diffusion of the drug from the chip followed by release of the drug due to enzymatic degradation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>Twenty patients, aged 35-55 years, diagnosed with generalized chronic periodontitis, having probing pocket depth &#x02265;5mm were selected from the Department of Periodontology and Implantology, Meenakshi Ammal Dental College, Chennai, for this study which was approved by Ethical Committee.</p><p>A total number of 40 posterior sites were selected.

Both studies showed that the adjunctive use of Periochip was effective in reducing Plaque index scores, bleeding on probing, probing pocket depth, and gain in clinical attachment level when compared to scaling and root planing alone.</p><p>In the present study, supragingival plaque decreased significantly from baseline in both the groups as a result of full mouth supragingival and subgingival scaling. In Group A, the mean reduction in the Plaque index score was in accordance to studies done by Mc Nabb <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] Dahlen <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] and Ximmenez-Fyvie <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] who demonstrated that repeated professional supragingival plaque control reduced both supra and sub-gingival plaque. The reduction was higher in Group B because of application of PerioCol&#x02122;-CG This result was similar to the study done by Mizrak <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] The plaque scores were maintained at a low level throughout the study, indicating good oral hygiene performance of all the patients and successful re-motivation and instruction in supportive periodontal care.</p><p>Both the treatment groups presented marked reduction in the percentage of bleeding sites. On comparing both these parameters between the groups, the reduction was more significant in Group B compared to Group A. The results in Group A were similar with the results of Mc Nabb <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] Dahlen <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] and Ximmenez-Fyvie <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] who demonstrated that repeated professional supragingival plaque control reduced counts of both supra- and sub-gingival plaque and may have altered the inflammatory state of the periodontal tissues. In Group B, apart from supragingival scaling, the adjunctive placement of PerioCol-CG would have released chlorhexidine with drug concentration greater than 125 &#x003bc;g/ml into the periodontal pocket for 7-10 days. This concentration has been reported to be above the minimum inhibitory concentration for more than 99% of subgingival microorganisms. This change in microflora would have further reduced the inflammatory state of periodontal tissues, thus bringing about reduction in the bleeding on probing. The results in Group B were in accordance with the results of the study done by Killoy <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>]</p><p>In the present study, the mean reduction in probing pocket depth in Group A was similar to the studies done by Hill,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] Pihlstorm,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] and Cugini.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] The mean reduction in probing pocket depth in Group B was similar to studies done by Soskolne,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] Jeffcoat,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] Azmak,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] and Paolantonio.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>]</p><p>On comparison of the mean probing pocket depth between Group A and B, there was no statistically significant difference observed from the baseline to 90<sup>th</sup> day and baseline to 180<sup>th</sup> day. On clinical examination, Group B demonstrated a higher reduction in probing pocket depth when compared to Group A. In Group A, the probing pocket depth would have reduced because of the beneficial effects of scaling and root planing which occurred within the first 3 months followed by a period of stability aided by maintenance scaling. In Group B, the probing pocket depths reduced because of the placement of PerioCol&#x02122;-CG. This indicates that there was an additional beneficial effect of chlorhexidine apart from scaling and root planing alone. The continuing efficacy of chlorhexidine was due to the fact that the periodontal pockets received a second application of chlorhexidine at 3 months with supragingival scaling while the control group received supragingival scaling only.</p><p>The mean gain in the clinical attachment level from baseline to 90<sup>th</sup> day, and baseline to 180<sup>th</sup> day was statistically significant in Group A and Group B. On comparing the mean gain in clinical attachment level between Group A and B, the gain was higher in Group B. In Group A, the improvement in clinical attachment level was due to deeper baseline probing depth in the present study. According to Kaldahl,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] there was greater gain in clinical attachment level after scaling and root planing with PPD of &#x0003e;4 mm. In Group B, the sites were treated by SRP followed by treatment of periodontal pockets with PerioCol&#x02122;-CG. With the additional placement of chlorhexidine chip, there was sustained exposure of chlorhexidine in pocket environment for 6-9 days which gave long-lasting effects on microbiota. This would have brought about additional gain in the clinical attachment level in Group B. These findings were similar to studies by Soskolne[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] and Jeffcoat[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] who also demonstrated gain in the clinical attachment level in test sites which received the chlorhexidine chip.</p><p>Studies done by Mizrak[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] and Azmak[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] demonstrated that after placement of Periochip there was reduction in GCF PGE<sub>2</sub> and GCF MMP-8 levels. In this present study, the adjunctive use of chlorhexidine along with SRP resulted in a beneficial effect in both clinical and microbiological parameters which could have been due to reduction in GCF PGE<sub>2</sub> levels and reduction in GCF MMP-8 levels. The microbiological analysis and GCF analysis after placement of the chlorhexidine chip was not performed as it was not within the scope of this study.</p><p>However, long-term studies are required with larger sample size and longer time period with microbiological analysis to evaluate the effectiveness of PerioCol&#x02122;-CG.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>From the results observed in this study, it can be concluded that the adjunctive use of PerioCol&#x02122;-CG was safe and provided significant improvement in the Plaque index and gingival bleeding index.
