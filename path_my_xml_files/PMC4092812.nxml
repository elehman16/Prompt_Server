The opioid infusion was titrated, in the first intent, to achieve optimal sedation as defined by a Sedation Agitation Scale (SAS) of 4. NIH in G1 was realised by infusion of MS (0.008 mg/kg/hour), K (0&#x02013;8 &#x003bc;g/kg/min) or C (0&#x02013;0.01 &#x003bc;g/kg/ min) depending on hemodynamic stability. A tramadol open-label (0.25 mg/kg/hour) infusion was started if additional analgesia was required. Sedation was performed in all patients with a propofol infusion (0&#x02013;6 mg/kg/min). The SAS was maintained between 3 and 4. For statistical analysis a Shapiro-Wilk test, Wilcox test and a Student <italic>t </italic>test were used.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The mean percentage hours of optimal sedation was significantly longer in the R group (108.3 &#x000b1; 26.3 = 5.5 days) than in the S group (86.5 &#x000b1; 6.5). This was achieved with less frequent infusion rate adjustments (0.34 &#x000b1; 0.25 changes/hour) than in the S group (0.42 &#x000b1; 0.22 changes/hour). The mean durations of mechanical ventilation were comparable in both groups (76 &#x000b1; 14 hours SD). The extubation times were significantly longer in the S group (22.1 &#x000b1; 4.4 hours, 75 &#x000b1; 5 min) than in the R group (4.1 &#x000b1; 2.0 hours, 10 &#x000b1; 6 min), respectively (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.001). The total mean hospitalisation time in the ICU was reduced by 48 &#x000b1; 8 hours in G1 compared with G2 (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.005). The R mean infusion rate was 0.12 &#x000b1; 0.9 &#x003bc;g/kg/min, whereas the S mean infusion rate was 0.38 &#x000b1; 0.14 &#x003bc;g/kg/min. More subjects in the S group (32 of 50) than in the R group (6 of 50) required tramadol (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.001). The mean EVA at the end of the ICU stay was for G1: 1 &#x000b1; 1 and for G2: 2 &#x000b1; 3 (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.005). The incidence of adverse events was low and comparable across the two treatment groups. The global hospitalisation cost shows a 26% reduction for patients in G1 despite a raise of 8% when R is used compared with S.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>A remifentanil-based regimen was more effective in the provision of optimal analgesia sedation than a standard sufentanyl-based regimen. The remifentanil-based regimen allowed a more rapid emergence from sedation and facilitated earlier extubation, and so diminished total ICU hospitalisation time and cost. The prevention of NIH allows an optimal narco-sedative level without increased doses of remifentanyl and lower needs for analgesics at the end of ICU hospitalisation.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="B1"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Mercadante</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><article-title>Hyperalgesia</article-title><source>J Pain Symptom Manage</source><year>2003</year><volume>10</volume><fpage>769</fpage><lpage>775</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/S0885-3924(03)00258-6</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">12906962</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref></ref-list></back></article>
