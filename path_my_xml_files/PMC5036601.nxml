Patients were classified into two groups: those with high eosinophil counts (HE &#x02265;3%) and those with low eosinophil counts (LE &#x0003c;3%). Lung function was evaluated with forced expiratory volume in 1 second, forced vital capacity, and COPD assessment test.

This study was a post hoc analysis of our previous study<xref rid="b29-copd-11-2341" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> in which the patients were nonblinded and randomized 1:1 to one of two treatment groups: high-dose (HD) and medium-dose (MD) ICS groups. From the previous drug therapy, these COPD patients were randomized to and prescribed one of the two treatment doses, which were higher dosage (HD) and medium dosage (MD) of ICS. The definition of higher dose of ICS was Fluticasone 1,000 &#x003bc;g/day and medium dose of ICS was Fluticasone 500 &#x003bc;g/day.

Fisher&#x02019;s exact test (qualitative data) or analysis of variance (quantitative data) was performed to test the homogeneity of the treatment groups. A Hosmer&#x02013;Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test was used to help determine if the model fit to the data well. All statistical analyses were performed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences for Windows (version 9.0; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>In the post hoc analysis, 248 patients were studied and classified as follows: 85 patients (34.3%) with high eosinophil counts (HE group, &#x02265;3%) and 163 patients (65.7%) with low eosinophil counts (LE group, &#x0003c;3%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-copd-11-2341">Figure 1</xref>). The demographics and COPD characteristics of patients in the HE and LE groups are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-copd-11-2341">Table 1</xref>. Most patients (84.9%) were male, and the average lung function was classified based on the Global initiative for chronic Obstructive Lung Disease III status (50.3% of predicted in the HE group and 52.5% of predicted in the LE group). There was no significant difference between the two groups with respect to treatment with higher ICS or medium ICS doses (<italic>P</italic>=0.39). Besides, regarding the lung function parameter with positive bronchodilator test responsiveness, there was no statistically significant difference between patients with high eosinophil counts and low counts (HE: 22.2% vs LE: 14.5%, <italic>P</italic>=0.08). However, there was higher AE frequency in the previous 1 year in HE patients compared with LE patients (HE: 27.1% vs LE: 7.4%, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01).</p><p>Analysis of the pulmonary function status with FEV<sub>1</sub> and FVC revealed that patients showed improvements in lung function across both treatment groups during the study. The improved FEV<sub>1</sub> levels among these patients were as follows: HE/HD: 125.9&#x000b1;27.2 mL versus HE/MD: 94.2&#x000b1;23.7 (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05), versus LE/HD: 70.4&#x000b1;20.5 (<italic>P</italic>=0.03), and versus LE/MD: 49.8&#x000b1;16.7 (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01). The levels of FVC were as follows: HE/HD: 248.4&#x000b1;51.3 mL versus HE/MD: 198.6&#x000b1;48.1 (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05), versus LE/HD: 145.2&#x000b1;47.5 (<italic>P</italic>=0.02), and versus LE/MD: 82.6&#x000b1;44.3 (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01). There was more significant lung function improvement in HE/HD patients when compared to that in patients of other groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-copd-11-2341">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-copd-11-2341">3</xref>). Patients receiving higher doses of Fluticasone showed greater efficacy in improvement of lung function, especially the patients also having high eosinophil counts.</p><p>Patient-assessed COPD symptoms scores with CAT questionnaire decreased in both HE and LE groups, with a statistically significant difference found in favor of the patients treated in the HD group. The CAT scores were as follows: HE/HD: 9&#x000b1;5, HE/MD: 12&#x000b1;6, LE/HD: 13&#x000b1;5, and LE/MD: 16&#x000b1;7 throughout the study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-copd-11-2341">Figure 4</xref>). There was a trend of a higher quality of life among the patients who received continuous treatment with higher dose of ICS, especially in patients with accompanying high eosinophil counts, and statistically more significant difference in CAT scores among patients treated with medium ICS dose, even in those with high eosinophil counts (LE/HD). Average changes from baseline in the mean scores of CAT decrease also showed significant differences between HE patients and LE patients (8&#x000b1;3 vs 4&#x000b1;2, <italic>P</italic>=0.04) at the end of study, irrespective of whether the patients were treated with HD or MD therapy. There was greater benefit and more treatment response, especially in HE patients using ICS therapy.</p><p>Also, the frequency of AE detection showed a significant difference in the patients of all four groups. The percentage of AE after ICS/long-acting beta-agonist treatment was HE/HD: 0.135, HE/MD: 0.147, LE/MD: 0.226, and LE/MD: 0.287 per person-year, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-copd-11-2341">Figure 5</xref>). There was a significant difference and reduction in the percentage of AE in HE patients treated with HD, compared with other patients. None of the patients suffered from life-threatening AE. Meanwhile, there was no obvious difference in the incidence of pneumonia in these groups (HE/HD: 3.2%, HE/MD: 2.6%, LE/HD: 3.5%, LE/MD 2.8%; <italic>P</italic>=0.38) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6-copd-11-2341">Figure 6</xref>). Other side effects such as hoarseness or oral candidiasis were similar among the patients in the four groups (HE/HD: 6.3%, HE/MD: 8.8%, LE/HD: 4.9%, LE/MD 9.2%; <italic>P</italic>=0.38).</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our post hoc analysis demonstrated that the responsiveness was greater in lung function, quality of life, and decreased frequency of AE among COPD patients with high blood eosinophil count (&#x02265;3%) undergoing ICS treatment, especially in those on high-dose ICS therapy. The results were similar to other studies<xref rid="b26-copd-11-2341" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b28-copd-11-2341" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> in which greater effectiveness was noticed in treating high eosinophil counts with ICS. However, this is the first study to compare the benefits shown by high and medium ICS dose in COPD patients with high eosinophil count. Results of this study showed greater improvement from treatment with high ICS dose (Fluticasone 1,000 &#x003bc;g/day) than with medium ICS dose (Fluticasone 500 &#x003bc;g/day). Therefore, it is helpful to select the most appropriate treatments for individual patients and the blood eosinophil count has greater potential as a biomarker to improve decision making in COPD treatment.</p><p>Blood eosinophil count, a promptly available and easy-to-interpret measure, is probably a suitable tool as a biomarker in clinical practice to identify which COPD patients are most likely to benefit from the treatment efficacy of ICS. Our study revealed that there were higher exacerbation and hospitalization rates in patients with high eosinophil counts than in those with low eosinophil counts. Our result is similar to a recent report in which increased blood eosinophil levels above 0.34&#x000d7;10<sup>9</sup> cells/L were associated with a 1.76-fold increased risk of severe exacerbations.<xref rid="b31-copd-11-2341" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Therefore, it may have immediate clinical implications as there are ongoing more complex inflammation processes, such as asthma pathogenesis, in the airway in patients with high eosinophil counts and the benefits were greater with the use of ICS treatment in patients with extreme higher eosinophil counts<xref rid="b27-copd-11-2341" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="b28-copd-11-2341" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> or with the use of high ICS dose to reduce antiallergic inflammation in these patients. A recent study,<xref rid="b32-copd-11-2341" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> however, reported that eosinopenia is a marker of poor outcome in COPD AE. It is important to clarify the true impact of the role of and the inflammation mechanism of eosinophils in patients with COPD.</p><p>The threshold for high eosinophil counts in COPD patients was not confirmed. Several studies<xref rid="b26-copd-11-2341" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="b27-copd-11-2341" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="b33-copd-11-2341" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> had used 2% as the cutoff for the blood eosinophil level and documented that for patients with over 2% eosinophils, ICS combined with long-acting beta-agonist was associated with significant reduction in exacerbation rates versus Tiotropium (INSPIRE study<xref rid="b34-copd-11-2341" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>) or placebo (TRISTAN study).<xref rid="b35-copd-11-2341" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> Stratification by blood eosinophil level &#x02265;3% versus &#x0003c;3% showed similar trends for TRISTAN. In the Foster 48-Week Trial to Reduce Exacerbation in COPD (FORWARD) study,<xref rid="b28-copd-11-2341" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> the stratified method involved total eosinophil counts, not the percentage. In our study, the threshold of 3% eosinophil level had shown significant difference in previous AE rate and a good response to high-dose therapy of ICS. The definition using 3% level in blood was based on the sputum cutoff level<xref rid="b10-copd-11-2341" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b12-copd-11-2341" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> in our study. It was found that the 3% cutoff level was associated with increased exacerbation risk than the 2% threshold level. Also, the clinical effectiveness with ICS was greater in patients with &#x02265;3% than in those with &#x0003c;3%, but there was no significant difference if the threshold level was 2%. It should be further elucidated and studied as to which classifications of eosinophil levels are beneficial to the treatment guide.</p><p>A recent study had mentioned that patients with higher sputum eosinophils can predict more bronchial hyper-responsiveness (BHR) than the patients without BHR, and those with sputum eosinophils &#x02265;3% had more frequent exacerbations in the previous year and higher symptom scores than the patients with sputum eosinophils &#x0003c;3%.<xref rid="b36-copd-11-2341" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> Sputum eosinophil count is known to be the most reliable predictor of responsiveness to ICS in COPD. However, there was no association between BHR and blood eosinophil percentage in our study, which is similar to another report.<xref rid="b37-copd-11-2341" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> The different sites of eosinophil counts may represent variable clinical characteristics. This phenomenon is like that reported in a recent study on uncontrolled asthma patients, of whom one third exhibited inconsistency between sputum and blood eosinophils.<xref rid="b38-copd-11-2341" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> There are some studies that confirm the concordance or discordance between sputum and blood eosinophils in patients with COPD. It should be further elucidated whether sputum eosinophil levels are in concordance with blood eosinophil counts or not, and airway eosinophil inflammation is compatible or not with systemic eosinophil inflammation in COPD.</p><p>Possible mechanisms for the inconsistency in blood and sputum eosinophils may consider the imbalance between the production by allergy and the subsequent clearance of eosinophils by airway macrophages<xref rid="b39-copd-11-2341" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> and various stimulants in the inflammatory process of eosinophil recruitment into the airways.<xref rid="b38-copd-11-2341" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> The cause for only a small group of the COPD patients exhibiting higher blood eosinophils may be that it may be a response to the association of several kinds of biological mechanisms underlying eosinophilic inflammation in the pathogenesis (endotypes) and clinical characteristics (phenotype) of COPD.<xref rid="b40-copd-11-2341" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> Similar to the pathogenesis of asthma, stimulation and subsequent production of T helper (Th)2 cytokines may be responsible for eosinophilic inflammation in COPD subgroup.<xref rid="b40-copd-11-2341" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> However, it has also been reported that the coexisting eosinophilic inflammation in the airway of COPD patients is not due to elevated levels of Th2 cytokines responsiveness.<xref rid="b41-copd-11-2341" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> This may result from the non-Th2 eosinophilic inflammation in COPD, which is induced by the epithelial innate lymphoid cell type 2 pathways, and innate lymphoid cell type 2 has been documented the relationship of pathogenesis in severe nonallergic eosinophilic asthma.<xref rid="b42-copd-11-2341" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> Therefore, further studies should be performed in order to elucidate the pathogenesis involved in the association between different endotypes of eosinophil inflammation and COPD phenotypes.</p><p>Based on these inflammatory mechanisms, the role of ICS in suppressing eosinophilic inflammation is rational and essential. More importantly, there was more clinical effectiveness when HE patients were treated with ICS therapy, especially with a high ICS dose. There is still a controversy regarding the benefits and risks of ICS therapy in COPD patients. Our current and previous findings show that high ICS doses have greater clinical benefits in lung function improvement, improvement of quality of life, and reduction of AE, especially in the HE subset of COPD patients. The side effects, especially the incidence of pneumonia, did not increase in patients on high ICS therapy. Therefore, our results provide a reliable and effective strategy of prescribing high ICS therapy in COPD patients with high eosinophil count.</p></sec><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>The major limitation and weakness of the study is the post hoc analysis nature of the analyses, although the rationale for the study was based on previous findings. This survey is from our randomized controlled trial and appropriate analyses were put in place to control for confounding factors. Indeed, the designed parameters and factors for this survey are not the primary endpoints originally. The second limitation is the difficultly to assess blood eosinophilia as the only marker for measurement of ICS efficacy; also, we chose the cutoff point &#x02265;3% to divide the groups, based on a previous study performed on sputum eosinophilia. There is no clear data to support that blood eosinophilia reflects sputum eosinophilia in patients with COPD. The strong basis to test the value of blood eosinophils as a marker to ICS treatment and comparison between the treatment effectiveness of high and medium dose of ICS prompted us to do this elucidation. Further prospective studies should be carried out with large sample sizes to highlight the usefulness and reliability of eosinophil counts as a biomarker in COPD patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, COPD patients with high eosinophils (&#x02265;3%) treated with high doses of ICS had improved lung function status, decreased exacerbation frequency, and showed greater relief from symptoms in comparison to those using medium doses of ICS and to other low-eosinophil (&#x0003c;3%) subgroups. Besides, no significant increase in the incidence of pneumonia development, especially on using high doses of ICS, was noticed. The study was the first study to compare the effectiveness of medium and high ICS doses in treatment of COPD with different eosinophil counts and provide an applicable dose for anti-inflammation response in COPD.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The abstract of this paper was presented at the American Thoracic Society International Conference, San Francisco, CA, USA, on May 13&#x02013;18, 2016, as a poster presentation with interim findings.
