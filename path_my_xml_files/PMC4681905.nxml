exercises during prolonged sitting on the lower back mobility of sedentary young adults.
[Subjects and Methods] Seventy-one subjects aged between 18&#x02013;25&#x02005;years participated in this
study. Following a randomized crossover study design, subjects were randomly assigned to
two groups: sitting only and dynamic sitting exercise. The dynamic sitting exercise was a
combination of lower back hyperextension and abdominal drawing-in movements which were
repeated 6 times in a 1-minute period and performed every 20 minutes during a 2-hour
sitting session. Lumbar range of movement was measured with the modified-modified Schober
test, and the pain intensity was evaluated using the visual analog scale. [Results] After
the experiment, the lumbar range of movement was significantly impaired in the sitting
only group; however, it was significantly improved in the dynamic sitting exercise group.
There were significant differences in lumbar range of movement of both flexion and
extension between the groups. No significant difference in pain intensity between the
groups was found. [Conclusion] These results suggest that dynamic sitting exercises during
prolonged sitting can prevent decreases in lumbar range of movement in both back flexion
and extension following a 2-hour sitting period.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Back exercise</kwd><kwd>Flexibility</kwd><kwd>Long sitting</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Low back pain (LBP) is a worldwide health problem and a major cause of disability in the
general population<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Causes of LBP are
combinations of many factors including improper posture, overloading of the back,
immobility, and trunk muscle weakness<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. One of the primary causes of back pain is a
sitting posture sustained over long periods<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Many sedentary workers keep a markedly
curved back posture with low muscle activity during sitting<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. This habitual improper posture as well as low muscle activity of
the back may weaken lumbar muscle strength<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>, because the total amount of muscle activity in daily life affects
both muscle volume and strength. When the daily requirements on muscle activity are
decreased, the muscle becomes smaller and weaker<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Additionally, improper posture while sitting in a chair burdens
the low back with an unnecessary load due to spinal alignment. These prolonged
sitting-induced decreases in muscle strength and function can increase the prevalence of
LBP. Accordingly, a proper sitting posture is an important ergonomic factor in the
prevention of LBP. Exercise programs are an important treatment and a form of rehabilitation
for LBP<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. These exercise programs are effective at decreasing pain,
improving physical function, and increasing oxygenation and blood flow to the lower back of
individuals with LBP<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. Exercises
performed while sitting could provide therapeutic effects for preventing decreases in the
lumbar range of movement (LROM) and reduce LBP; however, there is a lack of information
concerning the effects of exercise on the lower back during prolonged sitting conditions.
Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of dynamic sitting
exercises during prolonged sitting on the lower back mobility of sedentary young adults.
Dynamic exercise also represents an important instrument for assuming a proper posture under
spinal loading conditions during sitting. Moreover, it can provide useful information to
advance our understanding of LBP, which, in turn, may provide new approaches towards
preventing LBP during periods of long-term sitting. The hypothesis tested in this study was
that the frequency of muscle activation is a key factor in maintaining a healthy low back
condition, and that exercise during sitting can prevent a decrease in low back mobility.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Eighty healthy young subjects were recruited from the general community using bulletin
boards and verbal requests addressed to persons living in the city of Khon Khaen. All the
subjects received a physical screening performed by a physical therapist and a physician.
The inclusion criteria of the physical screening were physical activity without regular
participation in exercise training, no history of previous LBP within the six months prior
to the study, and no pain on the experimental day. The exclusion criteria were: a history of
back, hip joint and lower limb surgeries; congenital deformity of the spine or limbs; or
musculoskeletal problems including tuberculosis, scoliosis, ankylosing spondylitis,
spondylolisthesis and rheumatoid arthritis. A randomized crossover study was conducted
according to the flowchart design displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig.

randomly assigned to one of two groups: the sitting only CON group, or the dynamic sitting
exercise (DSE) group. This was followed by a one day washout period, after which a crossover
assignment was performed for each subject with a member of the other group using simple
randomization (random number). After the first day of baseline assessments, 3 subjects
dropped out leaving a total of 71 healthy young males (n = 46) and females (n = 25), 18 to
25&#x02005;years of age (age: 21.0 &#x000b1; 2.0&#x02005;years; height: 1.64 &#x000b1; 0.08 m; mass: 55.23 &#x000b1; 7.48&#x02005;kg; body
mass index (BMI): 20.50 &#x000b1; 1.81&#x02005;kg/m<sup>2</sup>; mean &#x000b1; SD), who completed the study. All
subjects were informed about the experimental procedures as well as the purpose of the study
prior to the onset of the study. Written informed consent was obtained from each
participant. The protocol and informed consent forms were approved by the Khon Kaen
University Ethics Committee for Human Research.</p><p>The DSE was modified from the chair-care decompression exercises<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. It was a combination of lower back hyperextension and
abdominal drawing-in exercises. Participants were instructed to perform the following
sequence of actions: 1) relax their arms on the armrests, 2) extend the lower back until
they could feel slight stretching in the lower back and hold for 5 sec, then 3) gently draw
in abdomen to return to the neutral sitting posture in 1&#x02013;5 sec. This exercise was performed
six times in a 1-minute period and repeated every 20 minutes while sitting and watching a
classic movie over a 2-hour period. Prior to the experiment, each participant was given and
explanation and demonstration of how to perform each step of the DSE by a licensed physical
therapist with 1&#x02005;year of experience. The participants in CON were instructed to watch the
same movie over a 2-hour period. This group received treatments at a different time from the
DSE to make sure that they did not know which treatment group they were in by observing the
other group. In addition, prior to the experiment all the participants were asked to go to
the restroom and perform their ablutions, as they were not allowed to leave the chair during
the experimental period. The assessments of each group were performed before and after each
intervention.</p><p>The outcome measures included LROM and pain levels, which were measured with the
modified-modified Schober test (MMST) and the visual analog scale (VAS), respectively. They
were assessed by a physical therapist who was blinded to the treatment group of each
participant. The MMST was used to measure ROM in both lumbar flexion and extension<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>.

for flexion and extension were assessed as the distance between two points. An increased
flexion distance and a decreased extension distance indicated a better LROM. These
measurements were taken three times and the mean value was used for further analysis. Before
conducting the main study, the inter- and intra-rater reliabilities of back flexion and
extension measurements were determined using 10 healthy subjects who did not participate in
the main study. The inter-rater reliability was tested by assessment of the intra-class
correlation coefficient (ICC) using a two way mixed effect model (3:1), and comparing the
performance of the physical therapist with that of an expert physical therapist with
20&#x02005;years of experience. Then, the intra-rater reliability was assessed using the physical
therapist.</p><p>The VAS is a common assessment of pain intensity in clinical and research settings. The VAS
is rated by a subject on a scale drawn on a 10-cm-long line, with 0 indicating no pain and
10 indicating intolerable pain. Subjects were asked to make a mark on the line commensurate
with their perceived levels of pain intensity<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>All data are presented as means &#x000b1; SD. The inter and intra-rater reliabilities of back
flexion and extension measurements were assessed using the intra-class correlation
coefficient (ICC) and a two way mixed effect model (3:1). The LROM and pain levels were
normally distributed according to the Shapiro-Wilk W test. To examine whether there was any
carryover effect from the order of treatment due to the 2-period crossover design, a
repeated-measures ANOVA was performed. When there was no evidence of a carryover effect, the
independent t-test or Mann Whitney U test were used to compare the relative changes (pre-
and post-intervention) between the two treatment groups. Statistical significance was
accepted for values of p &#x0003c; 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The ICCs (3:1 model) of the intra-reliability of back flexion were 0.99 (95% CI: 0.99 to

prolonged sitting periods can maintain lower back mobility of both flexion and extension as
measured by the modified-modified Schober test. Because a decrease in lower back flexibility
is one of the major causes of lower back problems, dynamic sitting exercises during
prolonged sitting may be an important technique for preventing low back problems in healthy
young adults. Although it is important to note that not all LBP arises from back
inflexibility, the results of this study suggest that exercise during sitting can maintain
low back mobility and the frequency of muscle activation is a key factor in the maintenance
of a healthy low back condition.</p><p>Prolonged sitting has been shown to be associated with various back problems. Previous
studies have shown that sitting in a chair without lumbar support for a 2-hour period causes
LBP, stiffness, fatigue, and buttocks numbness<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. Sitting in a standard office chair for 30 minutes produced an
increase in lumbar flattening and a decrease in thoracolumbar curvature<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. The results of the present study could also demonstrate
that prolonged sitting resulted in an impairment of LROM, which might be a cause of LBP. On
the other hand, dynamic sitting exercises performed during the 2-hour sitting period
prevented the loss of low back mobility. Similarly, sitting on an exercise ball, as compared
with sitting on an office chair, elicited greater improvement in trunk, lumbar, and spine
mobility<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. Sitting on a dynamic chair
increases spinal length because the passive motion of this type of chair provides spinal
distress relief; however, sitting on a static chair decreases the spinal length<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>. Various exercises have elicited positive
effects in patients with LBP and lumbar instability. Lumbar flexibility exercises performed
for two weeks elicited improvements in lumbar ROM and decreases in the LBP symptoms of
patients with non-specific LBP<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>. Our
previous study demonstrated that a 10-week core stabilization exercise program reduced
functional disability and pain intensity while improving deep abdominal muscle activation in
subjects with clinical lumbar instability<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. The combination of exercise, massage therapy, and lumbar support
is an effective treatment and provides the tools needed to release muscle stiffness,
decrease pain, and improve physical functions<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup>. Stretching and core stability exercises also have beneficial
effects on muscle relaxation and spinal alignment<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup>, and can help prevent LBP. The mechanism of lower back
hyperextension and abdominal drawing-in exercises in dynamic sitting exercises may increase
the extensibility of the non-contractile capsular and ligamentous tissues around the spine,
thereby enhancing spinal mobility and improving LROM. In addition, enhancement of the spinal
height may be explained by the similar effect of &#x0201c;off-loading posture&#x0201d; using chair-care
decompression exercises<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The study was conducted using a cross-over design which allowed control of individual
confounding factors. The LROM assessment was performed blinded and the measurements of LROM
were found to have very high degrees of reliability. Since this study examined healthy
adults aged between 18&#x02013;25 years only, the derived results may not be generalizable to other
age groups. Furthermore, it was not feasible for the participants to be blinded to their
treatment group due to the nature of the intervention and the study design. Despite these
limitations, our findings may contribute to the advancement of the general understanding of
LBP caused by periods of long-term sitting.</p><p>In conclusion, dynamic sitting exercises were performed during a 2-hour sitting session and
improved lumbar mobility, whereas prolonged sitting without exercise decreased lumbar
mobility. These results indicate that dynamic sitting exercises may provide an effective
intervention for the impairment of lower back flexibility caused by prolonged sitting, a
condition afflicting many office workers. Future studies are needed to determine the
clinical efficacy of dynamic sitting exercises either over the long term or in patients with
LBP.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank the volunteer subjects who participated in this study. This
