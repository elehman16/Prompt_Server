The Ras/Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway (Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK pathway) is an intracellular key signaling pathway that transmits mitogenic stimuli from the extracellular environment to the nucleus of the cell by multiple phosphorylation steps [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The cascade can be schematically divided into membranous and cytoplasmic phases. When growth factors bind to, and activate transmembrane receptors located on the cell surface, the level of guanosine triphosphate-bound forms of Ras increases in the cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Upon Ras activation, Raf kinases are recruited to the plasma membrane and become activated. This process results in sequential phosphorylation and activation of several protein kinases, collectively known as the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascade. In the MAPK cascade, Raf phosphorylates and activates MEK, which in turn phosphorylates and activates ERK. Activated ERK dissociates from the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK complex and can translocate to the nucleus to phosphorylate and activate numerous different transcription factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. MEK is the only enzyme known to activate ERK and being located downstream of Ras, and Raf has therefore been identified as an attractive therapeutic target within this central cascade. Inhibition of MEK activity is anticipated to inhibit tumor proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Given the widespread distribution of constitutive ERK activation, a MEK inhibitor could be foreseen to have a broad spectrum of clinical utility in both solid tumors and hematological malignancies.</p><p>Selumetinib (C<sub>17</sub>H<sub>15</sub>BrClFN<sub>4</sub>O<sub>3</sub>; AZD6244 and ARRY-142886) is a potent, selective, non-ATP competitive inhibitor of MEK with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 14&#x000a0;nmol/L against purified MEK1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In contrast to its activity against MEK 1/2, selumetinib did not show significant activity against various other kinases, enzymes, receptors, ion channels, and transporters. Selumetinib monotherapy has been clinically evaluated in a variety of cancers including melanoma, pancreatic, biliary tract, colorectal, and lung [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>The initial formulation of selumetinib taken into Phase I was an extemporaneous preparation of an oral suspension of selumetinib, as the free base in an aqueous solution of sulphobutylether &#x003b2;-cyclodextrin (Captisol<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>), also referred to as selumetinib free base suspension or selumetinib &#x0201c;mix and drink formulation&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Preclinical pharmacological studies revealed that this formulation showed good oral bioavailability at low doses, but there was dose-limited absorption with increasing dose (i.e. less than proportional increase), likely reflecting the low aqueous solubility of the free base. Selumetinib free base has a moderate permeability across Caco-2 cells (an in vitro model of the human small intestinal mucosa used to predict in vivo drug absorption) and exhibits pH dependent solubility (274&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mL at pH1 and 3.4&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mL at pH 7.4; data on file). Because of these properties, selumetinib was classified as a tentative class IV compound (characterized by low permeability and low solubility).</p><p>For more convenient drug administration, and to achieve higher exposures, a capsule formulation of selumetinib as the hydrogen sulfate salt (AZD6244 Hyd-Sulfate) was developed, which was used in the present study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The capsule formulation dissociates readily into sulfuric acid and selumetinib free base at equilibrium in water (data on file), with the capsule solubility measurements reflecting those of the free base suspension (274&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mL at pH1, and 3.4&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mL pH 7.4). The selumetinib capsule has two pKa values (acid/base ionization constants) at 2.7 and 8.2.</p><p>Excretion of selumetinib is predominantly via the feces. The majority of selumetinib metabolites were detected as glucuronide conjugates indicating that direct conjugation is a significant route of elimination for selumetinib. Selumetinib is metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYPs) 1A2, 2C19, and 3A4, with CYP1A2 being responsible for the formation of the active metabolite, N-desmethyl-selumetinib, which in vitro showed 3- to 5-fold greater potency for MEK1 inhibition than selumetinib itself. Another metabolite, selumetinib amide, is up to 50-fold less active than selumetinib and therefore unlikely to contribute significantly to biological activity.</p><p>Phase I studies with selumetinib free base suspension and capsule formulation showed that the pharmacokinetics (PK) was approximately dose proportional across the studied dose ranges for both formulations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The maximal tolerated dose (MTD) for the free base suspension was 100&#x000a0;mg BD and 75 BD for capsule formulation. Single-dose PK revealed that selumetinib was absorbed relatively quickly at all dose levels with a median time to reach maximum plasma concentration (t<sub>max</sub>) of 1.5&#x000a0;h and a terminal elimination half-life (t<sub>1/2</sub>) of 5&#x02013;8&#x000a0;h. Total body clearance of drug from plasma after an oral dose (CL/F, ranging from 12 to 23 L/h) and volume of distribution at steady state (Vss/F, ranging from 87 to 126&#x000a0;L) also remained largely consistent across the studied dose range. Plasma N-desmethyl-selumetinib concentrations followed a similar PK profile, although exposure was much lower (AUC and C<sub>max</sub> generally &#x0003c;15% of parent compound). Based on the dose-normalized area under the plasma concentration&#x02013;time curve from time 0 to 24&#x000a0;h (AUC<sub>0&#x02013;24</sub>), the estimated bioavailability of the capsule formulation was 2.5-fold higher than the free base suspension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>The current study was undertaken to investigate the effect of food on PK parameters of the capsule formulation, which was taken forward for further clinical development. It is known that food can influence the absorption of a drug by altering one or more of the manifold variables, ranging from postprandial changes of the gastrointestinal tract, e.g. delayed gastric emptying, to chemical characteristics of the drug itself, like modified solubility and changed metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Therefore, the present study was conducted to determine whether selumetinib should continue to be dosed on an empty stomach or whether it could be given with food.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Aims</title><p>The primary objective of this study was to assess whether food influenced the rate and extent of selumetinib absorption. Secondary objectives were to determine the PK of both selumetinib and N-desmethyl-selumetinib in the presence and absence of food and to assess the safety and tolerability of selumetinib in patients with advanced solid malignancies.</p><p>An exploratory objective was included to assess the efficacy of selumetinib as measured by objective response rate (ORR) based on response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST 1.0) assessment in patients with measurable disease.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Patient selection</title><p>Male and female patients aged 18&#x000a0;years and over (World Health Organization (WHO)/Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0&#x02013;2) with advanced cancer, refractory to standard therapies or for whom no standard therapies existed, were enrolled in two investigational centers in the Netherlands and three in the United Kingdom.

Required laboratory values consisted of absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &#x02265;1,500 per mm<sup>3</sup>, platelets &#x02265;100,000 per mm<sup>3</sup>, hemoglobin &#x0003e;9.0&#x000a0;g/dL, serum bilirubin &#x0003c;1.5&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;upper limit of normal (ULN), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &#x0003c;2.5&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;ULN, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &#x0003c;2.5&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;ULN, and calculated serum creatinine clearance &#x0003e;50&#x000a0;mL/min (using Cockcroft-Gault formula or by 24-h urine collection).</p><p>Exclusion criteria included patients with refractory nausea and vomiting, chronic gastrointestinal diseases or significant bowel resection that would preclude adequate absorption; pregnant or lactating women; patients that received any radiotherapy or chemotherapy within 21&#x000a0;days prior to starting the study, or any investigational drug within the previous 28&#x000a0;days; patients with mean QTc (using Fridericia&#x02019;s correction) &#x0003e;450&#x000a0;ms at screening or with factors that increased the risk of QT prolongation or arrhythmic events or patients using concomitant medication known to prolong QT interval; and patients with brain metastases or spinal cord suppression unless treated and stable for at least 1&#x000a0;month.</p><p>Informed written consent was obtained from all patients in accordance with federal and national guidelines, and the study was conducted in compliance with GCP guidelines and the Declaration of Helsinki. An additional informed written consent was needed for optional genetic blood sampling.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Study design</title><p>This was a Phase I, multi-center, open-label, randomized crossover study (NCT00710515). The dose of selumetinib was selected based upon the PK, safety, and tolerability data from the Phase I clinical study of the Hyd-Sulfate capsule formulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Eligible patients were randomized to one of two sequences. The first sequence received a single dose of 75&#x000a0;mg selumetinib with food on Day 1, followed by a single dose of 75&#x000a0;mg selumetinib in the fasted state on Day 8. The second sequence received 75&#x000a0;mg selumetinib in the fasted state (Day 1) and then 75&#x000a0;mg selumetinib with food (Day 8) following a 7-day wash out period. Both groups continued on twice daily 75&#x000a0;mg selumetinib from Day 10 onwards (extension period). Patients could continue to receive selumetinib until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or for as long as they continued to derive benefit from treatment. Selumetinib capsules were taken with approximately 240&#x000a0;mL of water. On Days 1 and 8, water could be taken freely up to 1&#x000a0;h prior to, and from 1&#x000a0;h after, dosing. In the fasted state, patients received no food or drink other than water for 10&#x000a0;h prior to dosing. In the fed state, patients were fed an FDA high-fat breakfast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Patients were required to completely ingest this breakfast within 30&#x000a0;min and were dosed with a single oral 75&#x000a0;mg dose of selumetinib 30&#x000a0;min after starting to eat breakfast. A standard meal was given at 4&#x000a0;h post-dose on both days, and until that time no food or drink (other than water) was received. For the BD dosing from Day 10 onwards, the extension period, the doses were taken 12&#x000a0;h apart. Both doses were taken in the fasted state. Breakfast could be taken from 1&#x000a0;h following dosing. Evening doses were not to be taken in the 1&#x000a0;h preceding a meal or in the 2&#x000a0;h after having finished a meal.</p><p>Treatment with selumetinib during the BD treatment phase was withheld if patients experienced an intolerable Adverse Event (AE) or any AEs&#x000a0;&#x02265;Common Terminology Criteria (CTC) Grade 3. Selumetinib treatment could be restarted after the toxicity improved to a level considered by the Investigator to be manageable (i.e., CTC Grade 1, except for dermatological AEs where CTC Grade 2 was acceptable). Treatment could be resumed at the original dose or at a permanently reduced dose (50&#x000a0;mg selumetinib BD).</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Plasma sampling and assay methods</title><p>Blood samples were collected on Days 1 and 8, at pre-dose (within 30&#x000a0;min of dosing), 15 and 30&#x000a0;min and 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, and 48&#x000a0;h post-dose for analysis of plasma selumetinib and N-desmethyl-selumetinib metabolite concentrations. For the analysis of selumetinib and N-desmethyl selumetinib in human plasma, solid phase extraction (SPE) was followed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with tandem mass spectrometric detection (MS/MS) with a calibration range that extended from 2 to 2,000&#x000a0;ng/mL for selumetinib and 2&#x02013;500&#x000a0;ng/mL for N-desmethyl selumetinib. <sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>-selumetinib and <sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>-N-desmethyl selumetinib were used as internal standards in the assay. The analytes and internal standards were extracted from human plasma by SPE using Phenomenex Strata-X plates Polymeric Reversed Phase 96-well plates and injected onto a ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) column (Acquity(tm) UPLC<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> BEH Phenyl, 1.7&#x000a0;m, 2.1&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;50&#x000a0;mm) or an HPLC column (Phenomenex Synergi, 4&#x000a0;&#x003bc; Polar-RP, 2.0&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;50&#x000a0;mm). The chromatographic separation and detection was achieved by liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (LC&#x02013;MS/MS) using a Sciex API5000, respectively. Selumetinib and N-desmethyl selumetinib concentrations were determined by reference to calibration curves created by adding known concentrations of selumetinib and N-desmethyl selumetinib to control human plasma.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Pharmacokinetic analysis</title><p>Actual sample times were used for the PK analysis.

AUC and C<sub>max</sub> were log transformed and analyzed using an analysis of variance model allowing for the effect of food (fed or fasted), period, sequence, and patient within sequence. The adjusted geometric means (gls means) were estimated for each treatment arm (fed or fasted). An estimate of the food effect (ratio of the gls means of selumetinib in fed state: fasted state) was calculated together with its 90% CI. A formal test of carry-over was not performed. The potential for any carry-over was assessed by examination of pre-dose plasma concentrations on Day 8. An analysis of selumetinib t<sub>max</sub> data was performed on untransformed data using a non-parametric analysis. The food effect, as measured by patient differences in t<sub>max</sub> (fed minus fasted states), was analyzed using a Wilcoxon signed rank test.

In addition to selumetinib, concentrations of its 3- to 5-fold more active metabolite, N-desmethyl-selumetinib, were also determined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], as any changes in the metabolite concentrations may influence the treatment efficacy. The present study showed that the extent (C<sub>max</sub> and AUC) and rate of absorption of selumetinib was significantly reduced in the presence of food. It is therefore recommended that for future clinical studies, selumetinib should continue to be administered on an empty stomach (no food or drink other than water for 2&#x000a0;h prior to dosing and 1&#x000a0;h after dosing).</p><p>The exact mechanism for decreased selumetinib exposure in the presence of a high-fat meal is unknown and may be a result of saturation of drug dissolution in the intestinal fluids with an increased pH. In the average person, the basal gastric secretion in the fasted stomach is estimated to be 300&#x000a0;mL and in the fasted small intestine about 500&#x000a0;mL, and both can increase up to 5-fold after a high-fat meal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. On the other hand, fatty foods also stimulate bile secretion that can cause a significant rise in the pH of the proximal small bowel, the major site for selumetinib absorption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The presence of more fluid in the gastrointestinal tract may actually improve the dissolution rate and can result in increased solubility due to increased wetting of the drug and increased micellar solubilization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. However, since the food effect consisted of a decrease in selumetinib exposure, the effect of the raised pH in the proximal bowel might be of greater importance and help explain the observed decrease in absorption of selumetinib. Additionally, the selumetinib capsule has a hydroxypropylmethylcellulose coating and will tend to disintegrate slowly thus preventing early activation by gastric acid and probably resulting in a controlled release.</p><p>Delayed gastric emptying is believed to be the major mechanism for delayed absorption and could be the underlying mechanism for the delayed t<sub>max</sub> of selumetinib given in the presence of food. The presence of food in the stomach can decrease the rate of presentation of the drug to the small intestine and delay the onset of absorption, especially for rapidly absorbed drugs (C<sub>max</sub> achieved within 2&#x000a0;h in fasted state). For selumetinib in fasted state, C<sub>max</sub> was determined in a previous study at 1.5&#x000a0;h and therefore could fit in this category of drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>The study population was representative of the broader Phase I clinical population of patients with advanced solid malignancies in terms of baseline and demographic characteristics. As observed in previous selumetinib monotherapy studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], the exploratory efficacy analysis of this study suggests that selumetinib is biologically active. During the study, two patients with melanoma had partial responses and four patients had stable disease; two patients had stable disease for &#x0003e;100&#x000a0;days (1 patient with colorectal cancer and 1 patient with skin/soft tissue cancer) and two patients had stable disease for &#x0003e;50&#x000a0;days (1 patient with prostate cancer and 1 patient with liver cancer). However, it should be noted that this study was not designed to investigate the efficacy of selumetinib, and tumor mutation status (e.g. BRAF V600E or KRAS) was not determined. Limited responses were to be expected from this advanced patient population who had progressed on multiple prior anti-cancer treatments, consistent with that seen in the Phase I trials.</p><p>The AE profile in this study was similar to that seen in previous selumetinib monotherapy studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The most common AEs included gastrointestinal AEs, dermatological AEs, and fatigue. The majority of these events occurred during BD dosing.</p><p>Food effect data are available with other MEK inhibitors that have been used clinically including CI-1040 (PD-184352) and PD-0325901. CI-1040 was the first MEK inhibitor to enter the clinic, and in the Phase I study, dosing was initially performed in the morning on an empty stomach (after an overnight fast) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. It has been proposed that low aqueous solubility is responsible for the poor oral absorption of CI-1040 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]; solubility of &#x0003c;1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mL in pH 6.5 phosphate buffer. Administration of CI-1040 at 800 and 1,600&#x000a0;mg with a high-fat meal resulted in a 4.5-fold increase in drug exposure of CI-1040 and a 5-fold increase of the metabolite PD-0184264. The MTD and recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) was determined at 800&#x000a0;mg BID administered with food. The mechanism postulated for the observed increase in CI-1040 exposure in the presence of food was facilitated dissolution either by the fat in the food or because of increased presence of bile salts. This would be in line with preclinical dissolution data in which the addition of detergents to the dissolution media increased dissolution. Development of CI-1040 was discontinued in Phase II due to lack of efficacy. PD-0325901, another non-ATP competitive MEK inhibitor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], is a derivative of CI-1040 with improved aqueous solubility of 190&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mL in pH 6.5 phosphate buffer and is, like selumetinib, referred to as a second generation MEK inhibitor. PD-0325901&#x000a0;had a 50-fold higher potency than CI-1040, improved bioavailability, increased metabolic stability, and increased duration of target suppression (inhibition of ERK phosphorylation). In fasted conditions, PD-0325901 was absorbed rapidly with a t<sub>max</sub> of 1 h, and C<sub>max</sub> and AUC showed proportional increase at the tested doses; however, the effect of food on pharmacokinetics was not reported in the Phase I study. We would expect the food effect to be less than that for CI-1040 because of the improved solubility of PD-0325901. Due to lack of response and observed toxicity, development of PD-0325901 in Phase II was discontinued [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p>CH497655 (RO4987655) is a new MEK inhibitor and is currently being evaluated in a Phase I trial. Although a study has been performed in healthy volunteers, no information has been provided about the effect of food on the absorption. PK in healthy volunteers with doses up to 4&#x000a0;mg showed rapid absorption (median t<sub>max</sub> of 1&#x000a0;h) and low variability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p>In conclusion, PK parameters of orally administered drugs may be significantly altered in the presence of food due to changes in solubility, absorption and metabolism. The current study demonstrated that intake of a high-fat meal decreases the extent and rate of selumetinib absorption and suggests that a 75&#x000a0;mg dose of selumetinib capsule formulation given twice a day has an acceptable safety profile in this advanced cancer population. It is recommended that for further clinical studies, selumetinib should be taken on an empty stomach.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was sponsored by AstraZeneca.</p><p><bold>Open Access</bold> This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Noncommercial License which permits any noncommercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author(s) and source are credited.</p></ack><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref id="CR1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Chang</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Karin</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Mammalian MAP kinase signalling cascades</article-title><source>Nature</source><year>2001</year><volume>410</volume><fpage>37</fpage><lpage>40</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1038/35065000</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">11242034</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR2"><label>2.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Downward</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Targeting RAS signalling pathways in cancer therapy</article-title><source>Nat Rev Cancer</source><year>2003</year><volume>3</volume><fpage>11</fpage><lpage>22</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1038/nrc969</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">12509763</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR3"><label>3.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ramnath</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><name><surname>Adjei</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Inhibitors of Raf kinase and MEK signaling</article-title><source>Update Cancer Ther</source><year>2007</year><volume>2</volume><fpage>111</fpage><lpage>118</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/j.uct.2007.10.001</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR4"><label>4.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bonnet</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>Vigneron</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Bensaude</surname><given-names>O</given-names></name><name><surname>Dubois</surname><given-names>MF</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Transcription-independent phosphorylation of the RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain (CTD) involves ERK kinases (MEK1/2)</article-title><source>Nucleic Acids Res</source><year>1999</year><volume>27</volume><fpage>4399</fpage><lpage>4404</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1093/nar/27.22.4399</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">10536148</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR5"><label>5.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Weinstein-Oppenheimer</surname><given-names>CR</given-names></name><name><surname>Blalock</surname><given-names>WL</given-names></name><name><surname>Steelman</surname><given-names>LS</given-names></name><name><surname>Chang</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>McCubrey</surname><given-names>JA</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The Raf signal transduction cascade as a target for chemotherapeutic intervention in growth factor-responsive tumors</article-title><source>Pharmacol Ther</source><year>2000</year><volume>88</volume><fpage>229</fpage><lpage>279</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/S0163-7258(00)00085-1</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">11337027</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR6"><label>6.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Davies BR, Logie A, McKay JS, Martin P, Steele S, Jenkins R, Cockerill M, Cartlidge S, Smith PD (2007) AZD6244 (ARRY-142886), a potent inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase 1/2 kinases: mechanism of action in vivo, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship, and potential for combination in preclinical models.
