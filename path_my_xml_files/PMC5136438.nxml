BACKGROUND</title><p>Ischaemic heart disease is the commonest cause of death in many countries, including Iran and coronary artery bypass grafting surgery (CABG) is one of the few treatment options for these patients (<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>).</p><p>For on-pump coronary artery bypass grafting surgery we cross-clamp the ascending aorta and consequently deprive cardiomyocytes of oxygenated blood, after surgical procedure releasing the cross-clamp induce abrupt tissues re-oxygenation and can cause ischemia/reperfusion injury (<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>).</p><p>This process can initiate an inflammatory response and produce oxygen free radicals, resulting a microvascular and endothelial cell dysfunction, increase risk of vasospasm, vascular thrombosis and accelerated atherosclerosis (<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). It may also induce cerebrovascular accidents, myocardial dysfunction and arrhythmias, multi-organ system dysfunction such as respiratory renal or gastrointestinal dysfunction (<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>-<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).</p><p>To reduce ischemia-reperfusion organ injury, various treatment modalities have been used, such as leukocyte depletion therapy, anti-oxidant therapy, and complement therapy (<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). One of the effective measures used in this regard is ischaemic preconditioning, in which a brief periods of ischemia followed by reperfusion adapts the cardiac tissue to a longer ischaemic time and protects myocardium against adverse effects of ischaemic/reperfusion injury (<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Although the exact mechanism of RIPC is not clearly identified, some factors such as nitric oxide (NO) or adenosine release seems to play a fundamental role in this phenomenon (<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Some authors have proposed that the effect of ischaemic preconditioning may be transient, but animal studies have indicated that the protective role of RIPC can last 24 hours after surgery (<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).</p><p>In RIPC, ischemia is induced through limb tourniquet (<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>-<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) and has been used in various surgical procedures and even in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). There is still controversy regarding the beneficial effects of RIPC, on duration of hospital stay rate of mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke and renal dysfunction.</p><p>As renal and cardiomyocyte dysfunction are the most important adverse effects of CABG, role of RIPC on reducing renal complications and myocardial dysfunction has been addressed in the present study.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-2"><title>2. METHODS</title><p><bold><italic>Study design</italic></bold></p><p>This double-blind randomized clinical trial was conducted in Mazandaran Heart Centre a tertiary referral university hospital on patients who underwent CABG from March 2013 to February 2015. The protocol of the study was approved by Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences research council and ethical committee and was registered at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.irct.ir">www.irct.ir</ext-link> (IRCT138903123646N3). The design and objectives of the study were explained to all participants and written informed consent was obtained. The CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) recommendations for reporting randomized controlled clinical trials were followed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) diagram of patient flow through the trial</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="MA-70-373-g001"/></fig><p><bold><italic>Participants</italic></bold></p><p>We included patients undergoing non-emergency on-pump CABG surgery with ejection fraction (EF) higher than 35%. Exclusion criteria were under age under 18 years, CABG with valve surgery, pregnancy, advanced liver disease (INR &#x0003e;2.0), severe renal impairment (Creatinine clearance &#x0003c;50 ml/min), respiratory failure (O<sub>2</sub> Sat &#x0003c;90 %), acute myocardial infarction up to 14 days before surgery, advanced lower limb vascular disease, and patients using Sulfonamide or Nicorandil.</p><p><bold><italic>Procedures</italic></bold></p><p>We used a combinations of midazolam, sufentanil and pancuronium bromide for induction of anesthesia. All patients were mechanically ventilated using oxygen via an endotracheal tube. We maintained anesthesia with a moderate doses of sufentanil and midazolam. Also used isoflurane (&#x0003c;1%) or/and propofol (25-100 &#x000b5;g /min) as a supplement. Muscle relaxation was maintained with cisatracurium. Invasive arterial blood pressure, central venous pressure, O<sub>2</sub> saturation, end tidal CO<sub>2</sub>, five leads ECG and nasopharyngeal temperature were monitored continuously. Intravenous glyceryl trinitrate was administered during anesthesia (20&#x02013;70 &#x000b5;g/min) only when clinically indicated, since it may interfere with RIPC. The surgical procedure was started with Median sternotomy, after preparing left internal thoracic artery patients were put on bypass draining the right atrium and returning to the ascending aorta. The initial dose for Heparin was 300 IU/kg to achieve an activated clotting time (ACT) of &#x0003e;480 s. Heparin was reversed using a full dose of protamine chloride returning activated clotting time (ACT) to or &#x0003c;120 s. We used a Non-pulsatile CPB circuit with uncoated tubes, a membrane oxygenator, and an open reservoir. For priming the CBP circuit we used a Colloid based (Voluven) solution with no blood or even blood products. The maximum and minimum Hct levels were 24% and 20%, respectively. With a moderate hypothermia (32 &#x000b0;C) we maintained a mean arterial pressure of 60 to 80 mmHg during CPB. Arterial blood gas was managed using an&#x003b1;-Stat <italic>P</italic>H monitoring. After induction of anesthesia and before skin incision, Remote ischaemic preconditioning was induced by 3 cycles (each cycle 5-minutes) of a tourniquet cuff inflation applied to upper thigh (&#x02265;20mmHg higher than the resting systolic arterial pressure) followed by 5-minute reperfusion. For the sham or control group, the tourniquet was placed on the upper thigh, manipulated but inflated for the same period of time. At this period of time the lower limb was covered by a sterile sheath and inflation of tourniquet was done by one individual registered nurse responsible for randomization.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-3"><title>3. OBJECTIVES AND OUTCOMES</title><p><bold><italic>Primary outcome</italic></bold></p><p>The study primary outcome was acute kidney injury (AKI). Serum creatinine, and Troponin I level were measured at times 0, 6, 12, 24 and 48 h postoperatively measured with the Elecsys 2010 Chemistry Analyzer (Hitachi Corp., Tokyo, Japan). Normal value for Troponin I was equal or less than (&#x02264; 0.3 ng.mL-1). AKI was measured using Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) criteria:</p><p><bold>Stage 1</bold>: serum creatinine rise of &#x02265;0.3 mg/dL or 150%&#x02013;200% of baseline and/or urine output &#x0003c;0.5 mL/kg/h for &#x0003e;6 contiguous hours.</p><p><bold>Stage 2:</bold> serum creatinine rise of 200%&#x02013;300% of baseline and/or urine output &#x0003c;0.5 mL/kg/h for &#x0003e;12 contiguous hours.</p><p><bold>Stage 3:</bold> serum creatinine rise of &#x0003e;300% of baseline or serum creatinine &#x02265;4 mg/dL with an acute rise of at least &#x02265;0.5 mg/l and/or urine output &#x0003c;0.3 mL/kg/h for &#x0003e;24 h or anuria for 12 h.</p><p><bold><italic>Secondary outcomes</italic></bold></p><p>Serum Troponin-I level, Dialysis, serum CRP and inotrope requirement (measured before and at 6, 12, 24 and 48 hours after surgery), ventilator time, length of ICU stay, in-hospital mortality also were considered as secondary outcomes.</p><p><bold>Statistical analysis</bold></p><p>Based on the assumptions of a 25% incidence for post-CABG AKI and myocardial damage and 80% effect size for RIPC we calculated a sample size of 50 for our study group. We used (GraphPad StatMate; GraphPad Software Inc; San Diego, CA, USA) software for computer randomization by means of sequentially-numbered sealed envelopes. One registered nurse who did the randomization, treatment allocation and delivering RIPC was aware of patient group, other investigator, data collector, statistician, patients and doctors were blinded to study group.</p><p>We compared the two groups with Students t-test for unpaired data or Mann-Whitney U test comparing medians with interquartile ranges, depending on the normality of the distribution.

DISCUSSION</title><p>Our study indicate that remote ischaemic preconditioning can reduce cardiac and potentially reduce renal complications after CABG surgery. It showed a lower serum Troponin-I levels in the group received RIPC against control group, also showed a lower creatinine clearance 24 hours after surgery in control group but this was not statistically significant.</p><p>Previous studies had a contradictory results regarding the role of RIPC on reducing cardiac and renal complications after cardiac surgery.</p><p>The clinical efficacy of RIPC was investigated by Cheung and colleagues. They showed a lower serum troponin-I level and lower airway resistance in 37 children with congenital heart disease undergoing cardiac surgery receiving four cycles of 5-minutes lower limb ischemia (cuff inflated 15 mm Hg above systolic blood pressure) (<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Venugopal and colleagues have assessed the effect of three 5-minute cycles of brachial artery occlusion (Cuff inflated up to 200 mm Hg) on reducing myocardial damage in 23 CABG patients comparing with 22 patients in control group by measuring Troponin-T levels in these patients. They showed a lower troponin-T in subjects receiving RIPC (<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).</p><p>Thielmann and colleague have investigated effect of RIPC on reducing myocardial damage on 27 patients in study group comparing with 26 patients in control group by applying 3 cycles of five minutes upper limb ischemia in study group on patients undergoing CABG using crystalloid cardioplegia. They also showed a lower serum Troponin-I levels in study group (<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>).</p><p>Karami and colleagues have examined the clinical efficacy of RIPC by applying 3 cycles of five minutes upper or lower limb ischemia on patients undergoing elective CABG and showed Troponin-I rise in study and control group.</p><p>The finding of our study is similar to Cheung, Venugopal and Thielmann but it is different in two important ways. We used the lower limb for RIPC and our study was done on adult population of patients.</p><p>Regarding the renal-protective effect of RIPC, Venugopal and colleagues have reported lower acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients receiving RIPC before cardiac surgery (<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Zarbock and colleagues randomized 240 patients with high risk for AKI to receive 3 cycles of 5-minute ischemia in one upper arm before cardiac surgery and have reported reduced rate of AKI in the RIPC group (37.5 vs 52.5%) (<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Candilio and colleagues have also compared the effect of simultaneous arm and thigh cuff inflation in two groups of 90 patients undergoing elective CABG and have reported 48% reduction in the incidence of AKI also showed lower serum troponin-T level in the RIPC group (<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). They have reported reduction in the serum creatinine level 12 hour after surgery but in present study serum creatinine level dropped 24 hours after surgery. This might be due to different surgical procedures and study population. We have excluded concomitant valve surgery from our study population while Candilio&#x02019;s have included them.</p><p>Pedersen randomized 105 children undergoing cardiac surgery for complex congenital disorders to receive RIPC by 4 cycles of 5 minutes inflating a cuff on lower limb to 40 mm Hg above the systolic pressure and showed no renal protection in RIPC group (<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Gallagher also randomized 86 patients with pre-existing chronic kidney disease to receive three 5-minute cycles of forearm ischemia prior to CABG and have reported no difference in the incidence of AKI in RIPC group (<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>).</p><p>Li L in a review study indicated that the main reason for the contradicting results in RIPC studies is different definition for AKIA (<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Brevoord also reviewed the literatures for renal protective role of RIPC after heart surgery. He also concluded no difference between RIPC and control group. He indicated that as serum creatinine is the mostly used biomarker for detecting AKI (<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>-<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), which might not change significantly in an acute setting. we have also observed its significant decrease after 24 hours. Moreover, the different protocols of RIPC causes difference in the results, as the upper limb may be less effective than the lower limb and the pressure of the inflated cuff and the frequency of courses also play a role in this difference. Besides, the different surgical procedures also affect the results, as Walsh and colleagues have indicated that renal protective effect of RIPC is only positive in the presence of cardioplegia (<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). In addition, the difference in the demographic characteristics of patients, besides different inclusion and exclusion criteria also causes this diversity, as some studies have assessed children and some have assessed patients with existing renal risk, which affect the results profoundly.</p><p>Regarding the evident controversy in the role of RIPC on renal and cardiac complications of cardiac surgery, more studies are needed to establish the exact effect and the possible adverse effect of RIPC, but it&#x02019;s essential to use a standard definition for AKI for the results of different studies to be comparable. Moreover, the different methods of RIPC have to be compared and a standard method should be introduced, as each study has used its own method, which has caused the results not to be easily comparable with each other.</p><p>The strengths of the present study included randomizing subjects into two intervention and control groups that besides excluding many factors caused limitation in confounding factors. Moreover, this issue has rarely been addressed in Iranian studies. Beside the strengths, this study was not also free of limitations. Although the patients were randomized into the groups, it would be more optimal to select patients from different centers, in order to omit any bias and increase the generalizability of the data. Besides, the surgical procedure has to be standardized or performed by one surgeon, which was not possible in our center.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-6"><title>6. CONCLUSIONS</title><p>The results of the present study indicated decrease in the serum levels of creatinine 24 hours after CABG in the RIPC group, which indicates the superiority of this non-invasive inexpensive intervention in controlling the important complications of cardiac surgery.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>&#x02022; Conflict of interest:</bold> none
