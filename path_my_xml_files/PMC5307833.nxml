However as reported by the MASS trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], AAA related deaths do occur years after screening programs finding normal aortas in the attenders. This might be prevented by rescreening, although intervals for rescreening in normal aortas have yet to be established. Following this, the reduced AAA specific mortality by screening is only about 50%, which contrasts with reported attendance rates close to 80% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The specific causes are unknown - it could be, that those in high risk do not attend, or down to false negative findings, incidental development, a combination, or mistaken recorded cause of death.</p><p>Today two modalities are utilized to assess the infrarenal aortic diameter (IAD) to diagnose AAA, namely US and computed tomography (CT), each with their own benefits, and drawbacks.</p><p>As a screening modality for AAA, US has become accepted, because it is easy to operate, cheap and with an estimated sensitivity and specificity close to 100% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. This however, was based upon the size distribution in the population, and observed intervariation of US measurements. In reality, US has never been validated as a screening modality for AAA, it has only been validated when AAA was present, and even when present with significant interobserver variability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Adding to this, some infrarenal aortas are difficult to visualize due to intestinal gas and/or adiposity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>Using non-contrast CT scanning as an alternative screening method for AAA might be more reliable, and offer other screening potentials as coronary calcifications, thoracic- and iliac lesions. Because CT scanners are becoming widely available and perform better with each iteration, while using less radiation due to modern iterative reconstruction algorithms, effectively enabling CT to be a valid screening modality.</p><p>Contrast enhanced CT-scans are known to be more precise, probably with 100% sensitivity and specificity, but have not been tested as a screening tool. Additionally, it would expose the examined individuals not only for radiation, but potential nephrotoxic contrast. Contrast enhanced CT-scans are not widely available, time consuming and thus expensive, making it a less rational screening modality.</p><p>Nearly half the population in the Western world dies due to cardiovascular diseases (CVD), mainly due to ischemic heart disease. Focusing on traditionally risk markers like hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and diabetes screening and intervention have been tested in randomized setups, and proven insufficient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The question is whether detection of asymptomatic arterial lesions could lead to a better risk stratification and intervention. Low dose non-contrast-enhanced cardiac CT scan quantifying the degree of coronary arterial calcification, and has been proven to be one of the best predictors of future cardiac events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], and might be the tool for future screening and intervention. If such a scan is expanded to include the chest and abdomen, thoracic as well as abdominal aortic aneurysms would be exposed, but the question is whether infrarenal aorta will be sufficiently visualized. This question arises from the modern low dosage scans used in cardiac CT which might not visualize the infrarenal aorta sufficiently.</p><p>Consequently, in the pilot study of the randomized Danish CardioVascular Screening trial (DANCAVAS trial) men underwent screening for AAA by both US and non-contrast-enhanced CT scanning (nCT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The aim of this study, is to validate nCT as a comparable modality to US in a AAA screening setting.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Design</title><p>Population based cross-sectional study within a population based multicenter randomized screening trial.

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This is the first direct comparison of screening for AAA with non-contrast CT versus US. nCT was found to have superior sensitivity compared to US, and similar specificity. Our study is hampered by the lack of a real reference modality such as contrast CT, or contrast MRi. However, this was not included in the primary protocol because of the lack of feasibility to include such a modality. It was therefore decided that the modalities would be held up against each other, as reference standards, since neither had been validated as a AAA screening modality.</p><p>This study shows that in a screening setting, nCT has improved sensitivity over US. However, there is still a great deal of clinical evidence favoring US as a method, due to the reduced costs availability, and high specificity.</p><p>When aorta is visible utilizing US, it showed reasonable sensitivity for US with nCT being superior over US. Both modalities had a comparable high specificity. In addition, isolated iliac aneurysms are not likely to be detected by US, because AAA screening does not include the iliac arteries when using US. Consequently, as a screening tool for AAA, nCT seems acceptably valid, which is coherent with our hypothesis. In addition, it adds to the shortcomings of current AAA screening programs, because it is able to include the iliac arteries as well. Whether it too is acceptable as part of a multifaceted screening offer, we cannot conclude, as re-invitations, and final attendance rates are not yet available. It should be noted, that the pilot study was troubled by some preventable mishaps, with random lacking ultra sound devices, and not being able to review the US images being the most important issues. However, these issues would probably not have changed the final results of this study, but are worth mentioning. A possible limitation of this study is the lack of a truly accurate reference standard, which in this case would be 3D contrast enhanced CT scans, but this was not feasible nor ethically responsible to include.</p><p>Only men were invited to participate in this study, and this could be argued as a limitation, however, men are at increased risk solely because of their gender why a cardiovascular screening program would be targeted at men. However, a subgroup of women will be invited, to evaluate the potential cost-benefit of expanding the screening program to include women.</p><p>Although, nCT showed a comparable specificity to US, we cannot conclude that this should be the reference standard for screening for AAA as it is not widely available causing longer travel distances with assumable lower attendance, is time consuming and thus expensive. Nevertheless, nCT was able to detect more AAA (prevalence 5.7% versus 4.5%) and iliac aneurysms compared to US. This could &#x02013; at least partially &#x02013; explain the relatively low reduction in aneurysm related death in US-based randomized screening trials. nCT may thus be more efficient and perhaps a cost-effective alternative in a screening scenario, this however requires more data than currently available. This is especially true if repeated US scans are required to improve sensitivity to a comparable level of CT, since only one repetition of a US scan, closes the cost-gap between US and CT.</p><p>The medical students were trained in US, but have not undergone the same magnitude of screening as ultra-sonographers and other health care personnel conducting AAA screening. On the other hand, equipment with better-quality resolution, than portable scanners can offer was used. IAD was measured outer-to-outer, to be comparable to the UK screening program which also measures IAD in this fashion. The majority (7 of 9) of the AAA not detected by US but having visible aortas were found to be ectatic (&#x0003e;25&#x000a0;mm), while two were normal&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;25&#x000a0;mm. These might have been detected by later 5-year interval, if introduced, since half of ectatic cases develop true AAA within 5&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. This is due to true incidental cases or false negative findings. Those detected as ectatic by US but positive with nCT may be false positives, this could question whether rescreening five years after non-contrast screening will be beneficial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. However, they hardly make out the 50% reported to develop an AAA in this subgroup of the male population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Consequently, DANCAVAS will re-invite this group after five years. Additionally, it could be argued that the 3 cases found by US and not by nCT, are actually false positives, thus making nCT appear less precise than it essentially is.</p><p>While US is an acceptable screening modality, it does have some shortcomings, mainly patients with a large waist circumference or intestinal gas diameters become difficult to asses properly, there are of course certain maneuvers to improve the assessment, but in a screening scenario these are not feasible.</p><p>We theorized that calcification would improve the validity of the non-contrast CT, but have not recorded any aortic calcification quantification. Consequently, we used two indirect signs of calcification as the coronary artery calcification score and ankle brachial index. The coronary artery calcification score correlated significantly positively with the difference of the measurements. However, this could be due to confounding from a clear positive correlation between coronary artery calcification score and waist circumference, as the other indirect calcification marker, lowest measured ankle brachial index, did not correlate with the observed differences.</p><p>As an epidemiological sub finding, this study also gave a modern estimate on the prevalence of AAA in Denmark in men, which does not seem to decline as reported in UK and Sweden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The prevalence of AAA in Denmark remains relatively high. US based prevalence on Fyn (DANCAVAS 2014) is almost similar to the prevalence of 4.2% detected in the Viborg County (1994&#x02013;98) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and higher than the prevalence of 3.3% detected in the VIVA trial (2008&#x02013;11) in the Mid region of Denmark [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. However, it should be noted that this is a small sample, and as the DANCAVAS trial continues, the AAA prevalence will be reported with increased certainty.</p><p>Using low dose nCT for screening purposes will ultimately result, in increased radiation exposure to those participating. However, screening for AAA is a one-time event, which in combination with the advances made with modern CT-scanners reduces this risk greatly, making the risk negligible in these elderly males [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Thus, making nCT a worthwhile modality, since it allows for a more thorough CVD screening than US does, while not inducing illnesses. Additionally, there may be incidental findings further improving disease prevention, this however would require the participant&#x02019;s approval. This was not a part of this study, however, if a suspicious found was made by accident, the participant was informed and referred to the relevant specialties.</p><p>It is worth noting, that there is a secondary benefit to a reliable screening method, because of the psychological impact a false positive or negative result will have on the participant. This is especially important, when screening for common and potentially lethal diseases.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Low-dose nCT scanning seems to be more sensitive than US, screening for AAA, making it a possible tool for a larger scale screening program.</p><p>Expanding the screening to not only include AAA but also generally for CVDs, nCT may become truly beneficial, because it enables evaluations of the aortic and iliac vessels in their entire length, as well as evaluating any arcane lesions to the coronary arteries, thus providing more information about the patient&#x02019;s possible risks &#x02013; this however requires additional research.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>AAA</term><def><p>Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AP</term><def><p>Anterior-Posterior</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CVD</term><def><p>Cardiovascular disease</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DANCAVAS</term><def><p>The randomized Danish CardioVascular Screening trial</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IAD</term><def><p>Infrarenal aortic diameter</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>nCT</term><def><p>Non-contrast-enhanced computed tomography</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>US</term><def><p>Ultrasound</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Jannie L.
