Specifically, it is suggested that the traditional interview format is too loose and not structured enough to obtain data that are valid and similar across the different raters involved in a clinical trial (Kobak et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2007</xref>; Engelhardt et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2006</xref>).</p><p>Furthermore, it is suggested that the interview technique of a single rater may vary from interview to interview throughout a trial. Kobak et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2007</xref>) and Engelhardt et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2006</xref>) suggest that raters in antidepressant clinical trials are therefore prone to low levels of reliability. Also, there may be rater bias of inflating the entry scores to make depressed patients eligible to enter into a trial.</p><p>The idea that an increase in the reliability of ratings may enhance antidepressant-placebo differences (Lipsitz et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2004</xref>) was supported in a retrospective study by Cogger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2007</xref>). He evaluated the quality of a subsample of taped interviews from a paroxetine trial and noted that the effect size between antidepressant and placebo was much larger if the interviewers adhered to a specific format, asked the same questions, and took adequate time to get the best answers.</p><p>Based in part on the concept that the reliability of ratings in antidepressant trials could affect outcome, a few modifications in the conduct of recent antidepressant clinical trials were suggested: &#x0201c;rating the raters&#x0201d; (Engelhardt et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2006</xref>), Rater Applied Performance Scale (RAPS) appraisal (Lipsitz et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2004</xref>), and a Structured Interview Guide for the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (SIGMA; MADRS) (Williams and Kobak <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2008</xref>; Montgomery and Asberg <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">1979</xref>). Audiotaping or videotaping interviews that are conducted either remotely (central raters) or at the investigative site (local raters) have been used to verify adherence to the modified interview formats.</p><p>Kobak et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2010</xref>) reported that the &#x0201c;central raters&#x0201d; trained in these structured interview techniques noted a lower magnitude of placebo response compared to the &#x0201c;local raters&#x0201d; who conducted interviews in person at the trial site. The authors attributed this difference in outcome to more reliable ratings by the &#x0201c;central raters.&#x0201d; However, three recent reports have challenged the concept that rating interview modifications have the intended effect of increasing antidepressant-placebo differences.</p><p>Oren et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2008</xref>) reported results from a trial of an investigational medication versus escitalopram and placebo using centralized raters who determined patient eligibility and assessed the primary outcome measure. The trial reported by Oren et al. used raters who were not based at the study site, who remotely interviewed patients via a video screen. The remote raters were unaware of the stage of the study the patient was in and the raters changed for each visit. These modifications were done to achieve uniformity of ratings, enhance reliability of ratings, and minimize rater bias. The authors reported no significant difference in outcome between placebo and escitalopram, and the results for the investigational medication were significantly worse than for placebo (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.04).</p><p>More recently, Targum et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2013</xref>) reported results from a study evaluating trial outcome differences based on the method of rating: &#x0201c;central raters&#x0201d; that conducted interviews via a videoconference interview versus local site raters. A significant difference indicating superiority of combination (buspirone plus melatonin) treatment versus placebo was reported on the IDSc30 (Rush <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2000</xref>) for the site-based ratings (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.030), whereas the centralized ratings did not detect this difference (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.124) (details reported in Table 3 of the Targum et al. publication).</p><p>Lastly, Khan et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2014</xref>) evaluated outcome of three clinical trials that used SIGMA interview ratings that were audiotaped and were either conducted or appraised remotely versus four clinical trials that used traditional semi-structured MADRS interviews. Our primary focus was on the outcome with the placebo groups because not all of the agents were approved for the treatment of depression by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). We found a larger magnitude of change in the placebo group among trials that used taped SIGMA interviews with remote scoring or appraisal, and we also found significantly more variability in the outcome with placebo in the subset of trials using these newer interview methods.</p><p>Given this background, we undertook the current study to further assess the effect of rating interview format on clinical trial results. We systematically reviewed data from the antidepressant and placebo arms of four of the antidepressant clinical trials that were included in our previous study. All of the trials used antidepressants that have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration.</p><p>Most importantly, the trials were all conducted by the same pharmaceutical company and all used similar clinical trial design. The primary difference in the conduct of the trials was that two of the four trials used SIGMA interviews that were taped to obtain MADRS ratings and the ratings from these trials were subject to outside RAPS appraisal, whereas the other two trials used traditional semi-structured MADRS interviews. The choice of the evaluation method was randomly chosen by the sponsoring company. Our evaluation focused on the outcome in the antidepressant and placebo arms in each subset of trials.</p><p>We hypothesized that the antidepressants trials that used the newer patient evaluation techniques would result in a lower magnitude of differences between antidepressants and placebo compared to the traditional patient interview techniques. Furthermore, we hypothesized that such a difference would be related to the magnitude of change among depressed patients assigned to placebo.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Background</title><p>Of the 12 antidepressant trials conducted at the Northwest Clinical Research Center (NWCRC) between 2009 and 2011, only four were suitable for the current study. The other eight trials included investigational antidepressants that have not been approved or enrolled depressed patients who were treatment-resistant. The other trials conducted at NWCRC during this time were therefore not suitable for inclusion in the study.</p><p>All of the four included trials were sponsored by the same pharmaceutical company with nearly identical study design aside from the interview method. For two of the trials, the sponsoring company randomly chose to use interview modifications including site-based SIGMA interviews that were audiotaped and appraised for RAPS adherence by outside interview monitors. The other two trials were conducted using the traditional method of interviews to obtain data for MADRS scores. The NWCRC had no input as to which method was used by the company.</p><p>Although the subset of trials that used taped SIGMA interviews with outside RAPS appraisal used newer rating methods, the site-based raters that conducted the ratings were the same for each subset of trials. Each of the site-based raters had more than 2&#x000a0;years of experience participating in clinical trials, and the raters each had a Master&#x02019;s Degree in Clinical Psychology or related field. All of the site raters also completed the study-specific rater training for each study in which they participated.</p><p>Of the four trials included in our study, three of the trials evaluated the recently approved agent levomilnacipran and one of the trials was a placebo-controlled phase IV study of vilazodone which was approved in 2011. The SIGMA interviews that were taped with outside RAPS appraisal were used during two of the levomilnacipran trials, and traditional semi-structured MADRS rating methods were used in the third levomilnacipran trial and the vilazodone trial.</p><p>The primary outcome variable for each of the trials was the change in MADRS score from baseline to final visit based on the depression scale scores of the site-based raters. The central appraisal was done post hoc and the appraisals were issued shortly after the site-based ratings were completed to encourage conformity with SIGMA style throughout the trials.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Characteristics of the trials and demographics of the patients</title><p>The fact that clinical trial design characteristics are associated with clinical trial outcome is well documented. Factors such as the baseline severity of depression (Joyce and Paykel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">1989</xref>; Khan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2002</xref>) are associated with the trial outcome and may influence the proportion of patients that qualify for a trial. A lower probability of being assigned to placebo may increase patient expectations for improvement, resulting in a higher placebo response (Papakostas and Fava <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2009</xref>; Rutherford et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2009</xref>; Sinyor et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2010</xref>).</p><p>We therefore critically evaluated the trial characteristics and patient demographics of the trials using the taped SIGMA interviews with RAPS appraisals as compared to the trials using the traditional semi-structured MADRS interviews prior to comparing outcome of the trials. Each of the trials recruited and enrolled patients diagnosed with major depressive disorder. Patients diagnosed with treatment-resistant depression defined as a failure of two adequate antidepressant treatment trials during their lifetime were excluded from each of the four trials.</p><p>All four trials used a randomized, parallel group, double-blind, placebo-controlled design. The visitation schedule was also identical among the four trial including a pre-randomization (&#x0201c;baseline&#x0201d;) visit as well as visits at weeks 1, 2, 4, and 6 with the final MADRS rating being assessed at the week 8 visit. As shown in Table 1, all of the trials were of 8&#x000a0;weeks duration. A similar number of patients were screened for study enrollment in trials using the different rating methods (taped SIGMA interview trials with RAPS appraisal, <italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;120; traditional semi-structured MADRS interview trials, <italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;123). Of the patients that presented for screening, there were no significant differences in age, sex, or racial characteristics between the two groups of trials.</p><p>However, there were some significant differences in the two sets of trials as described below. The two trials using the SIGMA interviews that were audiotaped and appraised had a higher entry criterion for pre-randomization severity of depression symptoms at the time of randomization. These two trials required the total MADRS score to be 30 or higher, whereas the two trials using the traditional interview techniques required the total MADRS score to be 26 or higher.</p><p>The screen fail rate of 48&#x000a0;% was significantly higher in trials using taped SIGMA interviews with outside RAPS appraisal compared to the screen fail rate of 31&#x000a0;% in the trials using traditional semi-structured interviews (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001). This resulted in fewer patients being enrolled in the trials using the newer interview methods (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;63) compared to the trials using the traditional interview methods (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;85).</p><p>The higher pre-randomization score requirement was also likely related to the higher MADRS scores of patients enrolled in the SIGMA trials (<italic>M</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;37&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;4) as compared to those enrolled in the trials using traditional semi-structured MADRS interview methods (<italic>M</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;32&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;3; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.008). Lastly, the placebo risk was not significantly different in the two types of study as shown in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. Of the patients enrolled in the trials using SIGMA interviews, 22 were assigned to placebo and 41 were assigned to antidepressants (35&#x000a0;% chance of receiving placebo). Of the trials conducted using traditional interviews, 37 were assigned to placebo and 48 were assigned to antidepressants (44&#x000a0;% chance of receiving placebo).<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>

We therefore considered it appropriate to control for the baseline severity of depression by entering it as a covariate in all of our analyses.

All of the analyses included only data from depressed patients who participated at a single site (NWCRC) as part of the four large multicenter trials.</p><p>Our finding supported our hypothesis that the antidepressants using the newer interview techniques would have a lower magnitude of antidepressant-placebo differences, largely due to a larger magnitude of change with placebo rather than magnitude of change with antidepressants. This finding further supports our earlier finding (Khan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2014</xref>). Our study is the first to evaluate how the structured interview methods with taping of the patients and outside appraisal of the clinical trial raters may actually impact outcome of pivotal antidepressant trials as the only antidepressants that were evaluated in our study have been shown to be effective in multiple antidepressant clinical trials that have undergone FDA review.</p><p>These results are consistent with the results of the Oren et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2008</xref>) trial and those of Targum et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2013</xref>) who both reported negative findings in trials using some of the recently introduced methods of rating in antidepressant clinical trials. Oren et al. found that central raters were unable to distinguish antidepressants from escitalopram in a trial of an investigational antidepressant that has yet to be approved, whereas Targum et al. reported that the site raters were able to detect a difference in combination therapy versus placebo that the centrally based raters could not detect.</p><p>On the other hand, our findings do not support the findings of Cogger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2007</xref>) or Kobak et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2010</xref>) among the published trials that have used modified interview techniques of different varieties to increase the reliability of depression ratings. In other words, although it is implied that greater reliability and homogeneity of ratings will result in a better outcome, we found that newer techniques resulted in a larger and more variable placebo response in pivotal approval trials that were part of drug development programs.</p><p>In this context, it is important to note that in the past 5&#x000a0;years far more trials than the four included in our study have used various modifications to depression interview techniques. These modifications replace the traditional semi-structured MADRS interviews with methods including SIGMA, both central and local raters, or just central raters, and either audio- or videotaping. The data from the majority of these trials have not been systematically presented or published. Given this fact, the results of our study cannot be considered definitive until the data from these trials are fully available in the public domain. Also, our study does not evaluate the role of centralized ratings compared to site ratings.</p><p>In trying to understand our finding, we asked several raters and patients about their rating experiences. In describing her experience with the structured and appraised interviews, one rater said, &#x0201c;You are aware that your adherences to the exact language of the form as well as your assessment skills are being monitored. Of course, the interviewer begins to focus more on the details of the interview form and her own performance and attention is less available to focus on the patient. What is lost is the level of information that comes from a more global perception of the patient presentation, including non-verbal cues.&#x0201d;</p><p>Another rater had this to say about the SIGMA ratings with audiotaping and RAPS appraisal, &#x0201c;These are question and answer sessions and do not get into an in-depth exploration of the patient&#x02019;s world that is unique to the individual. Also, I feel that patients feel that they are being scrutinized for good behavior and have to present themselves in the best light and are reluctant to criticize their experience. Simply put the patients become actors and seem to perform for the ratings.&#x0201d;</p><p>As a rule, patients were reluctant to sign up for the taped sessions and expressed preference for studies not requiring audiotaping. As one patient said, &#x0201c;I feel like big brother is watching and I have to behave myself&#x0201d;. At the end of taped sessions several patients made statements like, &#x0201c;the tape is off, right? Now, we can talk about anything I want, right?&#x0201d;</p><p>An additional incongruent fact in our study was that unlike the case in many previous studies, severity of pre-randomization depressive symptoms did not influence the outcome of the trial (Joyce and Paykel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">1989</xref>; Khan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2005</xref>). The antidepressant trials using the SIGMA interview technique, audiotaping, and RAPS review had higher pre-randomization scores, but a smaller magnitude of antidepressant-placebo differences.</p><p>These data raise concern about modifying standard psychiatric interview techniques and trial designs based on ideas that may have face validity, but have not been tested. This is a common practice in depression trials, and it may have led to many instances of type II errors. Specifically, if only modified interview formats had been used, it is possible that neither vilazodone nor levomilnacipran would have been approved by the US FDA. Thus, the recently suggested potpourri of antidepressant clinical trial design modifications should only be implemented if sufficient prospective data exist.</p><p>In conclusion, the recently suggested modifications in obtaining clinical data in antidepressant trials such as SIGMA interviews that are taped with ratings appraised by RAPS feedback may in fact result in a higher magnitude of placebo response and a lower magnitude of antidepressant-placebo differences compared to the traditional methods of collecting clinical data. These results were unexpected and indicate the necessity to test new methods prospectively, no matter how intuitively sensible they seem, prior to their implementation. Thus, caution is warranted in how clinicians interpret data from failed or negative antidepressant clinical trials.</p></sec></body><back><ack><sec id="d30e1239"><title>Conflict of interest</title><p>None of the authors have a conflict of interest to declare.
