With these challenges in mind, the GRADE working group initiated the Developing and Evaluating Communication Strategies to Support Informed Decisions and Practice Based on Evidence (DECIDE) project.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> DECIDE aimed to improve dissemination of evidence-based recommendations for a range of stakeholders, including healthcare professionals, policymakers and patients, as well as to ensure and facilitate adherence to trustworthy guideline standards.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4&#x02013;6</xref></p><p>As detailed in articles by Treweek <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> and Kristiansen <italic>et al</italic>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> a multidisciplinary group of clinicians, guideline developers, methodologists and graphical designers developed a multilayered guideline presentation format (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2016011569F1">figure 1</xref>A, B) targeted at healthcare professionals. We hypothesised that clinicians' apparent discomfort with more complex methodological concepts could be alleviated with proper education and an optimal user interface. Based on the groups&#x02019; extensive experience from clinical practice and guideline development and informed by a narrative review of guideline formats, we designed a prototype presentation format through brainstorming sessions.

We included practicing physicians in internal or family medicine. In order to recruit representative samples of internal medicine physicians, investigators targeted compulsory educational sessions at teaching hospitals. Two facilities recruited general practitioners in family medicine. One by targeting a compulsory educational session at a larger family practice centre (Spain), the other by inviting individual physicians, including general practitioners, to a specific CLICK-IT study session (NICE, UK). All participants attended a standardised educational session on key guideline standards performed within the context of this study. We performed four pilot sessions and made revisions to the survey questions based on experiences in these sessions. The revisions were minor and concerned mainly phrasing of the questions asked. Our reported primary and secondary outcomes are in accordance with the original study protocol.</p><p>Participants were considered to provide consent by accepting to answer the survey questions.</p><sec id="s2a1"><title>Standardised lecture and study procedure</title><p>At each site, a member of the research team delivered a standardised lecture according to a predefined protocol. The lecture was titled &#x02018;New standards for trustworthy guidelines&#x02019; (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">supplementary appendix</xref> 1) and was given in power point on a standard projector screen. Participants provided anonymous answers to questions with predefined response categories using clickers. The questions (both for the survey and the randomised part of the trial)&#x02014;as well as screenshots of presentation formats&#x02014;were embedded in the lecture slides using an audience response software, TurningPoint, and read out loud by the presenter. For the Norwegian and Spanish sites we translated the presentation to their native language; while in Lebanon and the UK the questions were presented in English, which is commonly used in medical education.</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SM1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/bmjopen-2016-011569.supp1</object-id><label>Supplementary appendix</label><p><inline-supplementary-material id="ss1" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2016-011569supp_appendix.pdf" content-type="local-data"/></p></supplementary-material><p>The lecture and study procedure were developed by the investigators and included the following components:

The presenter handed out the clickers to the participants, randomly and with the front-side up, thus concealing the allocation marking for both presenter and participant. The participants were not informed that the marking was part of the group allocation until the survey part of the lecture was completed, and they had no opportunity to swap clickers during the lecture. Participants with marked clickers were randomised to group B, being presented the multilayered format. We asked participants in either group to put on blindfolds while participants in the other group were shown their allocated presentation format and answered questions. Questions during randomisation were not read out loud, only the group not wearing blindfolds at the time answered the questions. The presenters watched while the participants put on blindfolds, making sure they adhered to their allocated group.</p></sec><sec id="s2b2"><title>Outcome measures</title><p>Our primary outcome was preference for either presentation format.

A majority of the physicians (82%) also reported absolute effect estimates provided in the multilayered format evidence summaries to be helpful or crucial for decision-making. Conceptual understanding of the strength of recommendations and quality of evidence was limited when expressed through numbers and letters&#x02014;as carried out in the standard format example from UpToDate. A short explanation of these concepts according to the GRADE system substantially increased reported understanding.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Strengths and weaknesses</title><p>We enlisted a substantial and diverse set of practising physicians across six different countries, targeting mandatory educational sessions, making our participant sample representative of the everyday clinician and our results generalisable. We mapped understanding of both key methodological concepts and preference for entire guideline formats, as opposed to single elements. We devised a clinical scenario with a highly prevalent disease (atrial fibrillation), in which there have been recent treatment innovations (DOACs), possibly not commonly known to all physicians when this study was conducted. Through this manoeuvre, we limited the possible bias of previous knowledge on the participants' performance. We targeted internists and family physicians as participants given their familiarity with atrial fibrillation.</p><p>There are limitations to the chosen study design. First, devising multiple-choice questions that accurately test key outcomes such as understanding is challenging. Our approaches, including subjectively perceived understanding and anticipated clinical action are less satisfactory than detailed testing of understanding. Actual understanding may be less than what our results suggest, and the correct clinical choice of action may have been highly influenced by previous knowledge on the subject. A substantial proportion of physicians reported to &#x02018;somewhat agree&#x02019; rather than agree or strongly agree with statements concerning usefulness of recommendations and evidence summaries in clinical practice guidelines. This finding highlights some limitations of our study related to using a hypothetical scenario&#x02014;rather than assessing real life decision-making&#x02014;and the challenge of phrasing questions and devising appropriate response categories within this field of research. Finally, as we have only tested one specific clinical scenario on a limited representation of healthcare professionals, the transferability of our findings to other settings and professional groups needs further validation.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Implications for practice and research</title><p>The finding that the majority of clinicians preferred to be informed about the absolute effects on patient-important outcomes in evidence summaries is encouraging, as numeracy among healthcare professionals is highly variable and many guidelines omit contextualised effect estimates necessary for shared decision-making.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19&#x02013;21</xref> GRADE Summary of findings tables&#x02014;as displayed in the multilayered guideline formats&#x02014;have emerged as user-friendly and well accepted formats in the context of systematic reviews, with recent advances in formatting resulting in further increasing understanding.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>
<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></p><p>About 40% of the participants stated that they fully understood the difference between strong and weak recommendations, but only 13% could correctly recognise a weak recommendation applying the commonly used numbered labelling (1=strong, 2=weak). However, when given recommendation and evidence summary linked to a clinical scenario 95% of participants would treat according to current guidelines. There are thus two reasons for optimism: Most participants correctly interpreted the intent and meaning of the recommendations when communicated within a larger context. Furthermore, perceived understanding improved after being presented a one slide explanation on the meaning of key concepts.</p><p>We did not explore in detail why participants preferred the new DECIDE multilayered format. However, informed by feedback throughout the design process from stakeholders as well as informal discussions following the survey, clinicians seem to appreciate short and clear advice, provision of strength that is easy to interpret and details on the key factors that drove the recommendations, which is provided within the multilayered format.</p><p>Optimised guideline presentation formats and sufficient conceptual understanding can potentially facilitate the uptake of trustworthy guidelines and application of research evidence in practice.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>
<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> The multilayered format serves several purposes: It is devised around the GRADE framework and thus directs guideline authors through the appropriate methodological steps. It provides end-user clinicians with actionable, graded recommendations, as advocated by the Institute of Medicine.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Finally, having the guideline digitally structured facilitates easy translation into several outputs; such as decision aids, clinical decision support systems within the electronic medical record, tablets, smartphones, online and as PDFs. It also facilitates continuous updating and adaptation to local settings,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> thereby minimising the workload for guideline developers and policymakers.</p><p>Further research into different ways of communicating key guideline concepts to healthcare professionals to improve understanding and adoption is still necessary. The multilayered guideline presentation formats are currently implemented in a handful of published guidelines from a variety of organisations, and more are under development. We are continuously performing usability testing, both with authors and end-users, informing further improvements.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Clinicians prefer a novel multilayered presentation format to the standard format.
