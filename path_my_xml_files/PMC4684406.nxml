In attempts to reduce smoking-related mortality, graphic warning labels on cigarette packaging are now required in 77 countries [<xref rid="pone.0142879.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and were mandated in the US in 2009. However, the DC Circuit Court, a US judicial body that has the authority to invalidate laws it deems unconstitutional, blocked the graphic warning requirement, concluding in part that the images proposed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) were unconstitutional and &#x0201c;unabashed attempts to evoke emotion&#x02026;and browbeat consumers into quitting&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pone.0142879.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. An earlier 2011 memorandum predicted this later ruling: &#x0201c;the emotional response they were crafted to induce is &#x02026; an objective wholly apart from disseminating purely factual and uncontroversial information&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pone.0142879.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The aim of the present paper is to examine this statement in light of psychological theory about the effects of emotion on risk perception and informed decision making (from here on, we use the terms emotion, feelings, and affect interchangeably). In particular, we consider the negative affect elicited by graphic warnings to be an important source of health information and driver of cognitive processes critical to informed decisions among smokers. This paper presents data from a randomized clinical trial that is consistent with this notion.</p><p>Experimental research aligns with the court&#x02019;s assertion that graphic warning labels evoke more negative emotion than text-only labels; these negative feelings also generalize to smoking-related cues (e.g., images of cigarettes) [<xref rid="pone.0142879.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142879.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142879.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Despite the Court&#x02019;s assertion, such emotional reactions to danger have been shown critical to the quick perception and reaction to risk that has been necessary for avoiding health and other hazards across human evolutionary history [<xref rid="pone.0142879.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. These emotions can influence behavior directly, motivating us to engage in pleasant, rewarding behaviors and avoid unpleasant, potentially dangerous activities [<xref rid="pone.0142879.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Affect also acts as an important source of information, informing us whether the water is safe to drink or it&#x02019;s okay to enter a dark alley (via an Affect Heuristic). In other words, affective responses can serve as simple cues or heuristics enabling people to skirt hazards quickly and efficiently [<xref rid="pone.0142879.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142879.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. These are important ways that graphic warning labels may assist smokers, most of whom want to quit and/or wish they had never started smoking [<xref rid="pone.0142879.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Affect, thus, serves multiple functions in risk perception and decision processes [<xref rid="pone.0142879.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142879.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. This line of research also points towards affect influencing perceptions of health risks by motivating people to think more carefully about the risks [<xref rid="pone.0142879.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Peters [<xref rid="pone.0142879.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], for example, proposed that affect plays a role as a spotlight in a two-step process. First, enhanced affective feelings (e.g., those aroused by graphic warnings in the present study) encourage the decision maker to focus on new information consistent with those feelings (in this case, the risk information). Second, the new information (rather than the initial feelings) is used to guide further judgments and decisions. Thus, we expect affect-laden graphic warnings to highlight health-risk information, promote greater processing and acceptance of it, and, in turn, increase smoking risk perceptions and quit considerations. Consistent with this, graphic warnings have been shown to elicit increased evaluations of warning credibility that may encourage quitting [<xref rid="pone.0142879.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Such cognitions are important because evaluations formed from carefully thinking about information last even longer [<xref rid="pone.0142879.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and are even more predictive of behavior [<xref rid="pone.0142879.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142879.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142879.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Understanding the processes through which affect influences risk perceptions and quit intentions among smokers represents the primary objective of the current research.</p><p>We further predicted that smokers given graphic warnings would remember more health information from them than those given text-only warnings. Graphic images contain more detailed information than is available in brief textual warnings. For example, showing an image of advanced oral cancer on the lip of a person who also has diseased teeth and gums says more to the smoker than simply saying &#x0201c;cigarettes cause cancer.&#x0201d; In addition, our hypothesis has a basis in past research showing that affective arousal increases memory for associated information [<xref rid="pone.0142879.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142879.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142879.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Consistent with both lines of thought, survey research shows that smokers in countries with graphic warning labels can identify more smoking risks than smokers in countries with text-only warnings [<xref rid="pone.0142879.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142879.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Improving our understanding of how graphic warning labels influence smokers&#x02019; risk knowledge represents an important secondary objective of this trial.</p><p>In addition to images, another label component that can influence the perceived credibility of warnings is the addition of text that elaborates on the risk information in the warnings. Emery et al. [<xref rid="pone.0142879.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] found that elaborated risk information (similar to that used in Canada) increased perceived warning credibility, which decreased smoking desires. Because smokers do not appreciate the cumulative risks associated with smoking [<xref rid="pone.0142879.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], we designed elaborative text that emphasized the additional risk that each cigarette posed to the smoker. Whether messages emphasizing cumulative risks would be compelling to regular smokers (and especially smokers not intending to quit) was not clear. We anticipated that, consistent with past research showing the superiority of elaborated text [<xref rid="pone.0142879.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], such messages would enhance warning credibility, an effect that would indirectly influence risk perceptions and quit intentions.</p><p>A recent meta-analysis of 37 laboratory-based experimental studies concluded that one-time exposure to graphic vs. text-only warning labels leads to heightened quit intentions among smokers [<xref rid="pone.0142879.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. However, a naturalistic experiment is a key addition to this literature because, compared to single-exposure studies, the experience of a pack-a-day smoker is likely much different, with 600 potential exposures to graphic warnings on cigarette packs per month. It seems unlikely that the first label response would be the same as the 599<sup>th</sup>. In particular, the effects of graphic images on negative affect towards smoking may be short-lived as smokers could avoid the warnings or habituate to them over time [<xref rid="pone.0142879.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142879.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. If true, graphic warnings will lose efficacy over time. However, we anticipated that their emotional impact would change smokers&#x02019; feelings about their habit and motivate greater processing of risk information [<xref rid="pone.0142879.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], leaving the smoker with enhanced knowledge and heightened risk perceptions even after the immediate emotions waned. The present study, to our knowledge, is the first to randomly assign smokers to receive graphic vs. text-only warnings on their cigarette packs over a relatively long duration (four weeks).</p><p>We conducted a randomized clinical trial to experimentally study smokers in a naturalistic setting in order to test causal claims based on longer term exposures than past experiments. We compared three conditions: text-only using the nine Congressionally-mandated messages; mandated text plus FDA-proposed images [<xref rid="pone.0142879.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]; and elaborated text combined with the mandated messages and proposed images. Consistent with past research [<xref rid="pone.0142879.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142879.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142879.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], we tested our hypotheses using mediated models with affect, risk scrutiny, perceived credibility, and label memory as mediators of warning label effects on risk perception, quit intentions, and risk knowledge. We tested the following hypotheses:</p><p>Hypothesis 1a (H1a): Graphic warning labels will cause greater negative affect toward smoking among adult smokers, an effect that will indirectly motivate action by increasing quit intentions and serve as information about the dangers of smoking by increasing risk perceptions.</p><p>Hypothesis 1b (H1b): The negative affect created by graphic images will enhance the credibility of the warnings by increasing scrutiny of the warning information, an effect that will indirectly increase risk perceptions and quit intentions.</p><p>Hypothesis 2 (H2): Elaborative text will increase the credibility of the warning message, an effect that will also indirectly increase risk perceptions and quit intentions.</p><p>Hypothesis 3 (H3). Graphic warning labels will enhance recall of warning information, an effect that will be explained in part by negative affect elicited by the graphic labels. This greater label memory will indirectly increase participants&#x02019; knowledge of smoking risks at the end of the trial and at post-trial follow-up.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec007"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>The protocol for this trial and CONSORT checklist are available as supplemental information; see <xref rid="pone.0142879.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Protocol</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0142879.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Checklist</xref>.

The investigation was approved by the University of Pennsylvania Institutional Review Board (IRB), which served as the IRB of record for this trial. Prior to participation, all participants provided written consent by signing an IRB approved document indicating that they understood the trial protocol and agreed to participate. In addition to receiving cigarettes in experimental packaging at no cost, participants were paid up to $235 for completing the full trial and adhering to all elements of the protocol. No adverse events occurred during the trial.</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Participants and procedure</title><p>Sample size was determined by power analysis using G*Power [<xref rid="pone.0142879.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], see <xref rid="pone.0142879.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Protocol</xref>. Our primary outcome of interest in this trial was quit intentions. Based on past experimental investigations exploring the impact of graphic warning labels on quit intentions [<xref rid="pone.0142879.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], we predicted an effect size of .35. Sample size estimates were calculated for 80% power and a two-tailed alpha of .05. After collapsing from 5 to 3 conditions as described below, we estimated that we would need 260 participants to identify a direct effect of graphic vs text-only warnings condition on quit intentions using unadjusted analysis of variance (ANOVA).</p><p>Study participants were 293 adult smokers (<italic>M</italic>
<sub>Age</sub> = 33.68, <italic>SD</italic> = 11.56, 45% female) recruited through fliers and ads placed on social media websites in Columbus, OH (N = 145) and Philadelphia, PA (N = 148). Recruitment was conducted from January 2013 and February 2014. All follow-up was completed by April, 2014. An initial phone screening was used to exclude individuals who smoked &#x0003c;5 cigarettes or &#x0003e;two packs per day, reported being <italic>likely</italic> or <italic>very likely</italic> to quit smoking in the next 30 days, had a contra-indicated medical condition (e.g., pregnancy), were currently being treated for a psychiatric condition or who reported a history of substance abuse. Complete inclusion and exclusion criteria can be found in <xref rid="pone.0142879.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Protocol</xref>. Most participants identified themselves as being White (62%), 31% as Black, and 5% as more than one race. Remaining participants identified as American Indian (<italic>n</italic> = 3), Asian (<italic>n</italic> = 2) or &#x0201c;other&#x0201d; (<italic>n</italic> = 1). Participants reported smoking an average of 16.99 (<italic>SD</italic> = 7.87) cigarettes per day, and they reported having been a smoker for 17.14 (<italic>SD</italic> = 12.04) years. Nicotine dependence was assessed by the Fagerstr&#x000f6;m Test of Nicotine Dependence [<xref rid="pone.0142879.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The mean score was 4.37 (<italic>SD</italic> = 1.78) indicating moderate dependence, which was biochemically supported by breath carbon monoxide (CO) sample at intake (<italic>M</italic> = 17.93 ppm, <italic>SD</italic> = 10.63)[<xref rid="pone.0142879.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>Participants were stratified on the basis of gender, amount smoked, and quit intentions, then randomly assigned to conditions by research assistants. The randomization scheme was generated by an individual who did not interact with participants. The protocol was open label; thus no attempts at blinding were made for experimenters or participants. No differences existed between conditions on demographic characteristics or baseline smoking behaviors at randomization (see <xref rid="pone.0142879.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>). Depending on their assigned experimental condition, participants received their own brand of cigarettes with packages modified by text-only warning labels, graphic warning labels, or graphic warning labels that included elaborated text. Early participants (n = 117) were randomized to one of 5 conditions at a 1:1:1:1:1 ratio. The presence vs. absence of a quitline number was manipulated in conditions with images. No participant ever called the quitline. Thus, the quitline number was dropped and participants who had been exposed the quitline number were analyzed as members of the parent condition (graphic or elaborated). This change in the protocol, which was approved by the funding agencies, enabled us to recalculate the power analysis and recruit fewer participants (see <xref rid="pone.0142879.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Protocol</xref>). For the remainder of the study, participants were randomly assigned to one of the three experimental conditions. The randomization scheme was adjusted to increase the likelihood that later participants would be included in the text-only condition, resulting in a 1:1:1 ratio across conditions for the study.</p><p>Participants returned to the lab each week to receive additional cigarettes and respond to surveys about their experiences with the new packaging. Participants returned any unused cigarettes from the prior week at each appointment. To reduce possible demand characteristics from exposure to cigarette packages, they completed all dependent measures at a private computer work station with no cigarette packages within sight. At the same time, a research assistant prepared cigarettes for the next week in an adjoining room. Retention was high at the end of the trial (84.6%). At that time, participants completed key dependent measures on a computer. About one month later, experimenters were able to contact most participants (60.8%) by phone for a voluntary follow-up survey, <xref rid="pone.0142879.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>.

Participants in the elaborated text condition received packs with warnings covering the same package space; these labels included the same text and images plus additional text describing how every cigarette entails risk (e.g., &#x0201c;Every cigarette you smoke increases your risk of crippling, often fatal, lung diseases such as emphysema.&#x0201d;).

Four independent coders evaluated responses for evidence of the presence of memory for the components of each label (basic text/images/ elaborated text). Although lung cancer and throat cancer were not mentioned explicitly on the warning labels, participants often inferred these illnesses from information on the labels. Thus, any mention of lung or throat cancer was included as memory for label content, but was not classified as memory for any specific label element. This resulted in a total possible score of 29. Inter-rater reliability was established for memory of each label component (mean Krippendorff&#x02019;s &#x003b1; = .95) and the number of components recalled (Krippendorff&#x02019;s &#x003b1; = .96).</p></sec><sec id="sec020"><title>Smoking risk knowledge</title><p>Participants&#x02019; knowledge of smoking-related illnesses also was measured through a free response task at the end of the trial.

Participants responded to the item &#x0201c;What are some diseases you&#x02019;ve heard about that can be related to tobacco use?&#x0201d; Participants were given a large text box in which to enter as many diseases as they could think of. Two independent coders examined these responses and coded for any mention of 29 different smoking-related health risks. Responses were coded for widely known smoking-related illnesses (e.g., lung cancer; heart disease) and less widely known risks (e.g., breast cancer; joint problems). Inter-rater reliability was high (Krippendorff&#x02019;s &#x003b1; = 1.00).

We also used unadjusted one-way ANOVAs to investigate the possibility that participant exposure to the warning information might have differed as a function of experimental condition and that warning label exposure may have had direct effects on key outcome variables.</p><p>Consistent with an intention to treat analysis strategy, available data for participants who completed the trial were analyzed as if they had complied with the intervention condition to which they were randomly assigned, regardless of compliance with the experimental protocol. All analyses were conducted after the end of the trial and follow-up data collection. To test hypotheses about the indirect (mediated) effects of exposure to graphic warning labels, we used structural equation modeling (SEM). Analyses were conducted using MPlus Version 7 [<xref rid="pone.0142879.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. We created two orthogonal contrast-coded predictors to represent the effects of the two warning conditions. One predictor contrasted the two graphic conditions (coded as 1) versus text-only warnings (coded as -2). The other contrasted the elaborated text condition (coded as 1) versus the graphic-only condition (coded as -1), with the text-only condition coded as 0. We used these contrast codes to fit models based on our theoretically derived predictions about the indirect effects of graphic warning labels on risk perceptions, quit intentions, and smoking risk knowledge. In the structural equation models, a pairwise present approach was taken to handling missing data for participants who completed the trial. This approach uses all available data about variable relationships in estimating model parameters.</p><p>To assess the possibility that non-normal distribution could influence results, all analyses were first conducted using maximum likelihood estimation with robust standard errors, an approach to structural equation modeling that is robust to non-normally distributed data [<xref rid="pone.0142879.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Modification indices were used to identify plausible paths not predicted by our theoretical framework. Satorra-Bentler scaled &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> comparison tests were computed to compare nested models [<xref rid="pone.0142879.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Models which evidenced acceptable fit were recalculated using bootstrap resampling. We used several different indices to determine the fit of each structural equation model including the normed &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> and the relative &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> [<xref rid="pone.0142879.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. A non-significant &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> and a relative &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> of less than 2 indicate good model fit [<xref rid="pone.0142879.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. We also report the root mean squared error of approximation (RMSEA). RMSEA values below .05 are considered to indicate that the model fits the data well [<xref rid="pone.0142879.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Finally, we report the Comparative Fit Index (CFI), and the Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI). CFI and TLI values above .95 are considered indicators of good model fit [<xref rid="pone.0142879.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. For the purpose of comparing non-nested models, we also report the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and Bayesian information criterion (BIC). The significance of indirect (mediated) effects was assessed by using bootstrap re-sampling procedures, which used 5,000 random samples drawn from the existing data with replacement to generate bias-corrected confidence intervals for each indirect effect [<xref rid="pone.0142879.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Confidence intervals which do not contain zero indicate a significant indirect effect. Bootstrap resampling is well suited to estimating indirect effects in multiple mediator models because confidence intervals are based on the sampling distribution of the indirect effect rather than an assumed normal sampling distribution [<xref rid="pone.0142879.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142879.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].</p><p>To address the possibility that differential attrition based on demographic characteristics or smoking behavior might bias our results, we used logistic regressions and &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> tests to compare the characteristics of participants randomized to experimental conditions who did vs. did not complete the trial. Individual differences that were related to attrition were used to create imputation models from which we imputed missing data and retested each of our hypotheses. To do so, we created ten data sets using multiple imputation with chained equations (MICE) in Stata version 12 [<xref rid="pone.0142879.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Structural equation models were then calculated from the imputed data sets using the MPlus multiple imputation analysis procedures.</p><p>Finally, to further assess the validity of our theoretically derived model described in hypotheses 1 and 2, we also tested the fit of the data to two plausible alternative models and report their fit statistics. We compared the fit of the data to these models to the fit of the data in our hypothesized model using the AIC and BIC.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec022"><title>Results</title><p>In our primary analyses, participants who did not complete the week six appointment were excluded from analyses (n = 45). Retention did not differ as a function of experimental condition. Four additional participants were excluded from analyses (two were hospitalized for mental illness during the trial, one was diagnosed with a possible smoking-related illness during the trial, and one reported intoxication during lab sessions), leaving 244 participants at week 6. Follow-up data were excluded for one additional participant who was diagnosed with a possible smoking related illness after completing the trial.

<sub>Diff</sub> = 78.57, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; .001). Thus, a two factor measurement model was appropriate for tests of Hypotheses 1 and 2. We predicted that the presence of graphic images would increase negative affect toward smoking, which would increase risk perceptions and quit intentions directly and indirectly by encouraging smokers to think about and form favorable evaluations of the risk information warnings provided. A model testing these predictions using maximum likelihood estimation with robust standard errors fit the data well (&#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>[59] = 65.59, <italic>p</italic> = .259, relative &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> = 1.11, RMSEA = .02 [CI 90: .00 to .05], CFI = .99, TLI = .99). However, modification indices suggested that including a path from negative affect to perceived credibility would improve model fit. A model with this path was estimated using maximum likelihood estimation with robust standard errors and also fit the data well (&#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>[<xref rid="pone.0142879.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] = 61.52, <italic>p</italic> = .351, relative &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> = 1.06, RMSEA = .02 [CI 90: .00 to .04], CFI = 1.00, TLI = .99).

Therefore, this path was retained in our final model, which was retested using bootstrap resampling to calculate confidence intervals for indirect effects.

The similarity of these results to the results of the same model estimated with MLR suggests that non-normal variable distributions did not significantly bias the trial&#x02019;s results. The AIC for this model was 8215.82 and the BIC was 8397.46.

As such, it represents the best to-date approximation of real world impact of graphic warning labels. In the study, graphic warning labels (compared to text-only) increased negative affect toward smoking, elicited greater scrutiny of the warning message, and enhanced label memory. The graphic-only condition also increased the credibility of the warning message. In analyses of mediated effects on perceived risks of smoking and intentions to quit, we found support for H1a and H1b that multiple functions of affect influenced these outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0142879.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142879.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Warnings with graphics did, in fact, elicit more negative affect than text-only warnings, and, consistent with past research on the affect heuristic [<xref rid="pone.0142879.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], more negative affect increased risk perceptions (and quit intentions in turn). Increased negative affect also motivated greater quit intentions directly. Third, it also elicited greater scrutiny of the messages and increased perceptions of warning credibility. This result is consistent with affect acting as a spotlight and motivating greater processing of the risk information consistent with that negative affect. In addition, increased credibility perceptions led to heightened risk perceptions and quit intentions. The elaborated text condition, however, did not support H2 and, instead, reduced credibility perceptions and counteracted the images&#x02019; effect on heightened risk perceptions.</p><p>Consistent with H3, the presence of graphic images also increased memory for label content, which led to greater smoking risk knowledge immediately after participants completed the trial and approximately one month later. Thus, warnings containing images also enhanced memory for label content, which helped to educate smokers about the harms of smoking. Although we predicted that negative affect from week 3 would drive increased memory for warning information at week 6 [<xref rid="pone.0142879.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142879.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], the data were inconsistent with this prediction. Several possible reasons exist for this lack of effect: (1) negative affect may have already started to fade after a week of exposure [<xref rid="pone.0142879.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142879.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], (2) the negative affect measure focused on feelings about smoking rather than feelings about the warnings themselves, and (3) the measure focused on valence rather than on the arousal linked with memory in past studies [<xref rid="pone.0142879.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142879.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The first possibility seems unlikely given that negative affect remained strong enough to have significant associations with several other key variables. Alternatively, it may be the case that negative affect is unrelated to memory for warning information. Instead, it may be that simply having illustrations of textual material provided more detailed content that enhanced memory [<xref rid="pone.0142879.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Given that the images used in cigarette warnings were designed to illustrate the health risks, they likely provide memory cues for the warning information. Additional research is needed to determine how to maximize the memorability of health risk information on warnings.</p><p>Results of the current research replicate past laboratory findings which have found that the negative affect elicited by graphic warning labels mediates their effect on quit intentions [<xref rid="pone.0142879.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142879.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142879.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The current research extends these past investigations by demonstrating that negative affect has significant influences outside the laboratory setting and after many exposures to the warnings. Importantly, results of the current research also provide evidence that images which arouse negative affect may be necessary components of impactful cigarette warning labels where impact is defined as increased risk knowledge, risk perceptions, and quit intentions (see also Wang et al. [<xref rid="pone.0142879.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]). In this study, negative affect influenced risk perceptions directly, serving as a simple cue or heuristic. However, negative affect also caused people to more carefully scrutinize smoking-risk information and led to greater perceived label credibility, risk perceptions, and quit intentions. This careful assessment of available information is inconsistent with the labels merely &#x0201c;&#x02026;browbeat[ing] consumers into quitting&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pone.0142879.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The impact of negative affect suggests that merely making text-only warnings more salient or including images which do not evoke negative affect may be insufficient to increase smokers&#x02019; risk perceptions and quit intentions.</p><p>Although the tobacco companies assert that &#x0201c;Americans&#x02026;are well aware of the health risks of smoking&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pone.0142879.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], providing risk information in plain text is less effective than text plus images. Even after exposure to the newly mandated text warnings, participants in this study were able to identify only 3&#x02013;4 smoking-related risks on average (<xref rid="pone.0142879.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The 2014 Surgeon General&#x02019;s Report states that smoking harms nearly every organ in the body and identifies at least 35 discrete negative health outcomes caused by smoking [<xref rid="pone.0142879.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Exposure to warning labels which included graphic images, however, led to greater label memory which was associated, in turn, with increased knowledge of smoking-related risks both at the study&#x02019;s end and one month later. These findings demonstrate that graphic warning labels can be effective in increasing knowledge about smoking&#x02019;s dangers, perhaps consistent with research showing the superiority of information accompanied by illustration for enhancing recall of that information [<xref rid="pone.0142879.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>].</p><p>The effects of our warning-label manipulations on smoking risk knowledge, risk perceptions, and quit intentions were indirect and without a significant unmediated effect. Our trial was powered on the expectation of a larger warning label effects on quit intentions than we observed. Additionally, our final sample of 244 analyzed participants falls slightly below our recruitment goal. Nevertheless, the mediated analyses suggest that with a larger sample, experimental effects on quit intentions may have emerged alongside the observed direct effects on affect, label scrutiny, and label credibility. In addition, our finding of a direct effect on label memory suggests that risk knowledge may also be enhanced. It remains for future research with larger samples to demonstrate this conclusively.</p><p>Indirect-only effects like those observed in this trial are also important because they suggest the possibility of missing moderators [<xref rid="pone.0142879.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. For example, in the current research, reactance to label content is one possible missing moderator [<xref rid="pone.0142879.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Such reactance could be the cause of the reduced credibility elicited by the elaborated text condition. Although earlier research has shown that elaborated text such as that used in Canada can enhance warning effects [<xref rid="pone.0142879.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], this study&#x02019;s exclusive focus (in the elaborated text condition) on the very next cigarette entailing risk may have been met with disbelief among life-long smokers who began the study with no intentions to quit. The current research suggests that either additional research is needed to identify the best content for the elaborated text, or that the positive effects of such text are limited to studies with a single exposure to any one warning [<xref rid="pone.0142879.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142879.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Alternatively, the smaller text size in the elaborated-text condition may have been problematic as observational research has demonstrated that warning labels with large, salient text are more impactful than those with smaller and less salient text [<xref rid="pone.0142879.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>].</p><p>Some of our design choices also may have reduced our effect sizes. First, the relatively brief study duration (four weeks) may be inadequate to compete with the power of addiction. Longer trials are expensive, but may be necessary. Second, we chose to use the nine images selected by the FDA for placement on US cigarette packages in their 2011 Final Rule [<xref rid="pone.0142879.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The images in these warnings are less arousing than those featured on cigarette packages in other countries [<xref rid="pone.0142879.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Single exposure studies and population level research suggest that placing more disturbing images on graphic warning labels would increase their impact on intentions to change behaviors [<xref rid="pone.0142879.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0142879.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Thus, the use of more graphic warnings than those used in the present trial may reveal larger effects. Third, we did not have a true control condition. Participants in the text-only condition received novel warnings that were stronger than those currently featured on US cigarette packaging. In particular, text-only participants received the nine, currently unfamiliar, risk statements mandated by the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, printed in black text on a white background. Current US warnings are smaller and in colors consistent with the rest of the package. Although we believe that the inclusion of a strong comparison condition is a merit of the current research, our results might have appeared stronger if we had instead compared image conditions to a &#x0201c;current warnings&#x0201d; control group.</p><p>The current research was designed to investigate how graphic warning labels might influence smokers at the population level. As such, this trial lacked sufficient statistical power to effectively identify the impact of potential moderating variables. Although past experimental research suggests that the effects of graphic warnings do not vary as a function of demographic characteristics such as race/ethnicity, education, and income [<xref rid="pone.0142879.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], this result may prove to be different with a period of prolonged exposure. This possibility should be explored in future research. Some additional variables which future research should consider as potential moderators of the effects observed here include the number of cigarettes participants&#x02019; smoke daily, nicotine dependence, duration of smoking, living with a smoker, and personal experience with smoking-related illness. Another plausible moderator is baseline quit intentions. For this study, we only recruited participants who indicated that they were either &#x0201c;somewhat unlikely&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;very unlikely&#x0201d; to quit smoking in the next 30 days during the prescreening phone call. It is possible that graphic warnings might be more impactful for smokers planning to quit in the near future.</p><p>This study is the first experiment of which we are aware to investigate the processes by which graphic warning labels influence smokers in a naturalistic setting over an extended period of time. Our method of providing relabeled cigarettes ensured that all participants were exposed to experimental warning labels every time they smoked one of their own cigarettes. However, it is possible that providing participants with cigarettes at no cost may have undermined interest in quitting and worked against our hypotheses (see <xref rid="pone.0142879.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Recent investigations suggest that this can be avoided by requiring participants to provide cigarettes for re-labeling [<xref rid="pone.0142879.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] or asking participants to apply experimental labels to their own cigarettes [<xref rid="pone.0142879.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. These techniques may reduce one source of error variance, however, while increasing others (e.g., participant lack of funds or compliance). In addition, if free cigarettes provided disincentive to quit, quit intentions at least should have been influenced equally across all conditions. Overall, the presence of the effects we found speaks to the efficacy of graphic warning labels. Additional investigations are needed to determine the tradeoffs of different methods by which to examine the impact of graphic warning labels in naturalistic contexts.</p><p>In particular, the current research provides evidence that negative affect is a crucial ingredient in successful graphic warning labels. It is also the first study to demonstrate that graphic warning labels can elicit greater processing of provided smoking risk information rather than influencing smokers exclusively by &#x0201c;browbeating&#x0201d; them into quitting. Policies requiring such labels have the potential to reduce the number of Americans who smoke. The affect induced by graphic warning labels appears to have utility in communicating more and more credible information, useful to promoting risk perceptions and quit intentions among smokers in the US and around the world.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec029"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0142879.s001"><label>S1 Checklist</label><caption><title>CONSORT Checklist.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0142879.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0142879.s002"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Basic Text Warnings.</title><p>Basic text warnings which were affixed to the side of all cigarette packages distributed in the study.
