The current study aimed to evaluate whether increasing the level of dissolved oxygen by Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT) could activate neuroplasticity in patients with chronic neurologic deficiencies due to stroke.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Findings</title><p>A prospective, randomized, controlled trial including 74 patients (15 were excluded). All participants suffered a stroke 6&#x02013;36 months prior to inclusion and had at least one motor dysfunction. After inclusion, patients were randomly assigned to "treated" or "cross" groups. Brain activity was assessed by SPECT imaging; neurologic functions were evaluated by NIHSS, ADL, and life quality. Patients in the treated group were evaluated twice: at baseline and after 40 HBOT sessions. Patients in the cross group were evaluated three times: at baseline, after a 2-month control period of no treatment, and after subsequent 2-months of 40 HBOT sessions. HBOT protocol: Two months of 40 sessions (5 days/week), 90 minutes each, 100% oxygen at 2 ATA. We found that the neurological functions and life quality of all patients in both groups were significantly improved following the HBOT sessions while no improvement was found during the control period of the patients in the cross group. Results of SPECT imaging were well correlated with clinical improvement. Elevated brain activity was detected mostly in regions of live cells (as confirmed by CT) with low activity (based on SPECT) &#x02013; regions of noticeable discrepancy between anatomy and physiology.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The results indicate that HBOT can lead to significant neurological improvements in post stroke patients even at chronic late stages.

Unfortunately, these programs are often just partially successful, and additional therapeutic approaches towards metabolic recovery of affected cerebral tissues are called for. While a considerable amount of preclinical research supports the use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) for post-stroke damaged brain tissue, so far, only 5 articles reported controlled clinical trials of HBOT for stroke patients. These studies, in which the treatment started during the early-acute phase immediately after stroke, yielded non conclusive and somewhat contradicting results <xref rid="pone.0053716-Anderson1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0053716-Nighoghossian1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0053716-Rusyniak1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0053716-Vila1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0053716-Imai1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. In contrast, a recent phase-I study evaluating the effect of HBOT on chronic neurological deficiencies (due to traumatic brain injury) revealed promising results <xref rid="pone.0053716-Harch1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. However, to date the effects of HBOT on neurological deficiencies due to stroke during the late-chronic phase (the focus of the current report) have not yet been investigated in a prospective randomized trial.</p><p>Years of clinical experience revealed that the dramatic spontaneous recovery from stroke occurs mainly within the first 30 days, though moderate and severe stroke survivors continue to improve for at least 90 days <xref rid="pone.0053716-Duncan1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Most of the recovery involves brain regions rendered dysfunctional, but not dead <xref rid="pone.0053716-Astrup1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Accumulated data from visualizations of these non-active (stunned) regions indicates that they may persist alive but dysfunctional for months, even years, after the acute injury <xref rid="pone.0053716-FernandezBouzas1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0053716-Siddique1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0053716-Neubauer1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. It was proposed that the oxygen supply to these under-active neurons was low due to stroke damage to blood vessels in these regions, leading to oxygen deficiency, anaerobic metabolism and ATP depletion <xref rid="pone.0053716-Hossmann1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0053716-Culmsee1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. The decreased oxygen level not only causes reduction in the neuronal activity but also prevents angiogenesis to replace the stroke-damaged blood vessels and the generation of new synaptic connections. Since 1 cm<sup>3</sup> of normal brain tissue contains about 1 km of blood vessels, high oxygen supply is essential for repair of the stunned regions. Indeed, as has been demonstrated by previous studies, an increase in dissolved oxygen has several beneficial effects in damaged brain tissues <xref rid="pone.0053716-Neubauer1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0053716-Golden1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0053716-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0053716-Gunther1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0053716-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0053716-Calvert1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Transport of oxygen to glial mitochondria, the main sites of oxygen utilization, follows oxygen release from erythrocytes into the plasma and then diffusion of the blood-dissolved oxygen across the Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB). Breathing oxygen under hyperbaric conditions has been shown to be a potent means of increasing arterial oxygen tension and consequently the brain oxygen tension <xref rid="pone.0053716-Calvert1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0053716-Niklas1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0053716-Reinert1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. For example, at 2ATA (atmospheres absolute), the plasma O<sub>2</sub> partial pressure rises above 1,110 mmHg. Hence, it is reasonable to expect that HBOT can be an efficient (and clinically feasible) method for increasing tissue/cellular oxygenation and thus effectively evoking neuroplasticity in the chronically non-active areas during the late post-stroke phase.</p><p>Many physiological pathways, each with a different characteristic time, are spontaneously activated following the onset of stroke. Therefore, a challenging question to be addressed considers the optimal time lapse after stroke to start the HBOT procedure. It should also be kept in mind that signals and chemical cues associated with cell death during the acute stage of stroke might, in fact, promote repair during recovery <xref rid="pone.0053716-Lo1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> and can be negatively affected by premature application of HBOT. Unlike the case of preclinical animal studies, in clinical practice it is not feasible to apply the HBOT immediately at the stroke onset. Thus, HBOT procedure can practically begin either at the degenerative or at the regenerative stage. One can assume that any added energy during the degenerative stage could further increase the unwanted, post-injury damage. On the other hand, elevated oxygen supply during the regenerative stage would supply the energy needs for the innate brain repair processes. The differences in the time lapse between stroke onset and HBOT application in previous studies are likely to be the reason for the contradictive results obtained for HBOT application during the acute phase after stroke <xref rid="pone.0053716-Anderson1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0053716-Nighoghossian1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0053716-Rusyniak1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0053716-Vila1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0053716-Imai1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the effects of HBOT started at the late-chronic phase after the acute stroke.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>The study was performed as a prospective, randomized, controlled, two-group trial. The population included patients of ages 18 years or older, who had either ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke 6&#x02013;36 months prior to their inclusion. All patients had to have at least one motor dysfunction. Exclusions were based on chest pathology incompatible with HBOT, inner ear disease, claustrophobia and inability to sign informed consent. Additional exclusions were based on dynamic neurologic improvements during the last month (based either on objective measurements by external evaluator or on subjective statement by the patients). Smoking was not allowed during the study. All patients signed written informed consent; the protocol was approved by the local Helsinki committee. The study was conducted in the hyperbaric and research units of Assaf-Harofeh Medical Center, Israel.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Protocol and End Points</title><p>After signing an informed consent form, the patients were invited for baseline evaluations.

Statistically significant improvements were obtained following treatment for almost all treated patients from both the HBOT-treated group and the HBOT-treated cross group (with no false negative), as was evaluated by NIHSS, ADL, brain SPECT and life quality. The significance of the improvements in this chronically debilitated population of patients is further noticeable when compared to the lack of improvement during the control (no-treatment) period of the cross group (with no false positive).</p><p>This is the first prospective, randomized clinical study evaluating the effect of HBOT in the late post-stroke period (6 months to 3 years after the acute event). There are two major reasons for selecting this study population. First, by carefully selecting patients with chronic stable neurological deficiency we were able to avoid unexpected changes in their condition. In this regard, the selection proved very useful since the control group demonstrated neurological stability with no outliers. The second reason was, as discussed in the introduction, to test our hypothesis that the optimal time for the HBOT procedure should be during the regenerative and not during the degenerative stage. While it is not possible to mark a clear line between the regenerative and the degenerative phases <xref rid="pone.0053716-Lo1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, it is quite clear that 6 months after the acute event in a stable patient the degenerative process has ended. As mentioned in the introduction, the differences in initiation times and protocols of HBOT may explain contradictive results in previous studies, where HBOT was used in the early phase after stroke <xref rid="pone.0053716-Anderson1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0053716-Nighoghossian1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0053716-Rusyniak1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0053716-Vila1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0053716-Imai1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. The recent publication by Harch et al., evaluating the effect of HBOT on chronic neurological deficiencies due to traumatic brain injury, also supports the use of HBOT in the late stage after the acute insult <xref rid="pone.0053716-Harch1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p><p>The issue of &#x0201c;how to handle the control group&#x0201d; was discussed by a multidisciplinary team including physicians specializing in hyperbaric medicine, physicists specializing in neuronal-glia interactions and the ethics committee. The patients can tell if pressure is increased or not, so the pressure must be increased also in the control group. The only way to administer &#x0201c;placebo&#x0201d; of HBOT is to bring the patients to the hyperbaric chamber and to increase the environmental pressure to an extent that the patients will feel it in their ears. The minimal pressure needed to gain such a feeling should be 1.3 ATM. Henry&#x02019;s law states: &#x0201c;the amount of a given gas dissolved in a given type and volume of liquid is directly proportional to the pressure of that gas in equilibrium with that liquid&#x0201d;. Thus, hyperbaric environment significantly increases the dissolved oxygen pressure even if a person holding his breath <xref rid="pone.0053716-Muth1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Compressed air at 1.3 ATA increases the plasma oxygen tension by at least 50% and that is certainly notable. There are many case reports illustrating significant effects following small increase in air pressure <xref rid="pone.0053716-James1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0053716-Golding1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0053716-Austin1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Moreover, even a slight increase in partial pressure, such as, for example, to 1.05 ATM at altitude 402 m below sea level (the Dead Sea), can lead to noticeable physiological effects <xref rid="pone.0053716-Goldbart1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0053716-Kramer1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0053716-Falk1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0053716-Abinader1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0053716-Gabizon1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. However, it should be kept in mind that oxygen is not a drug, and because it is metabolized mainly in the mitochondria, there is no simple dose-response curve.</p><p>Since increasing the pressure even without adding oxygen can also increases the dissolved oxygen partial pressure, the only way to maintain normal (placebo) levels of dissolved oxygen is to supply air with lower than normal level of oxygen, which we deemed unethical. To partially compensate for this inherent limitation, the patients in the cross group started with a two-month control period of no treatment, at the end of which they were crossed to two months of HBOT sessions. To gain better validity of the results, we used the scatter plot analysis of the changes in the combined neurological evaluations. The scatter plots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053716-g003">figure 3</xref>) show changes in the NIHSS and ADL scores in terms of the scaled relative differences, as is defined in the methods section. In that analysis, summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053716-g002">figures 2</xref> &#x00026; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0053716-g003">3</xref>, the correlation between changes NIHSS &#x00026; ADL after HBOT is clearly demonstrated. Moreover, the analysis evidently demonstrates that the effect of HBOT on these &#x0201c;not completely blinded evolution&#x0201d; was the same in the treated group and the control group after blind randomization. The correlation between the improvement in NIHSS and ADL and the improvement in the brain SPECT results, which was done in a completely blinded fashion, further substantiates the clinical findings. Moreover, the consistency between the anatomical locations of the changes in the brain metabolism, as demonstrated by the SPECT, with the finding in the neurological evaluation provides important validation of the neurological evaluation.</p><p>During most of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, there was an ongoing debate about the time window available for induction of neuroplasticity. The improvements in the chronic late stage reported here support the view that neuroplasticity can be activated months to years after the acute event when a proper brain stimulation (such as HBOT) is applied. More specifically, the current study included patients that underwent stroke more than 6 months prior to treatment and after their condition reached a steady state (no improvements were monitored for at least a month). These important and unexpected findings arein agreement with other recent findings revealing that many aspects of the brain remain plastic even at adulthood <xref rid="pone.0053716-Rakic1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. They are also consistent with several other studies in post stroke patients <xref rid="pone.0053716-Zimerman1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0053716-Kattenstroth1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0053716-Sterr1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. In the current study, patients were treated only with HBOT without any additional guided training and/or practice. This was done in order to demonstrate the therapeutic potential of this treatment. It is reasonable to expect that exploiting the HBOT in conjunction with other rehabilitation intervention can lead to even better results leading to optimal future practice. The current study paved the way for future investigations of this promising direction, which should be one of the aims of upcoming more elaborated clinical studies.</p><p>Current imaging technologies reveal that the stunned brain areas (regions of high anatomy-physiology mismatch) may persist for months and years after an acute brain event <xref rid="pone.0053716-FernandezBouzas1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0053716-Siddique1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0053716-Neubauer1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. The changes in SPECT images after treatment demonstrate that the HBOT procedure led to reactivations of neuronal activity in the stunned areas. While SPECT imaging has limited spatial resolutions (in comparison, for example, to fMRI), the changes in activity were sufficiently robust to be clearly detected by the SPECT images. However, a future, more detailed study using fMRI (along with direct observations on animal model) will be able to provide additional valuable insights, in particular regarding the operative underlying mechanisms that activate the neuroplasticity (e.g. the putative role of glial cells). We note that patients were not selected based on their anatomical and functional brain imaging evaluation. It might be possible that the results would have been even better had the study included only patients with high SPECT/CT mismatch. This issue of the preferred population for HBOT should be further investigated in future clinical trials. We also note that in the current pioneering study aimed at &#x0201c;proof of concept&#x0201d;, all patients underwent 40 HBOT sessions. Based on our current clinical experience, more sessions of HBOT may be needed, at least for some patients, in order to obtain the maximal improvement effect.</p><p>In any case, the observed reactivation of neuronal activity in the stunned areas imply that increasing the plasma oxygen concentration with hyperbaric oxygenation is a potent means of delivering to the brain sufficient oxygen for tissue repair: HBOT might initiate a cellular and vascular repair mechanism and improve cerebral vascular flow <xref rid="pone.0053716-Harch1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0053716-Neubauer1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0053716-Golden1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0053716-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. At the cellular level, HBOT can improve mitochondrial function (in both neurons and glial cells) and cellular metabolism; improve BBB and inflammatory reactions; reduce apoptosis; alleviate oxidative stress; increase levels of neurotrophins and nitric oxide, and up-regulate axon guidance agents <xref rid="pone.0053716-Neubauer1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0053716-Golden1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0053716-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0053716-Calvert1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Moreover, the effects of HBOT on neurons can be mediated indirectly by glial cells, including asrocytes <xref rid="pone.0053716-Gunther1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. HBOT may also promote neurogenesis of the endogenous neural stem cells <xref rid="pone.0053716-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. The major limitation of the above-mentioned data is that it has been tested in different types of models and includes different protocols of HBOT. However, it is well noticed that there is at least one common denominator to all repair/regeneration mechanisms: they are all energy/oxygen dependent. It might be possible that HBOT enables the metabolic change simply by supplying the missing energy/oxygen needed for those regeneration processes.</p><p>To conclude, in this study we provide, for the first time, convincing results demonstrating that HBOT can induce significant neurological improvement in post stroke patients. The neurological improvements in a chronic late stage demonstrate that neuroplasticity can be operative and activated by HBOT even long after acute brain insult. Thus, the findings have important implications that can be of general relevance and interest in neurobiology. Although this study focused on stroke patients, the findings bear the promise that HBOT may serve as a valuable therapeutic practice in other neurological disorders exhibiting discrepancy between the anatomical and functional evaluation of the brain.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0053716.s001"><label>Protocol S1</label><caption><p>Clinical Study Protocol.</p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0053716.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0053716.s002"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>CONSORT 2010 checklist.</p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0053716.s002.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0053716.s003"><label>Form S1</label><caption><p>Informed consent form (English translation).</p><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0053716.s003.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0053716.s004"><label>Text S1</label><caption><p>Statistical, Randomization and Placebo Considerations.</p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0053716.s004.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0053716.s005"><label>Text S2</label><caption><p>Scatter plot analysis of the clinical scores.</p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0053716.s005.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are thankful Dr. Alexander Vol and Dr. Orna Gribova for enlightening discussions regarding the neurophysiology and oxygen related processes in brain recovery.
