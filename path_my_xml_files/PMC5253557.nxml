Participants are blinded to the trial's hypothesis and to the interventions received by the opposite group. A total of 204 participants will be recruited from the community and randomised using a computer-generated schedule. The intervention group will receive education for joint protection and OA, a splint for the base of the thumb, hand exercises and topical diclofenac sodium 1% gel over 6&#x02005;weeks. The control group will receive education for joint protection and OA alone. Main inclusion criteria are pain &#x02265;40&#x02005;mm (Visual Analogue Scale, 0&#x02013;100) at the base of the thumb, impairment in hand function &#x02265;6 (Functional Index for Hand Osteoarthritis, 0&#x02013;30) and radiographic thumb base OA (Kellgren Lawrence grade &#x02265;2). Participants currently receiving any of the intervention components will be excluded. Outcomes will be measured at 2, 6 and 12&#x02005;weeks. The primary outcome is change in pain and hand function from baseline to 6&#x02005;weeks. Other outcomes include changes in grip and pinch strength, quality of life, presence of joint swelling and tenderness, duration of joint stiffness, patient's global assessment and use of rescue medication. Analysis will be performed according to the intention-to-treat principle.

<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> The most common form of OA is that involving the hands, affecting three times more women than men and with greater prevalence following menopause.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Overall prevalence of symptomatic hand OA is nearly 15%,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> while in the elderly (aged 70&#x02005;years and over) the prevalence is about 26% in women and 13.4% in men.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>Among the different subtypes of hand OA, that affecting the base of the thumb represents a particular challenge to clinicians due to associated disabling symptoms and the limited efficacy of treatment options.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Radiographic thumb base OA was reported to affect nearly 21% of the population over 40&#x02005;years of age in the USA<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> and it is usually more frequently related to pain and disability than interphalangeal joint OA.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> In addition to pain, it can cause deformity, stiffness, decreased range of motion and strength, resulting in difficulty performing common activities such as opening jars, carrying weights and writing.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p><p>While thumb base OA is primarily treated with non-surgical modalities, surgical treatment may be indicated for those whose debilitating symptoms persist despite adequate conservative management. Thumb base OA is one of the most common causes of hand surgery.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Surgical management, however, is associated with a number of complications, including tendon rupture, sensory changes and wound infection.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> In addition, a 7-year prospective study found 70% of patients waiting for surgery for thumb base OA were able to postpone or avoid surgery following conservative treatment with joint protection and splinting.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p><p>Although a number of conservative therapies have proven to be effective for the management of hand OA, only modest treatment effects were reported for most individual interventions.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> This is particularly true in the case of thumb base OA, with few high-quality clinical trials in the literature to date and great heterogeneity across studies.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p><p>Among the non-surgical modalities, education about the disease, delivered along with instructions regarding joint protection techniques, has been demonstrated to have no clinically significant benefits for pain.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> In contrast, a systematic review demonstrated that the use of splints for thumb base OA reduced pain, particularly in the long term, based on data from two trials.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> The same review found evidence that hand exercises might improve grip strength and hand function; however, evidence was based on individual trials using different exercise programmes. With regard to pharmacological management, there are insufficient data available to support the efficacy of intra-articular therapy with either corticosteroids or hyaluronic acid<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> and their use is not recommended by the 2012 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) guidelines.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> On the other hand, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are recommended to relieve pain associated with thumb base OA, and topical formulations are recommended over oral NSAIDs in the most recent guidelines, due to a superior safety profile.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16&#x02013;18</xref> However, their effect on function is small and transitory (no more effective than placebo after 2&#x02005;weeks).<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></p><p>Combining non-pharmacological and pharmacological modalities in the management of hand OA is recommended by the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) guidelines,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> supported by a literature review,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> and is frequently used in clinical practice. Despite this, direct evidence of efficacy of this strategy is lacking. A few trials evaluating combined treatment have been performed, although they have not generally been specific to thumb base OA.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>
<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Moreover, the combinations investigated usually included exclusively non-pharmacological modalities<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> and to date no strategy has been found to be highly efficacious for improving pain and function for thumb base OA. Determining an evidence-based therapeutic approach with a clinically meaningful effect on clinical outcomes would provide health professionals with a basis for decision-making for treatment of patients with thumb base OA. This strategy does not yet exist, and decisions on the best combination of interventions are usually based on personal experience and personal opinion of health professionals.</p></sec><sec id="s1b"><title>Objective</title><p>The aim of this study is to determine the effect of a combination of conservative non-pharmacological and pharmacological modalities in the treatment of thumb base OA compared with education control (standard care).

If the pain scores are the same for both hands, participants will be asked to nominate the worst hand (ie, the one that causes more problems to the participant, either the dominant or non-dominant hand), which will be included as the index.</p></sec><sec id="s2c2"><title>Exclusion criteria</title><p>Participants will be excluded if they fulfil any of the following criteria: known diagnosis of crystal-related arthritis (eg, gout, calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease), autoimmune arthritis (eg, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis), hemochromatosis or fibromyalgia; hand surgery in the last 6&#x02005;months or planning to undergo surgery in the next 6&#x02005;months; use of concomitant medications potentially directed at OA, unless at a stable dosage for at least 1&#x02005;month for analgesics and NSAIDs or 3&#x02005;months for slow-acting symptomatic or structure-modifying drugs (eg, diacerein, chondroitin sulfate, avocado/soybean unsaponifiables); intra-articular hyaluronic acid injection in the affected joint in the past 6&#x02005;months; intra-articular steroid injection in the affected joint in the past month; significant injury to the affected joint in the past 6&#x02005;months; any other self-reported hand condition that is likely to be contributing to the pain at the base of the thumb (eg, scaphoid fracture, carpal tunnel syndrome, DeQuervain's tendinopathy, trigger thumb, joint infection, diabetic neuropathy, pain referred from the neck, pain following hand or wrist trauma or surgery); poor general health likely to interfere with compliance or assessments, judged by the investigator; known hypersensitivity to diclofenac; current history of advanced renal failure; past or current history of gastrointestinal ulceration, bleeding and/or perforation; women who are pregnant or breastfeeding; current use of any of the study interventions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Randomisation and allocation concealment</title><p>Individuals who consent to take part in the study and fulfil all study criteria will be assigned to either intervention or control group with a 1:1 allocation as per a computer-generated randomisation schedule, stratified by OA severity using KLG (2 and 3 vs 4) using random blocks of size 2, 4 and 6. The allocation sequence will be concealed from the researchers enrolling and assessing participants in sequentially numbered opaque, sealed and stapled envelopes. Aluminium foil inside the envelope will be used to render the envelope impermeable to intense light. Envelopes will be stored in a locked drawer and will be opened by the study coordinator only after the enrolled participant completes all baseline assessments.</p><p>The sequence generation will be prepared by a statistician and the envelopes will be prepared by an external investigator not involved in the trial. The study blinded assessor will enrol participants and the study therapist (one single physiotherapist with experience in thumb base OA management) will open the envelope in front of the participant and execute the designated intervention.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Blinding</title><p>All clinical assessments will be conducted by an assessor blinded to treatment allocation. To reduce the potential for unblinding, participants will be instructed not to disclose any information about the treatment, not to wear the splint during the follow-up assessments and not to use the topical NSAID just before the visit. Any occurrence of unblinding of the assessor will be recorded with its reason and reported along with the trial's results. The physiotherapist executing and supervising the treatments will not be blinded to the group allocation. The statistician involved in the main statistical analyses will be blinded to group allocation. Group allocation will be immediately unblinded if deemed necessary by the chief investigator in the case of serious adverse events potentially related to the study.</p><p>Participants will be naive to the treatments offered to the opposite group and hence blinded to the hypothesis of the study. In order to reduce the risk of bias, participants will be informed about the overall aspects involved in the treatment of both groups (ie, conservative therapies not involving oral or intra-articular medications) but not told the specific treatments included in each one of them nor about the differences among groups. This procedure aims to minimise differences regarding expectations with the allocated treatment between groups.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Interventions</title><p>The intervention group will receive a combination of education about OA and joint protection techniques, a splint to support the base of the thumb, hand exercises and topical NSAID. The control group will receive education about the disease and education about joint protection techniques alone (standard care). All participants will attend two individual, face-to-face treatment sessions with the study physiotherapist of &#x0223c;30&#x02005;min each. The first will occur at the baseline visit and the second will occur after 2&#x02005;weeks (2-week visit). Both treatment sessions will occur after the assessment by the blinded assessor. The 2-week visit aims at checking adherence to the programme while balancing the number of face-to-face visits and contact with the therapist between the control and intervention groups (two visits for each group).</p><p>The intervention will be delivered over 6&#x02005;weeks. After the 6-week visit, participants will be encouraged by the physiotherapist to continue the treatment throughout the follow-up period (from 6 to 12&#x02005;weeks) but intervention use will be at the participants' discretion. This period aims to evaluate participant's choice in continuing using the interventions and to assess the outcomes after this period.</p><p>Participants will be allowed to continue using current pain medications throughout the study provided the dose has been stable at study entry as per exclusion criteria. They will be permitted to use acetaminophen (paracetamol) as rescue medication for any symptom exacerbation, up to a maximum of 3000&#x02005;mg/day.</p><sec id="s2f1"><title>Education about OA and joint protection techniques</title><p>All participants in this study (both groups) will be provided with education about OA and joint protection techniques through a nine-page educational booklet delivered at baseline (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">supplementary appendix 1</xref>) and through two face-to-face sessions with the study therapist at baseline and at the 2-week visit.

Specific attention will be drawn to performing the exercises in a way which prevents collapse (hyperextension) of the first metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint while maintaining the web space (abduction).

All participants will be contacted by phone or through an online survey at 6&#x02005;months to assess: (1) participants' choice in continue using the interventions (yes vs no); (2) the frequency of intervention use (as recommended by the physiotherapist vs less than the recommended by the physiotherapist); (3) primary outcomes (pain at the base of the thumb, assessed by VAS (0&#x02013;100&#x02005;mm); and hand function, assessed by FIHOA (0&#x02013;30)). The reason for non-compliance (eg, lack of benefit, side effect, forgot to use intervention/do the exercise) will be recorded.

The risks for participants involved in this study are minimal. Topical NSAIDs have demonstrated a good safety profile and good tolerability, with no higher gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, renal and hepatic adverse events than placebo.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Nevertheless, due to theoretical concerns related to the use of NSAIDs, adverse events will be monitored. To ensure the safety of participants, blood pressure will be monitored and systemic symptoms (new or worsening of previous symptoms) will be assessed at 2, 6 and 12&#x02005;weeks after study initiation. Symptoms suspected to be related to the topical NSAIDs will be assessed by a physician involved in the study and, if necessary, the medication will be discontinued and further medical evaluation will be arranged. Local skin dermatitis may occur; however, these will most likely be minor local skin reactions. Participants who have local adverse reactions will cease the topical medication and will be followed to certify resolution of their rash. The same procedure will be applied if participants report local adverse skin reactions associated with the splint use. All adverse events will be reported.</p><p>Participants currently taking warfarin that are allocated to the intervention group will be required to consult their treating physician during the study due to the potential interaction between this drug and NSAIDs. Participants will be exposed to a small amount of radiation (0.001&#x02005;mSV) for the acquisition of the radiograph, which is much lower than the annual average radiation dose (around 2&#x02005;mSV).<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></p></sec><sec id="s2i2"><title>Handling of withdrawals</title><p>If a participant withdraws from the study, they will have their reasons for withdrawal recorded and any information provided or recorded up to the point of withdrawal will be kept in accordance with the data security and handling protocol of this study (see below).
