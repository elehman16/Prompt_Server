The main symptoms of AR and conjunctivitis are sneezing, rhinorrhoea, nasal congestion, itchy nose, itchy eyes and watery eyes [1]. The recent Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma (ARIA) group classification includes an assessment of the frequency and duration of symptoms [2]. In addition, a severity scale of mild to moderate/severe has been included in the revised classification The severity of rhinitis has a greater impact on quality of life (QOL), sleep, daily activities and work performance than the duration of rhinitis.</p><p>The prevalence of self-reported AR in a pan-European survey of an unselected population was between 15% and 22% [3]. In another study, 19% of the population self-identified as having AR and, in this group, 70% reported having a medical diagnosis of AR [4]. In a recent survey, 3052 patients consulting a general practitioner for AR were classified into one of the four classes of ARIA. Mild intermittent rhinitis was diagnosed in 11% of patients, mild persistent rhinitis in 8%, moderate/severe intermittent rhinitis in 35% and moderate/severe persistent rhinitis in 46%. More than 80% of patients with moderate/severe rhinitis reported impaired activities, compared with only 40% with mild rhinitis [5].</p><p>Asthma is more common in subjects with AR than in those without (20% vs. 2&#x02013;4%, respectively) [3, 6]. In an international cross-sectional study in young adults, 74&#x02013;81% of subjects with asthma reported symptoms of rhinitis, depending on sensitization to specific allergens. In all countries, bronchial hyperreactivity was also more frequent in subjects with rhinitis than in those without [odds ratio (OR)=6.63, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 5.44&#x02013;8.08; and OR=3.02, 95% CI 2.66&#x02013;3.43, respectively).</p><p>Sensitization to pollen allergens has increased in many areas of Europe where the prevalence of grass pollen sensitization is reported to be around 16.9% [7]. The allergen concentration in the air is an important factor for disease development and outcome. Thus the burden of IgE-mediated grass pollen allergy is related to the length of the pollen season, total pollen counts, the height of the pollen peak and allergen bioavailability. The allergen content within pollen grains of the same taxon has been shown to vary for a number of reasons [8, 9]. Recent birth cohort studies have revealed increased sensitization to at least one allergen, due essentially to the high prevalence of grass pollen exposure [9]. Different and multiple sensitizations are frequent in atopic subjects although clinical symptoms may not always be present [10, 11].</p><p>The IgE-mediated immune response differs among sensitized subjects, even when exposed to a common environment; some individuals react towards a limited number of allergens (mono- or pauci-sensitized), whereas others are sensitized to a wide array of allergens (polysensitized). Taking into consideration the cross-reactivity between allergens and panallergens, a minority of symptomatic patients is sensitized to a single allergen [5]. It has been suggested by the ARIA group that patients with multiple sensitivities may not benefit from specific immunotherapy (SIT) as much as patients with a single sensitivity, but more data are needed to confirm this [2].</p><p>The aim of this complementary analysis was to determine whether 300 IR (index of reactivity) 5-grass pollen sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) [12] was equally effective in different subgroups of patients from the original study, including those with particularly severe sensitivity to grass pollen, patients with severe symptoms of AR, those with mild grass-associated asthma and polysensitized patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Participants and setting</title><p>Participants of both sexes, aged 18&#x02013;45 years, with moderate-to-severe grass pollen-induced allergic rhinoconjunctivitis for at least 2 years were included. All patients had a positive skin prick test (SPT; weal diameter 3 mm), serum-specific IgE of at least class 2 and a Retrospective Rhinoconjunctivitis Total Symptom Score (RRTSS) of at least 12 (out of a maximum of 18). The SPT included five grass pollens (<italic>Anthoxanthum odoratum</italic>, <italic>Dactylis glomerata</italic>, <italic>Lolium perenne</italic>, <italic>Phleum pratense</italic> and <italic>Poa pratensis</italic>), and timothy grass-specific IgE was measured in kU/L. Patients were investigated for sensitization to other allergens by testing with the 10 most common allergens in each country. Patients sensitized to allergens other than grass pollen were included only if these allergens did not induce symptoms during the grass pollen season (symptoms outside the grass pollen season were allowed). Patients with grass pollen-induced asthma requiring treatment with &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-agonists only were also included. The main exclusion criteria were allergic rhinoconjunctivitis due to a co-sensitization likely to influence the patient's symptoms during the study, or symptoms of rhinoconjunctivitis during the treatment phase due to sensitization to allergens other than grass pollens, previous SIT for grass pollen allergy, and the usual contraindications for SIT. This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in which a total of 628 patients was enrolled from 42 centres in 10 European countries.</p></sec><sec><title>Sublingual immunotherapy</title><p>Patients were randomized to receive once-daily sublingual tablets containing either placebo or extracts of 5-grass pollens (<italic>A. odoratum</italic>, <italic>D. glomerata</italic>, <italic>L. perenne</italic>, <italic>P. pratense</italic> and <italic>P. pratensis</italic>) at doses of 100 IR, 300 IR, 500 IR; 300 IR corresponds to 25 &#x003bc;g/tablet of Group 5 major allergens. Treatment began 4 months before the expected start of the pollen season. The pollen season was defined as the first day of three consecutive days with a grass pollen count &#x0003e;30 grains/m<sup>3</sup> of air to the last day before three consecutive days with a pollen count &#x02264;30 grains/m<sup>3</sup>. Peak pollen period was defined as the 14-day period with the highest grass pollen count in the area.</p></sec><sec><title>Efficacy analysis</title><p>The primary efficacy assessment of the study was Rhinitis Total Symptom Score (RTSS) from 0 to 18, corresponding to the sum of the severity of the six rhinoconjunctivitis symptoms (sneezing, rhinorrhoea, nasal pruritus, nasal congestion, ocular pruritus and watery eyes) during the previous 24 h, each symptom assessed on a four-point scale (0=absent to 3=severe). Secondary assessments were the individual rhinoconjunctivitis symptom scores, RTSS at the peak of the pollen season, rescue medication usage and proportion of symptom-free days. Patients' QOL was assessed using the self-administered disease-specific Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire and patients' global evaluation of their condition. In case of severe symptoms, patients could use predefined rescue medication. Patients were instructed to start with an oral antihistamine (cetirizine) and if the symptoms were not alleviated, progress to an intra-nasal corticosteroid (mometasone furoate) and finally an oral corticosteroid.</p></sec><sec><title>Safety analysis</title><p>Adverse events were monitored throughout the study and graded according to the MedRA dictionary (version 7.1). The safety population included all eligible patients who were randomized and had received a single dose of investigational product.</p><p>In the complementary and exploratory sensitivity analysis, four subgroups of patients with severe disease profiles were evaluated: (i) Group 1: patients with baseline specific (timothy grass) IgE&#x0003e;17.5 kU/L (class 4); (ii) Group 2: patients with a RRTSS greater than the third quartile (15); (iii) Group 3: patients who had a baseline SPT to the 5-grass pollen extracts (Stallerg&#x000e8;nes, Antony, France) with a weal diameter greater than the third quartile (10.5 mm); and (iv) Group 4: patients falling in any of these three subgroups.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical methods</title><p>Clinical efficacy assessed by the RTSS was examined using an <sc>ancova</sc> model with treatment and pooled site as main effects, and RRTSS, presence or absence of grass pollen-induced asthma and sensitization (mono/polysensitized) status as covariates. Non-parametric methods were also used on the primary efficacy variable as a supportive analysis. All data are given as means &#x000b1; SD. For the primary outcome, the difference between each active and placebo group was estimated by the difference in adjusted means together with the 95% CI for this difference. In order to control the overall type I error rate of 5%, a step-down approach was used, from highest to lowest dose.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Demographic characteristics</title><p>Of the 628 randomized patients, 569 comprised the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) population, and 559 of these completed the study. The baseline characteristics of the patients included in each treatment group (active and placebo) were identical. The mean RRTSS was 14.2 &#x000b1; 1.75, with no statistical significance between the groups.</p><p>The proportion of the overall population with mild intermittent asthma (GINA 1) was 8.8&#x02013;11.0% of patients and the proportion of polysensitized patients was 51.5&#x02013;57.4%.</p><p>At baseline, the patients who were sensitized to more than one allergen (polysensitized) were well matched across the treatment groups. The most common allergens were birch, ash, mugwort, ragweed and cat.</p><p>The mean treatment duration before the pollen season was similar in the four treatment groups (121.4 &#x000b1; 31.1 to 128.6 &#x000b1; 15.4 days in the safety population). The mean duration of the pollen season was 29.5 &#x000b1; 9.5 days.</p><p>Similarly, the four subgroups of patients with severe grass pollen allergy were well represented in the three active treatment

Based on these efficacy data, together with the safety profile, the Data Safety Monitoring Board recommended the 300 IR dose as the optimal dose for SLIT with grass allergens.</p><p>The percentage mean improvement in RTSS scores compared with placebo of 27% in the 300 IR group and 24% in the 500 IR group is considered clinically meaningful [13]. This magnitude of effect is similar to other recent studies using grass allergen SLIT tablets [14, 15].</p><p>Because immunotherapy is specific for the allergen, rather than for the disease, its use in polysensitized patients is still a matter of debate and no clinical trial has been designed to dissect the response of SLIT in patients with single vs. multiple sensitizations. In this study, we included patients who were allergic only to grass pollens (monosensitized) and patients who were allergic to grass pollen and to other tested allergens with symptoms outside the grass pollen season (polysensitized). No differences in terms of efficacy or safety were observed in patients who were polysensitized. This is of importance in clinical practice because the majority of allergic patients are polysensitized. Similar results were observed in a previous open-label study in patients sensitized to grass and birch, where SLIT with both allergens gave the best clinical results [16]. It is important to confirm these results so that SLIT can be offered to a wider population of patients in countries where its use is currently restricted to monosensitized patients [17].</p><p>Furthermore analysis showed that efficacy was achieved with the 300 IR dose regardless of the presence of underlying asthma. These results are important in terms of efficacy and safety of adequate treatment of AR in patients with concomitant asthma. The absence of significant systemic reactions in this group of patients with intermittent mild asthma emphasizes the safety of this approach [18]. Additionally, no subject with concomitant asthma was withdrawn from immunotherapy as a result of adverse events or perceived lack of efficacy.</p><p>In patients with severe rhinoconjunctivitis (as assessed by IgE class, SPT weal size or RRTSS), the 300 IR dose achieved a statistically significant treatment effect compared with placebo. The intensity of symptoms and consequences on QOL seem to be more important than a comprehensive list of symptoms of rhinitis. It is now well known that intensity and chronology can both be evaluated by symptoms. However, it seems to be more efficient for both practitioner and patient to talk about the impact of the disease rather than to simply list symptoms using medical words which are usually incomprehensible to the patient. The proposal of the ARIA expert panel defining the severity of AR based on QOL parameters is likely to simplify daily physician practice [2].</p><p>In these subgroups, the 300 IR dose had a similar safety profile as in the overall study population. In comparison with placebo, patients treated with the 300 IR dose achieved a statistically significant effect in all four sensitivity subgroups (<italic>P</italic>&#x02264;0.05).</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Regardless of sensitization (monosensitized/polysensitized) or concomitant mild asthma, both the 300 IR and 500 IR doses resulted in a significantly improved RTSS compared with placebo. Similarly in patients with severe rhinoconjunctivitis (as assessed by IgE level, RRTSS and SPT weal size), the 300 IR dose achieved a statistically significant treatment effect compared with placebo. The data also indicate that the relative safety profiles of the treatment were similar across all four sensitivity subgroups of patients, suggesting that the doses of SLIT administered in this study were well tolerated in all four subgroups of patients investigated. All these complementary analyses support the use of 300 IR tablets in grass pollen-allergic patients in clinical practice.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="b1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Plaut</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Valentine</surname><given-names>MD</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Clinical practice.
