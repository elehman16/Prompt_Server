Our results indicate that the DNA C plus NYVAC C vaccine regimen was highly immunogenic, as indicated by the detection of T cell responses in 90% of vaccinees and was superior to responses induced by NYVAC C alone (33% of responders). The vaccine-induced T cell responses were (a) vigorous in the case of the env response (mean 480 spot-forming units/10<sup>6</sup> mononuclear cells at weeks 26/28), (b) polyfunctional for both CD4 and CD8 T cell responses, (c) broad (the average number of epitopes was 4.2 per responder), and (d) durable (T cell responses were present in 70% of vaccinees at week 72). The vaccine-induced T cell responses were strongest and most frequently directed against Env (91% of vaccines), but smaller responses against Gag-Pol-Nef were also observed in 48% of vaccinees.

All past experience suggests that a vaccine will be the only intervention able to control the HIV epidemic. Although many successful antiretroviral drugs have been developed with enormous impact on HIV-associated morbidity and mortality, access to antiretroviral therapy remains limited to only 5% of the total population of HIV-infected subjects in developing countries (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Even in the face of open access to therapy, HIV transmission continues.</p><p>Over the past 10 yr there has been a progressive increase in resources for vaccine research, allowing the generation of several candidate vaccines capable of stimulating anti-HIV immunity (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). The ideal HIV vaccine should be safe, thermostable, able to elicit both humoral (antibody) and cellular (both CD4 and CD8 T cells) effector functions, and to induce durable protective immunity (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). The goal of the &#x0201c;antibody&#x0201d; vaccines is to induce neutralizing antibodies to provide immunity that prevents or limits infection; so far, these have been recombinant envelope protein vaccines (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). One envelope protein vaccine has been tested in a phase III efficacy clinical trial, without any protective effect (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). This candidate, as well as other tested envelope protein vaccine candidates, induces antibodies with neutralizing activity against laboratory-adapted strains of HIV-1, but these antibodies are largely ineffective against primary HIV-1 isolates. Strategies to develop high titres of neutralizing antibodies with broad activity against primary HIV-1 isolates remain elusive.</p><p>In contrast, relatively significant advances have been made in the development of &#x0201c;T cell&#x0201d; vaccine candidates. T cell vaccines are unlikely to prevent infection but may control HIV replication after infection, leading to attenuation of HIV disease (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). The scientific rationale for developing T cell vaccines is based on several observations, including: (a) the presence of vigorous CD4 and CD8 HIV-1&#x02013;specific T cell responses in HIV-1&#x02013;infected subjects that are long-term nonprogressors (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>); (b) the in vivo observation in the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) model of AIDS in macaques that the depletion of CD8 T cells is associated with rapid loss of control of virus replication (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>); and (c) the recent observation that CD4 and CD8 T cell responses endowed with multiple functional capacities, particularly IL-2 secretion and proliferation in addition to typical effector functions (cytotoxic activity and secretion of IFN-&#x003b3;, TNF-&#x003b1;, and MIP-1&#x003b2;), are associated with better control of virus replication (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).</p><p>Most T cell vaccines use virus vectors to induce T cell immunity, particularly adenovirus and poxvirus vectors (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Adenovirus vectors used alone or in combination with plasmid DNA-based vaccines have been shown to induce vigorous T cell responses (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). However, the high seroprevalence to adenoviruses in target populations remains a major issue for adenovirus vectors, even though recent data seem to indicate that vector immunity may be circumvented by higher vaccine doses and/or combination with DNA-based vaccines (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Vector immunity seems to be a lesser problem for poxvirus vector&#x02013;based T cell vaccines, due to the diminishing prevalence of a vaccinia-experienced population.</p><p>The efficiency of poxvirus vectors in eliciting T cell responses has been variable (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Limited immunogenicity (17% response) has been shown in a study using recombinant DNA in combination with a modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) expressing Gag protein (consensus of HIV-1 clade A) and several immunodominant CD8 T cell epitopes (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). A more recent study using the same vaccines at a higher dose showed enhanced immunogenicity (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). However, the response rate based on ex vivo functional analysis (IFN-&#x003b3; ELISPOT and proliferation) remained limited at a 40% response, and the T cell responses induced were exclusively due to CD4 T cells. Similarly, the ex vivo immunogenicity of a canarypox candidate vaccine, ALVAC, currently being tested in combination with an Env protein vaccine in a phase III clinical trial, was in the range of 30% (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). This work describes the immunogenicity of a prime-boost regimen composed of recombinant DNA and the poxvirus vector NYVAC, both expressing common immunogens consisting of Env, Gag, Pol, and Nef proteins of the HIV-1 clade C isolate CN54. We performed a comprehensive functional analysis of the vaccine-induced T cell responses, including quantification of T cell responses by IFN-&#x003b3; ELISPOT and functional characterization of CD4 and CD8 T cell responses (IFN-&#x003b3;, IL-2, and TNF-&#x003b1; secretion, proliferation, and degranulation activity) by polychromatic flow cytometry and epitope mapping. Our results indicate that the DNA/NYVAC vaccine combination induced ex vivo T cell responses in 90% of immunized volunteers and that these responses were vigorous, polyfunctional, broad, and durable.</p><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>The main objectives of the EuroVacc 02 (EV02) trial were to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of the prime-boost regimen, DNA C plus NYVAC C, compared with NYVAC C alone. The DNA and the poxvirus vector NYVAC both expressed fused Gag-Pol-Nef and the gp120 subunit of Env of the HIV-1 clade C isolate, CN54 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). The design was open for participants and clinical investigators, without a placebo control, and 40 volunteers were randomized to receive DNA C or nothing on day 0 and at week 4, followed by NYVAC C at weeks 20 and 24 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). The participants received 2 &#x000d7; 2-ml injections of DNA C (1.05 mg per ml and a total dose of 4.2 mg) intramuscularly in the right and left vastus lateralis and a 1-ml injection of NYVAC C (10<sup>7.7</sup> CCID<sub>50</sub> per ml) intramuscularly in the deltoid. The primary immunogenicity endpoints were measured at weeks 26 and 28 by the quantification of T cell responses using the IFN-&#x003b3; ELISPOT assay. The T cell responses were also measured on day 0 and at weeks 5, 20, 24, and 48. Comprehensive analyses of the demographics of the trial population and of the safety of the vaccine regimens have been described (unpublished data and reference <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). The results indicated that both DNA C and NYVAC C candidate vaccines are safe and well tolerated.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>

As mentioned above, T cell responses were measured at different time points during the 48-wk study using the IFN-&#x003b3; ELISPOT assay. The primary immunogenicity endpoints were, however, evaluated on the basis of the proportion of subjects with positive vaccine-induced T cell responses at weeks 26 and 28. There was a clear and significant difference (P = 0.003) in the proportion of subjects with positive vaccine&#x02013;induced T cell responses within the two study groups. The proportion of responders was 90% (18 out of 20) in the DNA C plus NYVAC C group compared with 40% (6 out of 15) in the NYVAC C&#x02013;alone group (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). Based on an intention-to-treat analysis of all 40 participants (assuming that missing equals no response) 83% (19 out of 23) in the DNA C plus NYVAC C group responded compared with 35% (6 out of 17) in the NYVAC C&#x02013;alone group (difference 47%; 95% confidence interval 20&#x02013;75%; P = 0.0034). It is important to note that one of the six responders in the NYVAC C&#x02013;alone group had a detectable response (in the range of 200 spot-forming units [SFU]/10<sup>6</sup> cells) not only at weeks 26 and 28, but also at weeks 5 and 20 before vaccination. Therefore, although this subject had to be considered positive at weeks 26 and 28, the T cell response observed was clearly nonspecific and was not considered for analyses. On the basis of the above considerations, the proportion of subjects with vaccine-induced specific T cell responses was 33% (5 out of 15) in the group vaccinated with NYVAC C alone. The assessment of vaccine-induced T cell responses at different time points has indicated that the proportion of responders after the DNA C vaccination was low, for instance 10% at week 5 after two vaccinations and 35% at week 20 before NYVAC C boost (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>). Furthermore, the proportion of responders in the DNA C plus NYVAC C group mostly peaked (17 out of 20) at week 24, 4 wk after the first NYVAC C boost, and the proportion of responders was still 80% at week 48, 6 mo after the completion of the vaccination (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). Only two subjects within the NYVAC C&#x02013;alone group maintained positive vaccine&#x02013;induced T cell responses at week 48 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>

In the EV02 trial, we demonstrate that DNA plus NYVAC is a highly immunogenic prime-boost regimen, with durable responses up to 1 yr after vaccination. The primary analysis of the vaccine-induced T cell responses was performed using a validated IFN-&#x003b3; ELISPOT assay. Polychromatic flow cytometry was used to characterize the phenotypic and the functional profiles of the vaccine-induced T cell populations. Furthermore, both the IFN-&#x003b3; ELISPOT assay and polychromatic flow cytometry were instrumental in analyzing the breadth of the vaccine-induced T cell responses and for performing epitope mapping. All the analyses have been performed on frozen blood mononuclear cell samples, and the evaluation of the immunogenicity has been assessed in the IFN-&#x003b3; ELISPOT assay after a conventional overnight stimulation of the blood mononuclear cells, with the panel of peptide pools encompassing Env, Gag, Pol, and Nef of HIV-1 clade C CN54.</p><p>The majority (18 out of 20, 90%) of the volunteers immunized with the DNA C plus NYVAC C regimen had a positive response using the IFN-&#x003b3; ELISPOT assay at weeks 26 or 28, the primary endpoints of the study. The percentage of responders in the NYVAC C&#x02013;alone group was 33%. These results were superior to previous studies that have evaluated the immunogenicity of DNA plus poxvirus (MVA) vaccine regimens in which the percentage of responders was 17% (low dose DNA) and &#x0223c;40% (high dose DNA) when conventional overnight stimulation was performed to analyze IFN-&#x003b3;&#x02013;secreting cells (as used in EV02) (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Responses were observed in the eight volunteers in the high dose DNA plus MVA study only using a cultured ELISPOT assay (5-d stimulation) able to detect weak vaccine-induced T cell responses (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). The immunogenicity observed in EV02 was also higher than that observed in studies using Ad5-based vaccine strategies and in the same range of studies using DNA plus Ad5 regimens (unpublished data).</p><p>Vaccine-induced IFN-&#x003b3;&#x02013;secreting cells were detected only in 7 out of 20 volunteers after DNA C vaccination and before NYVAC C boosting. However, despite the fact that vaccine-induced T cell responses were not measurable in the majority of volunteers after the two DNA vaccinations, the DNA priming was clearly responsible for the substantial increase in the immunogenicity and magnitude (see below) of the vaccine-induced T cell responses in the DNA C plus NYVAC C group compared with the NYVAC C&#x02013;alone group. These results indicate that the assessment of immunogenicity after immunization with DNA alone is not a reliable measure of the priming ability of DNA candidate vaccines.</p><p>Collectively, these results indicate that the DNA C plus NYVAC C regimen is superior to the NYVAC C&#x02013;alone regimen and has a degree of immunogenicity comparable to that of other promising candidate vaccines that have entered large phase II/IIB clinical studies (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>).</p><p>The magnitude of the vaccine-induced T cell responses as measured by the frequency of IFN-&#x003b3;&#x02013;secreting cells using the ELISPOT assay was substantially higher (three- to fourfold) in the DNA C plus NYVAC C group compared with the NYVAC C&#x02013;alone group. The magnitude of the vaccine-induced T cell responses observed after DNA C plus NYVAC C immunization was superior to that observed in previous DNA plus MVA studies (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) and comparable to that of Ad5 candidate vaccines and to the DNA plus Ad5 vaccine combination (unpublished data).</p><p>The vaccine-induced T cell responses were predominantly (in 100% of responders) mediated by CD4 T cells. However, CD8 T cell responses were also found in 47% of responders. Furthermore, both vaccine-induced CD4 and CD8 T cell responses were predominantly directed against Env (the median magnitude of Env T cell responses in the DNA C plus NYVAC C group vs. the NYVAC C&#x02013;alone group was 299 and 131 SFU/10<sup>6</sup> cells, respectively). T cell responses against Gag, Pol, and Nef were detected in 48% of volunteers and had lower magnitude (the median magnitude of Gag-, Pol-, and Nef-specific T cell responses was &#x0223c;100 SFU/10<sup>6</sup> cells).</p><p>The finding of predominant CD4 T cell responses after immunization with DNA C plus NYVAC C is consistent with previous studies (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) investigating the T cell responses induced by poxvirus candidate vaccines. The predominant CD4 T cell response after immunization with vaccines including poxviruses seems to differentiate these latter from Ad5-based candidate vaccines and the DNA plus Ad5 vaccine regimen that appear to induce more balanced CD4 and CD8 T cell responses (unpublished data). Three factors may have contributed to the dominant CD4 T cell and Env-specific responses: (a) the DNA priming that seems to favor the development of the CD4 T cell response; (b) the monovalent nature of the NYVAC C construct in which Env, Gag, Pol, and Nef are expressed within the same vector; and (c) the construction of the NYVAC vector with regard to Env, which is expressed in a secreted form. The use of multivalent instead of monovalent DNA and Ad5-based vaccines may reduce the Env immunodominance in favor of more balanced Env, Gag, and Pol responses. The secreted form of Env is likely to be responsible for favoring the exogenous pathway of antigen presentation and thus stimulation of CD4 T cells.</p><p>In natural infection studies, it has been reported that Gag-specific CD8 T cell responses are associated with better control of HIV disease in individuals with chronic HIV-1 infection, whereas Env-specific CD8 T cell responses are associated with poor control (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). However, it is not clear from this study whether (a) Gag-specific CD8 T cell responses are the cause or rather the effect of lower levels of virus replication, and (b) results generated in the nonhuman primate model have shown that the presence of Env- and Gag-specific vaccine-induced T cell responses in animals immunized with DNA plus Ad5 expressing Env and Gag conferred better protection from disease after infection compared with animals immunized with DNA plus Ad5 Gag-expressing vaccines (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>).</p><p>The DNA C plus NYVAC C vaccine regimen induced CD4 T cell responses in 100% of the immunized individuals and CD8 T cell responses in 50% of vaccines. In this regard, it is important to mention that the presence of the vaccine-induced CD4 T cell responses strongly correlated with the containment of viremia in macaques exposed to the highly pathogenic SIV<sub>mac251</sub> after immunization with the DNA-SIV-<italic>gag-env</italic> plus NYVAC-SIV-<italic>gag-pol-env</italic> (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Therefore, vaccine-induced CD4 T cell responses may be effective in the attenuation of HIV disease.</p><p>Env- and Gag-specific CD4 and CD8 T cell responses induced by DNA C plus NYVAC C vaccination were polyfunctional. Recently (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), the term polyfunctional has been used to define T cell responses that, in addition to typical effector functions such as secretion of IFN-&#x003b3;, TNF-&#x003b1;, and MIP-1&#x003b2;, as well as cytotoxic activity, comprise T cell populations also able to secrete IL-2 and retain antigen-specific proliferation capacity, whereas the term &#x0201c;only-effector&#x0201d; defines T cell responses/populations with typical effector functions but lacking IL-2 and proliferation capacity. Of interest, several studies (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>) have demonstrated that polyfunctional and not only-effector T cell responses were associated with protective antiviral immunity (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). The DNA C plus NYVAC C immunization therefore induced the best functional profile of virus-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells capable of controlling virus replication in several chronic virus infections, such as cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, herpes simplex virus, and HIV-1 in patients with nonprogressive disease (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). These data are consistent with our previous study demonstrating that vaccine-induced CD8 T cells after vaccination with DNA C plus NYVAC C were highly polyfunctional and that almost 75% of these cells had four or five functions based on IFN-&#x003b3;, TNF-&#x003b1;, MIP-1&#x003b2;, IL-2, and CD107a (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>).</p><p>The polyfunctional vaccine-induced CD4 T cell populations were CD45RA<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CCR7<sup>&#x02212;</sup>, a phenotype of cells with effector functions but also with the ability to secrete IL-2 and endowed with proliferation capacity (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). The phenotype of the vaccine-induced CD4 T cells remained unchanged over time. The vaccine-induced CD8 T cells were either CD45RA<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CCR7<sup>&#x02212;</sup> or CD45RA<sup>+</sup>CCR7<sup>&#x02212;</sup>. This phenotypic profile defines memory CD8 T cells at intermediate and advanced stages of differentiation and is consistent with our recent study using CD27 and CD45RO (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). The presence and rapid appearance after immunization of CD45RA<sup>+</sup>CCR7<sup>&#x02212;</sup> CD8 T cells is of interest. This phenotype has been proposed to define effector CD8 T cells at advanced stages of differentiation (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Furthermore, virus-specific CD45RA<sup>+</sup>CCR7<sup>&#x02212;</sup> CD8 T cells have been found in controlled chronic virus infections such as CMV and EBV (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>), and a correlation between the percentage of this cell population and virus control has also been shown in HIV-1 infection (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). The majority of the vaccine-induced CD45RA<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CCR7<sup>&#x02212;</sup> CD8 T cell population disappeared over time, whereas &#x0223c;90% of vaccine-induced CD8 T cells were CD45RA<sup>+</sup>CCR7<sup>&#x02212;</sup> at week 48, 6 mo after the last immunization. Therefore, the DNA C plus NYVAC C vaccination likely induces the generation of a long-lived population of memory CD8 T cells.</p><p>Of interest, the DNA C plus NYVAC C vaccination induced a broad T cell response, with a mean 4.2 epitopes recognized per volunteer. About 50% of epitopes identified in the EV02 study have not previously been described according to the Los Alamos database (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), and approximately two out of three of the total epitopes identified were located in constant regions.</p><p>A critical component of the effectiveness of vaccines is their ability to induce long-lasting immunity. The results obtained in EV02 study after vaccination with DNA C plus NYVAC C are extremely promising. More than 70% of volunteers have still measurable vaccine-induced T cell responses 1 yr after the last vaccination and, more importantly, the magnitude of the T cell responses is not substantially changed compared with 1 mo after the completion of the vaccination regimen.</p><p>Poxvirus vectors have traditionally represented an interesting platform in the HIV vaccine arena because of (a) their large and successful use in the veterinary field, (b) extensive safety data in humans, (c) their use in vaccine platforms for other infectious diseases and cancer, and (d) their facility to be manipulated and to be inserted with large gene fragments (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). However, disappointing results on their immunogenicity in humans had seriously cast doubt on the validity of the poxvirus platform and the rationale for their further development in the HIV vaccine arena. The present data generated within the EV02 study have clearly demonstrated that a poxvirus candidate vaccine, NYVAC, in combination with DNA is highly immunogenic, induces vigorous and broad T cell responses, comprising of both CD4 and CD8 T cell responses, which are polyfunctional, and more importantly, this vaccine regimen induces long-lasting T cell immunity.</p><p>These promising results support the further development of the poxvirus platform and the move of the DNA C plus NYVAC C vaccine regimen into larger clinical trials.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>DNA immunogens GagPolNef (GPN) and Env.</title><p>RNA- and codon-optimized GPN and Env gene vector inserts were designed by GENEART AG using the GeneOptimizer software package. Clade B/C' GPN and Env (gp120) sequences were designed based on sequence information derived from a 97CN54 provirus clone (sequence submitted to GeneBank) (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). The HIV C clade isolate CRF_70 B/C' 97CN54 was collected from Sinkiang Province in China, biologically characterized, and sequenced in a collaboration of China CDC (the Chinese Academy for Preventive Medicine) and the European Commission&#x02013;funded research cluster CHIVAC 1&#x02013;3 in an attempt to generate region-specific candidate vaccines. This and subsequently detected, closely related variants represent at least 60% of HIV infections in China and are anti-genetically also close to other C clade isolates from India and South and East Africa. The CN54 Env construct comprises 1,500 nucleotides encoding an artificial signal peptide (MDRAKLLLLL LLLLLPQAQ), followed by gp120 CN54 (nucleotides 5,673&#x02013;7,109). The 5&#x02032; part of the 4,254 nucleotide CN54 GPN polygene construct encodes the group-specific antigen (nucleotides 167&#x02013;1,651) with a G2A modification rendering this polyprotein myristylation deficient.

The 3&#x02032; pol reading frame (nucleotides 2,527&#x02013;3,591) lacking the integrase gene was extended by the 3&#x02032; end of the scrambled Nef gene. The sequence stretch (nucleotides 2,407&#x02013;2,514) encoding the active site of the reverse transcription (amino acids 1,382&#x02013;1,417 in GPN) was translocated to the 3&#x02032; end of the polygene construct, resulting in an open reading frame encoding the &#x0223c;160-kD nonglycosylated artificial GPN polyprotein. Both genes were placed under direct control of CMV IE promoter/enhancer to generate pORT1a-GPN and pORT1a-gp120, lacking any antibiotic resistance gene and instead using a repressor titration system for plasmid selection (Cobra Biomanufacturing Plc.)
