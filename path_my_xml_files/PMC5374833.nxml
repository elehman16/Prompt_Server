Adequate depth of anesthesia is essential during insertion of LMA to obtund the hemodynamic responses and airway reflexes. Lighter plane of anesthesia during LMA insertion can lead to airway complications[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] while a deeper plane can result in hypotension and bradycardia.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] The clinical markers commonly used to assess the adequacy of anesthesia for LMA insertion in both adults and children include measured dose of intravenous anesthetic,[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] loss of verbal response (LOV),[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] loss of eyelash reflex (LOE), jaw relaxation,[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] end-tidal (ET) concentration of volatile anesthetics,[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] weighed syringe drop technique,[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and jaw thrust (JT) maneuver.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] LOV and LOE are associated with lighter planes of anesthesia and are not suitable indicators.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] ET anesthetic concentration depends on age, gender, body weight, dose, and cardiac output, and its use is impractical because of a long equilibration time of 10&#x02013;15 min.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] TPZ and JT have been found to reliably assess adequate anesthetic depth for LMA insertion in adults as well as children.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] In adults, TPZ was a superior indicator of adequate conditions for LMA insertion than JT under sevoflurane anesthesia,[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] whereas JT was a good clinical indicator under propofol anesthesia.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] As sevoflurane is the most common inhalational agent used for induction of anesthesia in children, and TPZ and JT have not been compared in children under sevoflurane anesthesia, we planned to assess the LMA insertion characteristics following TPZ and JT maneuver in children anesthetized with sevoflurane.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Material and Methods</title><p>The present study was a randomized prospective comparative study, conducted between June 2012 and December 2013. After the Institutional Ethics Committee approval (NK/375/MD/9753-54) and written informed parental consent, 124 children of age 2&#x02013;8 years and the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Physical Status I or II undergoing minor surgical procedures such as orthopedic or urologic surgery were enrolled in the study. The trial was not registered in the Central Trial Registry of India. Children with predicted difficult intubation and ventilation, acute respiratory tract infection, and previous history of or family history of malignant hyperthermia were excluded from the study. Children were randomized into group TPZ (<italic>n</italic> = 62) and group JT (<italic>n</italic> = 62) by computer-generated random number table which was kept in sequentially numbered opaque envelopes.</p><p>All children were premedicated with oral midazolam 0.5 mg/kg about 30 min before the start of surgery. Parental separation of the child at the time of transfer to the operation theater was assessed using a 3-point sedation scale (1 = tearful/combative; 2 = alert/awake; 3 = drowsy/sleeping). The children were induced with 8% sevoflurane with oxygen at a fresh gas flow of 4 L/min. No neuromuscular blocking agent was used. Anesthesia was maintained with oxygen, nitrous oxide (FiO<sub>2</sub> =0.5), and sevoflurane (minimum alveolar concentration [MAC] = 2). TPZ or JT was performed as per randomization after 1 min of the start of sevoflurane and then every 20 s till the test was negative. At that point ET sevoflurane concentration and MAC were noted.</p><p>The trapezius is a flat muscle that extends from the back of the neck to the shoulder girdle. In group TPZ, approximately 1&#x02032;&#x02013;2&#x02032; of the trapezius muscle near the base of the neck was squeezed between thumb and index and middle fingers.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] In group JT, the JT was performed gently by lifting the angles of the mandible vertically upward. If required, the thumb was used to retract the lower lip to keep the mouth open. JT was relaxed to a previously tolerated level if a motor response was elicited. In both groups, the child was observed for motor responses such as gross purposeful movements and movement of great toe.</p><p>A classic LMA of requisite size was inserted immediately after a negative response to TPZ or JT tests by an anesthesiologist who was not involved with the study and who was blinded as to how the end-point was achieved. An anesthetist with &#x0003e;3 years of experience inserted the LMA. The conditions at insertion of LMA were scored by a variable scoring system (score of 18 = excellent, 16&#x02013;17 = satisfactory, &#x0003c;15 = poor).[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Effective ventilation was determined by observing chest wall movement, auscultation, and capnography. The insertion time was measured from sevoflurane administration to the negative TPZ or JT tests. Monitoring included electrocardiogram, noninvasive blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and ETCO<sub>2</sub>. The above parameters were recorded before induction, every minute till the insertion of LMA and then every 5 min till the end of the procedure. The number of attempts of LMA insertion was recorded.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>In a previous study, JT had a success rate of detecting adequate depth of anesthesia for LMA insertion in 70% of patients.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] To detect a 90% success rate with TPZ with an alpha error of 0.05 and power of 0.8, the sample size was determined to be 62 patients.</p><p>Continuous variables were expressed as mean and standard deviation and compared using unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test.

Four children were excluded in the JT group: LMA insertion was not attempted because of a technical problem with sevoflurane vaporizer in two children, in one child, vomiting occurred during the induction of anesthesia, and LMA insertion was abandoned in favor of endotracheal intubation and in another child, LMA insertion was attempted thrice; however, the correct placement was not successful, following which endotracheal intubation was performed [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>].</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Consort flow chart of patients</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JOACP-33-71-g001"/></fig><p>There were no significant demographic differences between the two groups with respect to age, gender, and weight.

The insertion conditions, number of insertion attempts, and the success of LMA insertion were similar with both the methods. However, the time for LMA insertion was significantly longer in patients where TPZ was used for assessing the depth of anesthesia when compared to the JT. The ET sevoflurane concentration was comparable in both groups at the time of LMA insertion. Neither of the techniques was associated with any clinically significant hemodynamic change.</p><p>LMA insertion needs an optimal and adequate depth of anesthesia to prevent untoward hemodynamic and airway complications, especially in children who are more prone to these problems. Many subjective and objective predictors have been utilized to assess the adequate plane of anesthesia for inserting the LMA. However, a simple, cost-effective, reliable, repeatable, reproducible, and precise clinical predictor which is devoid of side effects is desirable.</p><p>In our study, LMA was successfully inserted in all 59 children of TPZ group (100%) and in 61 of 62 children of JT group (98%). Earlier prospective studies using TPZ during sevoflurane anesthesia in children have found a success rate of LMA insertion of 91%&#x02013;96%.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] These studies, however, did not compare TPZ with JT technique for assessing the success of LMA insertion. These techniques have been compared in adults in a prospective randomized controlled study, where a higher success rate of 96% was found with TPZ compared to 72% with JT method.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>We defined the LMA insertion time as the time from the start of sevoflurane till the time the tests became negative and found it to be significantly longer in TPZ group (145 &#x000b1; 28.7 s) as compared to JT group (111.8 &#x000b1; 31.0 s). This time in our study is much shorter than that reported in the other studies. Chang <italic>et al</italic>. using TPZ as an indicator of optimal conditions for LMA insertion in children showed the elapsed time to complete insertion of LMA of 342 &#x000b1; 114 s.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] The same authors in adults observed that the time needed for LMA insertion in TPZ and JT groups was 246 s and 150 s, respectively.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Hooda <italic>et al</italic>. using TPZ as an indicator of optimal conditions for LMA insertion in children showed that elapsed time to complete insertion of LMA was 271 s.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] This difference in the time needed to achieve a negative response to JT or trapezius squeeze may be related to the difference in the conduct of anesthesia. In the studies quoted above, anesthesia was induced with a semiclosed-circuit system, which was primed with 6% sevoflurane. In contrast, we used 8% sevoflurane with a Jackson Rees' modification of Ayre's T-Piece for induction. The higher sevoflurane concentration probably helped in achieving a faster depth of anesthesia in our study.</p><p>There was also a difference in the ET sevoflurane concentration achieved for the test to become negative between Chang's study and our study.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] In Chang's study, the ET sevoflurane concentration was significantly higher in the trapezius squeeze group (4.1% &#x000b1; 0.7%) than in the JT (3.2% &#x000b1; 0.9%) group. This suggested that the JT maneuver is not an adequate stimulus for assessing the anesthetic depth for LMA insertion in adults. However, these results from the adult population cannot be extrapolated to the pediatric population. In our study, the ET sevoflurane concentration was higher than that in the Chang's study but was similar in the trapezius (6.1%) and JT (6%) groups. Children when compared to adults require a higher MAC because they have high alveolar ventilation and a small functional residual capacity; the combination of which enhances the rise of alveolar concentration and a rapid delivery of inhalational anesthetics to the brain. Furthermore, MAC values of sevoflurane are very high in infants. A study by the same author in pediatric population using TPZ as the clinical indicator for optimal LMA insertion conditions had an ET sevoflurane concentration of 3.6 &#x000b1; 1.1 vol%.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] In this study, the children were premedicated with thiopental sodium 3 mg/kg for parental separation which may have contributed to the lower ET concentration of sevoflurane for LMA insertion. In our study, in JT group, five children had poor LMA insertion conditions compared to none in the TPZ group. This probably indicates that the intensity of noxious stimulus produced by trapezius squeeze is more than JT; therefore, it took a longer time to make the test negative.</p><p>HR, as well as blood pressure (systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, mean blood pressure), decreased in both of the groups after LMA insertion although the fall was &#x0003c;20% from the baseline. The absence of an increase in these hemodynamic parameters after insertion of LMA indicates that the tests were successful in assessing the adequacy of anesthetic depth. Children in the TPZ group had significantly lower HRs as compared to the children in the JT group which lasted up to 5 min after LMA insertion. This could be due to longer insertion time in TPZ group (145 s) than in JT group (111 s) leading to longer duration of sevoflurane exposure in the children in TPZ group.</p><p>A limitation of this study is that these findings cannot be applied to children of ages other than 2&#x02013;8 years, especially infants, in whom the MAC is different. Furthermore, our findings are limited to the anesthetic technique used by us, i.e., premedication with midazolam followed by induction with 8% sevoflurane and maintenance with nitrous oxide and sevoflurane and cannot be extrapolated to different anesthetic techniques.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In adults, the success rate with JT is low, about 70%, and it increases to about 90% with TPZ. Our study shows that JT and trapezius squeeze are equivalent clinical indicators in predicting the optimal conditions for insertion of LMA in spontaneously breathing children under sevoflurane anesthesia. However, the time taken to achieve a negative TPZ is longer.</p><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Chang</surname><given-names>CH</given-names></name><name><surname>Shim</surname><given-names>YH</given-names></name><name><surname>Shin</surname><given-names>YS</given-names></name><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>KY</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Optimal conditions for Laryngeal Mask Airway insertion in children can be determined by the trapezius squeezing test</article-title><source>J Clin Anesth</source><year>2008</year><volume>20</volume><fpage>99</fpage><lpage>102</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">18410863</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Blake</surname><given-names>DW</given-names></name><name><surname>Dawson</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Donnan</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Bjorksten</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Propofol induction for laryngeal mask airway insertion: Dose requirement and cardiorespiratory effects</article-title><source>Anaesth Intensive Care</source><year>1992</year><volume>20</volume><fpage>479</fpage><lpage>83</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">1463177</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Naguib</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Sari-Kouzel</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Seraj</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>el-Gammal</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Gomma</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Induction dose-responses studies with propofol and thiopentone</article-title><source>Br J Anaesth</source><year>1992</year><volume>68</volume><fpage>308</fpage><lpage>10</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">1547057</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Matta</surname><given-names>BF</given-names></name><name><surname>Marsh</surname><given-names>DS</given-names></name><name><surname>Nevin</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Laryngeal mask airway: A more successful method of insertion</article-title><source>J Clin Anesth</source><year>1995</year><volume>7</volume><fpage>132</fpage><lpage>5</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">7598921</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Taguchi</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Watanabe</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Asakura</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><name><surname>Inomata</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>End-tidal sevoflurane concentrations for laryngeal mask airway insertion and for tracheal intubation in children</article-title><source>Anesthesiology</source><year>1994</year><volume>81</volume><fpage>628</fpage><lpage>31</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">8092509</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref6"><label>6</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Martlew</surname><given-names>RA</given-names></name><name><surname>Meakin</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Wadsworth</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Sharples</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Baker</surname><given-names>RD</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Dose of propofol for laryngeal mask airway insertion in children: Effect of premedication with midazolam</article-title><source>Br J Anaesth</source><year>1996</year><volume>76</volume><fpage>308</fpage><lpage>9</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">8777116</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref7"><label>7</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Stoneham</surname><given-names>MD</given-names></name><name><surname>Bree</surname><given-names>SE</given-names></name><name><surname>Sneyd</surname><given-names>JR</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Facilitation of laryngeal mask insertion.
