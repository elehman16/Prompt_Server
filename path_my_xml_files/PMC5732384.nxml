It has been estimated that by the year 2030 more than 20% of the adults will suffer from OA in the western countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] which leads to increasing global health costs. Current pharmacologic treatment only allows management of symptoms without effects on disease progression and may be associated with potential adverse side effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The perceived burden of suffering often prompts patients to seek therapeutic alternatives, e.g. plant-derived remedies. Dietary factors or supplements have been discussed as options in the management or prevention of OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and their potential as chondroprotectives has been investigated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par33">A dietary supplement which has shown clinical effects in patients with mild forms of knee OA (Kellgren-Lawrence grade I and II) is the standardized maritime pine bark extract Pycnogenol&#x000ae; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In three double-blind randomized placebo-controlled studies with 37&#x02013;159 patients receiving 100&#x000a0;mg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] or 150&#x000a0;mg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] Pycnogenol&#x000ae; per day over three months, statistically significant reductions of the composite Western Ontario and McMaster Universities (WOMAC) score summarizing pain, joint stiffness and daily activities were observed. Additionally, a decrease in the concomitant use of analgesic drugs was reported. The cellular mechanisms responsible for the positive effects of Pycnogenol&#x000ae; on the clinical symptoms are unknown.</p><p id="Par34">The pine bark extract is a complex mixture of polyphenolic compounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. A pharmacokinetic study with volunteers ingesting Pycnogenol&#x000ae; revealed that catechin, caffeic acid, ferulic acid, and taxifolin were detectable in a nanomolar range in plasma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Moreover, a catechin metabolite (M1) produced by human intestinal bacteria was found in the plasma samples. Subsequent investigations showed that M1 exerted various anti-inflammatory effects in vitro such as the inhibition of the activity of the matrix metalloproteinases MMP-1, &#x02212;2 and &#x02212;9, decrease of the release of MMP-9 from human monocytes or inhibition of the expression of the inducible NO synthase (iNOS) in RAW 264.7 macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In other in vitro experiments using the whole extract a decrease of IL1B mRNA synthesis in RAW 264.7 cells was reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] as well as inhibitory effects on the expression of COX-2, IL-8 and iNOS in human chondrocytes and fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. However, since not all components of the extract are bioavailable and other bioactive molecules such as M1 are generated in vivo, it is not clear whether experiments using the whole extract would be indicative for cellular effects that actually occur in vivo.</p><p id="Par35">The results of in vitro and ex vivo approaches with the maritime pine bark extract are interesting in the context of the pathology of OA which is characterized by loss of articular cartilage and remodeling processes, pain and functional impairment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Destructive effects are related to an increase of cartilage catabolism while anabolic processes are suppressed. Various biomarkers are upregulated in OA patients and can be detected in serum or plasma samples, synovial fluid or urine. The pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1&#x003b2; actives various signal transduction pathways e.g. via NF-&#x003ba;B that result in upregulation of pro-inflammatory mediators and cartilage degrading proteolytic enzymes such as MMP-1, MMP-3 and MMP-13 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. MMPs degrade collagen and aggrecan, the major proteoglycan in human articular cartilage. Aggrecan is also targeted by another class of metalloproteinases, the aggrecanases-1 and -2, also known as &#x0201c;A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase with Thrombospondin Motifs&#x0201d; (ADAMTS4, &#x02212;5) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The role of different ADAMTS is not definitely resolved so far. In mice, ADAMTS-5 seems to be the most important enzyme degrading aggrecan molecule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. ADAMTS5 knockout mice are protected from cartilage loss, whereas ADAMTS4-KO mice are not [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In humans, both enzymes play a role in the pathophysiology of OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Cartilage degradation by MMPs, ADAMTS and also cathepsins generates various decomposition products such as type II collagen fragments, CTX-II (carboxy-terminal telepeptides of type II collagen) and Helix-II (type II collagen helical peptide) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Aggrecan depletion is indicated by sulfated glycosaminglycans (sGAG) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p id="Par36">So far research insights regarding the cellular effects of plant-based extracts or single constituents on relevant OA biomarkers have been gained from in vitro cell culture studies and experiments with animals receiving peroral or intra-articular treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. To the best of our knowledge there has been no approach reported which involves OA patients taking a plant extract and determines effects on biomarkers simultaneously in the participants&#x02019; articular cartilage, synovial fluid and serum. The purpose of the present pilot study was to span the knowledge gap between the reported clinical efficacy of Pycnogenol&#x000ae; and its in vivo mechanism of action in OA patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Patients and study design</title><p id="Par37">The present study was a randomized controlled clinical trial involving patients suffering from severe osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee according to the WOMAC score who were scheduled for an elective arthroplasty (Kellgren-Lawrence grade III-IV). Patients were not eligible if they regularly took NSAIDs or glucocorticoids p.o. within the past four weeks, if they currently received a therapy with anti-coagulants or if they were tested positive for HIV, HCV or HCB or if they had a previous or current infection of the affected knee joint. As rescue medication acetaminophen (paracetamol), tramadol or a combination of tilidine and naloxone was allowed. The study protocol was reviewed and approved (reference number 248/11) by the local Ethics Committee of the Medical Faculty of the University W&#x000fc;rzburg. The procedures followed were in accordance with the ethical standards of the Ethics Committee and with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as revised in 2000. Since the study primarily focused on pharmacokinetic/bioanalytical aspects (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]) an early registration was overlooked and the study was registered retroactively. The authors confirm that all their ongoing and related trials performed for this drug/intervention are registered.</p><p id="Par38">A total of 33 OA patients were recruited for the study and gave written informed consent. The number of participants was chosen based on an earlier pharmacokinetic study with healthy volunteers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. With respect to cellular pharmacodynamic effects the present study was of exploratory nature due to lack of reference data. The insights generated can be used as rational basis for future sample size calculations in similar study settings. Patients were randomized into two groups using a computer-generated randomization list which was not accessible to the physicians and nurses who were involved in the patient care and management. Study participants were either assigned to the treatment group (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x02009;16) receiving 200&#x000a0;mg Pycnogenol&#x000ae; (Horphag Research Ltd., Geneva, Switzerland) per day (twice daily two capsules with each 50&#x000a0;mg) over three weeks prior to the planned surgery or to the control group (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x02009;17) who received no Pycnogenol&#x000ae;. All patients were asked to refrain from polyphenol-rich food/beverages. Nutritional check-lists were provided for specifying food/beverages to avoid and for recording ingested items within the last two days before blood sampling.

Patients with end-stage OA were chosen since this was an ethical option to simultaneously obtain cartilage samples and synovial fluid along with blood samples. The recruited participants were considered as representative OA patients with a mean age of 64.3&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;8.2&#x000a0;years and an elevated BMI of 30.74&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;5.29&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Above the age of 60&#x000a0;years approximately twice as many women (18%) suffer from OA compared to men (9.6%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. This relation was also mirrored in the present study population which included 20 women and 10 men. After randomization half of the recruited patients received Pycnogenol&#x000ae; over three weeks prior to joint replacement surgery. In clinical studies previously investigating the effects Pycnogenol&#x000ae; on clinical symptoms the patients were treated over three months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. All studies revealed time-dependent effects on symptoms of OA, earliest statistically significant differences between Pycnogenol&#x000ae; and placebo regarding the overall WOMAC score were observed after six weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Since an improvement of OA symptoms is typically a &#x0201c;late&#x0201d; event we hypothesized that changes on a cellular level would occur earlier. The three weeks of Pycnogenol&#x000ae; intake in the present study were chosen on the basis of the time period that the clinicians routinely scheduled between pre-admission meetings with the patients and the surgery. During this meeting a basic examination was performed, the patients were supplied with the pine bark extract and pre-intervention blood samples were collected.</p><p id="Par62">Despite of the fact that three weeks of Pycnogenol&#x000ae; intake were comparatively short the expression analysis in the articular chondrocytes revealed for all but one parameter a downregulation of the respective gene in the Pycnogenol&#x000ae; group compared to controls. The decreased expressions of MMP3, MMP13 and IL1B genes were statistically significant when single factors contributing excessively to the data variability were excluded based on statistical procedures or documented non-adherence. A concomitant downregulation of IL1B and the MMPs is consistent with the accepted belief that the IL-1&#x003b2; protein is a strong inducer of MMP1, MMP3 and MMP13 expression as well as inducing its own upregulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In contrast, the aggrecanase ADAMTS5 was not downregulated suggesting that its expression in the patients&#x02019; articular chondrocytes was not or not entirely dependent on IL-1&#x003b2; exposure. Indeed, there are contradicting reports about the induction of ADAMTS5 by IL-1&#x003b2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The proteolytic cysteine protease cathepsin K (CTSK) which contributes to collagen and aggrecan degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] was downregulated in the Pycnogenol&#x000ae; group, but this effect did not reach statistical significance. Whilst numerous in vitro or in vivo studies with animals have demonstrated a down-regulation of MMPs and ADAMTS in chondrocytes by plant extracts or single constituents thereof [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], high doses are frequently used in such settings and it is unlikely that comparable concentrations could be achieved in human patients. Importantly, when using complex plant extracts it must be kept in mind that not all components are bioavailable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The present results demonstrate for the first time that bioactive components of the dietary supplement Pycnogenol&#x000ae; actually influence the gene expression in human articular chondrocytes in vivo.</p><p id="Par63">The determination of inflammatory or metabolic factors and matrix degradation products in patients&#x02019; synovial fluid samples revealed no statistically significant differences between the study groups, but showed distinct tendencies. The mean protein concentrations of both ADAMTS-4 and ADAMTS-5 were higher in the Pycnogenol&#x000ae; compared to the control group. The latter is consistent with the slightly elevated ADAMTS5 gene transcription in the patients&#x02019; chondrocytes. However, the increased aggrecanase concentrations in the synovial fluid were obviously not associated with higher proteolytic activity since the main degradation product of the ADAMTSs, the sulfated glucosamine glycans (sGAG; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]), were even slightly lower in the Pycnogenol&#x000ae; group. This might be explained by the fact that total ADAMTS concentrations were measured and not the aggrecanase activity. It is possible that higher ADAMTS-4 and ADAMTS-5 protein concentrations were paralleled by an increased production of the endogenous inhibitor TIMP-3 which inhibits both ADAMTSs at subnanomolar concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Another possibility is that post-translational processing of the ADAMTSs was not yet completed. The ADAMTSs are synthesized as zymogens and although they are assumed to be secreted as active enzymes ADAMTS-4 is further processed extracellularly to yield increased proteolytic activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p id="Par64">In the synovial fluid MMP protein concentrations were not clearly lower in the Pycnogenol&#x000ae; compared to the control group. Again, this appears to be inconsistent with the observed downregulation of MMP1, MMP3 and MMP13 gene expression in the patients&#x02019; chondrocytes. The same reasoning as discussed with the ADAMTS may apply to the MMPs as well. Notably, mean concentrations of unspecific degradation products, type II collagen fragments CTX-II and Helix-II, were reduced in the Pycnogenol&#x000ae; group by approximately 45% and 27%, respectively, compared to controls. CTX-II is mainly produced by MMP-1, MMP-3 and MMP-13 while Helix-II is generated at high amounts by cathepsin K [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. This suggests that despite no obvious differences in the total MMP protein concentrations an attenuated generation of collagen fragments was related to the intake of Pycnogenol&#x000ae;. The reduced Helix-II concentrations in the Pycnogenol&#x000ae; group were consistent with the slightly reduced cathepsin K gene expression in the patients&#x02019; chondrocytes.</p><p id="Par65">Determination of cartilage homeostasis markers in the serum samples revealed two remarkable results. There was a significant (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x02009;0.02 and <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x02009;0.001 after exclusion of a confirmed outlier) decrease of ADAMTS-5 protein concentrations in the Pycnogenol&#x000ae; group compared to control patients. This would be consistent with the anti-inflammatory properties and clinical effects of the pine bark extract in OA patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. The rise of ADAMTS-5 concentrations in the control group might be explained by a further progression of joint disease or by the fact that the patients were required to refrain from anti-inflammatory analgesics. Serum levels of ADAMTS-5 have been shown to be higher in OA patients compared to healthy controls and correlate with the stage of OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. The present study now provides the first evidence that serum ADAMTS-5 concentrations of OA patients decrease in response to a dietary supplement. The other finding of note is the decrease of MMP-13 protein concentrations in the Pycnogenol&#x000ae; group compared to control patients. The effect was not statistically significant as a consequence of the low sample numbers. Interestingly, in the Pycnogenol&#x000ae; group only four patients had measurable MMP-13 concentrations as opposed to seven patients in the control group. Blood levels of MMP-13 appear to be generally low. In a biomarker study with OA patients no MMP-13 was detected in a plasma preparation and only some patients had measurable levels in synovial fluid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].</p><p id="Par66">The data obtained in the present study were subjected to a correlation analysis to determine potential interrelations of biomarkers and the previously analyzed polyphenol concentrations in the respective specimen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. For the first time it was shown in a human study that higher gene expression levels of MMP3 in the patients&#x02019; cartilage significantly (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x02009;0.01) correlated with higher CTX-II protein levels in synovial fluid. This is consistent with in vitro results showing that MMP-3 efficiently released CTX-II [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p id="Par67">A significant inverse correlation (<italic>r</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x02009;&#x02212;0.761; <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x02009;0.007) was determined between MMP-3 protein levels in the patients&#x02019; synovial fluid and concentrations of ferulic acid in the same specimen. A causal relationship is likely as ferulic acid downregulates MMP3 gene expression in cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. In contrast, a direct correlation between MMP-13 protein concentrations and the levels of caffeic acid in serum (<italic>r</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x02009;0.789; <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x02009;0.02) is less explicable or supported by similar observations.

The patients in the control group did not receive a placebo. However, the current study did not aim at measuring clinical effects, e.g. symptoms reported by the patients. The aim was to investigate pharmacodynamic aspects on a cellular level as well as pharmacokinetic aspects (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]). To the best of our knowledge it is not possible to deliberately influence the concentration or expression of inflammatory or cartilage degradation markers. Therefore, we think that it was scientifically justified to have an untreated control group in the present pilot study. Unfortunately the variability of the obtained data was high. More pronounced group differences might have been detected with a higher number of patients. However, there was no pre-study data on the effect size of the pine bark extract on inflammatory or chondrometabolic markers in OA patients to allow for a rational calculation of the sample size. Yet, despite of the limited group sizes and the participants ignoring dietary restrictions regarding polyphenols various significant effects were uncovered. Thus, even under &#x02018;real life&#x02019; conditions with occasional or regular consumption of dietary polyphenols the intake of Pycnogenol&#x000ae; had additional cellular effects in patients with severe OA. Clearly, the benefit for the patients is not the change of inflammatory or cartilage degradation markers, but the reduction of OA clinical symptoms. The latter had already been shown in clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and our study now provides a rational basis for the reported clinical effects. A strength of the current study was that more than one reference gene was used for the gene expression analysis in accordance with the MIQE guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Most investigations concerning cartilage gene expressions use a single housekeeping gene, particularly GAPDH, which showed high variance in expression in our hands consistent with observations of others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] and emphasizes the importance of choosing more than one reliable reference gene. A further strength of the present investigation is that a number of biomarkers were analyzed on several levels, i.e. at both gene transcription and protein level in synovial fluid and serum. Thus, findings were substantiated by consistent observations made at different checkpoints of pathophysiologic pathways playing a role in OA.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par69">To summarize, in the present study cellular pharmacodynamic properties of Pycnogenol&#x000ae; were investigated in patients suffering from severe OA of the knee. For the first time the effects of a nutraceutical were systematically researched in patients&#x02019; chondrocytes, synovial fluid and serum in comparison with a control group.
