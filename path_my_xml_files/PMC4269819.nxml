During 2 consecutive cycles of 28&#x000a0;days, oral contraception was given for 21&#x000a0;days combined with 1&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;160&#x000a0;mg/day Silexan or placebo.

It exceeds the quality definition of the pharmacopoeial monograph with respect to items that are important for efficacy and tolerability. Randomised controlled clinical trials have demonstrated that Silexan is a potent anxiolytic drug with superior efficacy compared with placebo in subsyndromal anxiety disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In generalised anxiety disorder (GAD), Silexan was found to be comparably efficacious as lorazepam [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and at least as efficacious as paroxetine. The drug has a marketing authorisation in Germany for the symptomatic treatment of restlessness related to anxious mood, with a recommended dosage of 80&#x000a0;mg/d. While Silexan is a complex, multi-ingredient mixture, its anxiolytic properties have been ascribed in particular to linalool and linalyl acetate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>Anxiety disorders are by far the most prevalent psychiatric conditions in Western Europe and the USA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Their prevalence in women is at least twice as high as in men [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Since the prevalence of anxiety disorders tends to decrease rather than to increase with age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], a substantial proportion of the patients who seek treatment for anxiety are women of childbearing potential who may be practising oral contraception.</p><p>The steroid hormones contained in oral contraceptives are metabolised mainly through hydroxylation in the liver. Drugs that induce the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system, notably CYP3A4, reduce the bioavailability by increasing the first-pass metabolism of the oral contraceptive steroids and may therefore impair their efficacy, leading to breakthrough bleeding and, possibly, unwanted pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. A comprehensive list of drugs that induce CYP has been published by Rendic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. They include several anticonvulsants and broad spectrum antibiotics, rifampicin, griseofulvin, and anti-retroviral drugs.</p><p>Bioavailability is the rate and extent to which the active substance or active moiety is absorbed from a pharmaceutical form and becomes available at the site of action [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. As the use of herbal preparations increases in the general population, the potential for herb&#x02013;drug interactions also increases. Therefore, herbal products must be assessed for their efficacy and safety, including their potential for interactions with other drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Since women of childbearing potential who practise oral contraception represent an important part of the target population for which Silexan is intended, it is important to investigate whether the herbal drug may have an effect on the bioavailability and efficacy of oral contraceptives. Although a clinical study showed no induction of the CYP enzymes 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], suggesting that no increased activity in metabolization of contraceptive ingredients occurs during co-administration of Silexan, some examples of inhibition of phase-II enzymes, mainly UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs), by co-administered herbal drugs (e. g., Williams et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]) do exist. This study was therefore performed to investigate the relative bioavailability of ethinyl estradiol (EE) and levonorgestrel (LNG), the active ingredients of the monophasic combination oral contraceptive Microgynon<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, during co-administration of Silexan as compared with the administration of the oral contraceptive alone, as well as any attenuating effect on contraceptive efficacy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Experimental Procedures</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Protocol and Design, Objectives</title><p>The investigation was performed as a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, monocentric, crossover study in healthy volunteers whose primary objective was to assess the interacting potential of Silexan with the pharmacokinetic properties of EE and LNG, the active ingredients of the combination oral contraceptive Microgynon<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>. An important secondary objective was to assess whether Silexan had an effect on the suppressive efficacy of Microgynon<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> on hormonal and ovarian status.</p><p>The protocol was reviewed and approved by an independent ethics committee. All subjects provided written informed consent. The principles of Good Clinical Practice and the Declaration of Helsinki were adhered to.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Participants</title><p>The study participants were healthy, female, premenopausal volunteers aged between 18 and 38&#x000a0;years (smokers had to be&#x000a0;&#x02264;30&#x000a0;years of age, and those with a consumption of more than ten cigarettes per day were excluded), who presented with a body mass index between 18 and 30&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>. For eligibility for randomised treatment, subjects had to take Microgynon<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> for at least 2 cycles before randomisation, with a &#x02018;usual&#x02019; 28-day pill cycle and withdrawal bleedings during the 7-day pill-free interval. Eligible subjects were also required to use a non-hormonal method of contraception in addition to Microgynon<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> throughout the study period. Women with delivery, abortion, or lactation within 3&#x000a0;months of the study were excluded.</p><p>During study participation, the subjects were not allowed to take any of the following drugs: any drugs known or discussed to potentially induce liver enzymes (e.g. rifampicin, dexamethasone, barbiturates, anticonvulsants, St. John&#x02019;s wort); any drugs known to inhibit CYP3A4 (e.g. ketoconazole, verapamil, cimetidine, macrolides); any broad-spectrum antibiotics; and long-acting, injectable or implant hormonal therapy within 26&#x000a0;weeks prior to the screening visit, as well as any oral contraceptives other than the investigational treatment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Interventions, Blinding</title><p>Silexan was presented in immediate-release soft gelatine capsules containing 160&#x000a0;mg of lavender oil. An identically matched placebo was available in which the smell of the study drug was concealed by flavouring the capsules with 0.08&#x000a0;mg of Lavender oil, i.e., with 1/2000 of the amount of Lavender oil contained in the active capsules. During randomised treatment, the subjects had to take one capsule of Silexan or placebo per day in the morning unchewed. A daily dose of 160&#x000a0;mg corresponds to twice the currently recommended dose of the marketed product. Moreover, Silexan 160&#x000a0;mg/day has been shown to be highly efficacious in patients with GAD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>Microgynon<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> is a combination oral contraceptive containing 0.03&#x000a0;mg of EE and 0.15&#x000a0;mg of LNG in a coated tablet. The drug is widely used in combination oral contraceptive interaction studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and was packed in the original marketed package, which carried an additional label presenting the information required for use in a clinical trial. Starting on the first day of each cycle during study participation, subjects were instructed to take one coated tablet per day in the morning for 21 consecutive days, followed by a 7-day break; during this break, the administration of Silexan or placebo continued.</p><p>The study participants had to complete at least 2 cycles of oral contraception with Microgynon<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> in order to achieve steady state conditions. Since LNG highly binds to sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) in plasma, and EE induces the SHBG binding capacity, LNG levels were expected to be in a steady state after 2 cycles. Eligible subjects were then randomised to 2 additional cycles with co-administration of Silexan during the first and placebo during the second cycle, or vice versa (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Double-blind treatment was always started on the first day of the pill cycle following randomisation. Treatment compliance was monitored by recording each drug intake in a diary as well as by counting the unused medication. Furthermore, plasma levels of linalool, the main metabolite of Silexan, were determined at weekly intervals during randomised treatment.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Study schedule</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left">Study period</th><th align="left">Screening: cycles 1&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;2</th><th align="left" colspan="2">Treatment: cycle 3</th><th align="left" colspan="2">Treatment: cycle 4</th><th align="left">Follow-up</th></tr><tr><th align="left" rowspan="2">Duration (days)</th><th align="left" rowspan="2">Up to 56</th><th align="left" colspan="2">28</th><th align="left" colspan="2">28</th><th align="left">7&#x02013;14</th></tr><tr><th align="left">21</th><th align="left">7</th><th align="left">21</th><th align="left">7</th><th align="left"/></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Treatment</td><td align="left">Microgynon<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>

For each visit, a deviation of&#x000a0;&#x000b1;1&#x000a0;day was permitted. In addition, blood sampling for determining the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of EE and LNG was performed on 4&#x000a0;consecutive days starting on day 18&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;1&#x000a0;day of each cycle: on each of these days EE and LNG trough levels were determined. Furthermore, blood samples for determining PK profiles were obtained at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 24&#x000a0;h after the intake of Microgynon<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> on the third and into the fourth day. The subjects were required to abstain from any food and beverages except for water after 22:00&#x000a0;h on the 2nd day of sampling and received standardised meals on the 3rd day. After the end of the 2nd cycle during randomised treatment, a follow-up examination was scheduled to be performed within 7&#x02013;14&#x000a0;days. The samples were analysed for the determination of EE, LNG, and linalool levels using a validated high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)&#x02013;tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) method and ConCalc for Windows (CCW; Integ GmbH) software version 1.15.</p><p>The primary outcome measures for assessing potential pharmacological interactions between Silexan and the combination oral contraceptive were the area under the curve over a dosing interval of &#x003c4;&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;24&#x000a0;h (AUC&#x003c4;) derived from the 24-h concentration&#x02013;time curves for EE and LNG at steady state. Secondary outcome measures included the EE and LNG peak concentration (<italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub>), time to peak concentration (<italic>t</italic><sub>max</sub>), and trough levels. Ovarian follicle size measurements were performed through transvaginal ultrasound examinations at screening and at each weekly visit during randomised treatment, and the Hoogland score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] was determined for each treatment cycle as a measure of ovarian activity. SHBG levels were determined at the end of the 3rd week (i.e., end of Microgynon<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> intake) during each cycle.</p><p>Assessment of safety and tolerability was based on spontaneous reports of adverse events (AEs), physical examinations and safety laboratory measurements.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Random Sequence Generation, Allocation Concealment, Implementation</title><p>After subjects were determined as eligible for the trial, they were randomised to treatment with Silexan followed by placebo, or vice versa, at a ratio of 1:1. Fixed block randomisation was used; however, the investigator was not informed about the random block size until completion of the trial. A biometrician otherwise not involved in the trial generated the code using a validated computer program. Upon inclusion into randomised treatment, each subject received the lowest available number.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Statistical Methods, Sample Size</title><p>PK parameters were derived by non-compartmental methods using Phoenix WinNonlin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> software (Certara, L.P., St Louis, MO, USA). <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> and <italic>t</italic><sub>max</sub> were read directly from the data, the AUC&#x003c4; was derived by the linear trapezoidal rule, <italic>t</italic><sub>&#x000bd;</sub>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;(ln&#x000a0;2)/<italic>&#x003bb;</italic><sub>z</sub>, where the terminal rate constant was derived by log-linear regression, apparent clearance CL/<italic>f</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;AUC&#x003c4;/dose, and apparent volume distribution <italic>V</italic><sub>z</sub>/<italic>f</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;<italic>&#x003bb;</italic><sub>z</sub>&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;CL/<italic>f</italic>/<italic>&#x003bb;</italic><sub>z</sub>.</p><p>PK measures determined from the EE and LNG concentration-time profiles were compared between Silexan and placebo using analysis of variance (ANOVA) models with main effects for sequence, subject within sequence, period, and treatment. Tests for AUC&#x003c4; and <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> were performed after log transformation, and for <italic>t</italic><sub>max</sub> on the original untransformed scale. Confidence intervals determined on the log scale were back-transformed into the original scale.</p><p>In the absence of other guidance, the assessment of the pharmacological interacting potential of Silexan was based on the same approach as when testing for bioequivalence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]: the absence of a clinically relevant PK interaction between Silexan and EE or LNG was concluded if the 90&#x000a0;% confidence intervals for the AUC&#x003c4; ratios (Silexan/placebo) determined from the ANOVA models were included within the standard 80&#x02013;125&#x000a0;% equivalence range. Since the confidence intervals for the AUC&#x003c4; ratios of both hormones were required to fall within the pre-specified equivalence range simultaneously, type I error level adjustment for multiple testing was not required.</p><p>Comparable ANOVA models were also applied to <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> and <italic>t</italic><sub>max</sub>; however, these were interpreted descriptively. For SHBG concentration, an ANOVA model was fitted using the same factors after log-transformation of the dependent variable. All other interaction and safety measures were evaluated using methods of descriptive data analysis.</p><p>The sample size estimation was based on the assumption of a true within-subject coefficient of variation of 20&#x000a0;% for ln(AUC&#x003c4;) of both EE and LNG. When the true AUC&#x003c4; ratio between Silexan and placebo is between 0.95 and 1.05, a sample size of 20 subjects will have at least 80&#x000a0;% power for rejecting the null hypothesis predicting an interaction between Silexan and EE or LNG according to the above criteria. In order to compensate for study participants who did not complete both treatment phases, a total of 24 subjects were to be randomised.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Recruitment, Participant Flow, Protocol Deviations</title><p>Between November 2009 and May 2010, a total of 32 women were included and 24 were randomised and treated.

All events were mild or moderate in intensity, and all were non-serious. AEs in which a causal relationship to the investigational treatment could not be excluded occurred in ten subjects during Microgynon<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> and Silexan treatment (gastrointestinal disorders, nine subjects; weight increased, one subject; headache, two subjects; and acne, one subject) as well as in two subjects during Microgynon<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> plus placebo treatment (headache and fatigue, one subject each). Safety laboratory measures reflected changes that were attributed to frequent blood sampling (e.g., anaemia) but were otherwise uneventful.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec15" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>It is important to investigate whether anxiolytic drugs may modify the bioavailability and the clinical efficacy of oral contraceptives with steroid hormones.</p><p>The study demonstrates that Silexan does not show clinically relevant pharmacological interactions with EE or LNG, which are the active ingredients of Microgynon<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> as well as of many other widely used oral contraceptives. According to the lower bound of the 90&#x000a0;% confidence intervals for the AUC&#x003c4; ratios of Silexan and placebo, a reduction of relative EE bioavailability by more than 7&#x000a0;%, as well as a reduction of relative LNG bioavailability by more than 11&#x000a0;%, can be excluded with a probability of 95&#x000a0;%, and at least 92&#x000a0;% of the maximum EE concentration, as well as 91&#x000a0;% of the maximum LNG concentration, are preserved during co-administration of the herbal drug. For LNG, a slight delay in reaching the LNG peak level was observed, but this did not affect the relative bioavailability of the hormonal contraceptives.</p><p>Smoking may alter the PK properties of oral contraceptive steroids. Since about one-third of the women in the study sample were mild smokers (subjects smoking more than ten cigarettes per day were excluded from participation), this might have contributed to large inter-individual variability in plasma concentrations, notably in EE. However, the inter- and intra-individual variability of the EE plasma levels in our trial was comparable with the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and, moreover, higher variability would have biased the data towards an acceptance of the null hypothesis predicting an interaction between Silexan and EE and/or LNG. Since the null hypothesis could be rejected and an interaction could be excluded in accordance with the pre-specified criteria, an introduction of bias due to the inclusion of mild smokers can also be excluded.</p><p>Progesterone, estradiol, and SHBG level monitoring also did not indicate an impairment of the contraceptive efficacy of Microgynon<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> during co-administration of Silexan. Throughout the entire cycle of randomised treatment, the average levels of these biomarkers during co-administration of Silexan were always in the range of those observed under placebo treatment.</p><p>Silexan had no appreciable effect on mean endometrial thickness and follicle size. The measured individual follicle sizes were always within the range expected during adequate ovarian suppression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], and a follicle size exceeding a threshold value of 13&#x000a0;mm was observed only once in a woman receiving placebo.</p><p>AEs observed during this trial in healthy volunteers were never more than moderately severe and temporary; abnormal laboratory values were more often related to the study procedures (e.g., to frequent blood sampling) than to study medication intake. Among the events assessed to be potentially attributable to Silexan, the only effect that was observed in more than one subject but also not during placebo treatment was eructation. Mild gastrointestinal disorders are among the known side effects of Silexan, but were always tolerable and did not interfere with treatment compliance.</p><p>In conclusion, Silexan, at a dose of 160&#x000a0;mg/day, corresponding to twice the currently recommended dose, did not adversely affect the relative bioavailability and the suppressive efficacy on hormonal and ovarian status of the oral combination contraceptive Microgynon<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> whose active ingredients are EE and LNG. Silexan was well tolerated.
