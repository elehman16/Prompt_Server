Although the symptoms can be controlled by drug treatment in most patients, effective low-risk, non-drug strategies could constitute a significant advance in asthma management. An increasing number of patients with asthma are attracted by acupuncture and moxibustion. Therefore, it is of importance that scientific evidence about the efficacy of this type of therapy is regarded. Our past researches suggested heat-sensitive moxibustion might be effective in treatment of asthma. Our objective is to investigate the effectiveness of heat-sensitive moxibustion compared with conventional drug treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>This study is comprised of a multi-centre (12 centers in China), randomized, controlled trial with two parallel arms (A: heat-sensitive moxibustion; B: conventional drug). Group A selects heat- sensitive acupoints from the rectangle region which consist of two outer lateral lines of dorsal Bladder Meridian of Foot-Taiyang, and two horizontal lines of BL13(Fei Shu) and BL17 (Ge Shu);6 inch outer the first and second rib gap of anterior chest. Group B treats with fluticasone/salmeterol (seretide). The outcome measures will be assessed over a 3-month period before each clinic visit at days 15, 30, 60, and 90. Follow-up visit will be at 3, 6 months after the last treatment session. Adverse event information will be collected at each clinic visit.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This trial will utilize high quality trial methodologies in accordance with CONSORT guidelines. It may provide evidence for the effectiveness of heat-sensitive moxibustion as a treatment for chronic moderate persistent asthma. Moreover, the result may propose a new type moxibustion to control asthma.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>The trial is registered at Chinese Clinical Trials Registry: ChiCTR-TRC-09000599</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Asthma is a common chronic inflammatory disease of the airways characterized by variable and recurring symptoms, airflow obstruction, and bronchospasm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. It is also a complex disease involving many cells and mediators[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Asthma affects 300 million people worldwide[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], with an increasing prevalence in Western Europe(5%) and the USA(7%) in particular[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Despite the fact that there is still no cure for asthma, it has been established in a great number of small and large studies that many patients can reach a good asthma control with controller treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Generally speaking, Medications used to treat asthma are divided into two general classes: quick-relief medications used to treat acute symptoms and long-term control medications used to prevent further exacerbation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The therapeutic options available for patients with asthma depend on the severity of the condition. Although the symptoms can be controlled by drug treatment in most patients, effective low-risk, non-drug strategies could constitute a significant advance in asthma management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Therefore, an increasing number of patients with asthma are attracted by complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. A survey showed that roughly 50% of asthma patients used some form of unconventional therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Acupuncture has traditionally been used in asthma treatment in China and is increasingly applied for this purpose in Western countries. Moxibustion is a traditional Chinese method of acupuncture treatment, which utilizes the heat generated by burning Moxa (it is also called Mugwort or Moxa) to stimulate the acupuncture points. The technique consists of lighting a moxa-stick and bringing it close to the skin until it produces hyperemia due to local vasodilatation. The intensity of moxibustion is just below the individual tolerability threshold. Moxibustion has anti-inflammatory or immunomodulatory effects against chronic inflammatory conditions in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Moxibustion method for treatment of asthma diverse curative effect and its mechanism may be due to improve lung function, antagonize of inflammatory mediators, modulate of immune function, regulate the role of cyclic nucleotide levels, and can also affect the neuroendocrine network and inflammatory cells[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Therefore, these inflammatory substances may be reduced and weakened by moxibustion. Especially for chronic persistent asthma, moxibustion may get a better effect.</p><p>Although firm evidence has not been established, the results of some clinical trials suggest that acupuncture and moxibustion may effective in the treatment of asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. However, these researches do not confirm the efficacy of acupuncture and moxibustion. This may be because all relevant RCTs were limited by methodological defects, including inappropriate sample size, variability of acupuncture and sham protocols, and missing information. Therefore, rigorous high-quality randomized controlled trials are needed.</p><p>Thinking about moxibustion itself, the selection of location for manipulating Moxa plays an important role in obtaining good effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The moxibustion point location may be connected with the changes in the condition of the disease. Our team of experts were astonished to find that the main factor in selecting the location of acupuncture points is link with the area which is affected by disease, not only the standardized fixed position.</p><p>In the human nature, there are two state of being in acupuncture points, the sensitized or awake state and the rest state. When the human body suffers form disease, the acupoints on the surface of the body are stimulated and sensitive by various stimulants including heat. The specific areas stimulated by heat are then called "heat-sensitive points". One of the characteristics of these areas is that they are specific or closely related to acupuncture points and have the same clinical effect as "a small stimulation induces a large response". The <italic>Inner Canon of Huangdi </italic>or <italic>Yellow Emperor's Inner Canon </italic>is an ancient Chinese medical text that has been treated as the fundamental doctrinal source for Chinese medicine for more than two millennia and until today. According with its core viewpoint and theory, acupoint is described and understood with the state, which is certain area of the body surface in the course of diseases. Among the changes, sensitized status is the common one, described that acupoints on the body surface may be sensitized in the course of diseases. Acupoint heat-sensitization is a type of acupoint sensitization. Our research found that the heat-sensitive phenomenon to a point or an area is a new type of reaction featured in a pathological state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. We applicated the acupoint heat-sensitization phenomenon and rule in the past twenty years. Our team experimental evidence indicates that the state of a point might change from the rest state to the heat sensitized state while suffering from diseases. Its characteristic was thought that these special acupoints might produce heat response and farther warm sensation, as a result of stimulation of moxibustion heat. If we can search out these heat-sensitized acupoints associating with pathological state, good effect will be achieved. Therefore, selecting the heat-sensitized acupoint may obtain therapeutic effect far better than acupuncture and moxibustion at acupoints of routine rest state. So we defined the approach which treated various diseases through heat-sensitized acupoint, as heat- sensitive moxibustion therapy. We carried out many clinical trials to test and verify the efficacy of heat-sensitized acupoint, such as myofascial pain syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], lumbar disc herniation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], pressure sores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] and knee osteoarthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. The result of clinical trials almost suggested superiority effect of heat-sensitized acupoint and encouraged us to proceed. Hence, we planned a rigorous multi-centre randomized controlled trial with a large sample size.</p></sec><sec><title>Method/design</title><sec><title>Objective</title><p>The aim of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of heat-sensitive moxibustion compared with fluticasone/salmeterol (seretide) in patients with chronic moderate persistent asthma in China.</p></sec><sec><title>Outcome measures</title><sec><title>Primary outcome</title><p>At present, the goal of asthma care is to achieve and maintain control of clinical manifestation of the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].

To determine &#x003b4;, we carried out a small sample pilot study previously. The primary endpoint chosen was ACT. The result of outcome showed difference in means between the two groups approximately was 0.45.

When asthma is controlled, patients can prevent most attacks, avoid troublesome symptoms day and night, and keep physically active [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Acupuncture therapy was often perceived as an effective option to control asthma successfully by patients with chronic asthma. The use of acupuncture in asthma patients is increasing as an adjunct and also as a substitute for effective and proven therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. In China, moxibustion are considered as an ancient treatment to prevent and control asthma, and still widely used today. A number of clinical trial suggested moxibustion as one of traditional acupuncture therapy, should effective in the treatment of asthma. But the methodological problems of published trials haunt us the trust of moxibustion. Therefore, we design this rigorous clinical trials meeting the CONSORT statement and guidelines to guarantee a high internal validity for the results.</p><p>At present, various conventional medications are used to slow down and control with the disease. An ICS/LABA combination in a single inhaler represents a safe, effective and convenient treatment option, and recommended by GINA. So, we selected the fluticasone/salmeterol (seretide) as the control treatment in the protocol. Actually, the aim of this trial is to search an effective CAM treatment to control asthma, as good as conventional drug. The focused features of moxibustion are low cost, less adverse event and low risk.</p><p>According to the current theory of traditional Chinese medicine, moxibustion resulting from the burning of Moxa produces the radiant heat and drug effects to acupoints. This treatment penetrates deeply into the body, restoring the balance and flow of vital energy or life force through acupoints. So the selected of location for manipulating Moxa plays an important role in obtaining good effects. Generally speaking, the location acupoints are fixed along meridians. The conventional moxibustion is considered as improving general health and treating diseases by stimulating these fixed acupoints. And doctors consider hyperemia due to local skin vasodilatation as the indicator of moxibustion's effect. However, our clinical experience and observation in the past suggested that stimulating these fixed acupoints might not the best treatment site for moxibustion. In the human nature, there are two states of acupoints, the stimulated or awake state and the rest state. When the human body suffers form disease, the acupuncture points on the surface of the body are stimulated and sensitive by various stimulants including heat. And acupoint heat-sensitization is a type of acupoint sensitization. Acupoint is more than fixed skin site but external sensitive point reflecting the diseases. Therefore, acupoint is variable and depends on the pathological state. Traditional fixed acupints are thought as indicators to searching specific sensitive acupoint. That is, traditional fixed acupints don not consider the state as the key factor to local the acupoint, so the course of fixing the position is imprecisely.</p><p>When we light the Moxa hold over the heat-sensitive acupoints, the patients will produce some heat-sensitization phenomenon. The following patients sensation will suggest the special heat-sensitization acupoint: diathermanous sensation due to moxa-heat, defining as the heat sensation conducting from the moxa local skin surface into deep tissue, or even into the thoracic cavity; expand heat sensation due to moxa-heat, defining as the heat sensation spreading the surrounding little by little around the moxa point; transfer heat sensation due to moxa-heat, defining as the heat sensation transferring along some pathway, or even to the arms.</p><p>Acupuncture and moxibustion originated in China several thousands of years ago. The ancient Chinese medical classic <italic>Hu&#x000e1;ng D&#x000ec; N&#x000e8;i J&#x0012b;ng </italic>translated as <italic>'The Yellow Emperor's Inner Classic' has </italic>been treated as the fundamental doctrinal source for Chinese medicine for more than two thousand years. According to the chapter <italic>Annotations on 'The Yellow Emperor's Inner Classic - chapter: jiu zhen shi er yuan'(translated as 'Nine Needles and twelve yuan-primary acupoints")</italic>, it says: <italic>"the so-called joints are the places where Shenqi flows in and out, not just referring to skin, muscles, sinews and bones." </italic>This explains that the acupuncture points are not located according to the flesh and bones, which by definition have a fixed location, but they are alive and have a dynamic state due to the activity of "shen-qi". In the Hu&#x000e1;ng D&#x000ec; N&#x000e8;i J&#x0012b;ng Ling Shu (&#x09ec4;&#x05e1d;&#x05185;&#x07ecf;&#x07075;&#x067a2;) translated as "<italic>Annotations on 'The Yellow Emperor's Inner Classic' - chapter: jiu zhen shi er yuan(translated as 'Nine Needles and twelve yuan-primary acupoints")</italic>, it says: "so the disease of the Five Zang-organs can be treated by needling the twelve Yuan-Primary acupoints. The twelve Yuan-Primary acupoints show how the five Zang-Organs receive the nutrients of food and water and how Essence-Qi is infused into the three hundred and sixty-five joints. That is why the disease of the Five Zang-Organs are manifested over the twelve Yuan-Primary acupoints which show certain manifestations. Awareness of the twelve Yuan-Primary and observation of the manifestation to know the pathological changes of the Five Zang-Organs". We can learn an important fact from this section of the classical text. It clearly states that acupuncture points reflect the pathological state of the internal diseases and can be stimulated in treatment. Physically, people are not always aware of the existence of the acupuncture points. In contrast, patients can usually feel some changes in the area of the acupuncture point when affected by disease. Through the observation of these changes, the ancient doctors located the acupuncture points. In the <italic>Annotations on 'The Yellow Emperor's Inner Classic - chapter: 'back-shu </italic>acupoints', it states: "The Feishu (BL13) acupoint is located between the third thoracic vertebra. The Xinshu (BL15) acupoint is located below and lateral to the fifth thoracic vertebra. The Geshu (BL17) acupoint is located below and lateral to the seventh thoracic vertebra. The Ganshu (BL18) acupoint is located below and lateral to the ninth thoracic vertebra. The Pishu (BL20) acupoint is located below and lateral to the eleventh thoracic vertebra. The Shenshu (BL23) is located below and lateral to the fourteenth thoracic vertebra. These acupoints are all located beside the spinal column and 3 cun away from the spinal column. The method to locate these acupoints is to press the regions. When pressed, the patient will feel aching and distending or feel that the original pain is relieved." This section of the classical text illustrated that the back shu points are found by founding the sensitive areas on the skin. In the <italic>Annotations on 'The Yellow Emperor's Inner Classic - chapter: 'five xie' </italic>(translated as 'five kinds of pathogenic factor')it says: <italic>"cough involving the shoulder and back, to treat such a disease, acupoints located on the lateral side of the chest and lateral to the third thoracic vertebra can be needled. Before applying acupuncture, the doctor may use his fingers to quickly press the concerned region; the place where the patient feels comfortable when pressed is the acupoint and should be needled"</italic>. From this section, we can conclude that the sensitivity of the points is the key factor to locate the position of the acupuncture points.</p><p>Among the changes, sensitized status is the common one, described that acupoints on the body surface may be sensitized with various types of sensitization. This sensitized acupoint is not only the pathological phenomenon reflecting the diseases but also stimulating location with acupuncture and moxibustion. Acupoint heat-sensitization is a type of acupoint sensitization, which derived from our clinical experience and research in past twenty years. The special acupoint makes accordance with the classical thought and theory from the Inner Canon of Huangdi.</p><p>Our empirical evidence engaged us to formulate the following hypothesis: selecting the heat-sensitized acupoint may obtain therapeutic effect in asthma. The main aim of this trial is to test and verify the hypothesis. If we can confirm this hypothesis, the results of our trial will be helpful to supply the evidence on searching better safe approach to control asthma.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>RC and MC obtained funding for the research project and drafted the protocol.
