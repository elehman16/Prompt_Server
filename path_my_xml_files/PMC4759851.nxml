In particular, cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) has been hampered by a high relapse rate. Because relapses can be due to the presence of conditions associated with tobacco consumption (such as drinking in bars with friends), virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET) can generate synthetic environments that represent risk situations for the patient in the context of relapse prevention. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of CBT coupled with VRET, in comparison to CBT alone, in the prevention of smoking relapse. The secondary objectives are to assess the impact of CBT coupled with VRET on anxiety, depression, quality of life, self-esteem and addictive comorbidities (such as alcohol, cannabis, and gambling). A third objective examines the feasibility and acceptability of VR use considering elements such as presence, cybersickness and number of patients who complete the VRET program.</p></sec><sec><title>Method/design</title><p>The present study is a 14-month (2 months of therapy followed by 12 months of follow-up), prospective, comparative, randomized and open clinical trial, involving two parallel groups (CBT coupled with VRET versus CBT alone). The primary outcome is the proportion of individuals with tobacco abstinence at 6 months after the end of the therapy. Abstinence is defined by the total absence of tobacco consumption assessed during a post-test interview and with an apparatus that measures the carbon monoxide levels expired. A total of 60 individuals per group will be included.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This study is the first to examine the efficacy of CBT coupled with VRET in the prevention of smoking relapse.

In France, the latest health survey estimated in 2010 an overall prevalence of tobacco use of approximately 28.7 % among individuals older than 15 years old [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], resulting in an estimated $47 billion in related annual health and economic costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Many successful interventions have been developed for smoking cessation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], but the efficacy of smoking relapse prevention interventions has been limited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The high rates of relapse after smoking cessation programs have ranged between 40 and 70 %, suggesting the need to incorporate more effective strategies for relapse prevention into such programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. A cognitive behavioural model of relapse was developed by Marlatt and colleagues, considering that relapses to drug use are usually associated with high risk situations characterized by the presence of drug-related stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Several studies have reported that individuals with substance use disorders have physiological and subjective reactions to the presentation of drug-related stimuli, a phenomenon known as cue reactivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Recent studies have also reported that cue-induced craving does not decrease over an extended period of abstinence and might actually increase with a longer duration of abstinence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In addition to drug-related stimuli, the involvement of abnormal cognitive and motivational processes also contributes to high relapse rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Two techniques have emerged as potential smoking relapse prevention interventions: cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and cue exposure therapy (CET). CBT aims to explain and treat the individual's dysfunctions (for example, cognitive patterns and automatic thoughts). CBT can increase the individual's motivation and can play an important role in relapse prevention through analysis and understanding of this phenomenon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However, a recent meta-analysis reported insufficient evidence to support the use of CBT to prevent relapse, and it advised the examining of alternatives in attempts to teach skills to cope with risk situations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In this sense, CET has been considered an interesting complement to CBT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. CET consists of controlled and repeated exposure to drug-related cues, using pictures, photographs or video to reduce craving associated with situations of tobacco consumption. CET could extinguish the association of a response (smoking) to a stimulus (for example, an ashtray, a lighter, or a cigarette pack) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. However, these situations are difficult to reconstruct effectively in passive video or images and in the framework of a hospital or an office, thus limiting the efficacy of CET.</p><p>Because of the complexity of nicotine cue reactivity involving proximal (lit cigarette, ashtray, lighter), contextual (physical situations such as a party or a bar) and complex (a combination of contextual and proximal cues, such as situations involving social interactions where people are smoking or offered cigarettes) cues, more ecological environments should be proposed than those used in CET [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET), which is now used for the treatment of various psychological disorders (phobias and post-traumatic stress disorders) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and smoking cessation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], can generate synthetic environments that represent risk situations for the patient in the context of relapse prevention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. However, this approach has never been used to prevent relapse in abstinent smokers. VRET offers various advantages for cue exposure, such as controlled environments and complex, dynamic interactive, three-dimensional situations (such as virtual bars, offices and artificial smokers in computerized restaurants) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. VRET gradually exposes the patient in the confidentiality of an office to situations considered to pose a high risk of relapse. Finally, VRET allows the therapist to guide the patient in real time, helping him or her to modify emotions and addiction-related cognitions.</p><p>To our knowledge, CBT coupled with VRET has not yet been evaluated in preventing smoking relapse in subjects with smoking abstinence. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of CBT coupled with VRET compared to CBT alone in the prevention of smoking relapse. The secondary objectives are to assess the impact of CBT coupled with VRET on dependence, craving and addictive comorbidities (such as alcohol or cannabis). In addition, because smoking abstinence can be associated with negative effects known to influence craving [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], we also explored the effects of VRET on psychological and emotional features, including depression, anxiety, self-esteem and quality of life.</p><p>A third objective examines the feasibility and acceptability of VR use. Three main issues will be considered: presence, cybersickness and number of patients who complete the VRET program. Presence is an important issue to consider when investigating the impact of VRET. Presence, defined as a psychological measure of &#x0201c;being there&#x0201d; or in the virtual environment, may be considered as a condition of VRET success [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The measure of cybersickness is of the utmost importance when examining feasibility and acceptability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Cybersickness is a natural physiological response to unusual stimuli, which results from an asynchrony between visual, vestibular and proprioceptive information. The subsequent incongruence may produce nausea, headaches, spatial disorientation and vomiting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study site and population</title><p>The study is being conducted at La Conception University Hospital (Marseille, France).

Diagnoses of past chronic smoking and nicotine dependence are based on the DSM-V [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], and the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) French Version [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] is used to evaluate psychiatric comorbidities. Then, a physician describes the study, responds to any questions the candidates might have and obtains written informed consent. The participants are then randomly assigned to two therapeutic groups: one group receiving CBT coupled with VRET and one group receiving CBT alone. The allocation to each group is accomplished using a randomization table generated by a computerized sequence generator (1:1 allocation ratio). Data are collected during face-to-face interviews conducted by psychologists and also using self-reported measurements at five different time points: at randomization (baseline; T0), at the end of therapy (2 months, T1) and then at 3 (T2), 6 (T3) and 12 months (T4) after the end of therapy (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

The content of the CBT is similar in the two groups but delivered differently between the two groups.<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>CBT treatment group</p><p>The subjects receive eight weekly individual sessions of CBT. The CBT was developed by three psychologists (CG, NP and MFP) with training in the assessment and treatment of health problems and specific training in CBT. The content was first developed independently by two of the psychologists (CG and NP), based on international guidelines, the scientific literature on smoking cessation and relapse and their professional experience [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The sessions pivoted on all of the key principles of CBT. It was collaborative, present-oriented, and problem-focused. Any discrepancies were resolved by consensus with a third psychologist (MFP). The CBT was then tested on a small sample of patients (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;10), confirming its acceptability and validity. The sessions were designed to target the factors linked to smoking relapse after smoking cessation, including: 1) definition of relapse and identification of causes leading to relapse; 2) analysis and detection of high risk situations; 3) explanation of automatic thoughts and beliefs leading to tobacco consumption; 4) presentation of strategies (for example, behavioural coping strategies and cognitive coping strategies); 5) management of negative emotions; 6) management of assertiveness. The sessions are described in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>.</p></list-item><list-item><p>CBT coupled with VRET treatment group</p><p>The subjects receive two weekly individual sessions of CBT, followed by six weekly individual sessions of VRET. VRET consists of exposing the patient to situations considered to incur high risk of tobacco relapse and aimed at the reduction of cue reactivity by extinction. The therapist can help the subject to review the CBT principles and strategies during the VR exposure, using various complex environments tailored to the project (detailed below). The VR exposure is context graded because the smoking cues can vary in intensity (for example, number of avatars smoking around the patient, presence of cigarette boxes spread on tables). Given individual differences in the relevance of craving-specific stress among participants and to determine the order of exposure to virtual situations, a hierarchy of virtual environments (VEs), from the least craving and anxiety induced to the most craving and anxiety induced, was established for each participant independently. Throughout the exposure to VEs, the participants were invited to progress to the next VE when they had reached a comfortable level of emotion or craving in the current environment. Consequently, if required, exposure to a particular event or situation could be repeated. The therapist could monitor the subject's reactions according to the displayed situation. The session occurring in VEs lasts approximately 50 to 60 minutes. This duration is standard and does not depend directly on extinction or craving reduction. However the 10-minute lapse allows the therapist to ensure that the end of exposure take place when arousal or craving is lowered, thus avoiding any accidental sensitization phenomenon. Besides, when extinction and craving reduction do take place before minute 50, participants are invited to proceed to the next context graded VE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Apparatus</title><p>The VR system includes a ruggedized Sensics ZSight HMD (1280x2024 stereoscopic OLED screen with 60&#x000b0; field of view), coupled with an embedded 3 degrees of freedom head tracker (angular resolution: 0,02&#x000b0;, latency 4 ms). The head tracker enables the subject to visually explore the environment by updating the 3D scene as a function of head orientation. Otherwise, the navigation is triggered by mouse motion. The subject's direction of locomotion is defined by his or her head orientation in the VEs. The participants must use a wireless controller with a directional pad for the walking locomotion. The steering wheel exploited for the driving VE is a Logitech G25 with vibration and force feedback capabilities. The VEs are generated and run on an ordinary graphics orientated notebook with a 4 core processor, 16Go DDR2 RAM, a graphics card with 3 Go RAM and a 1440x900 resolution screen. The required software is Microsoft Windows 7 (32- or 64-bit edition), Microsoft DirectX 9.0 or higher and the equipment&#x02019;s drivers.</p><p>The heart rate monitor is a Polar RS800CX.

Sandbox is an inexpensive (30 to 60 USD) and commercially available game level editor (GLE) of the video game Crysis 1/2, exploiting the CryEngine game engine developed by Crytek GmbH.

VRET in association with CBT might represent an interesting alternative to CET. Several previous studies have supported the efficacy of VRET for smoking cessation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. VR environments can be used effectively in the treatment of nicotine addicts who wish to give up smoking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. We hypothesize that the findings of our study might be in agreement with their findings. From a theoretical perspective, CET appears to be a relevant method for complementing CBT according to the conditioning model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. It focuses on prompting the patient to contend with smoking-related stimuli (for example, the tobacco package, ashtrays, lighters, cigarettes) to mitigate smoking behavioural responses, to decrease withdrawal complications and to extinguish the craving. However, CET has an important limitation. Smoking-related stimuli are presented only in proximal confrontation patterns, such as images, photos and videos (that is, proximal risks), so there is no interaction with the environment or its multi-sensorial stimuli (distal risks), which are known to be of the utmost importance in smoking relapse. VRET might thus offer an alternative line of treatment by presenting the simultaneous presence of proximal and distal stimuli, compared to CET. Our hypothesis was that individuals would learn with VRET how to cope with proximal and distal risks and then use effective skills when facing similar environments <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>The effects of VRET on health outcomes, such as anxiety, depression and quality of life, constitute an original aspect of our study, compared with previous studies. Several studies have reported that negative affect plays an important role in maintaining smoking dependence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Our hypothesis was that VRET might have an indirect effect, mediated by the impact on smoking dependence, on negative affect (depression) and other psychological features, such as anxiety, self-esteem and quality of life.</p><p>The last objective is to demonstrate that this novel virtual environment is feasible and acceptable to the clinicians and patients who are potential program users. This objective is of the utmost importance, because the successful application of any technology as a tool to enhance evidence-based treatments is directly related to the ability of patients and clinicians to use the tool easily and effectively.</p><p>Several limitations must be borne in mind when considering our protocol. First, we chose to propose a widely used design for the CBT intervention, based on eight weekly individual therapeutic sessions of 60 minutes in duration. Because CBT is already a constraining treatment, we could not propose performing VRET in addition to CBT sessions of 60 minutes in duration. To keep the same number of sessions between the two groups, we proposed to the VRET treatment group two full sessions dedicated CBT (that is, concentrating the eight sessions of the CBT treatment group), followed by six sessions for VR exposure. This choice might mitigate the full integration of CBT and VRET and thus decrease the effectiveness of their associations. The differences in group conditions will be examined with greater attention when interpreting the results of this study. In addition, this choice might also decrease the effectiveness of CBT in the group with VRET because the principles cannot be learned as rapidly (that is, in two sessions) by patients. However, the therapist can help the participants during the VRET sessions to review the principles of CBT once they are immersed in the virtual environments. Second, the virtual environments used in our trial are situations featuring only pleasant connotations (such as being in a restaurant or on the beach). A whole gamut of cues with negative connotations (such as job stress, arguing with one&#x02019;s spouse, acute stress, receiving bad news) that can trigger tobacco cravings exists as well in reality. In fact, former smokers might be more sensitive to cues with negative emotional valences and more prone to relapse in this context, rather than during positive events. Future studies focusing on situations with negative connotations should be performed. Finally, heart rate (HR) was examined only in the CBT coupled with VRET treatment group and not in the CBT treatment group alone. Because the CBT treatment group did not include cue exposure therapy, we did not include a measurement of HR data. Indeed, HR could be considered physiological reactivity to smoking-related cues, and it was measured during the cue presentations (VRET session). Our hypothesis was that VRET lowers physiological reactivity to smoking-related cues and that we would observe a significant decrease in HR during the VRET sessions. We expect to observe a negative correlation between HR and the number of VR sessions. The absence of comparisons for this parameter between the two groups is a limitation of our study. However, HR is one of the main correlates of craving, and we compared smoking cravings between the two groups with the French Tobacco Craving Questionnaire (FTCQ-12).</p><p>Finally, the findings of our study might have significant implications for future population-based interventions. Because VRET is now available at a low cost and is simple to use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], this interactive therapeutic method might be easily implemented in clinical practice if our study confirms its efficacy. We can also hypothesize that, in the long run, patients will practice VR exposure at home. Advances in computer science, hardware performance and equipment availability make this assumption entirely probable. Events such as the acquisition of the Oculus company, which assembles affordable VR equipment, by Facebook or the use of ordinary Samsung cell phones as screens for HMD Gear VR could represent premises for the generalization of VRET in the general population and could induce a major shift in the media paradigm in post-modern societies.</p><sec id="Sec13"><title>Trial status</title><p>The study started including participants in August 2014, and the recruitment is ongoing.</p></sec></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec14"><title>Additional file</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="13063_2016_1224_MOESM1_ESM.docx" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>
