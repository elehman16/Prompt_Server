Data for the Conners' Adult ADHD Rating Scale &#x02013; Observer: Screening Version (CAARS-O:SV) (primary endpoint) have been presented previously. Secondary endpoints included the observer self-reported short version of the CAARS (CAARS-S:S) and the Clinical Global Impressions &#x02013; Severity Scale (CGI-S). Daily functioning and quality of life were assessed using the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) and the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire (Q-LES-Q) respectively.

These, together with the core symptoms, affect daily functioning, leading to impairments in education, work, relationships and social activities (Kessler <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref021">2006</xref>; Barkley <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref008">2008</xref>). It is, however, unclear to what extent the symptoms contribute to impairments in daily life.</p><p>Stimulant medications such as methylphenidate (MPH) are highly effective for treatment of the core ADHD symptoms (Faraone <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref017">2004</xref>; Medori <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref025">2008</xref>; Peterson <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref029">2008</xref>; Adler <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref004">2009</xref>; Buitelaar <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref013">2009<italic>a</italic></xref>). There is also evidence that MPH treatment can improve symptoms relating to executive functioning in parallel with improvements in core symptoms (Aron <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref006">2003</xref>; Boonstra <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref010">2005<italic>a</italic></xref>; Fallu <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref016">2006</xref>). Few studies, however, have investigated the relationship between symptomatic improvement and improvements in daily functioning in patients with ADHD. A meta-analysis of clinical trials of atomoxetine in children and adolescents with ADHD found that symptomatic improvements (ADHD Rating Scale-IV &#x02013; Parent Version: Investigator-administered; ADHDRS-IV-Parent:Inv) showed moderate to strong correlations with improvements in daily functioning, measured on the Life Participation Scale (LPS) (Buitelaar <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref014">2009<italic>b</italic></xref>).</p><p>The osmotic-controlled release oral delivery system (OROS) MPH formulation is designed to deliver MPH in a controlled manner providing extended control of symptoms during the day. Studies have shown that once-daily treatment with OROS MPH is effective and well tolerated for treatment of ADHD in children and adolescents (Pelham <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref028">2001</xref>; Wolraich <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref037">2001</xref>; Swanson <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref036">2003</xref>), and adults (Biederman <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref009">2006</xref>; Medori <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref025">2008</xref>; Adler <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref004">2009</xref>; Buitelaar <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref013">2009<italic>a</italic></xref>). In a 5-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [Long Acting MethylpheniDate in Adult ADHD (LAMDA)], all three doses of OROS MPH tested led to significant improvements in symptoms of ADHD in adults, assessed using the investigator-rated 18-item Conners' Adult ADHD Rating Scale &#x02013; Observer: Screening Version (CAARS-O:SV) (Medori <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref025">2008</xref>). OROS MPH was also associated with statistically significant functional and global improvements, as measured using the non-disease-specific Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) and the Clinical Global Impressions &#x02013; Severity Scale (CGI-S). Regression analyses of data from LAMDA showed correlations between scores on the CAARS Hyperactivity/Impulsivity subscale and both SDS and quality-of-life scores (R&#x000f6;sler <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref030">2011</xref>).</p><p>In a 7-week open-label extension to LAMDA, subjects who received placebo in the double-blind phase showed significant improvement in CAARS-O:SV total score after 1 week of treatment in the extension, with further improvements at weeks 3 and 7, and CAARS-O:SV total scores continued to improve in patients who had previously received OROS MPH, with significant changes from baseline at weeks 3 and 7 (Buitelaar <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref013">2009<italic>a</italic></xref>). Here, we present data on functional and other secondary endpoints from the LAMDA open-label extension, and also explore the relationship between symptomatic and functional outcomes during the cumulative (double-blind and open-label) 12 weeks of treatment in adults with ADHD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec002"><title>Method</title><sec id="sec002-001"><title>Study design and patients</title><p>Adults with ADHD (<italic>n</italic>=401) were randomized to receive OROS MPH (18, 36 or 72 mg/day) or placebo for 5 weeks. Those who completed the double-blind phase or discontinued study medication as a result of poor tolerability after &#x02a7e;7 days of treatment were eligible to participate in a 7-week open-label extension during which they received flexibly dosed OROS MPH in the range 18&#x02013;90 mg/day. To maintain blinding from the double-blind phase, all patients started the open-label phase at a dose of 36 mg/day (18 mg/day in Germany), which could subsequently be adjusted to optimize efficacy and tolerability according to the clinical judgement of the investigator.</p><p>Patients eligible for the initial placebo-controlled trial were adults (aged 18&#x02013;65 years) with ADHD according to the criteria of DSM-IV and confirmed by the Conners' Adult ADHD Diagnostic Interview for DSM-IV (CAADID). The designs of the initial study and the open-label extension, together with full inclusion and exclusion criteria, have been published previously (Medori <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref025">2008</xref>; Buitelaar <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref013">2009<italic>a</italic></xref>).</p><p>The study was conducted according to Good Clinical Practice and the &#x02018;Recommendations Guiding Physicians in Biomedical Research Involving Human Subjects&#x02019; contained in the Declaration of Helsinki.

ADHD symptoms were also assessed using the patient self-report short version of the CAARS (CAARS-S:S). During the open-label phase, assessments were made at weeks 1 and 7 (CAARS-O:SV was also evaluated at week 3) with a post-study visit 1 week after the last dose of OROS MPH (whether this occurred in the open-label or in the double-blind phase). Global condition was evaluated using the CGI-S, for which the investigator rates the patient's severity of illness on a seven-point scale ranging from 1 (not ill) to 7 (extremely severe). Change in global condition was evaluated at endpoint using the CGI Change (CGI-C), a seven-point scale ranging from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse) (NIMH, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref027">1985</xref>). Daily functioning was assessed using the SDS, a generic instrument with three 10-point visual analogue scales designed to measure the extent to which (i) work, (ii) social life and leisure activities and (iii) home life and family responsibilities are impaired (Sheehan <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref032">1996</xref>). Quality of life was measured using the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire (Q-LES-Q) Short Form, a 16-item self-administered questionnaire designed to assess the degree of enjoyment and satisfaction experienced by patients in various areas of daily functioning. Patients rated items concerning physical health, feelings, work, household duties, work and leisure-time activities and social relationships across five response categories, ranging from very poor to very good (Endicott <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref015">1993</xref>). The Q-LES-Q has been validated in adults with ADHD (Mick <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref026">2008</xref>).</p><p>Subjects who were treated in the double-blind phase could continue into the open-label phase. Efficacy analyses were performed on the open-label intent-to-treat (ITT) population, defined as those subjects who received at least one dose of open-label study medication and had at least one post-baseline assessment during the open-label phase.</p><p>Changes in CAARS-O:SV, CAARS-S:S and Q-LES-Q were analysed using a paired-samples <italic>t</italic> test. A regression analysis was performed for each functional scale on the change from double-blind baseline at the end of the open-label period, including baseline score, age, country, double-blind OROS MPH dose (or placebo), sex, change in CAARS-O:SV Hyperactivity/Impulsivity subscale score, change in CAARS-O:SV Inattention subscale score, and change in CGI-S at end of double-blind. The CAARS-O:SV total score was found to correlate strongly with the two CAARS-O:SV subscale scores, and was therefore not included in the analysis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003-001"><title>Patient disposition</title><p>In the double-blind phase, 401 patients received at least one dose of study medication and 365 patients (91%) completed the 5-week double-blind study period.

These benefits were found to be similar when patients were categorized according to sex, ADHD subtype, prior treatment or the presence of psychiatric co-morbidities. Although the absolute benefits of OROS MPH in the open-label phase were generally greater in patients who were previously untreated, those who received placebo for 5 weeks in the double-blind phase had not &#x02018;caught up&#x02019; in terms of CAARS-O:SV score at week 12 with those who had received 12 weeks of OROS MPH. This may be related to the flexible-dose design of the open-label phase, and may also be a result of patients who had the potential for further improvement receiving fixed, and therefore potentially suboptimal, doses in the double-blind phase. At a post-study visit 1 week after discontinuation, there was no evidence of rebound.</p><p>The <italic>post-hoc</italic> regression analysis showed that improvement in the CAARS-O:SV Hyperactivity/Impulsivity subscale was more closely associated with functional improvement (SDS) and improvement in quality of life (Q-LES-Q) than improvement in the CAARS-O:SV Inattention subscale. It is possible that this lack of correlation between observer-reported inattention and subject-reported functional disability reflects deficits in subjects' self-observation. After 12 weeks of treatment, no significant associations between change in CAARS-O:SV Inattention score or CGI-S at double-blind endpoint (week 5) and change in SDS or Q-LES-Q were observed, although the change in CAARS-O:SV Hyperactivity/Impulsivity subscale was significantly associated with functional improvement for all SDS subscales and Q-LES-Q. These results are consistent with a similar analysis carried out at week 5 (double-blind endpoint), when the change from double-blind baseline in the CAARS-O:SV Hyperactivity/Impulsivity subscale was significantly associated with both SDS total score and Q-LES-Q score (both <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.001) (R&#x000f6;sler <italic>et al</italic>., in press).</p><p>In a meta-analysis of four studies of atomoxetine in children and adolescents with ADHD, a moderate to strong correlation (<italic>r</italic>=&#x02212;0.68) was observed between changes in the LPS daily functioning scale and the ADHDRS-IV-Parent:Inv total, although no <italic>p</italic> value was provided for this correlation (Buitelaar <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref014">2009<italic>b</italic></xref>). Of the LPS subscales, the Self-control subscale showed higher correlations than the Happy/Social subscale with the symptom measures. Regression analysis showed high sensitivity for functional measures to changes in symptom severity. Of note, impairments in daily functioning in children seemed to be driven by symptoms of inattention, suggesting that the effect of ADHD symptoms on daily living may change as individuals move from childhood to adulthood.</p><p>The magnitude of improvement in SDS score in the present study compares favourably with that demonstrated in a 4-year open-label study of atomoxetine, in which the change in SDS total score was &#x02212;3.8 (Adler <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref002">2008<italic>b</italic></xref>). Indeed, the improvement in SDS in the present study was almost as large as that seen in a 12-week open-label study of duloxetine in patients with major depressive disorder, in which the mean SDS total score was reduced from 18.7 to 9.5 (Hudson <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref020">2007</xref>). Although the SDS has not been validated formally in adults with ADHD, it has been validated in patients with bipolar disorder (Arbuckle <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref005">2009</xref>), social anxiety disorder (Hambrick <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref018">2004</xref>) and panic disorder (Leon <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref022">1992</xref>), and has been shown to be sensitive to treatment effects in patients with anxiety disorders, depression or premenstrual dysphoric disorder (Sheehan &#x00026; Sheehan, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref033">2008</xref>).</p><p>In the present study, significant improvement from baseline in quality of life, as measured by the Q-LES-Q, was observed. These are consistent with the quality of life improvements reported in other studies in adults with ADHD receiving stimulant medication. In two 7-week studies in adults with ADHD treated with mixed amphetamine salts, improvements in health-related quality of life assessed using the disease-specific ADHD Impact Module (AIM-A) were significantly greater than those in subjects receiving placebo (Spencer <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref034">2008<italic>a</italic></xref>,<italic>b</italic>). Further analysis of data from these two studies showed that the improvements in quality of life, particularly the Performance and Function subscale of the AIM-A, were correlated with improvements in executive function (Brown &#x00026; Landgraf, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref012">2010</xref>). Similarly, 8-week, 14-week and 6-month studies of adults with ADHD receiving atomoxetine have shown significant improvements <italic>versus</italic> placebo using the Adult ADHD Quality of Life Scale (AAQoL; Matza <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref024">2007</xref>; Adler <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref001">2008<italic>a</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref004">2009</xref>) or the 36-item Short Form questionnaire (SF-36; Adler <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref003">2006</xref>). In the latter study, the SF-36 score was shown to be significantly correlated with CAARS-O:SV.</p><p>Dosing in the open-label phase was flexible, based on clinical judgement, which more closely reflects clinical practice than fixed dosing. The patient cohort was, however, enrolled according to stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria, which may limit the generalizability of the data. In addition, it should be noted that the regression analysis was carried out on a <italic>post-hoc</italic> basis and the results remain to be confirmed in a prospective study.</p><p>In conclusion, the results of this analysis of data from a randomized, double-blind study and its open-label extension show that improvements in ADHD symptoms relating to hyperactivity and impulsivity in adults receiving OROS MPH are correlated with improvements in daily functioning and quality of life.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This study was supported by Janssen-Cilag EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa).
