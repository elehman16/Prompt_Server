Chemotherapy-naive patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (WHO performance status 0 or 1) with liver metastases not suitable for curative resection or ablation were randomly assigned (1:1) to either oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy (FOLFOX: leucovorin, fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin) or FOLFOX plus single treatment SIRT concurrent with cycle 1 or 2 of chemotherapy. In FOXFIRE, FOLFOX chemotherapy was OxMdG (oxaliplatin modified de Gramont chemotherapy; 85 mg/m<sup>2</sup> oxaliplatin infusion over 2 h, L-leucovorin 175 mg or D,L-leucovorin 350 mg infusion over 2 h, and 400 mg/m<sup>2</sup> bolus fluorouracil followed by a 2400 mg/m<sup>2</sup> continuous fluorouracil infusion over 46 h). In SIRFLOX and FOXFIRE-Global, FOLFOX chemotherapy was modified FOLFOX6 (85 mg/m<sup>2</sup> oxaliplatin infusion over 2 h, 200 mg leucovorin, and 400 mg/m<sup>2</sup> bolus fluorouracil followed by a 2400 mg/m<sup>2</sup> continuous fluorouracil infusion over 46 h). Randomisation was done by central minimisation with four factors: presence of extrahepatic metastases, tumour involvement of the liver, planned use of a biological agent, and investigational centre. Participants and investigators were not masked to treatment. The primary endpoint was overall survival, analysed in the intention-to-treat population, using a two-stage meta-analysis of pooled individual patient data. All three trials have completed 2 years of follow-up. FOXFIRE is registered with the ISRCTN registry, number ISRCTN83867919.

Median follow-up was 43&#x000b7;3 months (IQR 31&#x000b7;6&#x02013;58&#x000b7;4). There were 411 (75%) deaths in 549 patients in the FOLFOX alone group and 433 (78%) deaths in 554 patients in the FOLFOX plus SIRT group. There was no difference in overall survival (hazard ratio [HR] 1&#x000b7;04, 95% CI 0&#x000b7;90&#x02013;1&#x000b7;19; p=0&#x000b7;61). The median survival time in the FOLFOX plus SIRT group was 22&#x000b7;6 months (95% CI 21&#x000b7;0&#x02013;24&#x000b7;5) compared with 23&#x000b7;3 months (21&#x000b7;8&#x02013;24&#x000b7;7) in the FOLFOX alone group. In the safety population containing patients who received at least one dose of study treatment, as treated, the most common grade 3&#x02013;4 adverse event was neutropenia (137 [24%] of 571 patients receiving FOLFOX alone <italic>vs</italic> 186 (37%) of 507 patients receiving FOLFOX plus SIRT). Serious adverse events of any grade occurred in 244 (43%) of 571 patients receiving FOLFOX alone and 274 (54%) of 507 patients receiving FOLFOX plus SIRT. 10 patients in the FOLFOX plus SIRT group and 11 patients in the FOLFOX alone group died due to an adverse event; eight treatment-related deaths occurred in the FOLFOX plus SIRT group and three treatment-related deaths occurred in the FOLFOX alone group.</p></sec><sec><title>Interpretation</title><p>Addition of SIRT to first-line FOLFOX chemotherapy for patients with liver-only and liver-dominant metastatic colorectal cancer did not improve overall survival compared with that for FOLFOX alone.

The liver is the dominant site of metastases in colorectal cancer; liver metastases are the commonest cause of death for patients with colorectal cancer. Amongst the liver-directed therapies that might improve local control and increase downsizing of tumours to operability, selective internal radiotherapy (SIRT) is a new technology. The efficacy of SIRT in third-line or subsequent therapy for metastatic colorectal cancer has been evaluated and there are data to suggest that SIRT has clinical benefit in patients with colorectal liver metastases with liver-dominant disease after chemotherapy. We previously published a phase 1/2 trial that established the maximum tolerated dose of oxaliplatin-fluorouracil (FOLFOX) chemotherapy to combine as concomitant radiosensitising chemotherapy with SIRT. At the time of planning our studies in 2006, we searched PubMed and Web of Science for articles published between Jan 1, 1980, and May 31, 2006, with the search terms: &#x0201c;colorectal cancer&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;colon cancer&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;rectal cancer&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;oxaliplatin chemotherapy&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;5-fluourouracil chemotherapy&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;fluoropyrimidine&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;selective internal radiotherapy&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;yttrium-90 microsphere&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;radio-embolization&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;radio-embolisation&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;trans-arterial radio-embolization&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;liver metastasis&#x0201d;, and &#x0201c;hepatic metastasis&#x0201d; Original articles and review articles, published in English, were reviewed. No meta-analyses of SIRT treatment of liver metastasis were identified at the time of protocol writing in 2006.</p><p><bold>Added value of this study</bold></p><p>The FOXFIRE, SIRFLOX, and FOXFIRE-Global, randomised clinical trials were designed to study whether SIRT in combination with FOLFOX chemotherapy as first-line therapy for metastatic colorectal cancer can improve overall survival compared with FOLFOX alone. To our knowledge, the combined study represents the largest, randomised analysis performed in the field of interventional oncology to address the question of whether improved local control of colorectal liver metastases impacts on overall survival. Despite higher proportions of patients achieving a response and improved liver-specific progression-free survival, the addition of SIRT to first-line oxaliplatin-fluorouracil chemotherapy for patients with liver-only and liver-dominant metastatic colorectal cancer did not improve overall survival or progression-free survival. Additionally, to our knowledge, this study provides the most comprehensive account of the risk of adverse events which can occur secondary to SIRT when it is used in combination with FOLFOX chemotherapy.</p><p><bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold></p><p>Because of the absence of overall survival benefit, early use of SIRT in combination with first-line, oxaliplatin-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy in unselected patients with metastatic colorectal cancer cannot be recommended.

The first 30 treatments were allocated using (simple) block randomisation (using variable block sizes of 2, 4, and 6 in a ratio of 1:2:1). In SIRFLOX and FOXFIRE-Global, an imbalance window of 5 was used; if the treatment imbalance between the two groups was less than 5, the treatment was randomly allocated. If the treatment imbalance reached 5, the next treatment allocation was forced to reduce the imbalance. In FOXFIRE, computer-based randomisation was done centrally at the Oncology Clinical Trials Office (OCTO; Oxford, UK). While the trial was in progress, access to the full randomisation lists was restricted to the Database Development Manager at OCTO and the trial statistician at the Centre for Statistics in Medicine (CSM; Oxford, UK). In SIRFLOX and FOXFIRE-Global, randomisation was done centrally at the National Health and Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Centre (Camperdown, NSW, Australia) via an interactive voice response system. Participants were enrolled by the investigators in all three trials. As none of the trials were masked, once patients were allocated to treatment, participants, all members of the trial team, and treating medical staff knew the treatment allocation.</p></sec><sec id="cesec50"><title>Procedures</title><p>In FOXFIRE, systemic FOLFOX chemotherapy consisted of OxMdG (oxaliplatin modified de Gramont chemotherapy; 85 mg/m<sup>2</sup> oxaliplatin infusion over 2 h, L-leucovorin 175 mg or D,L-leucovorin 350 mg infusion over 2 h, and 400 mg/m<sup>2</sup> bolus fluorouracil followed by a 2400 mg/m<sup>2</sup> continuous fluorouracil infusion over 46 h).

The primary and secondary outcomes in each of the individual trials are in the <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix (p 13)</xref>. We defined progression-free survival as the time from randomisation to radiological progression or death from any cause, whichever occurred first. Patients who did not progress or die during the trial were censored at their last known progression-free follow-up date. Liver-specific progression-free survival was defined as the time from randomisation to radiological hepatic progression. Progression not involving the liver and death before progression were regarded as competing events. We deemed hepatic progression to have occurred immediately before non-liver progression in patients who had identical hepatic and extrahepatic progression dates. Patients who withdrew from study treatment before documented progression were censored at commencement of non-study treatment for both the progression-free survival and liver-specific progression-free survival endpoints. Time of resection was not deemed a censoring point for progression-free survival or liver-specific progression-free survival. The proportion of patients achieving an objective response in each treatment group was defined as the number of patients achieving a complete or partial response at any point during the trial, up to their first occurrence of hepatic resection, over the number randomised in that group (early deaths by any cause and unknown responses were included in the demominator).

The study also had 80% power to detect a 6-month overall survival benefit in the subgroup of patients with metastatic disease restricted to the liver: 708 patients (463 deaths) were needed. The cutoff for analysis was chosen such that there was a minimum of 710 deaths overall and 463 deaths in the liver-only subgroup (assuming a 6-month increase in overall survival in the SIRT-treated, liver-metastasis-only patients) and a minimum follow-up of 2 years since the last patient was randomly assigned to treatment.

The combined analysis of these three randomised clinical trials shows that a global, multidisciplinary trial involving a complex liver-directed therapy can be done with adequate power to answer an important clinical question.</p><p>The efficacy of SIRT in third-line or subsequent therapy for metastatic colorectal cancer (ie, salvage therapy of chemotherapy-refractory disease) has previously been evaluated.<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> A randomised trial<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> of salvage in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer with liver-confined disease showed a significant benefit of chemotherapy plus SIRT versus chemotherapy alone in time to progression. These data suggest that SIRT has clinical benefit in patients with colorectal liver metastases with liver-dominant disease after chemotherapy.</p><p>Metastatic colorectal cancer in which the liver is the only site of disease occurs frequently in a subset of patients; some of these patients can be resected with long-term cures.<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> In our study, the significant improvement in liver disease control assessed by competing risk analyses did not translate to a benefit in overall survival. This finding contrasts with that from the EORTC CLOCC study,<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> which showed that a significant effect of radiofrequency ablation with or without surgery on progression-free survival translated into a highly significant overall survival benefit in patients who did not have primary tumour in situ or extrahepatic metastases at trial entry. The absence of benefit of the addition of SIRT to FOLFOX on progression-free survival and overall survival in our combined study could be partly explained by the high proportion of patients who developed first progression at an extrahepatic site, independently of whether the metastases were liver-only at baseline or whether there were extrahepatic metastases or primary tumour in situ at baseline. Despite the better liver control in the FOLFOX plus SIRT group compared with the FOLFOX alone group, this observation of extrahepatic progression might also explain the absence of a significant difference between the groups in the frequency of surgical resection of the liver metastases being done during or after protocol therapy. To avoid possible ascertainment bias in interpreting responses and difficulties differentiating disease progression from radiation reaction of the hepatic parenchyma in patients undergoing the interventional radiotherapy liver procedure, scans were centrally reviewed by independent readers. The absence of an overall survival benefit suggests that early use of SIRT in combination with first-line oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy cannot be recommended in unselected patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.</p><p>In our study, the SIRT-treated patients had a similar quality of life to the patients who had chemotherapy only. Toxicity was higher in the SIRT group, particularly neutropenia and SIRT-related expected toxicities. In the as-treated population in the FOLFOX plus SIRT group (n=507 patients), hepatic failure resulted in death of one patient during the main safety window and death of a further two patients during extended follow-up. The increased toxicity in the SIRT-treated patients did not translate into inferior overall survival. This study provides the most comprehensive account of the risk of adverse events that might occur secondary to SIRT when used in combination with FOLFOX chemotherapy.</p><p>One possible limitation of our study is that significant changes to the management of metastatic colorectal cancer occurred during the 8-year recruitment period with the introduction of bevacizumab and EGFR inhibitors as first-line standards of care, and increased use of liver interventions such as surgery and ablation. However, there is no reason to believe that treatment differences occurred between treatment groups. Another limitation is that some patients were found not to have met the entry criteria after randomisation. Sensitivity analyses excluding all ineligible patients indicated that the findings were robust. The non-identical design of the individual trials might also be considered a limitation, but is accounted for by the use of appropriate statistical methods.</p><p>Little progress has been reported in improving overall survival in molecularly unselected populations since the CRYSTAL, PRIME, and TRIBE studies.<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> In our study, crossover was anticipated and 12% of patients randomised to FOLFOX alone received SIRT with a later line of therapy. Furthermore, 8% of patients assigned to SIRT did not receive SIRT, a proportion consistent with our previously published data in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> The difference in exposure to post-trial treatments between the two treatment groups might have affected the primary endpoint. It is possible that the improved liver disease control observed in the FOLFOX plus SIRT group might have influenced physicians to bias towards less intensive subsequent treatment, particularly as so-called treatment-holiday strategies were evolving during the recruitment and follow-up periods of these trials. Alternatively, it could be postulated that the reduced use of irinotecan after protocol therapy might have been related to increased or prolonged toxicities in the patients in the FOLFOX plus SIRT group, including the risk of myelosuppression. Our analysis of these toxicities for both groups over time showed an apparent increase of grade 3 or worse adverse events in the FOLFOX plus SIRT group, particularly haematological events, with the curves gradually converging after 6 months of protocol therapy.</p><p>In the past decade, the focus of clinical trials has been on improving outcomes for selected biological subtypes in metastatic colorectal cancer with predefined molecular criteria (eg, mutant <italic>RAS</italic> or <italic>BRAF</italic>). Several studies from the past 2 years have reported that patients with right-sided primary tumours have worse survival outcomes and it is possible that these patients benefit less from standard therapies.<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Molecular subtypes in our study are not currently available, but in the dataset available, 179 (25%) of 718 patients had right sided-tumours. Based on preliminary data currently available, patients with colorectal liver metastases from right-sided primary tumours could be a clinical subgroup that benefits from SIRT. Further analyses are underway to investigate this exploratory finding, with specific scrutiny of <italic>RAS</italic> mutation, <italic>BRAF</italic> mutation, and tumour location in study populations who have received SIRT in clinical trials. Further studies designed to define the potential benefit of SIRT to treat colorectal liver metastases from right-sided primaries are warranted.</p><p>In conclusion, despite better liver-specific disease control and improved radiological response, the FOXFIRE prospective trials did not show a benefit of the combination of SIRT with FOLFOX for progression-free survival or overall survival. The routine early integration of SIRT in combination with oxaliplatin-based, first-line chemotherapy cannot be recommended as therapy for metastatic colorectal cancer. Further studies are needed to study the role of SIRT in carefully selected patient populations and as a consolidation therapy after chemotherapy.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list
