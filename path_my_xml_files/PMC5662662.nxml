In Europe, tolvaptan is approved for the treatment of adult patients with hyponatremia secondary to syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">Tolvaptan acts as an orally available selective antagonist of the vasopressin V2-receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. By blocking the activity of vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone) on renal collecting tubules, the drug prevents the reabsorption of water, which leads to an increase in free water clearance (aquaresis) and a resulting increase in serum sodium concentrations. These pharmacologic consequences are the basis of its beneficial effects in patients with hyponatremia and/or edema. Tolvaptan treatment is to be initiated at 15&#x000a0;mg once daily with the dose increased to a maximum of 60&#x000a0;mg once daily as tolerated to achieve the desired level of serum sodium.</p><p id="Par7">In clinical trials investigating treatment of hyponatremia, tolvaptan was well tolerated. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events associated with tolvaptan use have been consistent with its mode of action to promote free water clearance. Thus, in the pivotal efficacy (SALT) clinical trials, which enrolled hyponatremic patients with chronic heart failure, cirrhosis, or SIADH, the most common adverse events were thirst (16%), dry mouth (13%), and pollakiuria or polyuria (11%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In a subanalysis focusing on the subset of subjects with SIADH, thirst and dry mouth occurred in 18 and 16% of subjects, respectively, while increased urinary frequency occurred in 10% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. As with any therapy for hyponatremia, the primary safety concern is overly rapid correction of serum sodium concentrations (e.g., &#x0003e;12&#x000a0;mmol/L/24&#x000a0;h or &#x0003e;18&#x000a0;mmol/L/48&#x000a0;h), which can lead to osmotic demyelination of neurons (1) which may result in dysarthria, mutism, dysphagia, lethargy, affective changes, spastic quadriparesis, seizures, coma, and death. In the SIADH subset of the SALT trials, overly rapid correction of serum sodium after the first dose of tolvaptan occurred in 5.9% (3/51) of patients. All three of these patients had moderate hyponatremia at baseline (serum [Na<sup>+</sup>]&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;130&#x000a0;mmol/L) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">In post-marketing assessments in Europe of tolvaptan use to treat hyponatremia, it has been reported that physicians, on a patient-by-patient case basis, appear to be splitting/crushing tolvaptan tablets to create a 7.5-mg starting dose in the belief that a lower starting dose may reduce the risk of overly rapid correction of serum sodium (data on file). No pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD) trials had been conducted in SIADH patients with hyponatremia, so a clinical trial to investigate the initial response of serum sodium concentrations following doses of tolvaptan as single oral tablets of 15, 7.5, and 3.75&#x000a0;mg was performed (NCT02009878).</p><p id="Par9">Investigation of tolvaptan for treatment of hyponatremia in pediatric subjects is ongoing. Prior to the start of this program, a phase 1 healthy-adult subject trial was conducted to compare the relative bioavailability of a suspension formulation to the 15-mg tablet, as well as to determine the relative bioavailability of tolvaptan following dosing with 7.5- and 3.75-mg tablets. The PK and PD assessment schedules following each dose were almost identical to those used in the SIADH patient trial, making it possible to directly compare the two populations.</p><p id="Par10">In healthy adults, the PK and PD of single oral tolvaptan doses ranging from 15 to 480&#x000a0;mg have been previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The terminal-phase elimination half-life (<italic>t</italic>
<sub>1/2,z</sub>) of tolvaptan increases with increasing dose, with mean values around 3&#x000a0;h for a 15-mg dose and 12&#x000a0;h for 120- to 480-mg doses. Tolvaptan is mostly absorbed from the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract at lower doses, and the decline of the terminal portion of the concentration curve therefore primarily reflects elimination processes. With increasing dose, tolvaptan continues to be absorbed from the GI tract, such that the rate of decline of the terminal portion of the concentration curve is reflective of both absorption and elimination. The limited early absorption of tolvaptan is exemplified by the fact that maximum (peak) plasma concentration (<italic>C</italic>
<sub>max</sub>) values show less than dose proportional increases from 30 to 240&#x000a0;mg and then plateau at doses from 240 to 480&#x000a0;mg. Despite the changes in tolvaptan absorption, area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) for tolvaptan following single oral doses increases proportionally with increasing dose, and apparent clearance of drug from plasma after extravascular administration (CL/F) values is unchanged for single doses from 30 to 480&#x000a0;mg. Tolvaptan concentrations do not accumulate following once daily dosing, and its PK parameters are not affected by age, gender, or race.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Ethics</title><p id="Par11">The studies in this report were conducted in compliance with International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice guidelines for conducting, recording, and reporting clinical trials, as well as for archiving essential documents.

In order to determine if early response to tolvaptan could be an indicator of rapid correction in serum sodium, correlations (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>) between the maximal increase in serum sodium and fluid balance (panel A) or urine volume (panel B) from 0 to 6&#x000a0;h post-dose were investigated. The four subjects with rapid corrections had large negative fluid balances, &#x02212;920, &#x02212;960, &#x02212;980, and &#x02212;2570&#x000a0;mL, for 0 to 6&#x000a0;h post-dose. However, one subject with a fluid balance of &#x02212;1280&#x000a0;mL had a maximal increase in serum sodium of only 5&#x000a0;mmol/L. The four subjects with rapid correction had urine volumes of &#x0003e;2000&#x000a0;mL for 0 to 6&#x000a0;h post-dose but two subjects with volumes &#x0003e;2000&#x000a0;mL had maximal increases in serum sodium of only 5 and 6&#x000a0;mmol/L. Because mean fluid intake in the first 6&#x000a0;h was similar for all doses, about 1000&#x000a0;mL, fluid balance was very highly correlated with urine output (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>c) with an <italic>r</italic>

</p><p id="Par45">As stated in Samsca&#x000ae; labeling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], &#x0201c;...after initiation of treatment, patients should be closely monitored for serum sodium and volume status.&#x0201d; When compared to healthy subjects, SIADH patients are less likely to increase fluid intake to limit decreases in fluid balance. Limiting early, i.e., 0 to 6&#x000a0;h, decreases in fluid balance, when tolvaptan is having the greatest effects on free water clearance, may allow for adjustments in fluid intake that would decrease the risk of rapid correction in SIADH patients.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to acknowledge the investigators Jan Jiskra (Czech Republic), Erling Pedersen (Denmark), Volker Burst (Germany), Christian Haas (Germany), Johannes Hensen (Germany), Christian Groh&#x000e9; (Germany), Martin Wermke (Germany), Istv&#x000e1;n Tak&#x000e1;cs (Hungary), Esteban Poch (Spain), Isabelle Runkle de la Vega (Spain), Gudmundur Johannsson (Sweden), Pierre Bouloux (UK), Jayadave Shakher (UK), and Claire Higham (UK).</p></ack><notes notes-type="COI-statement"><title>Compliance with ethical standards</title><sec id="FPar7"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par46">Clinical trials were funded by Otsuka Pharmaceutical Development &#x00026; Commercialization, Inc.</p></sec><sec id="FPar8"><title>Conflict of interest</title><p id="Par47">All authors are employees of Otsuka Pharmaceutical Development &#x00026; Commercialization, Inc.</p></sec></notes><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref id="CR1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Samsca [Package Insert].
