Yet, Hispanic men are grossly underrepresented in weight loss research. Tailored intervention strategies to improve obesity treatment programs for this vulnerable racial/ethnic subgroup are needed. This manuscript describes recruitment strategies, methodology, and participant characteristics of the ANIMO study, a 24-week randomized controlled pilot trial testing the effects of a gender- and culturally-sensitive weight loss intervention (GCSWLI) on body weight in Hispanic men compared to a wait-list control condition. The ANIMO study included two phases. The first phase was a 12-week GCSWLI. Participants attended weekly in-person individual sessions guided by a trained bilingual Hispanic male lifestyle coach, were prescribed a daily reduced calorie goal, and 225&#x0202f;min of moderate-intensity physical activity per week. In the second phase, GCSWLI participants received bi-weekly phone calls across a 12-week follow-up. Wait-list control (WLC) participants from phase 1 received the GCSWLI plus mobile health technology support. Recruitment strategies included face-to-face efforts at a swap meet (outdoor marketplace), family/friend referrals, printed advertisements and social media. Recruitment, screening, and participant enrollment occurred over three months. Overall, 143 men expressed interest in participation. Of these, 115 were screened and 78% (n&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;90) were eligible to participate; 45% of enrolled participants (n&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;52) completed baseline assessments and 43% (n&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;50) were randomized (mean age of 43.3&#x0202f;&#x000b1;&#x0202f;11.4 years; BMI: 34.1&#x0202f;&#x000b1;&#x0202f;5.3&#x0202f;kg/m<sup>2</sup>; 58% Spanish monolingual). Parameter estimates from ANIMO will support future adequately powered trials for this health disparate population.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02783521</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Hispanic</kwd><kwd>Men</kwd><kwd>Recruitment</kwd><kwd>Weight loss</kwd><kwd>mHealth</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0010">Hispanic males have the highest prevalence of overweight and obesity among racial/ethnic groups in the U.S. [<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Obesity is strongly linked to cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and certain types of cancers such as colorectal and liver [<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>]. Consequently, Hispanic males have the highest prevalence of obesity-related comorbidities relative to other racial/ethnic subgroups. For example, estimates suggest that Hispanic men are 1.4 times more likely than non-Hispanic white (NHW) men to have been diagnosed with diabetes by a physician despite lower healthcare access [<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Cardiometabolic abnormalities such as abdominal obesity, hypertension, high cholesterol and triglycerides, and high blood glucose levels are also significantly higher in this population subgroup overall [<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p id="p0015">Current evidence-based guidelines for the management of overweight and obesity in adults recommend weight loss treatment for individuals with a body mass index (BMI) &#x02265;30&#x0202f;kg/m<sup>2</sup> or with a BMI &#x02265;25&#x0202f;kg/m<sup>2</sup> coupled with weight-related comorbidities [<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. While behavioral weight loss interventions, delivered on-site in academic research settings, are capable of producing approximately an 8&#x02013;10% weight loss over the course of 6 months [<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], approximately 73% of study samples are comprised of women [<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Further, Hispanic participants tend to lose less weight and are more likely to regain weight at follow-up compared to other racial/ethnic groups [<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>]. It has been suggested that culturally-specific gender roles may contribute to this differential effect; however, there is limited evidence of effectiveness of behavioral weight loss interventions for Hispanics long-term [<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) is one of few randomized controlled studies with long-term weight loss data among Hispanic men. Data specific to the intensive lifestyle intervention demonstrated weight loss achieved by Hispanic men (&#x02212;6.8&#x0202f;kg) and non-Hispanic White men (&#x02212;7.1&#x0202f;kg) at 24 months were not significantly different [<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. While these data are promising, the DPP enrolled only 58 Hispanic men in the intensive lifestyle intervention, comprising only 6.0% of the total intervention arm population [<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Identifying intervention strategies to engage and promote successful weight management in Hispanic males is critical to reducing morbidity and mortality among this large and growing population [<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p id="p0020">Using existing practice guidelines and evidence from our recently completed in-depth qualitative interviews in overweight/obese Hispanic males [<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], we developed and tested a novel intervention to address this gap in knowledge. We proposed to 1) assess the feasibility, acceptability and preliminary efficacy of a gender- and culturally-sensitive weight loss intervention in 48 overweight/obese Hispanic males ages 18&#x02013;64 over 12-weeks; 2) assess participant characteristics and process measures related to the uptake of mobile-health (mHealth) technology in overweight/obese Hispanic males over 12-weeks; and 3) evaluate pathologic changes in the liver in Hispanic men enrolled in a 12-week weight loss intervention using non-invasive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as a therapeutic response biomarker.

Consequently, we conducted semi-structured interviews with overweight/obese Hispanic men (n&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;14) to examine their perspectives on health behaviors related to weight management. In brief, our findings revealed that while our participants had a rich understanding of how obesity-related disease affects health, they struggled with access to affordable foods, safe spaces for physical activity, strenuous work schedules, and familial influences that hindered their weight management efforts [<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Thus, individual, cultural, familial, and environmental influences required the future programs to be tailored to meet the needs of this population. However, these data were from a sample of men who were primarily U.S. born, English speaking, and well-educated. These factors influence acculturation, which is the adoption of practices, social values, and behaviors (e.g., diet) of the majority culture [<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. As a result, we focused latter efforts on recruiting a less-acculturated sample (e.g., Spanish-speaking; foreign-born, low educational attainment) for parallel inquiry. We completed a second qualitative assessment with 15 Spanish-speaking Mexican-origin men who were interested in engaging in behavior changes to improve diet and physical activity habits for weight management [<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The men identified additional barriers to weight management-related behaviors; specifically, that healthful eating habits were hindered by lack of knowledge, sociocultural norms, and conceptualizations of masculinity [<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Participants also recommended viable strategies for weight management including expanding knowledge of obesity-related risks, promotion of traditional Mexican foods, and increasing participant-interventionist accountability.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.9"><label>2.9</label><title>Gender- and cultural-tailoring</title><p id="p0070">We considered a variety of frameworks for the gender and cultural tailoring of our intervention. We chose a framework formulated by Bernal &#x00026; Saez-Santiago [<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] for its comprehensive consideration of a variety of fundamentals of adaptation. Bernal and Saez-Santiago's framework is composed of eight elements that are used to &#x0201c;culturally center&#x0201d; an intervention including; (1) language, (2) persons, (3) metaphors, (4) content, (5) concepts, (6) goals, (7) methods, and (8) context [<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The use of these elements in practice was as follows: (1) <italic>Language</italic> is a carrier of culture; therefore, we delivered our intervention in the participants preferred language (English or Spanish). (2) <italic>Persons</italic> highlights the importance of the cultural and linguistic matching of participant and interventionist as such, we employed the use of Hispanic male interventionists who were from the local community and had a broad understanding of the complex sociocultural and socioeconomic barriers to weight management that our participants may face. (3) <italic>Metaphors</italic> encompassed the inclusion of objects and symbols of the target population in the space where the intervention was delivered. Therefore, this intervention took place at a location that was highly accessible to our study population. The research team ensured that the visible d&#x000e9;cor and any passive information that was hanging on the walls was culturally and linguistically appropriate. (4) <italic>Content</italic> adaptations call for the inclusion of values, customs, and traditions shared by the intervention sample within all verbal communication (e.g., recruitment communication) and/or any distributed materials (e.g., flyers, informational pamphlets etc.). Consequently, all participant communication from recruitment to intervention, whether verbal or otherwise, was tailored to be culturally- and regionally-responsive. (5) <italic>Concepts</italic> considered the distinct ways in which different cultures and genders can define, manifest, and treat health concerns. As such, using our formative findings, we considered the opinions and perspectives of weight management of Hispanic males to better frame attainable bilateral communication with our participants. (6) <italic>Goals</italic> entailed that participant objectives of the intervention should be created with attention to the specific values, customs, and traditions of a client's gender- and culturally-bound definitions of success. Our preliminary work [<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] suggested that prescribed dietary and physical activity changes should take into consideration cultural gender norms as well as strenuous work schedules. For instance, prescribed dietary changes were based on alterations to participants' current diets (e.g., consumption of 2 flour tortillas versus 4 tortillas per meal) or the inclusion of culturally appropriate alternatives (e.g., substitution of corn tortillas for flour tortillas every other meal). (7) <italic>Methods</italic> referred to procedures implemented to simplify the achievement of intervention goals and their consideration of cultural and or gender norms, which in this case could include our culturally- and/or gender-adapted recruitment sites that were chosen (e.g., Swap Meet). (8) <italic>Context</italic> referred to the consideration of a participant's broader social, economic, and political reality, encompassing the effects of social and cultural processes such as socio-economic status, acculturative stress, immigration status, and neighborhood effects on their adherence to intervention-related prescribed behavior change.

Therefore, intervention participants attended 12 weekly 30&#x02013;45-min individual counseling sessions guided by a trained bilingual Hispanic male lifestyle coach. Participants were weighed in each week prior to their session to assist interventionists with weight counseling and goal-setting. Counseling sessions were tailored to the needs of the participants (e.g., language preference, evening/weekend sessions, waiting/childcare area). The lifestyle coach provided expertise, goal setting support, and self-monitoring reminders for participants. Participants also received tailored lesson materials focused on behavioral strategies for adopting and maintaining healthy eating and physical activity behaviors based on Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) [<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and Problem Solving Theory [<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. For instance, the lessons included information necessary for participants to possess the skills and knowledge to perform behaviors. Self-regulation was reinforced through the promotion of self-monitoring behaviors, goal setting, and self-instruction. In addition, problem solving exercises were used to improve adherence to study goals and improve self-efficacy [<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].

Participants self-monitored their body weight eating , and physical activity behaviors in a weekly journal. The information provided in these journals was used to generate discussion points for the lifestyle coach.

Specific focus areas included reducing the amount of foods consumed, modifying the types of food they eat, making small changes when eating out, and reducing liquid calories (e.g., alcohol and sugar-sweetened beverages). We also addressed specific eating behavior issues identified in our formative work [<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] including: access to healthy food, cost of food, meal preparation, portion control, and family/social events that may prohibit optimal change [<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].

Additional issues related to physical activity were addressed including: neighborhood safety, childcare to allow time for physical activity, and acceptance from other family members [<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. We provided strategies to overcome these barriers (e.g., providing a list of neighborhood resources for physical activity). In addition, we provided a 12-week membership to the YMCA.

After 12-weeks of receiving no intervention, WLC participants received the GCSWLI <underline>plus</underline> mHealth technology support. The integration of mHealth technology, in combination with face-to-face counseling, was due to our formative work suggesting it may improve participation and assist participants with behavior change, particularly for physical activity [<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. This included tailored text messaging from study staff and real-time self-monitoring support through the use of the Fitbit Charge 2, a consumer-wearable physical activity tracker, and a Fitbit Aria Wi-Fi Smart Scale for body weight. Participants were encouraged to use the Fitbit during all waking hours and weigh themselves daily using the Aria smart scale. In addition, two weekly text messages were tailored to their self-reported barriers and observed from their Fitbit tools. Intervention strategies of Phase 1 were maintained during this delivery, thereby ensuring all participants had the appropriate tools to continue weight loss efforts regardless of mHealth use.

Such events included illness, signs, symptoms, or clinically significant laboratory test abnormality that appeared worsened during the course of the research study regardless of casual relationship to the study. A SAE is an AE that results in one of the following: 1) Death: death due to any cause; 2) Life-threatening condition: the subject was at potential risk of dying at the time of the AE or it is suspected that the use of continued use of the study interventions would result in the subject's death; 3) Hospitalization: this indicates initial admission to the hospital or prolongation of a hospital stay that results from the AE; or 4) Disability: the AE results in a significant, persistent, or permanent change, impairment, damage or disruptions in the participant's body function/structure, physical activities, or quality of life. An AE form was completed and documented at each clinical evaluation. AE assessments were done by measurement staff and these staff members also were responsible for collecting all relevant source documentation to ensure accurate assessment and grading of adverse events is achieved. The Principal Investigator was responsible for reviewing, confirming, and signing off on all AE forms. AE/SAE data also were used to assess whether there was any change in the risk-to-benefit ratio of this study. If potential safety concerns were identified that changed the benefit-to-risk ratio for participants, the UA IRB was notified to determine the proper course of action to address these safety concerns.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec5"><label>5</label><title>Statistical analysis plan</title><sec id="sec5.1"><label>5.1</label><title>Feasibility outcomes</title><p id="p0215">The primary feasibility outcomes were recruitment and retention. Effectiveness of recruitment was determined by the number of Hispanic men who contacted the researchers and expressed interest in participation; numbers screened for eligibility; numbers eligible/ineligible for study inclusion and reason for ineligibility; and numbers enrolled in the study. Having assumed that recruitment would be carried out over 12-months, we aimed to recruit, on average, approximately 2 participants per week. A recruitment rate of less than this would have indicated a lack of feasibility. Retention was measured as the number of participants who remained in the pilot study at 12 and 24 weeks, divided by the number enrolled. Retention rates in weight loss trials have been shown to be between 60 and 80% [<xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,<xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. A retention rate less than 60% would indicate a lack of feasibility. Descriptive analyses were conducted to examine process measures which included attendance at weekly counseling sessions, self-monitoring of dietary intake, physical activity, self-weighing, treatment satisfaction, and intervention delivery time. Descriptive analyses were also used to examine the use of mHealth technology (e.g., receipt of text messages, use of wearable activity monitors, and smart scale).</p></sec><sec id="sec5.2"><label>5.2</label><title>Treatment satisfaction and acceptability</title><p id="p0220">Participants were asked to rate their overall satisfaction with the intervention at 12 and 24-weeks and if they would recommend the program to others [<xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>].

Weight was assessed at 0, 6, 12, 18, and 24-weeks and was modeled with a linear mixed model using an unstructured mean and covariance to guard against misspecification. Fixed effect terms include intervention group (GCSWLI, WLC), time, and their interaction. Linear mixed models account for the non-independence due to repeated measures on the same participant, and yield unbiased estimates for certain types of missing data [<xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Weight loss at 6, 12, 18, and 24-weeks for each group will be estimated using contrasts within this model and will be reported with 95% confidence intervals, as will the differences between groups.

Between June&#x02013;August 2016, 143 men expressed interest in participation. Twenty-eight men elected not to complete eligibility screening due to the following reasons: work conflicts prohibiting participation (n&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;11); were no longer interested in the study (n&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;10); limited access to the study site (n&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;3); did not want to provide a blood sample (n&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;2); did not identify as Hispanic/Latino (n&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;1); and could not commit to study requirements (n&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;1). Of the115 that were screened, face-to-face recruitment at the swap meet yielded the most men (n&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;101), followed by referrals (n&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;6), social media posts (n&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;5), and printed flyers (n&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;3). In total, 90 men were eligible, and 25 ineligible for study inclusion. Common reasons for ineligibility, after completing the eligibility screening, included not meeting the BMI criterion (n&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;9), treatment for psychological issues (n&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;5), high amounts of self-reported physical activity (n&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;4), did not identify as Hispanic/Latino (n&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;3), medical condition that indicated an acute risk for cardiovascular event (n&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;2), not in eligible age range (n&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;1), and treatment for condition that could affect body weight (n&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;1). Of those who were eligible to participate, 36 men did not show for baseline assessments, 1 cited a work conflict and declined participation, and 1 did not complete the initial telephone screening. Fifty-two enrolled and completed baseline measures. Two men withdrew prior to randomization citing time commitment issues. Overall, 50 men were randomized into the study, exceeding our target recruitment.

Hispanic population is the fastest growing in the U.S., efforts to identify strategies to promote weight control among Hispanic males, a population at high-risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes, has potential to significantly impact public health. The expected outcome of the proposed project is the identification of feasible and appropriate weight loss intervention strategies to improve engagement and weight management in this vulnerable and underserved population. This addition to the literature holds great promise in moving forward obesity prevention and treatment programs for Hispanic men. Notably, our research design also will allow us to examine participant characteristics and process measures related to the uptake of mHealth technology. This will inform the development of a future highly-scalable weight loss intervention that could be disseminated to a broader proportion of Hispanic males (and other populations) in settings where on-site weight loss delivery efforts may be a challenge (such as clinics, rural settings, or worksites in which access to facilities and services is limited). Further, we will use the variance estimates of this pilot study to design future adequately-powered studies to test the efficacy of the GCSWLI, with the intent of developing strategies and practice recommendations to expand the reach and impact of the intervention approach. However, it is important to recognize our study is limited to Hispanic men, primarily of Mexican-origin descent living in Southwest Arizona, which may limit the generalizability of our findings.</p></sec><sec id="sec8"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p id="p0250">The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec id="sec9"><title>Ethics approval and consent to participate</title><p id="p0255">All participants were informed about the potential benefits and risk of the weight loss intervention.
