The content can be also be easily updated and made available to all.</p><p>Inspired by these findings we developed a web portal, with the aim of improving the public's access to evidence-based health information and health literacy skills. What health literacy skills really entail has been conceptualised in many different ways. We used the multi-dimensional model formulated by Zarcadoolas and colleagues which contains four central domains: fundamental literacy (reading, writing, speaking and working with numbers), science literacy (understanding and using science and technology), civic literacy (skills and abilities that enables awareness, participation and involvement), and cultural literacy (skills and abilities to recognise, understand and use beliefs, customs, world-views and social identities) <xref rid="pone.0037715-Zarcadoolas1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. The web portal was designed from a public health perspective to target both healthy people as well as patients, and to be used either independently or in consultation with health providers. The web portal was intended to be used by those who are interested in searching for health information, who would like to know more about medical and health-related information, or need support in decisions related to health. Its content and key intervention targets were informed by extensive literature searches as well as explorative pre-studies with input from people within our target audiences, including focus groups and a questionnaire study based on the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) <xref rid="pone.0037715-AustvollDahlgren1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0037715-AustvollDahlgren2" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0037715-AustvollDahlgren3" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0037715-AustvollDahlgren4" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Three key barriers to obtaining information were identified; not knowing where to find reliable and relevant information, the inability to understand and critically appraise health information and the inability to exchange information in consultations <xref rid="pone.0037715-AustvollDahlgren4" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. The content of the web portal was tailored to address these barriers by facilitating specific domains of health literacy through a choice of evidence based strategies <xref rid="pone.0037715-AustvollDahlgren4" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. The web portal was developed within the conceptual framework of the shared-decision making model and evidence based practice, encouraging participation and emphasising the importance of that decisions should be based on the best available evidence <xref rid="pone.0037715-Coulter1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0037715-Dawes1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Using illustrations of typical healthcare topics, the web portal focused on <italic>how</italic> research is conducted and <italic>why</italic> this is important rather than just reporting conclusions and expert interpretations. Generic and non-disease specific in focus, the web portal was designed to be applicable to a range of healthcare decisions and settings, and included three facilitators or tool-sets to address each of the main barriers to obtaining information:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Access to medical and health-related research databases, an introduction to research methods, the principles of science (based on the steps of the evidence based practice model) and levels of evidence synthesis <xref rid="pone.0037715-Bjrndal1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0037715-DiCenso1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>.</p></list-item><list-item><p>A checklist for critically assessing health information (DISCERN) <xref rid="pone.0037715-Charnock1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref> and information about why critical assessment is important.</p></list-item><list-item><p>A checklist for consultations with health care providers <xref rid="pone.0037715-Irwig1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref> and information about what decision making related to treatment and screening entails.</p></list-item></list><p>The development and content of the web portal is described in more detail in another paper <xref rid="pone.0037715-AustvollDahlgren4" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, or can be viewed online at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sunnskepsis.no">www.sunnskepsis.no</ext-link>.

In addition, we wished to increase the probability that the portal would be used by participants in association with visits to health professionals during the trial. Parents with children under the age of 4-years of age were therefore targeted. At this life stage, parents are typically having many questions about treating and preventing health problems. They are also healthcare users with the highest number of health visits per year both for themselves (a mean number of visits per year of 4. 6), and for their children (mean number of visits of 3) <xref rid="pone.0037715-Statistics1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>.

Few studies, however, have targeted the publics' health literacy skills including domains other than functional literacy. Thus, for the outcomes included in this trial we had very little previous experience to rely on. Considering that the intervention was passive in nature, we anticipated the effects to be modest. We assumed a conservative minimum detectable difference of means (amounting to a one point difference on seven point scale with a standard deviation of 2,1) on the outcome &#x02018;beliefs about searching&#x02019;. These assumptions were supported by the means and standard deviations observed in the piloting phase and in the validation study of the TPB questionnaire <xref rid="pone.0037715-AustvollDahlgren3" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Furthermore, we based our sample size calculations on a power of 0.80, a level of significance of 0.95 and the use of a two-sided t-test for statistical analysis.

The intervention group was allowed access to the web portal immediately after randomisation through an email containing the URL, and given three days to explore its content and tools before receiving the first task. Each of the tasks corresponded to the web portal's three main content sections, namely: the improved use of research based information, improved critical appraisal of health information, and improved beliefs about participation (search and activation).</p><fig id="pone-0037715-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0037715.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Overview of the study design.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0037715.g002"/></fig><p>The purpose of the first task, the searching task, was to evaluate the degree to which participants used research based sources to obtain healthcare information. Participants were asked to formulate a question and to answer it by searching for online information. The intervention group was not asked specifically to use the web portal for this task and were thus free to search for information using any resource they felt would be useful, including the web portal.</p><p>The purpose of the second task, the critical appraisal task, was to evaluate participant critical appraisal skills related to health information. All participants were asked to rate the trustworthiness of an online article describing how to prevent swine flu, and that included information about vaccinations and alternative therapies. The intervention group was asked explicitly to use the full DISCERN critical appraisal tool which was provided on the web portal <xref rid="pone.0037715-Charnock1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. DISCERN is an instrument for patients and other lay-users of health information and is designed to allow them to evaluate the reliability of written information about treatment choices <xref rid="pone.0037715-Charnock2" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. Swine flu was chosen as the subject for this task for a number of reasons. All vaccinations are voluntary in Norway, and related healthcare decisions were therefore seen as a topic that would be of concern to all parents. Moreover, there has been considerable discussion about vaccinations in the media over the last few years, characterised by strong and often conflicting viewpoints <xref rid="pone.0037715-Tickner1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0037715-Mills1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0037715-Wolfe1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0037715-Goldacre1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, including debate about swine flu vaccinations <xref rid="pone.0037715-Haug1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0037715-Teasdale1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. We therefore viewed this topic as having considerable potential interest to participants. The specific material we chose for evaluation was taken from a health information site identified using a Google search and was typical of the kind of information available on sites used by lay-people searching for health information.</p><p>The third task, reporting of beliefs about search for health information and activation, was designed to explore potential differences between the intervention and control groups in terms of beliefs about health information searches (attitudes, social expectations, perceived behavioural control and intention to search). It also served to explore differences in overall levels of activation. In this final task, the intervention group was also given four additional questions in order to evaluate their satisfaction with the web portal.</p><p>Each of the tasks was sent to participants at weekly intervals. This timing and the overall length were decided on for two reasons: firstly, participants were provided with sufficient time to complete the tasks at their own pace. Secondly, longer periods or shorter intervals between tasks could possibly have had potentially negative consequences on the response rate and result in participation fatigue. At the end of the study, after all data had been collected, the control group was also given access to the web portal. The time-frame for data collection was pre-specified, beginning March and lasting throughout June 2011.</p></sec><sec id="s2a7"><title>Participant retention</title><p>Basic non-sensitive background information and email addresses were kept on file to allow for a descriptive analysis of losses to follow-up.

All analyses were performed using available data, with all participants being analysed in the group to which they were randomly assigned.</p></sec><sec id="s2a9"><title>Outcome assessment and analysis</title><p>Few tools are available for evaluating improvements in health literacy skills, and most map only general reading and numeracy skills (in other words, only functional literacy) <xref rid="pone.0037715-Ishikawa1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. Our intervention was intended mostly to target and evaluate critical and social skills and we identified no single available instrument suitable to achieving these goals. The outcomes of this study were therefore evaluated using a selection of instruments which, when combined, were considered adequate to evaluating most of the important health literacy skills targeted by our intervention. The main outcomes and corresponding instruments are described in further detail below (see also <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0037715-t001">table 1</xref>) and include both actual behaviour as well as behavioural beliefs. All data were automatically exported into SPSS via the online data collection program.</p><p>For the searching task the outcome was evaluated by categorising the accessed Internet material (identified by hyperlinks) as information that either had or had not been based on research. The information was considered to be &#x02018;research-based&#x02019; if it took the form of a report about original research (e.g. a primary study) or summarised research that had been based on explicit and systematic criteria (e.g. a systematic review or decision support). The information was excluded if no references were provided or identified, and if there were no explicit systematic criteria related to how and why any included references had been chosen. The material (identified by hyperlinks) was categorised by two independent and blinded researchers with training in the field of evidence-based practice and evidence synthesis. Their conclusions were then discussed further with the lead researcher. It was expected that research based information would be found by more participants in the intervention group than the control group. This hypothesis was tested by calculating the relative risk and corresponding confidence intervals.</p><p>For the critical appraisal task we used DISCERN appraisal tool (item number 16) to compare overall respondent ratings of the swine flu information <xref rid="pone.0037715-Charnock2" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. This tool measures the respondent's overall rating on a scale of 1&#x02013;5, where a score of 1&#x02013;2 indicates &#x02018;low quality&#x02019; (serious or extensive shortcomings), 3 indicates &#x02018;moderate&#x02019; quality (potentially important but not serious shortcomings) and a rating of 4&#x02013;5 indicates that respondents felt the material to be of &#x02018;high quality&#x02019; with only minimal shortcomings <xref rid="pone.0037715-Charnock2" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. The study group's mean value information rating was measured against ratings of the same material made by two blinded external experts with professional research and healthcare backgrounds. Based on results from previous studies using DISCERN, the mean overall score of the intervention group was expected to be closer in value to the experts' rating than the control group <xref rid="pone.0037715-Charnock1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. We also expected that the overall quality rating made by the intervention group would be lower, given that evaluations based on explicit criteria tend to be more critical compared to personal opinion <xref rid="pone.0037715-Eysenbach1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. The effects of the intervention were measured by calculating the mean differences between the groups and applying one-sided t-tests.</p><p>For measuring beliefs about intention to search for health information and activation we used two instruments. A questionnaire was designed specifically for the purpose of evaluating beliefs about searching for health information, based on the TPB <xref rid="pone.0037715-AustvollDahlgren3" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. The Patient Activation Measure (PAM) was used, with permission from Insignia Health, to evaluate overall activation and participants' self-management abilities <xref rid="pone.0037715-Steinsbekk1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>.</p><p>The TPB is a social cognition model rigorously tested and widely used to predict behavioural intentions <xref rid="pone.0037715-Francis1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0037715-Armitage1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0037715-Eccles1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. According to this model, there are three cognitive variables that can predict behavioural intentions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037715-g003">Figure 3</xref>) <xref rid="pone.0037715-Francis1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0037715-Ajzen1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>.

While the direct measures describe the overall beliefs associated with behavioural intentions, in this study of intention to search for health information, the indirect measures represented the specific beliefs that underlay the overall assessments and were seen as explanatory factors. To evaluate the influence of the intervention on the direct and indirect TPB components, we calculated the differences in mean overall scores and specific beliefs using a two-sided t-test. The minimum and maximum mean composite score for direct measures were 1 to 7, &#x02212;21 to &#x0002b;21 for specific indirect measures and &#x02212;63 to 63 for overall composite indirect score for subjective norm and perceived behavioural control, and &#x02212;84 to &#x0002b;84 for attitude (where higher values indicate more favourable attitudes, greater social pressure and higher perceived behavioural control). The intervention group was expected to have stronger beliefs than the control group.</p><p>To explore the effects of the intervention on predicting intention to search, the dependency between &#x02018;intention&#x02019; and the composite direct measures from the TPB questionnaire was investigated using a multiple regression model in which &#x02018;intention&#x02019; was the dependent variable. Group assignment (web portal vs. no intervention), and the three composite scores from the TPB model (namely &#x02018;Attitudes towards the behaviour&#x02019;, &#x02018;Subjective norms&#x02019; and &#x02018;Perceived behavioural control&#x02019;) were entered as independent variables. In addition, we estimated the effect of the intervention on the dependency between the three composite scores and the intention by entering the interaction terms between group assignment and each of the three composite scores as independent variables in the model. Furthermore, the TPB model, and consequently the questionnaire, consists of several operationalisations of theoretical constructs with certain assumptions about interrelationships between these (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0037715-g003">Figure 3</xref>). These relationships were explored by computing simple bivariate correlations using Pearson's r. The direct TPB measures are hypothesised to be positively correlated with intention, but the direct measures may also be interrelated as these are not seen as categories independent of each other <xref rid="pone.0037715-Ajzen1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. The questionnaire is available upon request by contacting the authors.</p><p>Overall activation was measured using the Patient Activation Measure (PAM), a validated instrument applicable to both patients and healthy people <xref rid="pone.0037715-Steinsbekk1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0037715-Hibbard1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>. This instrument includes four key domains (believing the patient role is important, having confidence and knowledge necessary to taking action, actually taking action to improve one's health, and staying the course under stress) which are measured by a total of 13 items <xref rid="pone.0037715-Hibbard1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0037715-Hibbard2" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>.

We anticipated that activation levels in the intervention group would be higher than activation levels for the control group. To evaluate this outcome, a two-sided t-test was used to measure and test the difference in mean overall score.</p><p>For measuring satisfaction with the web portal, we obtained user feedback from the intervention group about the web portal.

The model encompasses seven domains to assess whether a website is accessible, usable, credible, valuable, findable, desirable and useful <xref rid="pone.0037715-Morville1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>. In our study, questions were used to assess three of these measures of user satisfaction (credibility, usefulness and usability), each measured on a satisfaction scale from 1&#x02013;7 (higher values indicating greater satisfaction).

Participant recruitment can be a significant obstacle in the research process, and this proved to be a challenge in our study. Given the resources available, we were unable to recruit the number of participants suggested by the power-analysis. The response rates were also lower than expected. Considering that the content of the web portal and tasks included in the trial may be considered as challenging or difficult by many parents, particularly by those with lower health literacy, a higher drop-out could have been expected among those with lower education. Although the correlation between health literacy and education is not perfect, it is a relevant predictor <xref rid="pone.0037715-Berkman1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Background data information about those who dropped out of the study revealed no statistically significant differences in sex or education levels, compared to those who did not drop out which is a positive finding. There was, however, a small but borderline statistically significant (p&#x0003c;0.06) difference between the intervention and control group in terms of loss to follow-up: more were seen to drop out of the intervention group (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0037715-t001">Table 1</xref>). The difference in drop-out between groups may indicate that people joined the study primarily in order to receive access to the portal. Once they had access, they may have dropped out before the first task was given. Of those who did participate in one or more of tasks, the background characteristics across the intervention group and the control groups showed that participant distributions by sex and education were very similar. The mean level of education, however, was slightly higher in the control group. The fact that the loss to follow-up mainly happened between the time of the first screening questionnaire and the time of the first task may indicate that the tasks included in the trial were considered too extensive.</p><p>Using an online questionnaire system was a time-saving and cost-efficient data collection method. It allowed for the confidential treatment of data and provided an opportunity to use automatic systems for keeping track of response rates, sending out reminders, sending notifications directly to participants if data were missing, and to export the data directly into Excel and SPSS. In this way we reduced the risk of potential errors inherent in manual data entry, ensured that all communications were standardised, and that both groups were treated equally.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Intervention effects on critical skills</title><p>The effects of the intervention on the critical skills of participants were evaluated by means of a searching task and a critical appraisal task. Only minor improvements in the intervention group were identified by both tasks and these differences were not statistically significant.</p><p>The number of research-based sources reported by participants in the searching task was very low in both study groups. Interestingly, the majority of participants in the intervention group chose to use sources not included in the portal. This may imply that the respondents preferred to rely on sources with which they were already familiar, or that that the three-day interval between being given access and having to perform the first task, may have been too short to allow them to become familiarised with the portal itself.</p><p>In the analysis, the sources were categorised based on pragmatic yet strict judgments regarding whether the information was research-based or not. This proved to be difficult, particularly because few of the sites provided references or indicated what their information was based on. This applied even to information provided by government and public health organisations. Consequently, information that was research-based may have been excluded if it lacked appropriate references. One source, for example, which was originally excluded because it lacked references, was then re-included in our study based on the knowledge of our lead researcher (this material was the Norwegian translation of BMJ's Best Practice Patient information). That online health information is often unclear, incomplete or even misleading is supported by reviews of online literature <xref rid="pone.0037715-Glenton1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0037715-Hoye1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0037715-Wolfe1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref> and underlines the importance of providing users with easily accessible research-based information and the need to improve critical appraisal skills. But it also indicates that those who present such information on the Internet should critically review their own publishing practices and place greater emphasis on transparency and sources of their information.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Beliefs about participation and intervention effects</title><p>Beliefs about participation were evaluated using a TPB questionnaire that addressed intention to search and underlying factors, and the PAM questionnaire describing overall activation. The overall score for beliefs about participation (based on both the TPB and PAM) was high in both groups, indicating that participants viewed taking a more active role favourably. When comparing the two groups, we found small statistically non-significant improvements in favour of the intervention group with both the instruments indicating higher intention to search and higher activation.</p><p>In the TPB questionnaire, both groups were also found to have strong favourable attitudes towards searching for health information. Whereas both groups reported high overall perceived behavioural control, their responses to specific beliefs highlighted the fact that certain aspects of searching were perceived as being slightly difficult. The overall social pressure to search was moderate. Of particular interest was the fact that parents experienced very little pressure or expectation from health professionals who might have been anticipated to have a central role in this. Our findings are similar to those from other studies showing that independent searches for health information are rarely discussed, facilitated or addressed during healthcare consultations <xref rid="pone.0037715-Wainstein1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0037715-Bylund1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0037715-Tuffrey1" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0037715-Gordon1" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>.</p><p>The mean differences of direct measures across the groups showed a statistically significant difference in favour of the intervention group in terms of overall attitude 0.6 (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.03). This suggests that the web portal may be a useful tool for improving attitudes towards searching for health information, and is an interesting finding in view of the fact that attitude was also found to be the most important predictor of intention to search in both groups. That we found favourable attitude to be an important factor associated with searching for health information is supported by other studies <xref rid="pone.0037715-Fox1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0037715-Wainstein1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0037715-Sabel1" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>, including another study in which the same questionnaire was used <xref rid="pone.0037715-AustvollDahlgren3" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Perceived behavioural control was only a weak and not statistically significant predictor of intention to search but was found to have a strong correlation with both intention and attitude. Thus, although the user feeling of being in control of searching does not directly predict intention, it may still be an important underlying variable. Subjective norm was also found to have a weak relationship with intention and this finding supports earlier research showing that social expectations or pressure do not appear to be an important or positive predictor of intention to search <xref rid="pone.0037715-AustvollDahlgren3" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>.</p><p>We identified no statistically significant difference between the groups in terms of the effect of the intervention on the prediction of intention to search. The TPB components' overall prediction of intention to search was satisfactory and generally consistent with other studies in which the TPB had been used to predict behavioural intentions across a range of health topics <xref rid="pone.0037715-Armitage1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Satisfaction with the portal</title><p>The satisfaction with the web portal was good. This is encouraging given that the purpose of the web portal, and the concepts introduced, were potentially novel to most respondents. A challenge in this project was that although we wanted to improve user access to evidence-based information we also wanted to improve knowledge and skills. When developing the web portal, a compromise was therefore reached between usability (how easy it is to access reliable health information) and educational intention (reflected for example by how people are routed through the web pages). Consequently, the web portal may potentially demand more of its users relative to traditional sources of health information. Despite this, the results of this study indicated that we may have come a long way towards achieving this balance correctly.</p><p>In the next phase of our research, the web portal will be made publicly available and will be search optimised. This will mean that when people search for health information using a general search engine, the web portal will range high on the list of hits and, in this way, will contribute to making evidence-based health information more available to the general public. The web portal is also in continuous development, and more features will be considered for inclusion. Ideas for expansion include a discussion forum about science and research, and a blog addressing current issues related to medical and health related information in the public debate.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study was a pragmatic trial conducted in a real life setting. The recruitment of participants was challenging, the response rates were somewhat low and the intervention effects smaller than expected. Although this resulted in the study being underpowered, we found improvements on attitudes towards searching for health information, a variable identified as the most important predictor of intention to search. The relevance of the web portal to users was confirmed by the fact that the participants considered the web portal to have good usability, usefulness and credibility.</p></sec><sec id="s4f"><title>Implications for practice</title><p>It is vital that health practice and decision making should be based on the best available, current, valid and relevant evidence. Recognising that users should play a central role in evidence-based practice, people should be encouraged to take on an active role. Moreover, resources such as web portals should be made available in order to facilitate greater access to, and critical use of, research-based information.</p><p>Future efforts should aim at experimenting more with web-based resources in order to encourage user involvement in health care. Large samples are needed to identify more robust results. Furthermore, online resources alone may not be sufficient to improve health literacy skills effectively. More intensive interventions could include the use of the web portal during consultations with health providers, or as part of evidence-based practice courses for users such as patient representatives who have a particular interest in healthcare issues.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0037715.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>
