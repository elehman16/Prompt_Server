In the United Kingdom (UK), general counselling (treatment-as-usual; TAU) is widely delivered, but has limited effectiveness.

Secondary outcomes at the 1-month follow-up were percentage days abstinent (PDA) from cocaine, and longest period (days) of continuous abstinence (LPA) in the prior 28&#x000a0;days.</p><p>Outcomes were analysed as an unadjusted group mean difference (with Hedge's <italic>g</italic> effect size [ES]) and a 95% Confidence Interval [CI] for the primary outcome and a 90% CI for the secondary outcomes. Exploratory, multivariable linear (primary outcome) and Poisson regression models (secondary outcomes), with sex, age, months of regular cocaine use, baseline outcome score, and group estimated the effectiveness of the intervention.

With outcome data collected for all participants at the endpoint, the intervention group mean CEQ-F score (14&#x000b7;77; SD 21&#x000b7;47) was lower than the control group mean (51&#x000b7;75; SD 22&#x000b7;72); ES -1&#x000b7;62; 95% CI -2&#x000b7;45 to &#x02212;0&#x000b7;80.</p><p>MFCT was associated with more cocaine abstinence in the intervention group (PDA 85&#x000b7;94; SD 18&#x000b7;96) than the control group (PDA 54&#x000b7;59; SD 30&#x000b7;29); ES 1&#x000b7;19; 90% CI 0&#x000b7;54 to 1&#x000b7;84.

Exploratory, confounder-adjusted regression models for this preliminary effect supported the treatment association for reduced craving experiences (CEQ-F Coef. -28&#x000b7;25; 95% CI -45&#x000b7;15 to &#x02212;11&#x000b7;35); more abstinence (PDA Incidence Rate Ratio [IRR] 1&#x000b7;56; 95% CI 1&#x000b7;31 to 1&#x000b7;88); and greater maximum abstinence (LPA IRR 2&#x000b7;56; 95% CI 1&#x000b7;96 to 3&#x000b7;35), although relative weak unmeasured confounding could overturn these model-adjusted exposure-outcome associations.</p><p>There were four serious adverse events (among three participants).

There are several forms of cocaine, including a hydrochloride powder (taken by nasal insufflation or by injection) and a solid alkaloid (known as <italic>crack</italic>, and usually inhaled after heating). Injecting and smoking cocaine induces euphoria and confidence for ~5&#x02013;15&#x000a0;min, with dose-dependent increases in heart rate, blood pressure and body temperature. The pleasurable, reinforcing effects of nasally administered powder cocaine are less intense, but longer-lasting (~45&#x000a0;min) (<xref rid="bb0200" ref-type="bibr">Jeffcoat et al., 1989</xref>).

In England and Wales, cocaine is the most commonly used drug after cannabis.

There are well-studied neurobiological circuits (and drug-class specific neurotransmitter models) underpinning psychoactive substance use disorders. These circuits are found in the frontal-striatal region and the nucleus accumbens, amygdala, insula and hippocampus (<xref rid="bb0405" ref-type="bibr">Volkow et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bb0425" ref-type="bibr">Wise &#x00026; Koob, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bb0420" ref-type="bibr">Wilcox et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p id="p0040">Learning models of CUD emphasise quick-forming episodic memories of drug reward.

If the person is able to strike a balance between goals and habits, behavioural control may remain mostly intact, and consumption will be limited in frequency and intensity (<xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">de Wit &#x00026; Dickinson, 2009</xref>). However, as implicit-autonomous processes strengthen, many find it very hard to control their impulses and desires to use cocaine (<xref rid="bb0415" ref-type="bibr">Wiers et al., 2010</xref>). Taking crack, in particular, can be highly automatic and irrational. Patients often report that they know that only their first dose of crack results in euphoria. There will be less pleasure obtained from subsequent doses with an increase in anxious thoughts, uncomfortable physical sensations and unwanted behaviors. Yet they re-dose within minutes until their supply is exhausted.</p></sec><sec id="s0015"><label>1.2</label><title>Craving Experience, Process and Assessment</title><p id="p0050">The subjective experience called <italic>craving</italic> was reintroduced in DSM5 as a diagnostic symptom of substance use disorders. Craving is commonly understood as a powerful desire and emotion. This construct has a long history of theoretical and clinical study in the addictions, particularly in tobacco smoking and alcohol research (<xref rid="bb0370" ref-type="bibr">Tiffany &#x00026; Carter, 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bb0380" ref-type="bibr">Tiffany &#x00026; Wray, 2012</xref>). In the clinic, accounts of intense craving, and automatic drug seeking in response, are often reported after a patient encounters a conditioned cue in their environment (such as a place, object, person, or physical sensation such as pain). Craving often intensifies and feels very unpleasant when drug access is prevented or delayed (such as waiting for a drug seller or money to become available), or when an effort is made to resist. There may be autonomic (interoceptive) reactions, including changes in breathing, heart rate and sweating (<xref rid="bb0310" ref-type="bibr">O'Brien et al., 1990</xref>). However, craving is not always intense or persistent, and cocaine seeking is sometimes initiated by low-level desire (<xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">Field et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p id="p0055">There have been several influential accounts of craving process, including models by <xref rid="bb0365" ref-type="bibr">Tiffany (1990)</xref>; <xref rid="bb0410" ref-type="bibr">West (2006)</xref> and Kavanagh and colleagues' Elaborated Intrusion [EI] theory of desire (<xref rid="bb0275" ref-type="bibr">May et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bb0205" ref-type="bibr">Kavanagh et al., 2009</xref>). As applied to cocaine, EI theory describes an episode of craving with two components: an initial, spontaneously intrusive thought, followed by a cycle of elaborative cognition in which well-consolidated memories of past cocaine use are recalled and linked to sensory imagery, basic and complex affect, beliefs and expectancies of future pleasure or negative mood relief. This consciously mediated desire will be stronger if there is sensory vividness (<xref rid="bb0375" ref-type="bibr">Tiffany &#x00026; Hakenewerth, 1991</xref>; <xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">Andrade et al., 2012</xref>). We believe there is much to be learned from discussing with a patient the strength, frequency and their interpretation of craving episodes, as well as the type and number of DSM5 CUD harm symptoms experienced.</p><p id="p0060">There is no consensus about how to assess craving generally, or specifically for substance classes. A single dimension or a binary indicator is sometimes used, but we favour a multi-component approach. Based on EI theory, the present study uses the Craving Experiences Questionnaire (CEQ (<xref rid="bb0270" ref-type="bibr">May et al., 2014</xref>)) for cocaine, implemented as an 11-item measure of the frequency of the following recent craving experiences: intensity (wanted, needed, had a strong urge); imagery (pictured it, imaged the taste, the smell, the effects and how your body would feel); and intrusiveness (trying not to think of cocaine, frequency of intrusive thoughts, difficulty in thinking about anything else).</p></sec><sec id="s0020"><label>1.3</label><title>Treatment of CUD</title><p id="p0065">Unlike opioids, nicotine and alcohol, there is no approved treatment medication for CUD (<xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">Fischer et al., 2015</xref>). Several psychosocial interventions have been trialled, with Cognitive Behavioural Treatment (CBT) the most extensively studied. Meta-analysis shows CBT is better than no treatment for CUD; but when evaluated alongside active comparators, CBT achieves only a small standardised effect size (ES) associated with reduced cocaine use (0&#x000b7;15; 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 0&#x000b7;07 to 0&#x000b7;24) (<xref rid="bb0235" ref-type="bibr">Magill &#x00026; Ray, 2009</xref>).

These patients were typically offered one-to-one, fortnightly, ongoing, general counselling (treatment-as-usual [TAU]; ~45&#x000a0;min per session). In an observational study of 94,166 patients in the English public treatment system with CUD in 2015/16, 42&#x000b7;9% were still using cocaine after three months of TAU and 50&#x000b7;4% had left treatment by 6&#x000a0;months (<xref rid="bb0335" ref-type="bibr">Public Health England, n.d.</xref>).

The E-value has a minimum value of 1, and is reported alongside a risk ratio measure of its uncertainty, which quantifies the value that the CI for the association would need to shift to the null.</p><p id="p0375">Finally, we calculated the relative risk (RR) for negative UDS data and the number needed to treat (NNT) for DSM5 CUD remission in favour of MFCT.</p><p id="p0380">All adverse events were recorded and classified according to seriousness and the likely relationship to study interventions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0100"><label>3</label><title>Results</title><sec id="s0105"><label>3.1</label><title>Recruitment and Baseline Characteristics</title><p id="p0385">Between July 15, 2015 and November 27, 2016, we screened 58 patients and enrolled 35 participants (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>).

MFCT was also positively associated with improvements on the secondary outcomes (PDA ES 1&#x000b7;19; LPA ES 1&#x000b7;06); both were significant at the set 10% error level, and were supported by Bayes Factors (&#x0003e;3); U<sub>3</sub> (14 of 16 intervention participants above the control group median change). We also showed a statistically significant adjusted MFCT-craving and drug use outcome association in our exploratory multivariable regression. Perhaps unsurprisingly, given the small sample here and inclusion of five covariates, our sensitivity check showed that relatively weak unmeasured confounding could overturn the exposure-outcome association.</p><p id="p0505">On the exploratory outcomes, there were statistically significant effect sizes for MFCT on reduced craving and increased abstinence (each Bayes Factor&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;3&#x000b7;0). We also observed more cocaine negative UDS results (with almost complete agreement with self-report) at the three follow-ups (although the data were insensitive at 3-month follow-up). At the final follow-up, 10 of 16 intervention participants were judged to be in early CUD remission compared to two of 14 control participants (NNT 2).</p><sec id="s0150"><label>4.1</label><title>Strengths and Limitations</title><p id="p0510">Study strengths include the pre-registered research questions and analysis plan for transparent progression evaluation. A strength of the study was the broad eligibility criteria which generalise to community NHS settings and the inclusion of patient with primary CUD as well CUD and co-occurring OUD. Previous studies have observed that this clinical population are less likely to respond to, or successfully complete, OUD treatment (<xref rid="bb0245" ref-type="bibr">Marsden et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">Eastwood et al., 2016</xref>). In the present study, baseline heroin use or enrolment in OST did not moderate CUD outcome, suggesting a relatively stable clinical platform to address cocaine addiction.</p><p id="p0515">Our findings must be considered in the light of several limitations. Firstly, the sample size was small, but it was in-line with recommendations for pilot studies and was pre-determined. Naturally, the preliminary and exploratory nature of the study cannot be over-emphasized.</p><p id="p0520">Second, our findings relate to treatment programmes with psychologists who are CBT trained and supervised. CUD is a complex disorder and our view is that an effective psychosocial intervention requires this level of clinical expertise. The UK and many treatment systems has very limited CBT therapist capacity and this issue will need to be addressed if MFCT is found to be effective after further research.</p><p id="p0525">Third, resources precluded blinded outcome assessment and a TAU-only arm and we devoted available resources for this pilot to assessing the safety of the cue-induction process and did not balance the control group for time exposed to study procedures (each control participant had 9&#x000a0;h of contact versus 18&#x000b7;5&#x000a0;h for intervention participants). We acknowledge that this extra contact time could have contributed to the intervention effect. Balancing intervention exposure time is not always done in the literature. In our review of 14 CBT trials for CUD, six studies did not include a time-balanced control. Nevertheless, for a future trial, we judge it important to include a time-balanced control (e.g. guided relaxation, attention placebo, or credible alternative).</p><p id="p0530">Fourth, at this stage our MFCT has not been designed for co-occurring CUD and PTSD. PTSD is a common co-occurrence among the NHS addiction treatment population with a prevalence of 26&#x02013;52% (<xref rid="bb0345" ref-type="bibr">Roberts et al., 2015</xref>)). These patients are likely to need a specific intervention (<xref rid="bb0285" ref-type="bibr">Najavits et al., 2007</xref>). A trial of prolonged exposure therapy to treat PTSD and polysubstance problems (including cocaine) reported significant improvement in PTSD symptoms, but not in cocaine use (<xref rid="bb0280" ref-type="bibr">Mills et al., 2012</xref>). Further work is therefore needed to explore concurrent or sequential treatment of this patient group.</p><p id="p0535">Fifth, the potential for bias due to our allegiance to the MFCT intervention should also be taken into account. The researcher allegiance effect (i.e. the belief in an intervention's superiority (<xref rid="bb0230" ref-type="bibr">Leykin &#x00026; DeRubeis, 2009</xref>)) is a well-known concern for developmental studies in psychotherapy. In our study, we brought a level of enthusiasm and commitment to research tasks which might not be shared by others in a future multi-centre trial.</p></sec><sec id="s0155"><label>4.2</label><title>Possible Mechanisms</title><p id="p0540">While it would be premature to discuss cognitive-behavioural change mechanisms with pilot data, we observed a very encouraging clinical response for the majority of intervention participants. The majority of our participants readily engaged in therapeutic procedures to elicit and reconsolidate cocaine memories. During informal reflections after completion of MFCT, several participants said that the therapy had helped them be much more aware and of situations and also &#x02018;slow down&#x02019; and reflect on encountered craving episodes - noticing elaborated images, emotions and beliefs and using coping response (e.g. checking the evidence for a thought; bringing to mind a positive or negative sensory image as an alternative; self-reassurance; checking intensity of wanting and how this might reduce if attention is shifted).</p><p id="p0545">At this stage, and with the primary and secondary outcomes recorded at the same endpoint, we have not investigated whether there is a causal relationship between craving and subsequent cocaine use. We will now conduct an exploratory, confounder-adjusted, causal mediation analysis (Stata command: <italic>paramed</italic>). With the 1-month CEQ-F positioned theoretically and temporally as a mediator of 3-month cocaine use, we will investigate the natural direct effect and the indirect effect of treatment through craving reduction.</p></sec><sec id="s0160"><label>4.3</label><title>Implications for Future Research on MFCT</title><p id="p0550">Looking forwards, we judge that the primary outcome of a substantive clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness trial should be cocaine use, with UDS as part of the validation procedure. Efforts to help patients reduce the intensity and intrusiveness of craving remain an important intermediate target, but reducing or quitting cocaine use is the most clinically important recovery indicator. Meaningful reductions in cocaine use could be explored through further patient and public discussion. For example (for alcohol dependence), the European Medicines Agency recommends reporting the number of participants who achieve a 50%, 70% and 90% sustained reduction in alcohol consumption (<xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">European Medicines Agency, 2010</xref>).</p><p id="p0555">While it is not possible to record the quantity of cocaine consumed with any accuracy (<xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">Fischer et al., 2015</xref>), a response measure based on an increase in abstinent days to a pre-set level, or a cut-off associated with the maximal treatment effect is straightforward (<xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">Falk et al., 2014</xref>). We also judge that 3-months is the appropriate primary endpoint, and it will probably be important to include time to follow-up in an adjusted analysis model.</p><p id="p0560">CUD is a prevalent and significant public health problem. Meta-analysis has shown that CUD is hard to treat, with very limited treatment options available to clinicians. Our study is a first required step towards securing effectiveness evidence for a new, adjunctive psychological intervention. With positive findings from the present study, we believe there is a strong case to progress to an appropriately powered, RCT to determine the effectiveness of MFCT.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0165"><title>Contributors</title><p id="p0565">J.M. developed the concept in collaboration with C.G., T.M., L.M., J.S. and N.G.
