lymphedema patients using mobile phones and to investigate the effects thereof.</p><p><bold>Patients and Methods:</bold> A total of 30 patients with lymphedema following
female genital cancer surgery (stages I to II) who were referred from a nearby
gynecologist were randomly divided into groups for routine self-care support (control
group) and mobile telephone-assisted support (intervention group) and received the
self-care support appropriate to their group. The (total) circumference of the leg with
edema, FACT-G (cancer patient QOL), MHP (mental health status), and self-care
self-assessment were comparatively investigated at three months after the initial
interview.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> No significant reduction in the (total) circumferences of legs with
edema was confirmed in either the control or intervention group. The intervention group
was significantly better than the control group in terms of the activity circumstances and
FACT-G mental status at three months after the initial interview. The intervention group
was also significantly better in psychological, social, and physical items in the MHP. The
intervention group was significantly better than the control group in terms of
circumstances of self-care implementation at three months after the initial interview.
Additionally, comparison of the circumstances of implementation for different aspects of
self-care content showed that the intervention group was significantly better at selecting
shoes, observing edema, moisturizing, self-drainage, wearing compression garments, and
implementing bandaging.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Compared with routine self-care support, mobile
telephone-assisted support is suggested to be effective for leg lymphedema patients&#x02019; QOL
and mental health status as well as their self-care behaviors.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>leg lymphedema</kwd><kwd>self-care</kwd><kwd>after the surgery of the female genital cancer</kwd><kwd>mobile telephone-assisted support</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Lymphedema is a general term for swelling caused by lymphatic vessel dysfunction. Failure
to maintain proper care significantly lowers quality of life (QOL), as activities of daily
living will be impaired by swelling in the extremities. Body image is also adversely
affected, causing a considerable psychological impact. In Japan, as many as 150,000 patients
suffer from lymphedema; the most common cause is lymph node dissection associated with
malignant tumor removal<sup><xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Training of therapists in lymphedema treatment in Japan was initiated approximately 10
years ago. In 2007, the fees for lymphedema guidance and management after cancer surgery
became eligible for medical cost compensation. Recognition of the importance of lymphedema
care has gradually become more widespread.</p><p>What matters most for patients with lymphedema is daily self-care<sup><xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup><sup>, </sup><sup><xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup><sup>)</sup>. Previous research has also studied educational endeavors in
establishing self-care<sup><xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup><sup>)</sup>. Experience from implementing self-care consultations for
lymphedema, however, has led to the perception that establishing self-care behaviors
requires more than just education and guidance in terms of knowledge and technology. A
system of self-care support with which patient needs can be handled in a timely and
continuous manner is considered necessary, but research on supporting lymphedema self-care
is nowhere to be found, either domestically or abroad.</p><p>For patients with lower-limb lymphedema, it is important but quite difficult to keep the
lower limbs at rest during activities of daily living. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct
training specifically tailored to an individual patient&#x02019;s daily life on a case-by-case
basis. However, in patients with lower-limb lymphedema, the volume and weight of the lower
limbs increase, making movement difficult and leading to a great burden on patients treated
at medical facilities. Therefore, for patients with lower-limb lymphedema, it is difficult
to receive frequent care and support from specialists. As controlling the symptoms of
lower-limb lymphedema is more challenging compared with controlling those of upper-limb
lymphedema, it is not surprising that many patients with lower-limb lymphedema develop
serious complications such as elephantiasis or lymphorrhea.</p><p>This has led attention to be focused on the use of mobile phones. According to research by
Japan&#x02019;s Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, the mobile phone adoption rate
exceeded one unit per person by the end of March 2012, and the number of contracts amounts
to 100.1% of the population. In the clinical field, there is a research report related to
the construction of a system for supporting self-management of blood glucose in diabetic
patients using mobile phones<sup><xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup><sup>)</sup>
and one on the effects of nursing intervention using mobile phones for high-anxiety diabetic
patients in the insulin introduction stage<sup><xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup><sup>)</sup>. However, there are no reports on the effects of mobile phone
use for supporting self-care of lymphedema patients.</p><p>Therefore, I focused on leg lymphedema patients, who are especially burdened by hospital
visitation, and investigated the effects of self-care support employing mobile phones.</p><p>This study aimed to implement and investigate the effects of self-care support using mobile
phones for leg lymphedema patients.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Research Methods</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>This study used an association-verifying design incorporated qualitative data in a
part.</p></sec><sec><title>Operational definitions of terminology</title><p>1) Routine support of self-care</p><p>Patients received guidance for matters subject to assessment in lymphedema guidance
management (mechanism of lymphedema onset/complications/observation points/matters of note
in daily living/skin care/drainage/compression/exercise) in face-to-face meetings with
qualified lymphatic drainage personnel. This included aspects of support received by both
the intervention and control groups equally.</p><p>2) Mobile phone-assisted support</p><p>Once every two weeks, qualified lymphatic drainage personnel used the video, text, and
voice functions of mobile phones to respond to consultations for self-care (mechanism of
lymphedema onset/complications/observation points/matters of note in daily living/skin
care/drainage/compression/exercise). This included aspects of support received by the
intervention group in addition to routine self-care support.</p></sec><sec><title>Study subjects</title><p>1) Study subject selection criteria</p><p>The study subjects were patients referred by a gynecologist working in a nearby research
cooperation facility; all subjects gave informed consent and met all of the following
criteria:</p><p>
<list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>(1)</label><p> Postoperative female genital cancer patients who were diagnosed with lymphedema by a
physician</p></list-item><list-item><label>(2)</label><p> Patients who did not have venous diseases such as deep vein thrombosis (acute) or
chronic venous incompetency or other cardiovascular diseases and were deemed by a
physician to not be at risk in the implementation of lymphatic drainage</p></list-item><list-item><label>(3)</label><p> Patients with leg lymphedema stage I to II (early) who were deemed safe for support
by mobile phone</p></list-item><list-item><label>(4)</label><p> Patients aged 20&#x02013;69 who used a mobile phone on a daily basis and were considered able
to handle mobile phone communication without difficulty</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>2) Required number of samples</p><p>Based on an effect size of 0.75, &#x003b1; error probability of 5%, &#x003b2; error probability of 20%,
and statistical power of 80%, as used in previous research, the required number of
subjects for two groups was 28.5. Taking dropout into consideration, the target was set to
30 subjects<sup><xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup><sup>)</sup>.</p></sec><sec><title>Survey items and assessment indicators</title><p>1) Basic attributes were age, name of primary disease, therapies for female genital
cancer, time since edema onset, site of edema, edema staging, and presence or absence of a
history of cellulitis.</p><p>2) Self-care was assessed by evaluating the following four items</p><p>
<list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>(1)</label><p> Circumference: With the legs relaxed in the supine position, data were collected for
the total circumference from three points, that is, 2 cm above the medial malleolus of the
ankle, 10 cm below the lower pole of the patella, and 10 cm above the upper pole of the
patella. In cases in which edema appeared in both legs, data were collected where the
edema was stronger.</p></list-item><list-item><label>(2)</label><p> Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G): There were 29 items
(subscales: 7 items about physical aspects, 9 items about social/family aspects, 6 items
about psychological aspects, and 7 items about functional aspects) on the employed cancer
patient QOL scale. Subscales were subject to assessment, and reliability and validity were
confirmed.</p><p>QOL was understood to be higher when the total score was lower in physical and mental
aspects and when the total score was higher in social/family aspects and activity
circumstances.</p></list-item><list-item><label>(3)</label><p> Mental Health Pattern (MHP) testing: Reliability and validity were confirmed using a
mental health scale composed of a stress score and quality of life (QOL) scale; the mental
health scale 8 subscales (a total of 40 items).</p><p>In the present study, only the stress subscale (10 items each about
physical/psychological/social aspects) was used because QOL was measured with the
FACT-G.</p><p>In the MHP testing, the higher the score, the higher the stress level.</p></list-item><list-item><label>(4)</label><p> Self-care check list: An independently created assessment scale was used. Ten the
importance of items about important aspects of self-care were assessed using responses of
&#x0201c;seldom&#x0201d; (1 point), &#x0201c;about once or twice a week&#x0201d; (2 points), &#x0201c;about 3 to 5 times a week&#x0201d;
(3 points), and &#x0201c;Almost daily&#x0201d; (4 points), and total score was calculated. Self-care items
were examined by multiple lymphedema care experts to ensure content validity. Cronbach&#x02019;s &#x003b1;
coefficient, which is indicative of reliability, was 0.82.</p></list-item></list>

<list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>(1)</label><p> Method of allocation for intervention/control groups</p><p>Subjects were allocated randomly, five people at a time in order of arrival, into a
control group that received only routine self-care support and an intervention group that

lymphatic therapist in line with the appropriate protocols.</p><p>Other than the mobile phone-assisted support, the control and intervention groups
received identical support. The data collection time was determined for every patient with
the aim of keeping the external edema factors constant, and data were collected at
identical intervals. In principle, visitation for outpatient lymphedema care was avoided
until three months of data were collected after the initial interview.</p></list-item><list-item><label>(3)</label><p> Specific method of support for the intervention group</p><p>Routine self-care support was implemented at the first interview and at another interview
three months later. The content and methods of routine self-care support were identical
between the control and intervention groups.</p><p>In the intervention group, routine self-care support was accompanied by mobile phone
conversations once every two weeks, through which support was provided with the aims of
[1] symptom control and psychological intervention through the timely provision of
specific knowledge, [2] image-assisted confirmation of skin condition and status of
self-care implementation, [3] establishment of a trusting relationship through frequent
support, and [4] implementation of a support method that does not create a burden on the
legs and can be carried out when it is convenient without the patient having to leave
home.</p><p>Mobile phone models auIC001V12 were used for mobile phone support and were obtained under
a corporate contract. At the first interview, patients were told that the phones were
being loaned and could be used any time support was desired, that they would be contacted
by the investigator every two weeks in the event that no contact was made by the patient,
and that the investigator would cover all mobile phone communication costs.</p></list-item></list>
</p></sec><sec><title>Method of data analysis</title><p>Patients&#x02019; basic attributes was subjected to descriptive statistical processing.</p><p>Survey items were compared between the intervention group&#x02019;s first interview and the
interview three months later to study whether intervention provided any improvement
(Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test). Each of the assessment items was also compared between the
control and intervention groups to study the effects of the intervention using mobile
phones (Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test). SPSS (Ver. 13 Windows) was used as the statistical
analysis software with the level of significance set to 5%.</p><p>Regarding the mobile phone-assisted intervention, content relevant to a &#x0201c;patient&#x02019;s
thoughts during continuing self-care (patient remarks)&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;self-care support content
(nurse remarks)&#x0201d; was extracted and encoded from &#x0201c;call recordings&#x0201d; of call content;
anything similar was collected and subcategorized, and further similar content was
collected, abstracted, and categorized.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethical considerations</title><p>Because of the possibility that mobile phone operation could cause users stress, the
present study was committed to selecting subjects who used mobile phones on a daily basis
and to preventing immediate cessation of mobile phone use in the event of stress. The
research significance, objectives, methods, predicted results, and risks were fully
explained to the research subjects in writing; participation was voluntary, and patients
were reassured that lack of consent to participate would not engender prejudicial
treatment and that, even if they consented to participate, they could still withdraw
without any prejudice. Collected data were encoded and stored on a USB memory stick, which
was then kept under lock and key. Measures to ensure proper security in performance of all
analyses were also taken, including the use of a computer not connected to the Internet.
The study received the approval of the ethics review committee of the University of Shiga
Prefecture (No. 144, No. 144-2).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Basic attributes of the subjects (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table

three months. In no instance were there any unscheduled phone calls from patients, and all
calls originated from the investigator. In addition, video calls, which were supplementary
functions of the selected mobile phones, were not used; phone-assisted support was
provided using the phones&#x02019; voice call functions only.</p></sec><sec><title>Changes over time</title><p>1) Comparison between the first interview and interview three months later (<xref rid="tbl_002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><title>Intergroup comparison of self-care assessment</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th colspan="2" rowspan="5" valign="middle" align="left"/><th colspan="2" valign="middle" align="center" rowspan="1">Control</th><th rowspan="5" valign="middle" align="center" colspan="1"/><th colspan="2" valign="middle" align="center" rowspan="1">Intervention</th></tr><tr><th colspan="2" rowspan="1"><hr/></th><th colspan="2" rowspan="1"><hr/></th></tr><tr><th valign="middle" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Initial

successfully maintaining recovery&#x0003e; and &#x0003c;sharing the joy of being able to go out and
do what one likes&#x0003e;. The records included remarks concerning the joy of sharing with the
patient the circumstances in which self-care implementation had alleviated symptoms and
broadened the available range of activities, such as &#x0201c;had a great time at a hot spring

between the mobile phone-support group (intervention) and the self-care support group
(control) three months after the first interview. However, mobile phone support was found to
be effective in improving QOL for lymphedema patients, assessing psychological states, and
supporting self-care activities.</p><p>Why was support through mobile phone usage (intervention group) more effective? It was
suggested that the support through mobile phone usage was affect to certain feeling of
lymphedema patients. However, there have been no studies that have clarified patients&#x02019;
feelings regarding self-care of lymphedema. Therefore, the patients&#x02019; feelings and related
support were summarized as qualitative results in the present study. The following is a
discussion regarding how mobile phone usage enabled effective support.</p><sec><title>Effects of mobile phone usage in supporting self-care behaviors</title><p>Mobile phones enable communication easily anywhere at anytime. This is their biggest and
unique advantage. This study was designed to make the most use of this characteristic of
mobile phones.</p><p>Mobile phone communication once every two weeks enabled quick response to each patient&#x02019;s
differing symptoms, inquiries, and concerns, which led to psychological stability in the
patients, and thus the patients were able to deal appropriately with their given
conditions. Kamei <italic>et al</italic>. reported on the effect of tele-nursing for COPD
patients. &#x0201c;Since a tele-nurse objectively assessed each subject&#x02019;s different signs and
symptoms for nursing consultation and mentoring, elderly subjects were able to stay calm
so that they could understand how to deal with their challenges and conducted self-care
activities that responded to their exacerbation signs&#x0201d;<sup><xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup><sup>)</sup>. In the present study, a similar effect was shown.</p><p>The following is a detailed review of the records of communications between patients and
nurse. When the patients&#x02019; conversation records were analyzed, the category &#x0201c;stabilization
of symptoms due to self-care&#x0201d; was extracted as a feeling of the patient continuing
self-care. The patients&#x02019; recognition of the self-care effect was linked to their belief in
the effect of self-care, which finally led to adherence to care. This reveals the
progression of a process of patient&#x02019; behavior modification through the recognition that
self-care activities can prevent exacerbation of lymphedema; that is, it indicates the
progression of the process of modification of &#x0201c;attitudes toward behavior&#x0201d; for
self-care<sup><xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>However, at the same time, categories such as &#x0201c;anxiety towards physical symptoms&#x0201d; and
&#x0201c;anxiety towards life activities with lymphedema&#x0201d; were also extracted. In contrast,
records concerning such things as &#x0201c;confirmation of self-care&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;sharing the joys of
recovery&#x0201d; were extracted from the nurse`s conversations. These are also regarded as
supporting activities for the process of modification of &#x0201c;attitudes toward
behavior&#x0201d;<sup><xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup><sup>)</sup>. Timely
interventions were possible using the mobile phones in categories such as &#x0201c;anxiety towards
physical symptoms&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;anxiety towards life activities with lymphedema.&#x0201d; Wavering
emotions were caused in patients by trivial questions and uncertainties during daily
living, such as &#x0201c;I have one red spot,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;Can I continue to wear stockings even if they are
wedged into the back of my knee joints?&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Can I use an electric heater?&#x0201d; Unless these
trivial questions and anxieties are actively addressed, they can get lost in daily living,
never arising as issues. However, these anxieties and wavering feelings towards the
effects of self-care hinder maintenance of lymphedema self-care activities. Support for
resolving these trivial questions and anxieties was made possible using the easily
accessible mobile phones.</p><p>Ishii <italic>et al</italic>. showed the importance of &#x0201c;discussions regarding medical
treatment&#x0201d; as support for maintaining preventative behaviors in self-care for patients
with type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, the authors stressed the importance of establishing
consulting services and telephone consultations to respond to the patient needs of
&#x0201c;wanting to have a hassle-free discussion when they are troubled&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;wanting to call if
something arises before the next appointment.&#x0201d; Additionally, this would serve as a
preventative measure for reduction of activity due to convenience-based decisions, which
progresses with time<sup><xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Self-care for lymphedema requires more attentive decision making in a variety of daily
living situations than is required for patients with type 2 diabetes. However, there are
limits to the knowledge that can be provided beforehand by trying to predict highly
individualized daily living situations. Support through mobile phone usage in our study
allowed intervention at the time a patient had questions or was anxious and before a
convenience-based decision could be made. It also addressed the needs of patients who
wanted timely discussions when they were worried. I believe that this led to correct
self-care behavior.</p><p>The conversation records showed that patients with lymphedema approached self-care with
harbored harboring expectations towards recovery and frustration towards unchanging
conditions; this was displayed through such comments as &#x0201c;If I apply more pressure, I feel
like it will become thinner&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;I work so hard, but nothing is changing too much.&#x0201d;
Neglecting such conditions led to the feelings that &#x0201c;effective self-care is difficult and
is not possible for me. There is no effect&#x0201d; and to the possibility of the patient
abandoning self-care.</p><p>In contrast, a method of providing assistance was developed in this study to &#x0201c;confirm
self-care&#x0201d; and offer &#x0201c;support and admiration for working hard&#x0201d; in addition to support for
&#x0201c;accepting the inability to perform self-care&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;confirming signs of danger and advice
for its management.&#x0201d; This assistance worked on &#x0201c;feelings of behavior control&#x0201d; by enabling
patients to feel that &#x0201c;actualization of self-care for lymphedema&#x0201d; is easy or on behavioral
intent by eliciting patients to start self-care behaviors<sup><xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Senba <italic>et al</italic>. showed that self-efficacy was the largest factor affecting
adherence to exercise therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes and that it is important to
encourage self-efficacy<sup><xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup><sup>)</sup>.
The &#x0201c;feeling of behavior control&#x0201d; discussed in the present study refers to the feeling
that actualization of self-care for lymphedema is simple and can be considered
&#x0201c;self-efficacy&#x0201d; for lymphedema self-care. In order to maintain and strengthen this
&#x0201c;feeling of behavior control,&#x0201d; it was important to support the patients by positioning the
conditions of self-care as a successful experience, especially when the feeling of
behavior control wavers, such as by using statements like &#x0201c;Just because some days it is
not possible does not mean there won&#x02019;t be days where you try hard. It&#x02019;s OK.&#x0201d; Because it
was possible to provide timely assistance against wavering feelings of behavior control,
we believe the conditions of self-care actualization improved dramatically.</p><p>Moreover, the &#x0201c;feeling of behavior control&#x0201d; influenced &#x0201c;behavioral intent&#x0201d; to a large
degree<sup><xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup><sup>)</sup>. In particular,
supporting patients to continue self-care within the limits of their daily activities may
have also enabled patients to continue self-care for longer without abandoning them, and
this was achieved through remarks such as &#x0201c;Resting now is more important than self-care&#x0201d;
and &#x0201c;Just because some days it is not possible does not mean there won&#x02019;t be days where you
try hard. It&#x02019;s OK.&#x0201d; Proper maintenance of self-care led to effective self-care. I believe
that self-care maintenance was made possible through contributions that strengthened the
&#x0201c;feeling of behavior control&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;behavioral intent.&#x0201d;</p></sec><sec><title>Effects of mobile phone usage in supporting QOL and mental health status</title><p>FACT-G psychological state and behavioral conditions as well as MHP stress conditions
improved significantly in the mobile phone-supported (intervention group) patients
compared with those supported by normal self-care (control group). This suggested that
mobile phone interventions were psychologically effective in patients with lymphedema.</p><p>Patients with lymphedema harbor feelings such as &#x0201c;I don&#x02019;t go out if my legs feel bad,&#x0201d;
&#x0201c;My family won&#x02019;t help with chores even if my legs feel bad,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;shock from being told that I
lay down too much,&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;My family and friends don&#x02019;t understand lymphedema.&#x0201d; This led to a
lonely psychological state in the patients, as evidenced by categories such as &#x0201c;feels like
my feet are heavy.&#x0201d; Therefore, providing the patients with frequent consultations based on
their rapidly changing feelings and accepting the hardships the faced with their edema
allowed me to sympathizer with the patients. This relationship likely supported the
patients psychologically.</p><p>Research has shown that 47% of cancer survivors harbor psychological problems, including
reactive depression and anxiety<sup><xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup><sup>)</sup>. Furthermore, it is also known that 27&#x02013;40% of cancer
survivors continue to harbor anxiety and depression<sup><xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup><sup>)</sup>. These psychological conditions are well known to
influence self-efficacy<sup><xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup><sup>)</sup>.
Therefore, psychological support is absolutely necessary in order to improve the effects
of self-care instruction in cancer survivors in an unstable psychological state. The
effectiveness of mobile phone support (intervention group) in self-care in this report can
be explained through stabilization of the psychological state in cancer survivors such as
patients with lymphedema.</p><p>According to the planned behavior theory, sentiments including &#x0201c;desire to show good
results&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;desire to pull oneself together through harsh words&#x0201d; in the category of
&#x0201c;feeling of deserving praise/reprimand&#x0201d; are generated in the relationship between oneself
and others. For patients with lymphedema &#x0201c;feeling sadness due to isolation,&#x0201d; the existence
of other individuals who understand their condition is important. Moreover, Murakami
stated that maintaining relations with people around them such as family and other
patients can help during implementation of self-care<sup><xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup><sup>)</sup>. Additionally, Donna highlighted the importance of the
reciprocal, trusting relationship between the health- care provider and patient in patient
education<sup><xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup><sup>)</sup>. These
results suggest that building a trusting relationship through mobile phone support with
patients contributes to the promotion of patients&#x02019; self-care activities.</p><p>Is biweekly interview-based support possible without a mobile phone?</p><p>As mentioned previously, there are still very few therapists who treat lymphedema. Even
at lymphedema clinics, interview-based support occurs once every three months at the most.
Therefore, biweekly support is not practical.</p><p>Moreover, biweekly interview-based support is problematic from the patient&#x02019;s perspective.
The stress placed on the patient attempting to visit the clinic frequently while dealing
with extra weight due to edema and limited freedom of joints is too great. However,
lymphedema patients still seek support.</p><p>A mobile phone-based support system means support whenever and wherever it is needed,
provided there is a signal. It is possible to address patients&#x02019; needs without increasing
their burden. Such a support system, whereby patients can receive support while at home,
can be extremely worthwhile, particularly for those who are less mobile due to diseases
similar to lower leg lymphedema.</p></sec><sec><title>Limitations of this research</title><p>A statistically significant difference was not obtained in the change in limb
circumference, and this could have been the result of insufficient statistical power due
to the small sample size and limited time duration. Therefore, further study is required
with a statistically appropriate sample size and duration of the study.</p><p>In the present study, no scenarios arose in which image assessment was required.
Therefore, it could not be confirmed to be effective.</p><p>However, when the onset of complications is ruled a possibility, assessment will
necessitate detailed information such as the extent of edema, color and dryness of skin,
and status of rashes/blistering. The use of mobile telephones makes it possible to obtain
such information in &#x0201c;images,&#x0201d; resulting in more accurate assessment and the ability to
provide better advice for given circumstances. This would also enable earlier introduction
to specialized medical institutions and would be a major means for preventing the
complications of lymphedema.</p><p>It is essential to prevent complications in order to avoid worsening of lymphedema.
Future research should investigate the effectiveness of using mobile telephone images in
preventing lymphedema complications and avoiding any worsening.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Compared with routine self-care support, mobile telephone-assisted support is suggested to
be effective in improving leg lymphedema patients&#x02019; QOL and mental health status as well as
their self-care behaviors.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>I gratefully thank all the patients who participated and Prof. M. Ushikubo of Gunma
