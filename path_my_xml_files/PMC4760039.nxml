Saghaei, MD., Department of Anaesthesia, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran. Adults aged between 18 and 80 years belonging to American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I, II, III were included. Patients are weighing &#x0003c;50 kg, known the history of allergy to study drugs, pregnant patients and with significant blood coagulation disorders, and infection at the site of the block were excluded.</p><p>Preanesthetic evaluation was done; informed consent was obtained. All patients were kept nil per oral as per standard guidelines, premedicated with tablet diazepam 10 mg, and tablet ranitidine 150 mg 2 h before surgery. Preoperative baseline values of heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) were noted. Limb to be operated was positioned, under all aseptic precautions, axillary brachial plexus block was performed by the anesthesiologist using 24 G 50 mm length, short beveled, insulated stimulating needle according to multiple injection techniques using nerve locator. After positioning the limb, the axillary artery was palpated in the upper one-third of the arm. Just above and below the pulsation, skin wheal was raised by injecting 2% lignocaine plain solution of 1 ml each. Electro location of each nerve was done by starting the stimulation with current intensity at 2 mA. The current intensity was decreased slowly to a minimum of 0.5 mA by redirecting the needle to obtain the best desired appropriate response. Continuous negative aspiration was done to check for inadvertent intravascular needle placement during electrolocation. A volume of 8 ml of the drug solution per nerve (radial nerve, ulnar nerve, median nerve, and musculocutaneous nerve) was injected after checking for the absence of blood by negative aspiration.</p><p>Intercostobrachial nerve was blocked by injecting 8 ml of the drug solution subcutaneously superiorly and inferiorly along the axillary crease using 1.5 inch 25 G needle.</p><p>Group R received 39 ml of 0.375% ropivacaine and 1 ml of normal saline, Group RD received 39 ml of 0.375% ropivacaine and 1 &#x003bc;g/kg dexmedetomidine diluted to 1 ml with normal saline, according to the group allocated by computer generated random table. Drug combinations were prepared by an anesthesiologist who is independent of the study. 1 &#x003bc;g/kg of dexmedetomidine was taken in insulin syringe and diluted accordingly to 1 ml with normal saline.</p><p>To maintain uniformity, we have used ropivacaine 0.75% of 10 ml ampoule (Ropin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Neon Laboratories, Mumbai, India). A volume of 20 ml of 0.75% ropivacaine was diluted with 20 ml of normal saline, to make 40 ml of 0.375% ropivacaine. Dexmedetomidine (Dextomid<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Neon Laboratories, Mumbai, India) of 100 &#x003bc;g/ml strength of 1 ml ampoule was used to maintain uniformity.</p><p>The time of administration of the drug was noted. HR, SBP, DBP, MAP, SpO<sub>2</sub> were noted every 5 min (min) for the first 30 min and every 15 min for next 1&#x000bd; h and every hour later on till regression of sensory block. Sensory block was assessed by pinprick (20 G hypodermic needle) test in respective dermatomal distribution of nerves using a 3-point scale: 0 = Normal sensation, 1 = Loss of sensation to pinprick (analgesia), 2 = Loss of sensation to touch (anesthesia).[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>Motor block was evaluated by thumb abduction for radial nerve, thumb adduction for ulnar nerve, thumb opposition for median nerve, and flexion of elbow for musculocutaneous nerve on a 3-point scale: 0 = Normal motor function, 1 = Reduced motor strength but able to move fingers, 2 = Complete motor block.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>The time of the onset of complete sensory blockade and motor blockade were noted individually. Sensory and motor blocks were evaluated for every 5 min for the first 30 min and then every 30 min postoperatively till the regression of sensory block and return of motor function, respectively. The time to the first analgesic administered postoperatively was noted.</p><p>Surgery started 30 min after administration of block to facilitate the sensory and the motor block evaluation.</p><p>Successful nerve block is defined as complete loss of pinprick sensation in the radial, ulnar, median, and musculocutaneous nerve distribution with the concomitant inability to abduct, adduct and oppose thumb, and inability to flex elbow within 30 min after the LA injection. In patients showing incomplete nerve block within 30 min after injection, intravenous (IV) midazolam 2 mg, and IV fentanyl 2 &#x003bc;g/kg were administered. If patient complained of pain despite supplemented fentanyl analgesia, general anesthesia was induced, and these patients were considered, nerve block failures were excluded from the study.</p><p>Onset of sensory block was defined as the time interval between the end of total local anesthesia drug administration and complete sensory block. Complete sensory block was defined by anesthetic block (score 2) on all nerve territories. Duration of sensory block was defined as the time interval between the start of a complete sensory block and the complete resolution of the sensory block in all nerve territories. Onset of motor block was defined as the time interval between the end of total local anesthesia drug administration and complete motor block. Complete motor block was defined as the absence of voluntary movement on hand and forearm (score 2). Duration of motor block was defined as the time interval between the start of a complete motor block and the recovery of complete motor function of the hand and forearm. The time between the start of a complete sensory block and the first analgesic given was recorded as the duration of the analgesia.</p><p>Pain in the postoperative period was assessed using a visual analog scale (VAS). When VAS score &#x0003e;4 cm, first analgesia was given as IV tramadol 50 mg, and duration of analgesia was noted.</p><p>Any side effects of hypoxia (defined as SpO<sub>2</sub> &#x0003c;93%) was treated with supplemental oxygen. Hypotension (defined as SBP &#x0003c;90 mm of mercury) was treated by the fluid administration and if necessary, IV vasopressors.

It offers many advantages over general anesthesia. Many problems like pneumothorax, vascular injuries, which are common in interscalene, supraclavicular, and infraclavicular brachial plexus block are avoided in axillary brachial plexus block. Numerous drugs have been used for axillary brachial plexus block. Bupivacaine was the most common drug used. Recently, ropivacaine is gaining popularity in its use for regional anesthesia because it is less cardiotoxic and neurotoxic than bupivacaine.</p><p>Adjuvants have been added to the LAs for axillary brachial plexus block to intensify, prolong the duration of block and analgesia.</p><p>Both the groups were comparable with respect to age, gender, weight, ASA physical status, and duration of surgery.

Group D of 30 patients received bupivacaine 0.25% (35 cc) and dexmedetomidine 1 &#x003bc;g/kg. In this study the duration of sensory block was 227.00 &#x000b1; 48.36 min in Group C as compared with 413.97 &#x000b1; 87.31 min in Group D. Statistically significant longer duration of sensory block was observed in Group D (<italic>P</italic> = 0.001). Similarly, the duration of motor block was 292.67 &#x000b1; 59.13 min in Group C as compared with 472.24 &#x000b1; 90.06 min in Group D. The duration of motor block was longer and statistically significant in Group D (<italic>P</italic> = 0.001). There was a significant increase in duration of analgesia in Group D (456.12 &#x000b1; 97.99 min) as compared with Group C (289.67 &#x000b1; 62.50 min). This difference was also statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> = 0.001). SBP and DBP were found to be significantly lower than baseline from 30 to 120 min in Group D as compared with Group C and were statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001).</p><p>Abdallah and Brull did a systemic review and meta-analysis on facilitatory effects of perineural dexmedetomidine on neuraxial and peripheral nerve block.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] In this study, nine randomized controlled trials and 516 patients were analyzed. Randomized controlled trials comparing the effect of dexmedetomidine as an LA adjuvant to LA alone on neuraxial and peripheral nerve blocks were reviewed. Of nine randomized controlled trials analyzed, five were on spinal anesthesia and four were on the brachial block. They concluded that onset of sensory block, the onset of motor block for the brachial block were early and statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> = 0.00001) by the addition of dexmedetomidine to LA as an adjuvant. It was also found that the duration of the motor block and duration of analgesia were prolonged and statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> = 0.00001) by the addition of dexmedetomidine to LA as an adjuvant to brachial block.</p><p>Obayah <italic>et al</italic>. conducted a study on effects of addition of dexmedetomidine to bupivacaine for greater palatine nerve block for postoperative analgesia after cleft palate repair. Totally, 30 children were included in the study.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] The B Group received bupivacaine 0.25%, whereas the BD Group received bupivacaine 0.25% with 1 &#x003bc;g/kg dexmedetomidine. In this study, the duration of analgesia in the Group BD was longer and statistically significant. This was similar to our findings.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Dexmedetomidine as an adjuvant to ropivacaine provides quicker onset of anesthesia and longer duration of analgesia.
