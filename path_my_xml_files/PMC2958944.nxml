In most cases, a full course of radiotherapy has been applied after primary diagnosis, therefore application of re-irradiation has to be applied cauteously.

Due to their inverted dose profile and the high local dose deposition within the Bragg peak precise dose application and sparing of normal tissue is possible. Moreover, in comparison to photons, carbon ions offer an increased relative biological effectiveness (RBE), which can be calculated between 2 and 5 depending on the GBM cell line as well as the endpoint analyzed.

In the past, second courses of radiotherapy have only been applied reluctantly, in fear of treatment-related side effects. However, modern radiation techniques have enabled the radiation oncologist to deliver high local doses as an effective salvage treatment with low rates of side effects.</p><p>Especially for GBM, with unsatisfactory outcomes even after extensive research over the past centuries, effective treatment at tumor recurrence are needed urgently. With surgery and supportive care alone, overall survival is about 3-5 months. Postoperative RT can increase overall survival to 9-12 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. A number of studies have shown that an additional treatment with chemotherapy can increase overall survival. This benefit, however, is commonly associated with a high risk of treatment-related side effects, especially with combination treatments, such as PCV, and with BCNU. Only recently, significant increase in overall survival could be achieved by adding TMZ, an orally applicable alkylating substance, to postoperative radiotherapy. In a prospective randomized Phase III study performed by the EORTC radiochemotherapy with TMZ was compared to postoperative radiation alone. Overall survival could be increased from 12.1 months to 14.6 months, with acceptable toxicity. TMZ was applied in a dose of 75 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/die during radiotherapy, followed by 6 cycles of adjuvant TMZ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Therefore, standard treatment of patients with GBM is currently considered to be postoperative radiochemotherapy with TMZ, followed by 6 cycles or adjuvant TMZ.</p><p>However, with an overall survival of about 15 months, treatment outcome still remains insufficient, and patients develop tumor recurrences soon after primary diagnosis.</p><p>For anaplastic gliomas, overall survival after standard treatment following primary diagnosis, including neurosurgical resection and postoperative radiotherapy, lies between 18 and 50 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. However, also these patients develop tumor recurrences after primary diagnosis, and effective salvage treatments are required.</p><p>Treatment of low grade gliomas has been discussed controversially over the last years with respect to optimal radiation dose and time point of radiotherapy. It has been shown, that doses of 45-54 Gy are sufficient for long-term local tumor control, and that early application of radiotherapy can increase progression-free survival significantly, without altering overall survival as compared to treatment applied for tumor progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. During follow-up, patients develop not only low grade tumor progression, but also high-grade malignant tumor lesions.</p><p>In the past, a second course of radiotherapy has been applied reluctantly with conventional techniques as treatment outcome outweighs the risk of treatment-related side effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. With modern high-precision stereotactic photon techniques, such as Fractionated Stereotactic Radiotherapy (FSRT) re-irradiation could be established as a safe and effective treatment option for recurrent gliomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Survival times of 111, 50 and 21 months for WHO Grade II, III and IV gliomas could be shown with FSRT, with very low rates of side effects. However, outcome still remains unsatisfactory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>Charged particles provide the physical advantage of an inverted dose profile which enables steep dose gradients. Neighboring organs at risk and surrounding normal tissue can be spared from radiation doses. Additionally, heavy charged particles, such as carbon ions, as high-LET beams, are characterized by an enhanced RBE. For glioblastoma cell lines, RBE values between 2 and 5 have been reported depending on cell line and endpoint [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>In general, GBM are treatment-resistant tumors. Early studies using a high-dose proton boost could show that total doses up to 90 Gy E were effective in preventing local tumor recurrences, however, such high doses were associated with high rates of side effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Therefore, in general, standard radiation therapy is applied up to a total dose of 60 Gy. Besides the physical advantages of high local dose deposition provided by protons, carbon ions are a promising treatment alternative due to their biological benefits. A clinical study performed by the National Institute of Radiological Sciences (NIRS) treated 48 patients with malignant gliomas with a carbon ion boost up to total doses of 24.8 Gy E, of which 32 were GBM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In this study, no treatment related toxicity exceeding CTCAE Grade II or higher were observed. Therefore, the concept of a carbon ion radiotherapy for the treatment of recurrent gliomas with contrast enhancing lesions is a promising treatment alternative.</p><p>Carbon ion radiotherapy was available by the Department of Radiation Oncology at the Gesellschaft f&#x000fc;r Schwerionenforschung (GSI) in Darmstadt since 1997. Superior treatment results for a number of tumor entities, such as chordomas and chondrosarcomas of the skull base, as well as ACC have been shown, and carbon ion radiotherapy is currently performed in the clinical routine for these patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Safety of carbon ion radiotherapy with respect to critical organs at risk, such as the brain, brainstem or spinal chord, have been shown in these studies. At the Heidelberg Ion Therapy Center (HIT), treatment of over 1300 patients per year with Proton and Carbon ion RT is possible.</p><p><italic>In vitro </italic>data for the treatment of GBM with carbon ions have shown superior effectivity compared to photons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Our own data have shown a high RBE for carbon ion RT for GBM; additionally a combination of carbon ion radiotherapy and TMZ have been evaluated and show an additive effect in GBM-cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. A first clinical study evaluating a carbon ion boost in patients with GBM was recently published by Mizoe et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Median overall survival in patients with glioblastoma was 17 months; however, only small patient numbers were evaluated and standard chemotherapy with TMZ was not applied. In that study, the carbon ion boost was applied with increasing total doses up to 24.8 Gy E. While toxicity was low even in the high dose arm, the data showed that patients seem to benefit from the high dose carbon ion boost.</p><p>The promising results in primary GBM and the known physical and biological properties of carbon ion offer a promising treatment alternative that should be evaluated for the treatment of patients with recurrent gliomas.</p><p>In the present CINDERELLA trial, the impact of carbon ion radiotherapy using intensity modulated rasterscanning will be compared to FSRT which is considered the treatment standard alternative for patients with recurrent gliomas. In a first Phase I design, the RD of carbon ion radiotherapy for re-irradiation of gliomas will be determined. In the following Phase II part, the RD of carbon ions will be compared to standard photon radiotherapy delivered as FSRT,</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Design</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>The trial will be performed as a single-center two-armed randomized Phase I/II study.</p><sec><title>Phase I: Dose Escalation</title><p>Patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria will be treated with increasing total doses of carbon ion radiotherapy to RD of carbon ion radiotherapy for re-irradiation of recurrent gliomas.</p><p>Patients will be treated within seven increasing dose regimens starting at 10 &#x000d7; 3 GyE up to 16 &#x000d7; 3 GyE.</p></sec><sec><title>Phase II: Randomized Part</title><p>Patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria will be randomized into two arms:</p><p>Arm A - Experimental Arm</p><p>Carbon Ion Radiation Therapy</p><p>The total dose applied will be the RD determined in the Phase I part of the study protocol.</p><p>Arm B - Standard Arm</p><p>Fractionated Stereotactic Radiotherapy with Photons</p><p>Total Dose 36 Gy, 18 fractions, 2 Gy single dose</p><p>A flow chart of the study is shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Flow Chart of the Cinderella-Study</bold>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2407-10-533-1"/></fig></sec></sec><sec><title>Study objectives</title><p>The purpose of the trial is to compare carbon ion radiotherapy to FSRT for the treatment of recurrent gliomas delivered to the area of contrast-enhancement in T1-weighted MRI and/or Amino-Acid-PET-positive lesions.</p><p>In the Phase I study, the RD of carbon ion radiotherapy will be determined in a dose escalation scheme.

This stagewise procedure will have an overall significance of &#x003b1; = 0.05.</p><p>If for any reason no confirmative interim analysis will be performed, the final significance level will be 5%.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Dose Escalation Scheme</title><p>The dose-escalation part of this study was designed to enroll successive cohorts of 8 patients, each to be started on a fixed dose of carbon ion therapy. The starting dose was specified as 10 &#x000d7; 3 Gy E for the first cohort. Planned dose level for subsequent cohorts were 11 &#x000d7; 3 Gy E, 12 &#x000d7; 3 Gy E, 13 &#x000d7; 3 Gy E, 14 &#x000d7; 3 Gy E, 15 &#x000d7; 3 Gy E and 16 &#x000d7; 3 Gy E.</p><p>Dose escalation was to be stopped when the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was reached. MTD was defined as one dose level below that at which dose limiting toxicities (DLT) was observed in one-third or more of the patients meaning that at least 3 of the 8 patients in one dose cohort experienced a DLT. If maximum 2 DLTs were observed at one dose level, the next higher dose level will be evaluated. The maximum tolerated dose corresponds to the recommended dose for the following phase II part of this trial.</p><p>Toxicities were graded using the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria Version 4.0. DLT was defined as any treatment-related event qualifying as NCI grade 4.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics, informed consent and safety</title><p>A positive Ethics Vote was obtained by the Local Ethics Committee of the medical Faculty at the University of Heidelberg, Germany.</p><p>Before study recruitment, a positive vote of the Bundesamt f&#x000fc;r Strahlenschutz (BfS) is necessary.</p></sec><sec><title>Treatment at tumor progression</title><p>After completion of study treatment not adjuvant treatment is conducted as part of this protocol. Further treatments may be initiated as needed clinically.</p><p>For tumor progression, treatment alternatives will be evaluated and discussed in the interdisciplinary setting considering options of neurosurgical resection, systemic treatment such as chemotherapy, a second course of radiation therapy, or other.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Treatment of recurrent gliomas still remains an interdisciplinary challenge. Re-irradiation using high-precision photon techniques has been established as a standard treatment in this clinical situation for a subgroup of patients: Several different fractionation schemes are applied in this setting, including hypofractionated regimens or radiosurgery, however, in our institution, Fractionated Stereotactic Radiotherapy (FSRT) with an attempted total dose of 36 Gy in 2 Gy single fractions is considered standard treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Still outcome of these patients is not satisfactory and novel treatment appraoches are required.</p><p>With heavy charged particle beams such as carbon ions, the physical benefits of an ion beam in conjunction with the higher relative biological effectiveness (RBE) can be exploited for the treatment of different tumor entities. For several indications, superior clinical results as compared to photon radiotherapy have been shown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Preclinical studies have shown the RBE to be between 3 and 5 for high-grade gliomas, therefore demonstrating that carbon ions are a promising treatment alternative for patients with recurrent gliomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>Early clincial data on carbon ion radiotherapy in primary high-grade brain tumors have shown overall safety even with extensive dose escalation with promising results; however, few patients had been included into this study, and therefore validation in a larger patients collective is warranted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><p>Until now, no patients have been treated with carbon ion radiotherapy for recurrent gliomas. Based on the preclinical data as well as the clinical experience so far, this concept should be evaluated.</p><p>Therefore, the present CINDERELLA trial evaluates carbon ion radiotherapy performed as re-irradiation in patients with recurrent gliomas compared to FSRT with standard dosing. In a first Phase I part of the study, a dose escalation will be performed to determine the optimal dose of carbon ion radiotherapy that can be prescribed in this clinical setting. Thereafter, in the Phase II part of the trial, patients will be randomized between carbon ion radiotherapy and FSRT.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>ACC: Adenoid Cystic Carcinomas; BCNU: Carmustine; DL: Dose level; DLT: Dose limiting toxicity; FSRT: Fractionated Stereotactic Radiotherapy; GBM: Glioblastoma; GSI: Gesellschaft f&#x000fc;r Schwerionenforschung; GY E: Gray Equivalent; HIT: Heidelberger Ionenstrahl herapiezentrum; NIRS: National Institute for Radiological Sciences; RBE: Relative Biological Effectiveness; RD: Recommended Dose; RT: Radiotherapy; TMZ: Temozolomide; WHO: World Health Organization</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>SEC, JD, IB, LE and WW have developed the study concept.
