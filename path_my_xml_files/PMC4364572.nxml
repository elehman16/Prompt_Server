This consisted of 3&#x000a0;min rest followed by 3&#x000a0;min unloaded cycling before the constant phase, in which work rate was increased to 75% of maximum work rate and patients were encouraged to maintain a pedaling rate of 50&#x02013;70 rotations per min until symptom limitation. Change from baseline in exercise endurance time (time from the start of the loaded test to the point of symptom limitation) to Week&#x000a0;3 was the primary endpoint.</p><p>Before exercise, every 2&#x000a0;min during, and at the end of exercise, patients rated the intensity of their dyspnea using the Borg CR10 Scale<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (perceived exertion, range: 0&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02018;nothing at all&#x02019; to 10&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02018;extremely strong/maximal&#x02019;).

During exercise, inspiratory capacity (IC) was measured spirometrically at the same time points as a marker of dynamic hyperinflation. Change from baseline to Week&#x000a0;3 in intensity of dyspnea at isotime (duration of the shortest exercise test during Visits 1, 2, 3, and 4) was a secondary study endpoint. Changes from baseline to Week 3 in IC before exercise, every 2&#x000a0;min during exercise, at isotime, and at the end of exercise were additional endpoints. EELV at rest, at isotime, and at the end of exercise was calculated post-hoc by subtracting IC at each time point from mean total lung capacity (TLC) at 2&#x000a0;h post-dose. Oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) during exercise was assessed using a pulse oximeter.</p><p>Change from baseline in resting IC at Week&#x000a0;3 was also a secondary endpoint.

Changes from baseline at Week 3 in trough FEV<sub>1</sub> and FVC were also measured. All spirometry data were transferred for centralized reading and underwent a two-step quality-control process. Resting FRC, residual volume (RV), TLC, and specific airway conductance (sGaw) were assessed by whole-body plethysmography, performed pre-dose on Day&#x000a0;1 of each treatment period, and pre-dose and at 2&#x000a0;h post-dose at Week&#x000a0;3 of each period.</p><p>To assess physical activity, patients wore an armband device (SenseWear Pro3<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, BodyMedia Inc., Pittsburgh, PA, USA) day and night (excluding time spent for personal hygiene purposes) for 7&#x000a0;days prior to the start of, and during the last week of, each treatment period.

Improvements, versus placebo, in IC at isotime (a marker of dynamic hyperinflation) were also similar between aclidinium 400&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g BID (155&#x000a0;mL), tiotropium 18&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g QD (180&#x02013;190&#x000a0;mL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], and glycopyrrolate 50&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g QD (200&#x000a0;mL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Furthermore, the improvement in static lung function (IC at rest) with aclidinium (176&#x000a0;mL) was also comparable to that provided by other LAMAs (180&#x02013;220&#x000a0;mL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>It has been proposed that a minimal clinically important difference for exercise endurance time is in the range 46&#x02013;105&#x000a0;s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]; however, these estimates are based on few studies and do not take into account the large variation in, for example, interventions, study methodology/duration, patient characteristics and disease severity, and exercise testing protocols. Furthermore, it is unclear if a change observed with a pulmonary rehabilitation program involving regular training units is comparable to what can be achieved with bronchodilators. Nevertheless, most published improvements in cycling endurance with bronchodilators are in line with the proposed range. We therefore believe that the improvements seen with aclidinium fit well with the published data and indicate a meaningful response.</p><p>In the present study, there was a correlation between improvements in endurance time and reduced exertional dyspnea, overall and in the aclidinium treatment period only. Overall, improvements in endurance time were also correlated with reduced post-dose RV and FRC and increased IC at rest. There was no significant correlation between changes from baseline in static lung volumes and endurance time when assessed in the aclidinium treatment period only. To the best of our knowledge, only one previous study has investigated the relationship between exercise endurance time and lung volumes following treatment with a LAMA in patients with COPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. While a correlation between endurance time and exertional dyspnea and between endurance time and dynamic IC was observed following treatment with tiotropium 18&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g; the relationship between endurance time and static lung volumes was not reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Furthermore, patients were treated with tiotropium 18&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g for 6&#x000a0;weeks compared with the shorter 3-week treatment period with aclidinium in the present study.</p><p>Aclidinium treatment also significantly improved the duration of activity of moderate intensity and daily energy expenditure. It is difficult to speculate on the clinical relevance of the improvement in the duration of moderate physical activity observed with aclidinium (10&#x000a0;min vs placebo). Recently, a prospective cohort study reported the health benefits of 15&#x000a0;min moderate physical activity per day in terms of mortality reduction in the general population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Furthermore, physical activity level has been found to be a strong predictor of mortality in patients with COPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Further studies are needed to link improvements in physical activity in COPD to other patient-centered outcomes, and ideally, to also demonstrate health benefits in terms of reduced morbidity and mortality.</p><p>In the present study, there was no correlation between improved endurance time and increased physical activity in the whole study population and following treatment with aclidinium. This might be based on the observation that patients in this study who were extremely inactive at baseline had the greatest improvements in endurance time, whereas patients who were sedentary at baseline had the greatest improvements in physical activity. While the analyses reported here were exploratory, and in the case of the baseline PAL analyses, performed in small numbers of patients, they expand previous studies that suggest factors other than increased capacity are involved in driving patients with COPD to become more physically active.</p><p>Study limitations might include the short treatment duration, absence of assessments beyond 3&#x000a0;h post-dose to determine duration of effect, and the lack of an active comparator. Nevertheless, this study provides useful data to supplement findings from previous Phase III studies, demonstrating that aclidinium significantly improved lung function and symptoms versus placebo over 12 and 24&#x000a0;weeks and had comparable 24-h bronchodilatory efficacy to tiotropium over 6&#x000a0;weeks in patients with COPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Aclidinium has also been demonstrated to be safe and well tolerated in patients with COPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], and the safety findings from this short study were consistent with those previously observed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Treatment with aclidinium 400&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g BID significantly improved exercise endurance and related exertional dyspnea, and lung hyperinflation compared with placebo over 3&#x000a0;weeks in patients with stable COPD and moderate-to-severe airflow limitation. Aclidinium also provided significant improvements in static lung function and lung volumes, and parameters of physical activity compared with placebo.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Endnote</title><p><sup>a</sup>Registered trademarks of AstraZeneca PLC, Barcelona, Spain; for use within the USA as Pressair<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, and Genuair<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> within all other licensed territories.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Author&#x02019;s information</title><p>Diana Jarreta Formerly of Almirall S.A., Barcelona, Spain.</p><p>Esther Garcia Gil Formerly of Almirall S.A., Barcelona, Spain.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec19"><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1"><media xlink:href="12890_2014_644_MOESM1_ESM.pdf"><caption><p>Additional file 1:
