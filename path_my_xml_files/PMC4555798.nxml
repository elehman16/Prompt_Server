This disease in its wake leaves behind a trail of destruction mainly pertaining to the tooth supporting structures. Periodontal therapy consists of treatment modalities aimed at arresting infection, restoring the lost structure and to maintain a healthy periodontium. The mechanical removal of bacterial plaque, calculus and toxic material is an effective means of altering the etiology of periodontal disease.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>Historically, periodontal surgery was used to treat patients with generalized disease and because of this the surgical approach was usually designed to treat multiple adjacent teeth. The goal of periodontal surgery has always been to alleviate or eliminate the degeneration associated with the progressive periodontal disease. In order to accomplish this goal, access to the periodontal defect for debridement has been an integral part of surgical therapy.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>The current pendulum of clinical opinion in some areas of periodontal education and research has swung away from traditional mechanical and surgical therapy toward advanced treatment applications. The application of magnification to periodontics has tremendously refined the periodontal surgical care. As recent developments in medicine have shown, magnification and microsurgery can greatly impact clinical practice.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Microsurgery is a treatment philosophy whose clinical horizons will continue to improve with operator experience and willingness to employ previously unused basic optical magnification and ergonomic techniques and technology.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] As of today, no clinical study has demonstrated the use and possible advantages of dental loupes in periodontal open flap debridement. So the aim of the present study is to evaluate the treatment outcomes of microsurgery and compare it with conventional open flap debridement procedures.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>Ethical clearance was obtained from the institutional review board. Written informed consent was signed and obtained from all the patients who participated in the study. This study was carried out as a split mouth randomized controlled clinical trial. Totally, 13 patients (7 male and 6 female) with the age range of 30&#x02013;50 years were included in the study.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Patient selection</title><sec id="sec3-1"><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p>A total of 13 chronic generalized periodontitis patients attending the Department of Periodontics presenting with similar horizontal bone loss and probing pocket depth &#x02265; 5 mm in contralateral quadrants were included in the study.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-2"><title>Exclusion criteria</title><p>Patients with any systemic diseases or under antibiotics in the past 6 months, smokers and with poor oral hygiene were excluded.</p><p>Three teeth per quadrant with identical pattern of bone loss and probing depth were included for treatment either by microsurgical (test site) or conventional approach (control site) in a split mouth design. At baseline, 3, 6 and 9 months, the following clinical parameters were evaluated: Probing pocket depth, relative attachment level, gingival recession, gingival bleeding index - Ainamo and Bay 1975, Patient comfort was assessed by visual analog scale for 7 days postoperatively. Postoperative healing was assessed by early wound healing index at 1 week post operatively.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>A stent was individually fabricated to create fixed landmarks and to standardize the location and angulation of periodontal probes at all the six sites. The position of the gingival margin was measured from the stent to the gingival margin, and the relative attachment level from the stent to the bottom of the periodontal pocket. The probing depth was calculated based on the difference between relative attachment level and gingival margin level.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>All periodontal surgical procedures were performed on an outpatient basis under aseptic conditions. The patient was asked to rinse the mouth with 10 ml of 0.2% chlorhexidine digluconate solution for 60 s. The operative site was anaesthetized with 2% lignocaine HCL with adrenaline (1:80,000).</p><p>After achieving adequate anesthesia, in the control sites intracrevicular incisions were made, and full thickness mucoperiosteal flaps were elevated. Surgical debridement was carried out to remove subgingival plaque, calculus, diseased granulation tissue and pocket epithelium. The surgical sites were irrigated with sterile saline. Surgical flaps were sutured to the presurgical level with 3-0 silk suture utilizing an interdental, direct suturing technique achieving primary closure. A noneugenol periodontal dressing Coe-pack<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> was placed. Postoperative instructions were given to the patients. Antibiotic prescription of amoxicillin 500 mg thrice daily for 5 days and a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent thrice daily for 2 days was given.</p><p>In test sites, microsurgery was carried out with &#x000d7; 3.5 optical magnification dental loupe. After Local anaesthesia, sulcular incisions were placed with microsurgical ophthalmic blades [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. Buccal and lingual mucoperiosteal flaps were elevated using periosteal elevators [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>]. Granulation tissue adherent to the inner surface of flaps were carefully removed with curettes to provide full access and visibility to root surfaces. Any remaining plaque and calculus were gently removed using hand instruments. Sutures were placed using 6-0 suture vicryl suture.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Conventional versus microsurgical blade</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JISP-19-406-g001"/></fig><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Conventional versus microsurgical periosteal elevator</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JISP-19-406-g002"/></fig><p>Statistical analysis was carried out using SPSS software version 17.0 (IBM corporation, Chicago, IL, USA).

Scaling and root planing are widely used techniques to remove the irritants from the surfaces of teeth and also to reduce root roughness that may facilitate the accumulation of irritants.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Small areas of calculus are often left behind, with anywhere from about 3% to 80% of instrumented root surfaces showing some residual calculus.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] It was also observed that more residual calculus is left behind on proximal surfaces, in deep sites, and in furcation areas.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>Complete removal of calculus is a primary part of achieving a biologically acceptable tooth surface in the treatment of periodontitis. However, residual calculus exists not only on teeth treated by scaling alone but also on teeth treated by flap surgery followed by scaling and root planing.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>Periodontal flaps for access provide a means to reduce residual calculus, especially more efficient even in deeper pockets, both in anterior and posterior teeth.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] However, complete removal of calculus from periodontally diseased root surfaces is rare. Scaling and root planing with flap showed better removal of calculus than after scaling and root planing alone. Surgical access has shown to improve the efficiency of scaling and root planing.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>Microsurgical procedures have been studied for various regenerative procedures, root coverage and papilla reconstruction procedures.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] The benefits of microsurgical approaches have been described only in a few case reports,[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and one prospective cohort study.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] A case control study was conducted similar to our present study design to assess the clinical outcome in localized gingival recessions.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] As of today, there is no clinical study to compare microsurgical and conventional open flap debridement procedures.</p><p>In the present split mouth study, three teeth with probing pocket depth &#x02265;5 mm were considered as test site, and the contralateral teeth with same probing pocket depth were considered as controls. Both test and control sites showed almost similar radiographic and clinical parameters.</p><p>The only difference/variable over conventional technique was that there was improved visual and tactile perception through microsurgical technique.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>Postoperative pain and early healing assessed for 7 days after the procedure showed that the test sites were significantly better than the controls. This may be due to delicate handling of the tissues and precise wound closure, which are similar to some of the earlier studies.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>A frequency of once every 3 months recall appears to be sufficient to maintain the beneficial effects of therapy even in the presence of individual variations of personal oral hygiene and gingival inflammation. Although studies demonstrate that healing may continue for a period of 9 months following initial therapy, most of the healing seems to complete at 3 months following therapy.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p><p>In our study, although the clinical parameters, probing pocket depth, relative attachment level, gingival margin level showed significant difference from baseline to 3, 6 and 9 months, there was no significant difference between the groups in the present study.</p><p>In our study, there was no statistically significant increase in gingival recession between the test and control sites. The test sites showed an increase of 0.12 mm as against 0.14 mm in control sites. There was no significant decrease in recession between the groups. However, studies have shown minimal gingival recession (0.4 mm) with microsurgery due to atraumatic manipulation during surgery and excellent soft tissue preservation.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>However, the mean surgical operation time for test site is 1 h and 30 min that is 6% more than in control sites 1 h and 16 min. In oral surgical procedures, studies have shown that the incidence and severity of complications following periodontal surgery correlated well with the duration of the procedure. It may be speculated that the extended operation time may compensate for the beneficial treatment effect of minimally invasive techniques.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] However in the present study microsurgical open flap debridement resulted in faster healing and less postoperative pain.</p><p>The present study has certain limitations. The sample size was kept minimum. The test sites were treated after the control sites, the less postoperative pain may be due to the less apprehension for the second surgery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Within the limitations of the present study, it can be concluded that microsurgical approach resulted in early healing and less postoperative pain compared to the conventional approach. Both the procedures were equally effective in improving the clinical parameters. The choice of micro or macro surgical approaches should be decided based on the treatment outcomes, cost and the patient-centered parameters.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENT</title><p>Authors would like to acknowledge the principal Dr. Usha H L, V.S Dental College and Hospital (V.
