[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]), and is associated with marked impairments in personal, professional, and social life. SAD is associated with higher rates of divorce, alcohol consumption, suicide risk, and other forms of psychopathology
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Everyday functioning is significantly altered, and greater financial dependence on family and/or state resources makes SAD a societal burden
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Epidemiological data also reveal that only a small number of individuals seek and receive treatment for this condition
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], as SAD sufferers can delay seeking treatment for 28 years
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Spontaneous remission of symptoms has been reported and is rare, and it is mainly by active interventions (psychological and pharmacological) that the course of SAD can be altered
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>The Internet has grown rapidly across the world and the number of users increases steadily (
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.internetworldstats.com">http://www.internetworldstats.com</ext-link>). An association between SAD and Internet use has been found
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], suggesting that socially anxious individuals use the Internet to search for information and to communicate with others. Moreover, communication via the Internet may be attractive to socially anxious individuals because it conceals physical appearance and aspects of behavior that in face-to-face interactions could be viewed as being negatively evaluated by others
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>Given that the core features of SAD are the fear and avoidance of direct social interactions, guided Internet-administrated cognitive behavior therapy (iCBT) may constitute an attractive treatment option for persons with SAD
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. These individuals may be drawn to such treatment because they can engage in the therapeutic process from their private homes or offices and reduce the embarrassment and stigma of seeking treatment and going to a therapist&#x02019;s office. However, there is a potential risk that isolation and avoidance is reinforced by not seeing the client in therapy. To counteract this propensity, iCBT for SAD includes not only cognitive restructuring sessions, but also real life exposure exercises where participants are encouraged to confront their fears in their daily life
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>Andersson <italic>et al</italic>.
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] were the first to test the efficacy of an iCBT for SAD. To maximize the effects, the nine online modules were augmented with two therapist-lead group exposure sessions. Treated individuals reduced their social anxiety symptoms, depression and general anxiety, showing clinical significant changes
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Since then, other Internet-delivered interventions for SAD have been developed and tested in Australia, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], supporting the short- and long-term benefits of such interventions. In a meta-analysis of eight studies, the overall efficacy of iCBT for SAD was found to be high for social anxiety symptoms (Cohen&#x02019;s <italic>d</italic> test statistic = 0.86), and moderate for quality of life (<italic>d</italic> = 0.53) and comorbid anxiety and depression (<italic>d</italic> = 0.40)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Recently Hedman <italic>et al</italic>.
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] investigated the cost-effectiveness of a guided iCBT for SAD and a parallel group cognitive behavioral therapy (GCBT) intervention. While both treatments generated large cost reductions, the iCBT intervention was significantly less costly. This difference was mainly attributed to the therapist time required for each participant per week for the two interventions (that is., 5.5 minutes for iCBT versus 50.0 minutes for group CBT per week per patient). Because the savings generated by each treatment exceed their costs, Hedman <italic>et al</italic>. concluded that &#x0201c;society as a whole would be financially strengthened by making CBT for SAD more accessible&#x0201d;
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] (p. 735). The new generation of self-help interventions delivered online represents a readily accessible and cost-effective avenue to increase treatment accessibility for SAD. Nevertheless, before including them in the evidence-based armamentarium, we should carefully investigate their efficacy in various contexts and cultures.</p><p>This study represents an extension and replication of previous trials examining the effectiveness of guided iCBT for individuals with SAD. To our knowledge, there are no published trials on iCBT for Romanian adults with SAD. To date, paxonline.ro is the only platform offering computer-assisted intervention for anxiety in Romania
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. This password-protected website offers online assessment, resources and interventions for patients with different forms of anxiety, but no controlled trials about its effectiveness have yet been published.</p><p>In our study, an individual treatment approach will be used not only because the active intervention is delivered online, but also because it has been argued that individual treatments may be superior to group treatments
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Consequently, the primary aim of this study will be to investigate the efficacy of a treatment program called internet social phobia (iSOFIE) by comparing it to a waiting list control group. iSOFIE was derived from a previously tested Swedish program
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] that has been shortened while retaining the main treatment ingredients. The program assists participants in understanding their condition, in restructuring their maladaptative thoughts, and in implementing the exposure exercises (i.e., which is known to be a key factor in symptoms reduction)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. A second aim of the study is to track the potential changes in participants&#x02019; thought patterns. While our intervention is primarily based on the cognitive- behavioral model of SAD
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], and no specific Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT),
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]), will be implemented, it is hypothesized that the cognitive restructuring and exposure exercises will make participants less prone to irrational thinking - (as measured by the Attitude and Belief Scale-II (ABS-II),
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]). To our knowledge, no study has investigated whether an iCBT program for SAD has the potential to alter participants&#x02019; irrational thinking patterns. Moreover, because this is the first guided iCBT interventions conducted in Romania, the treatment credibility of the program will be investigated. Finally, we will investigate predictors of outcome with a focus on the levels of SAD and associated anxiety symptoms.</p></sec><sec><title>Method/design</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>We will conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with two parallel groups: the iSOFIE and a waiting list control group.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. They will be directed to the project&#x02019;s website, advised to read the study presentation, and eventually register to participate. Before starting the screening process, interested participants will be advised to carefully read the online Informed Consent details, and to approve their voluntary participation in the trial.</p><p>Participants will then receive a code that allows them to access the following screening measures: LSAS-SR,
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], SPIN,
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], SIAS,

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], and Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI),
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. All these measures are widely used in the literature and have good to excellent psychometric properties. Moreover, for LSAS-SR and SIAS, similar psychometric proprieties were found for both online and paper-and-pencil formats
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Participants who score above the cut-off value of the social anxiety measures will be contacted for a telephone interview. In addition, participants&#x02019; results on the SPSQ form will also be inspected to see whether they meet the criteria for SAD according to the DSM-IV. The telephone interview is based on social phobia section of the Structural Clinical Interview for DSM-IV - Axis I Disorders: SCID I
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Only participants who will meet the inclusion criteria will take part in the study.</p><p>Included participants will be randomized by an independent person to either: a) active training (iSOFIE) or b) the waiting list control group. The iSOFIE treatment manual is divided into nine modules and adapted for the Internet. Each module presents a different topic (that is., what is social anxiety, challenging your negative thinking, behavioral experiments, exposure etcetera.) and includes exercises, and essay questions (that is., homework to be sent in to the therapist). Participants are encouraged to explain what they have learned, provide thought records, describe their experiences during the exposure exercises. Based on their responses, an assessment is made of whether the participant is ready to continue. If so, the next module is made accessible. If not, the participant receives instructions on what needs to be completed before proceeding to the next module. The intervention takes nine weeks to be completed. The control group will not receive any active intervention during this time. To monitor participants&#x02019; symptoms and to analyze the possible mediating effects, all participants will be asked to fill in the LSAS-SR
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] on a weekly basis.</p><p>By the end of the nine-week treatment period, all participants will be asked to complete the post-intervention assessment, which consists of the same measures used in the screening phase, with treatment satisfaction items added for the intervention group. The SAD section of the SCID interview will also be used as a categorical diagnostic measure. To evaluate long-term effects of the intervention, the follow-up data will be collected six months after the treatment. The waiting -list control group will receive treatment after the waiting period and will also be evaluated after they have completed the treatment, and at six months follow-up.</p><p>A secure software will facilitate correspondence between the participants and therapists. The online messaging system uses a protocol for encrypting information (Secure Sockets Layer) to ensure communication security over the Internet. All communication will be mediated through this online messaging system.</p><sec><title>Primary outcome measures</title><p>Social anxiety symptoms will be assessed with more than one measure. The LSAS-SR
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] presents 24 commonly anxiety-provoking situations, and asks participants to rate their fear and avoidance for each situation. The psychometric properties of the LSAS-SR are good to excellent
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] and the scale captures symptom changes in both cognitive- behavioral and pharmacological interventions. The LSAS-SR has been recommended as a treatment monitoring, and treatment outcome, evidence-based measure in adults
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] and adolescents
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>].</p><p>The <italic>Social Phobia Inventory</italic> (SPIN,
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]) is a brief (i.e., 17-item) self-report instrument measuring fear in social situations, avoidance of performance/social events, and physiological discomfort in social situations. Each item is rated on a 4-point scale, with higher scores corresponding to greater distress. The scale has good to excellent psychometric proprieties
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] and has been recommended for clinical use
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].</p><p>The <italic>Social Interaction and Anxiety Scale</italic> (SIAS,
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]) is a 20- item measure that assesses fears of general social interactions. The scale captures both social scrutiny fears and social interaction fears. For each item, respondents are asked to indicate the degree to which they feel the statement is characteristic or true of them on a five-point scale. The SIAS has sound psychometric properties
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><p>The <italic>Social Phobia Screening Questionnaire</italic> (SPSQ,
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]) is a measure used for diagnostic screening of SAD. The questionnaire presents both dimensional and categorical data, including impairment and duration of reported social anxiety
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. It has been used in several other studies of SAD
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Secondary outcome measures</title><p>In addition to the social anxiety measures, we intend to capture participants&#x02019; anxiety sensitivity, depression level, and irrational thinking, using the <italic>Anxiety Sensitivity Index</italic> (ASI,

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The present RCT investigates the efficacy of an Internet-administered intervention (iSOFIE) in a different cultural setting. Potential participants will be carefully screened using both self-report measures (namely., the <italic>LSAS-SR, SPIN, SIAS,</italic> SPSQ) and a clinical interview (the SCID for DSM-IV). After the nine-week intervention, all participants (that is., the active treatment group and the waiting list control group) will be asked to complete the post-treatment measures, and the follow-up assessment will be administered after 6 months. Besides capturing the intervention&#x02019;s effectiveness in reducing social anxiety symptoms, potential changes in participants&#x02019; thinking patterns will be estimated. Data about treatment credibility and satisfaction will also be collected. Along with the hypothesized main effects, these data will provide a valuable feedback for optimizing future interventions.</p><p>Compared to the relatively new Internet-delivered interventions, face-to-face treatments appear to have stronger empirical support in the literature, and their credibility seems to be higher. However, the effects of the face-to-face treatments were recently compared with the effects of guided self-help for depression and anxiety, and no significant differences were found
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. It was argued that generalizing the results was hindered by the fact that participants were mainly self-referred (that is., clients interested in guided self-help applied for such trials, and the remaining category of clients applied for the face-to-face treatments). While it is true that some people may benefit more from guided self-help interventions, the fact that both treatments yielded similar effects
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>] cannot be discarded. Moreover, investigating the long-term effects of Internet-administered treatment for SAD, Hedman <italic>et al</italic>.
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>] found that the improvements in social anxiety symptoms were sustained 5 years after the treatment. This additional evidence supports the idea that guided self-help represents an effective and reliable way of helping anxiety sufferers via the Internet.</p><p>There are several limitations to our study that, if seen from a different perspective, suggest improvements for future research. First and foremost, having a passive wait list group does not offer the best control for the effects of expectancy or adherence to the treatment schedule. However, we hypothesized that such a design would be suitable for examining the main effects of an Internet-delivered intervention in a new context. Future studies could compare the effects of Internet-delivered CBT and other interventions (such as, acceptance and commitment therapy) and explore whether one of these alternative treatments is more effective in reducing social anxiety symptoms. Second, only self-report measures will be used to assess participants&#x02019; symptoms in this study. Despite their many desirable traits (such as., simplicity, ease of administration, etcetera.), self-reports also display some limits (such as, responses based on the frail human memory and judgment, social desirability, responses influenced by question order, question wording, etcetera.)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. Therefore, future studies could also capture the underlying cognitive process by using the new generation of implicit measures that indirectly capture various psychological constructs. For example, the possible changes in participants&#x02019; automatic information processes occasioned by an online intervention could be investigated using the Implicit Association Test
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>] or some other newly developed implicit measures. Finally, yet importantly, while Internet-delivered treatments have the advantage of increasing the accessibility of evidence-based interventions to a larger segment of the population, we suspect that the well-educated and computer savvy subgroup will mainly benefit from such programs. Alternative ways to increases treatment accessibility could be to offer straight forward, user-friendly programs that will not drive away beginners.</p><p>Overall, offering self-help materials with the support of new technologies constitutes a promising alternative for face-to-face treatments, and an effective way to disseminate evidence- based anxiety interventions. Using a predefined, and well-structured intervention that is available online decreases the number of therapist contact hours, and allows clinicians to assist a greater number of participants without sacrificing treatment efficacy. However, the costs and efforts needed for the development and maintenance of such specialized interventions, and for the appropriate training of new clinicians should not be underestimated. Because the initial costs for the platform development are relatively high, while the resources needed for maintenance and therapist contact hours are relatively low, it seems that once proven effective in an RCT, the optimal way of exploiting such platforms would be to attract a large number of clients. Considering the inverse ratio between the initial investment and the potential long-term benefits, it seems that using such platforms for a long time represents a cost-effective strategy worth pursuing.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial status</title><p>The screening phase of this trial is planned for April and May, 2012.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>BTT initiated the study and made important contributions to the study design, and manuscript drafting.
