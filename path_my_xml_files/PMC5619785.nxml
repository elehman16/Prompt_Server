Root canal therapy (RCT) is currently the most effective and most commonly provided treatment [<xref rid="pone.0185512.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The ultimate goal of RCT is to close the root canal system, especially in the last 1/3 of the root tip. RCT prevents bacteria in oral environment from entering and reinfecting the root canal, prevents the tissue fluid from going into the root canal and becoming the residual bacteria culture media, and prevents the occurrence of periodontitis. Therefore, the apical sealing of the root canal is one of the important indicators to a successful RCT [<xref rid="pone.0185512.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. It has been shown that 58.66% of the RCT failure was caused by incomplete root canal closure [<xref rid="pone.0185512.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Various methods have been used to achieve an optimal root canal closure, such as root canal filling with certain materials after root canal irrigation reverse filling after apicoectomy [<xref rid="pone.0185512.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0185512.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Because of the three main factors: the complexity of the anatomical structure of the pulp, the biofilm lifestyle and the lavage solution of the colonized bacteria are difficult to penetrate completely through the dentin tubules to the top of the root canal, so the conventional procedure rarely achieves complete roots tube disinfection and closure [<xref rid="pone.0185512.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0185512.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Microbes can penetrate up to 1mm on dentin tubules, and rinse can only reach about 100&#x003bc;m [<xref rid="pone.0185512.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0185512.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In addition, due to the ultra-thin diameter of the root and the high surface tension of the root flushing fluid, it is difficult to achieve complete sterilization of the root tip one-third of the root canal.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that several laser systems can be used as auxiliary auxiliaries for root canal disinfection [<xref rid="pone.0185512.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0185512.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0185512.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Semiconductor lasers are commonly used for dental pulp repair, and their bactericidal properties are mainly related to photothermal effects [<xref rid="pone.0185512.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0185512.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0185512.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0185512.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Semiconductor lasers are effective in pulp disinfection due to their affinity for bacterial cells. In addition, laser irradiation can penetrate the dentinal tubules in depth, as it is not absorbed by the hard tissue of the teeth and has reached a 63% reduction in bacterial population at a depth of 750&#x003bc;m [<xref rid="pone.0185512.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0185512.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0185512.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0185512.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. It was showed that after conventional root canal preparation, semiconductor laser irradiation in root canal may help to reduce microleakage and improve root canal closure for a success of root canal therapy. However, few studies on this area have been reported.</p><p>So we purpose to evaluate the effects of semiconductor laser irradiation on root canal sealing during routine root canal therapy through this study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Specimen preparations</title><p>Sixty single-rooted teeth with developed periapical areas and similar root length collected due to extractions for orthodontic and periodontal reasons from January 2016 to April 2016.

The canals were accessed, and the length of the teeth was determined by inserting a size #10 stainless steel K-file into the canal until the tip of the file was just visible at the apical foramen. The working length was determined as 1 mm shorter from root apex than the entire length of the teeth. All of the root canals were prepared with Wave-one rotary nickel titanium instruments (X-smart plus, Dentsply, USA) to an apical size of 40, 0.06 taper using 1% sodium hypochlorite (Beikang, Shantou) and17% EDTA (Beikang, Shantou) as the irrigant.

The plates were then placed in an incubator at 37&#x000b0;C for 7 days. At this point, the sample was rinsed under the water for 15 minutes, and the nail polish was removed with a razor. Two opposing longitudinal grooves were made into the dentin on the root surfaces, in order to facilitate the split of the root in half. The depth of the groove cannot be deepened to the root canal by the diamond plate on the buccal side of the sample and the side of the tongue along the long axis of the tooth. The chisel was used to divide the sample longitudinally into two, both of which were used as separate samples. And then observe each part under a stereomicroscope.

As the root canal system is complex and there are many traffic branches and collateral root canal, applying root canal instruments only cannot completely remove infectious substances from the root canal. During root canal preparation, the dentin smear layer will be attached to the root canal wall, which will affect the adhesion of the root-filling material to the root canal wall. It may also lead to apical leakage, causing recurrence of apical infection [<xref rid="pone.0185512.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0185512.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>At present, the main clinical approach is to use the rinse solution for disinfection and removal of smear layer [<xref rid="pone.0185512.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. EDTA combined with sodium hypochlorite wash is most commonly used. Nui et al. demonstrated that the complete removal of the smear layer requires both organic and inorganic solvents [<xref rid="pone.0185512.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The combination of sodium hypochlorite and EDTA can remove the organic and inorganic components in the smear layer, so that the dentinal tubules are opened, which can effectively remove the smear layer [<xref rid="pone.0185512.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].A previous study [<xref rid="pone.0185512.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]found that 17%EDTA combined with 1% sodium hypochlorite rinse effectively removed enterococcus faecalis of the root canal. The bacteria can invade the root canal dentin tubules up to 1mm in depth, while the flushing fluid can only reach the distance of 100&#x003bc;m.Another study [<xref rid="pone.0185512.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] found that although the EDTA and sodium hypochlorite alternate flush could effectively remove the neck 1/3 and middle 1/3 of the smear layer wall, it performed poorly in removing the root tip 1/3 smear layer. Because of the narrow lumen of the apical third of the root, it is difficult for the flushing fluid to reach, and to maintain an effective concentration. In addition, the flushing effect of sodium hypochlorite was overestimated in the trial, because the clinical form of the root canal was much more complex than the single root canal used in the previous study [<xref rid="pone.0185512.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].Therefore, conventional root canal preparation combined with irrigation fluid will achieve the perfect root canal filling effect [<xref rid="pone.0185512.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>Ultrasonic cleaning is developed in recent years, and it is a fast and effective physical cleaning methods. In the solution, the ultrasonic file produces the instantaneous cavity effect, the sound flow effect, the synergistic effect in the root canal, and the effect of heating and agitation and hence achieves the removal of the root canal smear and dentin debris. Li Yuliang et. al. [<xref rid="pone.0185512.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] has shown that ultrasonic washing effectively improved the success rate of root canal therapy. However, the number of dentinal tubules in the apical region was small and the opening was small, root canal diameter gradually reduced from the root canal orifice to apical area. The amount of washing liquid reaching the apical region was small and the reflux was poor. The smear layer removal effect of ultrasonic cleaning on the neck 1/3 and middle 1/3 is better, but it is less effective on the aplical third. Therefore, ultrasonic cleaning cannot completely remove the root canal smear layer [<xref rid="pone.0185512.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0185512.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p>At present lasers have been widely used in oral soft tissue surgery, mucosal disease, periodontitis and dental pulp diseases and other fields, A number of studies have indicated that after the root canal preparation, the semiconductor laser irradiation in the root canal may reach the area of the root canals which the conventional disinfection fail to enter [<xref rid="pone.0185512.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Semiconductor laser irradiation may carry out multiple functions, including disinfection and sterilization, removal of the smear layer, and melting and sealing of the dentin tubule to improve the sealing performance of the root canal [<xref rid="pone.0185512.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0185512.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p><p>The present study was designed to evaluate the effect of semiconductor laser irradiation on root canal obturation after routine root canal therapy. Many methods have been used to evaluate the sealing ability of filling materials, but the most common one involves dyes and radioactive isotopes. Among dyes, 1% basic fuchsia dye is widely used for convenience and can provide a high degree of penetrability due to its small molecular weight [<xref rid="pone.0185512.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Many researchers have used dyestuffs to detect microleakage of root-filling materials [<xref rid="pone.0185512.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0185512.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p><p>The apical sealing after root canal filling was compared between the three groups, namely the laser irradiation root canal after root canal preparation group, ultrasonic cleaning group and untreated group. Overall both laser irradiation and ultrasonic washing significantly improved the sealing performance compared with the blank group (p&#x0003c;0.05), and that laser irradiation combined with conventional root canal preparation is superior in improving the performance of root canal sealing (p&#x0003c;0.01).</p><p>The results of scanning electron microscopy in this study showed that most small dentinal tubules in the laser irradiation group were melted and closed, the number of tubules was also reduced, the edge was blunt and thickened, and some molten crystals were embedded on the surface. Some dentin tubules were sealed by molten dentin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0185512.g001">Fig 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0185512.g002">Fig 2</xref>).In the ultrasonic cleaning group, the dentin tubule was clearly visible, and most of the dentin tubules showed gutta-percha or paste (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0185512.g001">Fig 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0185512.g003">Fig 3</xref>).In the blank group, small dentinal tubules were clearly visible, and some dentin tubules showed debris coverage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0185512.g001">Fig 1F</xref>). Our results are consistent with the results of semiconductor laser-assisted root canal therapy [<xref rid="pone.0185512.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].In the study by Ravalli et al. [<xref rid="pone.0185512.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], after semiconductor laser irradiation the root canal showed that the surface was smooth and clean, and there are a small amount of dentin tubules exposed and large area of dentin tubule melting. Marc et al. used a laser to irradiate the hydroxyapatite powder, which had been previously placed in the apical foramina [<xref rid="pone.0185512.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The hydroxyapatite powder melts and the apical foramen can be closed. Our results demonstrated that the semiconductor laser irradiation of the root canal effectively removed the smear layer. The semiconductor laser irradiation also causes the occlusion of the dentinal tubules and prevents the residual material in the root canal from entering the periapical space through the apical or dentinal tubules which may reduce the occurrence of periapical lesions. These changes will likely prevent re-infection caused by bacteria, which could have entered the root canal through the dentinal tubules, and improve the success rate of root canal treatment. What&#x02019;s more laser irradiation and ultrasonic swing can effectively improve the closure of the root canal, so there is no difference in microleakage detection. But the principle of the apical sealing is different, so there are differences in the SEM image.</p><p>Our experiments also show that the root canal filling after laser irradiation failed to achieve complete closure of the root canal system. A possible cause could be the complexity of the root canal system. In the present study the laser cannot reach all parts of the root canal system, especially the root canal and curved root canal root tips, which greatly affect the bactericidal effect.</p><p>Thermal injury of periodontal tissue is a major concern of laser therapy in root canal therapy. Laser irradiation in the root canal dentin may increase the temperature of the external and adjacent tissue of the root canal. This temperature change may induce root and periodontal ligament fibrous absorption, alveolar bone necrosis and pain. Alfredo et al [<xref rid="pone.0185512.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] used a pulsed mode of 1.5 w or 3.0 w for 20 s which made the temperature increase of root canal wall less than 10, and it had no significant effect on periodontal tissue. Therefore, as long as the appropriate laser settings are selected, the effect of the heat generated by the laser on the periodontal tissues is very small, and the heat it produces may also be relieved by the root canal irrigant.</p><p>Application of semiconductor laser in root canal therapy effectively removes the smear layer within the root canal. It allows the root canal filling material and the root canal tightly integrated. It also improves root canal closure through melting and remineralization of hard tissue and closed dentinal tubules. However, discrepancies are also noticed among different studies because of the inconsistent laser parameters and experimental conditions used in each study. The application of semiconductor laser in clinics is just being explored. Therefore, more standardized experiments are needed to optimize the application of laser in clinic. Nevertheless, results from our study now reveal the great the promise of clinical application of laser during RCT.</p><p>Results from our study demonstrated the application of semiconductor laser prior to root canal obturation increases the apical sealing of the roots treated.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec017"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0185512.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Dye penetration length of each sample (mm).</title><p>Relevant data underlying the findings described in manuscript.</p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0185512.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0185512.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><name><surname>Mingwen</surname><given-names>Fan</given-names></name>, <etal>et al</etal>
