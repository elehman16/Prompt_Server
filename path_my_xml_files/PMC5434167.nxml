Previous studies have confirmed that krill oil can alleviate hyperlipidemia, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. To discern whether krill oil changes the structure of the gut microbiota during the hyperlipidemia treatment, 72 mice were acclimatized with a standard chow diet for 2 weeks and then randomly allocated to receive a standard chow diet (control group, <italic>n</italic> = 12) or a high-sugar-high-fat (HSHF) diet supplemented with a low (100 &#x003bc;g/g&#x000b7;d, HSHF+LD group, <italic>n</italic> = 12), moderate (200 &#x003bc;g/g&#x000b7;d, HSHF+MD group, <italic>n</italic> = 12) or high dosage of krill oil (600 &#x003bc;g/g&#x000b7;d, HSHF+HD group, <italic>n</italic> = 12), simvastatin (HSHF+S group, <italic>n</italic> = 12) or saline (HSHF group, <italic>n</italic> = 12) continuously for 12 weeks. The resulting weight gains were attenuated, the liver index and the low-density lipoprotein, total cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations showed a stepwise reduction in the treated groups compared with those of the control group. A dose-dependent modulation of the gut microbiota was observed after treatment with krill oil. Low- and moderate- doses of krill oil increased the similarity between the composition of the HSHF diet-induced gut microbiota and that of the control, whereas the mice fed the high-dose exhibited a unique gut microbiota structure that was different from that of the control and HSHF groups. Sixty-five key operational taxonomic units (OTUs) that responded to the krill oil treatment were identified using redundancy analysis, of which 26 OTUs were increased and 39 OTUs were decreased compared with those of the HSHF group. In conclusion, the results obtained in this study suggest that the structural alterations in the gut microbiota induced by krill oil treatment were dose-dependent and associated with the alleviation of hyperlipidemia. Additionally, the high-dose krill oil treatment showed combined effects on the alleviation of hyperlipidemia and obesity.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>krill oil</kwd><kwd>hyperlipidemia</kwd><kwd>gut microbiota</kwd><kwd>dose-dependent</kwd><kwd>mouse</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="5"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="55"/><page-count count="11"/><word-count count="7640"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Humans face various metabolic diseases, including obesity, hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia, and hypertension (Eckel et al., <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). Hyperlipidemia comprises a group of plasma lipoprotein abnormalities, including increased triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), and reduced high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) concentrations (Chen et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2014b</xref>). Hyperlipidemia is a dominant risk factor that contributes to cardiovascular disease (Abliz et al., <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Kim et al., <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), and its development has become a difficult public health problem (Chen et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2014b</xref>). At present, drug therapy is the preferred treatment for hyperlipidemia. Various drugs have been used clinically, including simvastatin (Farnier and Davignon, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>), acipimox (Shih et al., <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>), and clofibrate (Grundy et al., <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">1972</xref>). Generally, drug therapy is not regarded as an optimal long-term therapy due to its relatively high costs and adverse side effects. Therefore, intervention strategies are needed for the treatment of hyperlipidemia.</p><p>Accumulating evidence suggests that a disrupted balance between the host and the gut microbiota plays a vital role in lipid metabolism and the development of hyperlipidemia (Ley et al., <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Turnbaugh et al., <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). Probiotic feeding reduced the development of a fat-mass in mice fed a high-fat diet, with a corresponding decrease in the phylum Firmicutes, increase in the phylum Bacteroidetes, and changes in 102 distinct taxa in the gut microbiota (Everard et al., <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). In the hyperlipidemic mouse model, <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> administration led to a significant reduction in the serum lipids, an increased abundance of phylum Bacteroidetes and Verrucomicrobia and a reduced proportion of the phylum Firmicutes (Chen et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2014a</xref>). In the zebrafish model, <italic>Lactobacillus rhamnosus</italic> decreased the lipid content by increasing the ratio of Firmicutes, decreasing the abundance of Actinobacteria, and down-regulating the genes involved in cholesterol and triglycerides metabolism (Falcinelli et al., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Furthermore, the addition of green tea powder promoted the growth of <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> in the intestine and strongly decreased the hepatic triacylglycerol and cholesterol accumulation and the amount of <italic>Akkermansia</italic> in the small intestine in mice fed a high fat diet (Axling et al., <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Some Chinese medicines have shown positive effects on hyperlipidemia control via modulation of the gut microbiota. The abundance of <italic>Sporobacter termitidis</italic> and <italic>Akkermansia muciniphila</italic> were increased significantly, whereas the proportions of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and <italic>Parabacteroides distasonis</italic> were reduced after treatment of hyperlipidemic B6 mice with <italic>Rhizoma coptidis</italic> alkaloids (He et al., <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). The berberine supplement enriched short chain fatty acid (SCFA)&#x02014;producing bacteria and reduced microbial diversity, which might contribute to the beneficial effects on dyslipidemia and hypercholesterolemia treatment (Kong et al., <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Zhang et al., <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). In conclusion, the changes in the gut microbiota play an important role in the regulation of lipid metabolism and the alleviation of hyperlipidemia, and may have potential as a new hyperlipidemia treatment strategy.</p><p>Krill oil is extracted from <italic>Euphausia superb</italic> and contains eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; Maki et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). The fatty acids in krill oil are present as phospholipids, which are absorbed well by the intestine compared with other triglycerides oils of marine origin (Harris et al., <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">1988</xref>; Araujo et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Previous studies suggested that krill oil supplementation alleviated hyperlipidemia. For example, krill oil treatment suppressed lipid synthesis, up-regulated the genes involved in lipid oxidation, and down-regulated genes in lipogenesis (Burri et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Ferramosca et al., <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Krill oil supplementation reduced the TG and TC levels and alleviated the hepatomegaly and hepatic steatosis induced by a high-fat diet (Tandy et al., <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Another study found that the hyperplasia and total histology score were dramatically decreased and that the serum cytokines levels remained unchanged after krill oil treatment (Ierna et al., <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). In addition to a high concentration of omega-3 fatty acids, krill oil also contains astaxanthin, which is responsible for the deep red color (Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM9">S1</xref>). Astaxanthin is a strong lipid-soluble antioxidant that not only protects krill oil from oxidation (Hussein et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Ikeuchi et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>) but also provides additional health-promoting properties related to inflammation and hyperlipidemia (Bunea et al., <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Deutsch, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). At present, we have confirmed the benefits of krill oil in human health. However, there is a lack of evidence concerning whether krill oil alleviates hyperlipidemia via modulation of the gut microbiotan, and the dose-dependent effects of krill oil on hyperlipidemia remains unclear.</p><p>In this study, a randomized approach was used to assess the effect of krill oil on hyperlipidemia in mice. The biochemical blood indices, liver index, and shift in the structure of the gut microbiota in response to krill oil treatment at different doses were examined in mice. Our results provide new insights into the roles of the gut microbiota following treatment with different dose of krill oil for hyperlipidemia. We propose that this study will aid in the screening of intervention strategies for the amelioration of hyperlipidemia.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Experimental design</title><p>The experimental and animal care procedures were performed in accordance with the guidelines prepared by the Ningbo University Laboratory Animal Center (affiliated with the Zhejiang Laboratory Animal Common Service Platform, Ningbo, China).

The twelve mice in each group were divided into three cages (four mice per cage). The mice in the control group were fed a standard chow diet (purchased from the Laboratory Animal Center of Ningbo University, Ningbo, China). The mice in the high-sugar high-fat (HSHF) diet group were fed a HSHF diet (20% lard, 20% sucrose, 2.5% cholesterol, 1% cholic acid salt, and 56.5% standard chow diet). These two groups simultaneously received saline by gavage. The mice in the HSHF+S group were maintained on the HSHF diet with Shujiangzhi (simvastatin, Merck &#x00026; Co., Inc, Hangzhou, China) administration by gavage at a dosage of 1 &#x003bc;g/g&#x000b7;d for 12 weeks. The other three groups were maintained on the HSHF diet with a gavage of krill oil (purchased from Sino-Ocean Co., Ltd., Dalian, China) by gavage at low (100 &#x003bc;g/g&#x000b7;d, HSHF+LD group), moderate (200 &#x003bc;g/g&#x000b7;d, HSHF+MD group), and high dosages (600 &#x003bc;g/g&#x000b7;d, HSHF+HD group) for 12 weeks. The mice were kept in the same house during the experiments, and none of the mice died.</p><p>The body weights and food intake were measured weekly.

The temperature of the injector was maintained at 260&#x000b0;C. The detected mass ranged from 30 to 425 m/z.</p><p>The astaxanthin concentration in the krill oil was measured via high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) as previously described (L&#x000f3;pez-Cervantes et al., <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). The HPLC was operated at a rate of 1 mL/min with an SS Exil ODS column (250 &#x000d7; 4.6 mm, 5 &#x003bc;m) and detected at the 476 nm wavelength. A mixture of water, methanol, dichloromethane, and acetonitrile at a 4.5:28:22:45.5 ratio (v/v/v/v) was used as the mobile phase. An astaxanthin standard was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co.

Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were clustered using Usearch (version 7.1) (Edgar, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) at a similarity level of 97%. The most abundant sequence of each OTU in all the samples was selected as the representative sequence. The RDP classifier (Wang et al., <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>) was used to annotate the representative OTU sequences, and taxonomic information was obtained for each OTU. The phylogenetic tree and the normalized relative abundance of OTUs were used for weighted and unweighted UniFrac principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) via vegan package in R software (version 3.2). The community richness index and community diversity were calculated using Mothur (version 1.30.1) and the reads number normalized to the same number (smallest) to reduce biases in sequencing depth for alpha and beta diversity analysis (Schloss et al., <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>).</p><p>All data are shown as the means &#x000b1; <italic>S.D</italic>.

And the raw reads in each group are: control group (39,207, 36,383, and 26,214), HSHF group (40,795, 31,757, and 21,003), HSHF+LD group (21,404, 41,845, and 23,910), HSHF+MD group (37,709, 45,256, and 30,429), HSHF+HD group (27,117, 29,835, and 26,325), and HSHF+S group (34,849, 30,748, and 19,576).</p><p>The diversity of the microbial communities was measured using the Shannon and Simpson diversity indices (Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM11">S3</xref>). A significantly decreased Shannon index (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) and a significantly increased Simpson index (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) were measured in the HSHF group compared with those in the control group, which indicated that bacterial diversity was decreased after the HSHF diet treatment. The krill oil treatment restored the bacterial diversity regardless of the krill oil dose, with an increased Shannon index as well as a reduced Simpson index compared with those in the HSHF group.</p><p>The overall compositions of the gut microbiota in the six groups were analyzed via Weighted and Unweighted UniFrac PCoA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM12">S4</xref>). The low- and moderate-dose krill oil treatments shifted the overall compositions of the gut microbiota in the HSHF group toward the composition of the control group, whereas the HSHF+HD group showed a unique pattern that was different from that in the HSHF and control groups. Interestingly, we identified a close relationship between the gut microbiota structures of the HSHF and HSHF+S, even though the LDL, TC, and TG indices were significantly reduced and the hyperlipidemia features were attenuated in the HSHF+S group. This finding indicated that the anti-hyperlipidemic activity of simvastatin was not caused by modulation of the gut microbiota.</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Dose-dependent change in the composition of mice fed the HSHF diet and treated with different krill oil doses via Weighted Unifrac PCoA analysis</bold>.

Because the anti-hyperlipidemic activity of simvastatin did not occur through modulation of the gut microbiota, further analysis was performed in these groups, except for the HSHF+S group. Sixty-five key OTUs that responded to the krill oil treatment were identified via redundancy analysis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, Tables <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM7">S7</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM8">S8</xref>).

In this study, the krill oil treatment provided significant and meaningful dose-dependent reductions in the physical (relative body weight gain and liver index; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">S2</xref>) and biochemical indices (LDL, TC, and TG; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) compared with those of the HSHF group. Additionally, the HDL level was significantly improved after krill oil treatment regardless of the dose. These findings were consistent with previous studies on dietary krill oil supplementation in mice fed a high-fat diet and in overweight humans (Maki et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Tandy et al., <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Burri et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>).</p><p>Krill oil supplementary in diet with low and moderate doses in this study maintained the structure of the gut microbiota like the control group, as well as the levels of HDL, LDL, TC, and TG. Previous studies have indicated that diet has a great influence (estimated at 57%, compared with 12% for genetic factors) on the structure of the gut microbiota (Tomasello et al., <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Consumption of a Western diet results in an increased abundance of <italic>Bacteroides</italic> spp, <italic>Ruminococcus torques</italic>, and <italic>Bilophila wadsworthia</italic> (Kamada et al., <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), whereas the microbiota population with an Eastern diet has a higher abundance of <italic>Prevotella</italic> spp. (Ananthakrishnan, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). The improvement of vascular dysfunction by inulin-type fructans supplementary in the diet is linked to the increased nitric oxide producing bacteria, replenishment of abundance in <italic>Akkermansia</italic> and decreased abundance in bacterial taxa involved in secondary bile acid synthesis (Catry et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). The high consumption of fiber in the diet modified the gut microbiota populations and increased the abundance of acetate-producing bacteria (Marques et al., <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>).</p><p>However, the high-dose group, which exhibited further alleviation of the hyperlipidemia symptoms, showed a unique gut microbiota structure compared to that of the HSHF and control groups. Compared with the LD and MD groups, the HD group showed a decreased gut microbial diversity and the Proteobacteria abundance, and an increase in the Firmicutes abundance, although the Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio was almost the same as the ratio in the MD group. The change in the gut microbiota structure in the HD group was similar to the previously &#x0201c;obesity model&#x0201d; (Marchesi et al., <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Alard et al., <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Denou et al., <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Krill oil and fish oil are mixtures of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. In this study, a high concentration of supplementary fatty acids led to an increased body weight gain from 18.58 g in the LD group to 23.58 g in the HD group (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). These results indicated that the krill oil treatment will lead to two effects in the same time: (1) the obesity and (2) the alleviation of hyperlipidemia. When krill oil intake at a low concentration (100 or 200 &#x003bc;g/g&#x000b7;d), the main effect focused on hyperlipidemia alleviation rather than obesity, and a control-like gut microbiota structure were observed in this study. When the concentration of krill oil increased to 600 &#x003bc;g/g&#x000b7;d, the effect on obesity was detected on increased body weight gain compared with the LD and MD groups, as well as the obesity-like structure with increased Firmicutes and decreased gut microbial diversity.</p><p>Seven abundant genera were detected in this study (Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM6">S6</xref>), and the change in the abundance of these genera might explain the anti-hyperlipidemic effect. <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> and <italic>Streptococcus</italic>, which are lactic acid bacteria, were enriched by krill oil treatment in our study. The oral administration of <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> and <italic>Streptococcus</italic> successfully influenced the TC, TG, LDL, and HDL levels in addition to aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase activities in the rats with experimentally induced hyperlipidemia (Aderiye et al., <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Ngongang et al., <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). The increased proportion of <italic>Serratia</italic> after krill oil treatment led to the accumulation of the compound FR177391, which had an anti-hyperlipidemic effect (Sato et al., <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). In addition to hyperlipidemia, krill oil supplementation was also beneficial for the treatment of inflammatory and neurological disorders, and inflammatory disease was positively correlated with the <italic>Ralstonia</italic> and <italic>Delftia</italic> abundance (Tyler et al., <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Chen et al., <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2014c</xref>; Bilgin et al., <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Tamburini and Clemente, <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). In this study, krill oil treatment significantly decreased the proportion of <italic>Ralstonia</italic>, which might explain the anti-inflammatory effect. However, the reason for the unexpected increased abundance of <italic>Delftia</italic> remains unknown.</p><p>Among the 65 key OTUs that responded to krill oil treatment, 26 OTUs were increased and 39 were decreased, compared with those of the HSHF group, regardless of the krill oil dose (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). The OTUs that were increased in abundance after krill oil treatment, including the genera <italic>Allobaculum</italic> and <italic>Enterobacter</italic>, which were negatively correlated with hyperlipidemia phenotypes, and thus might represent potentially beneficial bacteria. The OTUs that showed reduced proportions, including the genera <italic>Barnesiella, Clostridium XlVa, Desulfovibrionaceae</italic>, and <italic>Lactobacillus</italic>, might include some harmful bacteria. Additionally, krill oil treatment led to the reduced abundance of <italic>Desulfovibrionaceae</italic> and <italic>Clostridium XIVa</italic> and increased proportion of <italic>Allobaculum</italic>. <italic>Allobaculum</italic> was shown to prevent dextran sulfate sodium-induced inflammation, whereas <italic>Desulfovibrionaceae</italic> and <italic>Clostridium XIVa</italic> that were involved in the obesity-related metabolic disorders or pro-inflammatory reactions (Zhang et al., <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>, <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Lam et al., <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Le Roy et al., <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Tuovinen et al., <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).</p><p>However, among the OTUs detected both in the control and HSHF groups, 11 and 8 OTUs increased whereas 6 and 8 OTUs decreased after HSHF treatment, which belonged to <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> probiotics and <italic>Lactobacillus</italic>, respectively. This finding indicated that many OTUs belonging to the same genus correlated in opposite directions. Previous studies have shown that different bacterial species in the same genus may respond differentially to the same environmental stressor, such as changing from a high-fat to a standard diet (Zhang et al., <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>, <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). For instance, both <italic>Bifidobacterium animalis</italic> ssp. <italic>lactis</italic> GCL2505 and <italic>B. longum</italic> ssp. <italic>longum</italic> JCM1217T belong to genus <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> but show different effects on the reduction of visceral fat accumulation, glucose tolerance improvement, and gut microbiota modulation (Aoki et al., <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Thus, identifying species-level phylotypes changes in response to treatment is important.</p><p>In conclusion, the results obtained in this study suggest that structural alterations in the gut microbiota induced by krill oil treatment are dose-dependent and associated with the alleviation of hyperlipidemia. Krill oil treatment will lead to the obesity and the alleviation of hyperlipidemia in the same time. The effects on the obesity was not obvious after low and moderate dose krill oil treatment, and a control-like gut microbiota structure with increased abundance of <italic>Serratia, Delftia</italic>, and <italic>Streptococcus</italic> in the gut and decreased proportion of <italic>Ralstonia</italic> were observed. Whereas with the increase of krill oil concentration, the effect on obesity was detected on increased body weight gain compared with the LD and MD groups, as well as the obesity-like gut microbiota structure with increased Firmicutes and decreased gut microbial diversity.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Author contributions</title><p>CL and XS designed the study.
