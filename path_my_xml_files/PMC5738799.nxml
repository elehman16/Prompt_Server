The fact sheets were framed as either what could be gained or be lost by following (or not) the recommendations and the likelihood of being affected by CMV (i.e., small chance or one of the most common infections in infants). The questionnaire measured CMV knowledge, participation in CMV risk or prevention behaviors, perceived severity of and susceptibly to CMV, and the perceived control over and the efficacy of recommended prevention behaviors. The dependent variable, intention to modify behavior, was an index score that ranged from 0 to 16 with higher values indicating greater intention. Linear regression was used to evaluate the association between all independent variables and overall behavioral intention.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">The sample included 840 women; 15.5% were familiar with CMV.

It is the leading cause of infant hearing loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] and can also result in cognitive and motor deficits, vision loss, or death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Each year, there are nearly 26,000&#x000a0;U.S. children born with congenital CMV for a total birth prevalence of 0.64% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Of these, approximately 400 infants will die and 8000 will develop lifelong disabilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Although the effects of this condition are serious, awareness of CMV among adults remains low at 13&#x02013;39% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">Infants born with CMV are most commonly infected with the virus through transmission from mother to fetus during pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The virus can also be transmitted through sexual contact, breastmilk, and organ transplantation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Young children are the primary carriers of the virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. If a woman is exposed to CMV for the first time prior to conception or at any time during pregnancy her infant may become infected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Because no effective, licensed, CMV vaccine exists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], behavioral practices are the only means for women to limit their exposure to CMV or reduce CMV transmission. Handwashing is currently the primary behavioral recommendation for reducing CMV transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. However, research has shown that behaviors that limit a woman&#x02019;s contact with children&#x02019;s saliva may be especially efficacious in reducing infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. These include avoiding contact with saliva when kissing a child and not putting things in one&#x02019;s mouth that have been in a child&#x02019;s mouth (specifically food, cups, forks or spoons, or pacifiers) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Past research has shown that women regularly participate in behaviors that increase their risk of CMV infection through direct saliva sharing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Women also regularly engage in the protective behavior of handwashing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">There is relatively limited research on how to effectively communicate CMV prevention information. Individual-level interventions, specifically healthcare provider counseling, have been shown to be effective in reducing CMV infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. One study found that a fact sheet and video both encouraged women to practice individual prevention behaviors, look for more information about CMV, and share their knowledge with family members or friends [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. There is no published research on the type of CMV message content that is most effective. Therefore, the purpose of this research was to explore the influence of message framing on women&#x02019;s intentions to perform CMV prevention behaviors.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Message framing</title><p id="Par9">Message framing refers to a common health communication technique in which behavior change messages are focused on the potential outcomes of a proposed health behavior. The theoretical basis for message framing stems from behavioral economic prospect theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Prospect theory&#x02019;s premise is that when presenting a person with a choice between two alternatives, framing the choice in terms of the potential losses (cost of not complying) or gains (benefits) has differential effects on decision making and subsequent behavior. Gain and loss framed messages are structured around two components: 1) the outcomes or consequences of taking action or not taking action, and 2) the possibility that the specified outcome will be obtained, or not obtained [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Gain-framed messages focus on obtaining a desirable outcome (&#x0201c;If you quit smoking your lungs will be healthy and strong,&#x0201d;) or avoiding an undesirable outcome (&#x0201c;If you quit smoking you will be less likely to get lung cancer.&#x0201d;). Loss-framed messages emphasize being the recipient of the undesirable outcome (&#x0201c;If you do not quit smoking you may develop gum disease and lose your teeth,&#x0201d;) or failing to receive a desirable outcome by not following the advocated behavior (&#x0201c;If you do not quit smoking, you may not be able to keep your original teeth.&#x0201d;)</p><p id="Par10">Message framing research suggests that the influence of gain and loss messages on advocated behaviors can be direct. In other words, the person can change behavior after hearing or seeing a message. Or it can be mediated by additional variables, one of which is behavioral intention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Rogers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] suggested that intention to perform a behavior results from an individual&#x02019;s appraisal of three factors: severity of the event or outcome; perceived probability of the event occurring (susceptibility, or level of risk), and belief of whether following the recommended behavior will yield the desired result (response efficacy).</p><p id="Par11">Additionally, research indicates that when a person perceives that individual risk is high, a loss frame tends to be more effective at influencing behavioral intention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]; when risk perception is low people respond more positively to gain framed messages aimed at influencing behavioral intention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] and actual behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. In some cases, among those who perceive they are not at risk, framing makes no difference in behavioral intention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p id="Par12">For response efficacy, studies have shown that loss frame is more effective at influencing behavioral intention for behaviors with low response efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. When there is high response efficacy, framing either has no effect on intention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] or gain frame messages are more persuasive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Similarly, with high response efficacy, gain framed messages are more persuasive for actual behavior change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p id="Par13">In addition, the function of the proposed behavior can moderate the effect of message framing on intention and behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Health behaviors are classified as having one of two functions, also known as roles: detecting potential health problems (e.g. mammography for breast cancer detection) or preventing future health issues (e.g. vaccination), also called protection behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Research on the interaction of behavioral function and message framing suggests that gain-framed messages may be more persuasive for protection-related behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p><p id="Par14">Given that CMV awareness is low, that there are significant consequences of CMV infection in infants, and that there is a scarcity of research in how to communicate this information, this study aimed to look at the effect of framed CMV messaging among women of childbearing years. Specifically we were interested in the association between message framing and behavioral intention for CMV prevention behaviors.</p><p id="Par15">There were three hypotheses.</p><p id="Par16">Hypothesis 1: Because the messages are focused on prevention-related behaviors, overall, gain-framed messages will result in greater intention to engage in CMV prevention behaviors.</p><p id="Par17">Hypothesis 2: Messages that frame the potential risk or susceptibility of CMV infection as the most common infection will be associated with greater intention to engage in CMV prevention behaviors.</p><p id="Par18">Hypothesis 3: For the group of women who perceive they are at risk for CMV infection, the loss frame will result in greater intention to engage in CMV prevention behaviors.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Method</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Procedure and stimuli</title><p id="Par19">This was a cross-sectional descriptive study using a 2&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;2 factorial design. Two likelihood conditions were chosen because the odds of being affected by CMV are low, yet CMV infection is one of the most common infections that can affect a baby [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. A single outcome was framed as either what they would gain by practicing or lose by failing to practice the CMV prevention behaviors. This was chosen based on the message framing literature.

</p><p id="Par20">The fact sheets were pretested with a convenience sample of 113 women during four rounds of testing.

The national United States sample was recruited during 2015 from an online panel managed by Qualtrics, a worldwide software research company. Women who had ever worked as a healthcare provider and those who had a child with a previously diagnosed disability were excluded as both groups were likely to have higher CMV awareness than the general population. Respondents were compensated in reward points credited to their Qualtrics account. The Brigham Young University institutional review board approved the study.</p><p id="Par22">A sample size of 800 was selected so that we were able to have 200 in each cell (2&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;2 study design).

Responses were on a five point Likert scale from a lot less often to a lot more often.

The chi-square test was used to test for the difference in proportions across the frames and ANOVA was used to compare means across the frames. The framing condition was operationalized into two variables: 1) gain or loss frame and 2) small chance/most common.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Total score for overall behavioral intention</title><p id="Par32">To measure the outcome variable, behavioral intention, the responses were re-coded and categorized as a three level variable with values of 0 (respondent behavior would remain the same), 1 (change behavior &#x0201c;slightly more/less&#x0201d; in the desired direction), and 2 (change behavior &#x0201c;a lot more/less&#x0201d; in the desired direction). Respondents who stated that they would change their behavior in the opposite of the desired direction (e.g., wash hands less; <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;23&#x02013;43) were also classified as 0, no change in behavior. The 3-level items were then summed to create a behavioral intention index score ranging from 0 to 16 where higher values indicated greater intention. The resulting index score had a Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha of 0.92.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Linear regression analysis- overall behavioral intention</title><p id="Par33">Linear regression was used to evaluate the relationship of the independent variables on the overall behavioral intention scale. All variables were entered into the model as main effects and, as we were interested in testing potential moderating effect of framing conditions, all constructs were entered into the model as a two-way interaction with each of the two framing variables. To create a parsimonious model that adequately controlled for confounding, backward elimination was used to individually remove variables and interaction effects that did not achieve significance at the &#x003b1;&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.10 level. Consistent with principles of hierarchically well-formulated models, non-significant main effects were retained if they were part of a significant interaction term.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Logistic regression analysis &#x02013; Intention to change individual behaviors</title><p id="Par34">To determine if the associations observed in the linear regression model varied across the CMV prevention behaviors, the 3-level behavioral intention index scores, were used as the dependent variable for multinomial logistic regression. The constructs and interactions that were significant in the linear regression model were included. Additionally, based on an a priori hypothesis that frequency of participation in behavior would affect behavioral intention, pre-survey frequency of performing the behavior was also included. All analyses were conducted in SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC, USA).</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Results</title><p id="Par35">There were 848 respondents.

Among the subset of women who agreed or strongly agreed that they were at risk for CMV infection (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;471), there was no association between framing and overall behavioral intention (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;.20) in the unadjusted model or the adjusted model (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.70). However, among this same group of women, the mean susceptibility score was higher for those in the most common frame (<italic>M</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;5.01; <italic>SD</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.83) compared to the small chance frame (<italic>M</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;4.82; <italic>SD</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.89; <italic>p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.02</italic>). Similarly, the most common frame was also associated with higher levels of perceived risk with a mean level of 2.74 (<italic>SD</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.01) compared to 2.50 (<italic>SD</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.17) in the small chance frame (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.02). There were no differences in mean risk level between overall loss frames (<italic>M</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.64; <italic>SD</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.15) and gain frames (<italic>M</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.60; <italic>SD</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.05).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par46">This study was undertaken to explore the effectiveness of message framing in communicating with women of child-bearing age about how to reduce CMV infection. There were no differences among sample demographics for the four message frames, therefore any difference between the groups with regard to behavioral intention or other constructs should have been due to the messaging. Results showed that message framing had no direct effect on overall behavioral intention. However, there were main effects for knowledge, message credibility, perceived severity, response efficacy and perceived behavioral control. Additionally, interactions with gain and loss frame were noted for behavioral control and response efficacy with associated increases in behavioral intention.</p><p id="Par47">Consistent with other CMV research, we observed high rates of participation in CMV risk behaviors, particularly for sharing food, utensils and cups with children and kissing a child on the lips [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Although these behaviors were common, behavioral intention was generally high, indicating that women were willing to modify these behaviors to protect their unborn child. It may be that because CMV awareness was relatively low, exposure to any information regardless of whether it was presented as gains or losses resulted in increased behavioral intention.</p><p id="Par48">The lack of between-group differences for behavioral intention is similar to the results in a meta-analysis on prevention behavior-related messages which observed no difference between gain and loss framing in persuasiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Likewise, other studies have found no effect with gain and loss messages regarding vaccination behaviors and intentions to perform behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. O&#x02019;Keefe and colleagues suggested that gain and loss framed messages may not be effective for prevention-related behaviors because outcomes are not certain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. This may be true for CMV messaging as well. Although studies have shown that the prevention behaviors included in the fact sheet can reduce CMV infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], there are no data that indicate the certainty or magnitude of risk reduction that may occur as a result of doing those behaviors. The absence of between-group differences may also be due to the possibility that subtle messaging differences about losses and gains could have been overshadowed by the CMV information which would have been new to the majority of respondents.</p><p id="Par49">Response efficacy, perceived behavioral control, perceived severity of a CMV infection, message credibility and CMV knowledge were all associated with increases in behavioral intention, though at varying levels. However, it appears that a woman&#x02019;s perception of effectiveness of the behavior to reduce risk is most influential in her behavioral intention. In other research, a woman&#x02019;s perception about the effectiveness of the flu vaccine influenced whether or not she received the vaccine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. In our study, the perception of effectiveness varied across behaviors with respondents feeling that hand hygiene was most effective at reducing risk of CMV infection. Not sharing food or utensils were seen as less effective than handwashing. Half of the respondents felt that not kissing a child on the lips was very effective (data not shown). Interestingly, the fact sheet did not mention the effectiveness of performing the CMV prevention behaviors, suggesting that people have predetermined beliefs about these behaviors that influence perceptions of efficacy. This may indicate that response efficacy is a function of other constructs that if identified may be modifiable.</p><p id="Par50">The observed interactions that varied between gain frame and perceived behavioral control, and loss frame and response efficacy, may indicate that framing has the potential to differentially impact some subsets of women. A study about sun protection behaviors also observed an interaction between framing and response efficacy for one of three sun protection behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. However, loss frame was more persuasive among those with low response efficacy and gain frame was more persuasive for those with high response efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. This differs from our finding that behavioral intention increased with increasing levels of response efficacy, but the increase was more pronounced for those in the loss frame. It is unclear whether the differences between these two studies reflect differences in populations or the behaviors studied, or some other factor that differs between CMV prevention and sun protection behaviors.</p><p id="Par51">Although behavioral intention scores were in the positive direction, intention was not equal across all behaviors. A smaller percentage of women reported intention to change sharing behaviors or kissing a child on the lips compared with washing hands. Possible explanations for the relative unwillingness to modify these behaviors (sharing and kissing a child on the lips) may be because these require the cooperation of others and are rooted in cultural norms which could have significant mental and emotional costs if changed. For example, parents often share cups, utensils and food with their child for convenience or to model appropriate eating practices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Kissing a child on the lips is a very common and valued expression of affection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Yet, these are two high-risk behaviors because of the potential sharing of saliva that have high CMV viral loads [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Though potentially difficult to change, there have been shifts in cultural norms related to other maternal-child health behaviors such as putting a child to sleep on his/her back [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] and using car safety seats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].</p><p id="Par52">Additional research could explore how framing interacts with predictors of behavioral intention in various populations and across various types of CMV prevention behaviors. Nevertheless, it is important to recognize that regardless of frame, increased response efficacy, behavioral control, and perceptions of severity were associated with increases in behavioral intention. This suggests that although the complex interaction between framing and these constructs is not fully understood, messaging focused on these constructs may influence behavioral intention. Additionally, recent research on message framing suggests that personal motivating factors such as preferences for self-regulation (e.g., pleasure vs. pain or rewards vs. punishments) may moderate message framing effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. This is an unexplored area in CMV research.</p><p id="Par53">Further, the differential impact of messaging on actual behavior change is not known. Additional areas of inquiry should include the testing of CMV messaging strategies in a sample of women who are aware of CMV in order to determine if any information about CMV versus tailored CMV messages influence intention and change. Furthermore, longitudinal research to determine the relationships between behavioral intention and realized behavioral change would be useful.</p><sec id="Sec21"><title>Limitations</title><p id="Par54">The study measured only perceived behavioral intention to follow guidelines and not actual behavior. There is no indication that intention to do CMV prevention behaviors will lead to behavior change. However, numerous research studies have demonstrated that intentions are good predictors of actual behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. The data are self-reported and women may have over- or understated what they do, though the rates of behavior are similar to other CMV studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Intention to change behavior was measured immediately after seeing the fact sheet and may have suffered from a ceiling effect. There was no control group with which to make comparisons.</p><p id="Par55">Our demographic distribution was similar to other national survey panels studying CMV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The study sample was primarily white with at least some college education. The percent of women with a college degree or greater is higher than the US estimate of 30% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. The median US household income is $53,000 (US) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>] and though we cannot directly compare with this study&#x02019;s income categories, the distribution indicates that our sample maybe be more wealthy. CMV seroprevalence rates are highest among groups with lower socioeconomic status and certain racial-ethnic minority groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. CMV awareness also varies by demographic variables [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. This data may not be reflective of cultural norms and practices of all racial and ethnic groups or may not represent groups that could benefit the most from CMV messaging. It is possible that these panel women may not represent all women who are pregnant or thinking about becoming pregnant.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par56">Congenital CMV infection is common and can lead to negative health outcomes. Because awareness is low, and severity is high, determining how to construct CMV prevention messages for optimal influence is of utmost importance. Framing messages by what women have to gain or lose by participating in CMV prevention behaviors does not make a difference in overall behavioral intention. In this study, perceived behavioral control and response efficacy were most predictive of behavioral intention. Additionally, framing interacts with perceived effectiveness of CMV prevention behaviors and individual perceptions of behavioral control to influence intention. There may be other factors that are more persuasive when trying to influence women&#x02019;s behaviors that may reduce the sharing of a young child&#x02019;s saliva which has high CMV viral loads. Future messaging that focuses on increasing perceived behavioral control and response efficacy, particularly for the kissing and sharing behaviors, may result in greater gains in intention.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviation</title><def-list><def-item><term>CMV</term><def><p id="Par5">Cytomegalovirus</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>None.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par57">Funding was provided from internal university funds.
