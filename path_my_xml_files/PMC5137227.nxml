Stone formation is a multi-factorial process, which comes from excessive saturation of urine, and low concentration of inhibitor factors, which results in crystal nucleation and accumulation of insoluble compounds.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Most of stones contain calcium, oxalate, or a combination of both.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Calcium oxalate stones are so important because of the two main facts, firstly high prevalence of them, second, poorer response to current therapeutics approaches. Therefore, the prevention of stone formation is more effective than its treatment. In stone-forming patients with a recurrent episodes of kidney stone, citrate supplementation is a one of the routine preventive therapy, but it does not seem to be so effective in this situation. The importance of finding an efficient supplement therapy to this routine therapeutic and preventive approach is undeniable. The preventive effects of different solutions containing potassium, magnesium, and citrate have been evaluated in many interventional studies conducted on patients with kidney stones.</p><p>Potassium citrate (K-Cit) solution has been currently used as a therapeutic choice. Since calcium oxalate stones do not respond effectively to this alkalization of urine, more complementary solutions are needed. One of the best candidates in this regard is magnesium ion, magnesium ion might be compete with calcium to attach with oxalate. Interestingly, magnesium oxalate seems to be more soluble than calcium oxalate.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Different solutions containing magnesium salts (oxide, citrate, and acetate) have been evaluated in therapeutic approaches in patients with kidney stones.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] The role of these kinds of magnesium supplements in effective increasing in urinary magnesium has been debated.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] In our previous pilot research project,[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] we prove the positive and significant effect of magnesium chloride (MgCl<sub>2</sub>) solution in combination with K-Cit in urinary parameter. Therefore, we conducted this study on patients with calcium oxalate stones to investigate whether the stone size change after the consumption of K-Cit and MgCl<sub>2</sub> solutions. Renal ultrasonography is commonly used to establish the diagnosis of kidney stone and for follow-up in those found to have stones. Advantages are its cost and lack of exposure to ionizing radiation. Current studies demonstrate that the acoustic shadow width in ultrasonography provides good sensitivity, specificity and accuracy in detection of kidney stone and also follow-up for changing in size.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>We used MgCl<sub>2</sub> in its permitted level in combination with K-Cit.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Both K-Cit and MgCl<sub>2</sub> solution are not commercially available in Iran, two different solutions containing K-Cit and MgCl<sub>2</sub> were prepared.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This study was performed on children aged 6 months to 18 years with kidney stone with the approval of the Ethics Committee of the Research Department of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences and had the Iranian Clinical Trial Registration Number IRCT138707091282N1.</p><p>In addition, written consent was obtained from the parents of the children under 6 years and from both children older than 6 years and their parents before prescribing medications.</p><p>Seventy patients with a history of kidney stone proven by ultrasound have been enrolled in the study.</p><p>The composition of stones was considered to be calcium oxalate in these cases according to one of the following findings:</p><p>

Therefore, treatment protocols concentrate on both increasing inhibitory and decreasing promoting factors.</p><p>In this study, we evaluated stone size after consuming K-Cit and MgCl<sub>2</sub> in patients with calcium-oxalate kidney stones and also confirmed its positive effects on urinary parameters. K-Cit solution has been used to elevate urinary pH and citrate urinary concentration as inhibitory factor for stone formation. Pak <italic>et al</italic>. indicated the effectiveness of K-Cit therapy in increasing urinary pH, potassium and citrate but not in decreasing of urinary concentration of oxalate as a one of the major promoting factors in this kind of stones.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Many studies discussed the inhibitory role of urinary citrate concentration and alkali urine in preventing urinary stone formation.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Citrate alkali therapy might be reduced recurrence of stone formation but it is not so effective.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Citrate could prevent calcium oxalate stones formation by creating soluble complexes with urine calcium and as a result reducing the degree of urine calcium oxalate saturation. Furthermore, citrate prevents the nucleation, growth, and concentration of calcium oxalate crystals theoretically.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</p><p>On the other hand, magnesium ion also has been reported to have an effective inhibitory effect on calcium oxalate stone formation by the following theoretically mechanisms:</p><p>

</p><p>The study showed that the simultaneous administration of potassium-sodium citrate and magnesium oxide (MgO and K-Na-Cit) increased the urinary excretion of magnesium and citrate and decreased calcium excretion more than consumption of K-Na-Cit alone.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</p><p>Brundig <italic>et al</italic>. showed that the administration of high doses of MgCl<sub>2</sub> decreased the urinary level of oxalic acid while increasing magnesium concentration in urine.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p><p>Producing MgO solution is so difficult and it sedimate rapidly. Furthermore, surprisingly, the oral administration of MgCl<sub>2</sub> has been proved to have more bioavailability than MgO and magnesium hydroxide.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] Therefore, it seems that MgCl<sub>2</sub> could be a good choice for a complementary solution to routine K-Cit therapeutic approach.</p><p>In addition to magnesium, diethylaminoethanol cellulose had been also administered to correct oxalate hyper absorption.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] However, this medication has not been used widely in pediatric cases.</p><p>While K-Cit solution might lower the recurrence rate of calcium oxalate stones, the same effects was not proved with magnesium salts alone.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] Therefore, using magnesium salts alone without any combination solutions has not been effective.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] Such as, Tiselius <italic>et al</italic>. study which is revealed an increased amount of urine calcium and no changes in urinary excretion of magnesium and oxalate during 12 months consumption of MgO and so it is not so effective.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</p><p>Here, we demonstrated significant decreased in kidney stone size in group which is treated with K-Cit and MgCl<sub>2</sub> in comparison with K-Cit alone. We also report increased level of citrate excretion in combination therapy. Lowering level of urinary oxalate in addition to rising level of citrate in combination phase might be helpful in treating and also prevention of progression of CaOx stone kidney stones.</p><p>The increased urinary levels of stone inhibitor (citrate) and decreased level of stone promoter (oxalate) in addition to significant decrease in kidney stone size in combination therapy of K-Cit, Mg-Cl<sub>2</sub> in comparison with routine K-Cit therapy in this study were achieved which is could be introduced combination therapy as effective substitution for routine K-Cit therapy alone.</p><p>The effectiveness of adding magnesium salts such as MgCl<sub>2</sub> to routine approach of citrate alkali therapy in reducing stone sizes should be considered. These findings will need to be confirmed with further studies with the large sample size, with special attention to the reproducibility of measuring these parameters.</p></sec><sec
