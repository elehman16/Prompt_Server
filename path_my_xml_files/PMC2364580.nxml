			<italic>Objective:</italic> The safety and efficacy of ampicillin plus sulbactam were compared with those of cefoxitin in the treatment of women with pelvic inflammatory disease (PID).</p>
		<p>
			<italic>Methods:</italic> This single-site, randomized, prospective, third-party-blinded, comparative, parallel-treatment study enrolled 93 women with a diagnosis of PID. Patients were treated with either ampicillin/sulbactam (2 g/1 g, administered intravenously [IV], every 6 h) or cefoxitin (2 g, administered IV, every 6 h) for a minimum of 12 doses. Patients with cultures positive for <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic> also received concurrent oral or IV doxycycline (100 mg twice daily). Patients with cultures negative for <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> received prophylactic oral doxycycline (100 mg twice daily) for 10&#x02013;14 days after treatment with either ampicillin/sulbactam or cefoxitin was completed.</p>
		<p>
			<italic>Results:</italic> Ninety-three patients were entered in the study: 47 in the ampicillin/sulbactam arm and 46 in the cefoxitin arm. All 93 patients were evaluable for safety; 61 (66%) were evaluable for efficacy. Demographic characteristics were similar for the groups. Of the 27 evaluable ampicillin/sulbactam-treated patients, 67% experienced clinical cure, 30% improved, and 4% failed treatment. Respective values for the 34 cefoxitin-treated patients were 68%, 24%, and 9% (<italic>P</italic> = 0.67). Pathogens were eradicated in 70% of the women given ampicillin/sulbactam vs. 56% of those who received cefoxitin (<italic>P</italic> = 0.64).</p>
		<p>
			<italic>Conclusions:</italic> Overall, ampicillin/sulbactam demonstrated clinical and bacteriologic efficacy at least equivalent to that of cefoxitin in the treatment of women with acute PID. The use of ampicillin/sulbactam for this indication may avoid the complex dosing regimens associated with other treatments.</p>
