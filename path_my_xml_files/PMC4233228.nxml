They are alternate sequential compression device (ASCD) that can compress limbs alternately and simultaneous sequential compression device (SSCD) that can compress both limbs simultaneously and sequentially. A recent study using a new sequential compression device (SCD Express, Tyco Healthcare, Kendall, MA, USA) showed promising venous hemodynamic performance. The SCD Express provided alternate sequential compression with customized compression-relaxation cycles in accordance with an individual's separate venous refill times in their lower limbs, but does not provide simultaneous bilateral compression in the limbs.<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13)</xref> Moreover, it has been asked whether this refill time-adjusted compression works optimally throughout the duration of IPC, considering that venous hemodynamics can change with irregular intervals and vary depending on position, postoperative day, and the activity of the subjects.<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16)</xref> However, there is a theoretical presumption that simultaneous sequential compression of both legs (SSCD) may be superior to alternate compression in the effort to augment venous return and to improve hemodynamics, which seemed to be true from the results of our pilot study comparing hemodynamic data from four normal adult volunteers.<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17)</xref></p><p>Thus, our hypothesis is that a SSCD will be superior to an ASCD and the aim of this prospective randomized study was to compare the venous hemodynamic changes and their clinical influences between the two graded sequential compression groups (ASCD vs. SSCD).</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><sec><title>Study Population</title><p>After Institutional Review Board approval, 34 patients who underwent knee and spine operations and had a moderate or higher risk of VTE were enrolled in this study. They were prospectively randomized into two different device groups (ASCD vs. SSCD), with 68 limbs used in the physiological study. Patients were randomized with a computerized tool. Clinical data are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>. The mean age was 66 years in ASCD and was 71 years in SSCD. There were no differences in body mass indices or body surface areas (BSAs) between the groups. In 25 knee and femur operations (ASCD, 14; SSCD, 11), 24 patients underwent total knee replacement arthroplasties (TKRAs) and one patient underwent a closed reduction and internal fixation for a left femur shaft fracture. Among the nine patients who underwent spine operations (ASCD, 3; SSCD, 6), eight patients underwent interbody fusions of the lumbar or lumbosacral spine and one patient underwent an open reduction for a lumbosacral spine fracture.</p><p>All subjects in this study were at the level of more than moderate risk of VTE and isolated IPC without anticoagulation could be justified according to the 8th American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (ACCP guidelines).<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2)</xref> Preoperatively, the potential subjects for this study were interviewed thoroughly, examined clinically, and tested by duplex ultrasonography to see whether they had any of the exclusion criteria. The exclusion criteria were (1) chronic superficial or deep venous insufficiency, (2) venous anomalies, such as duplication of the superficial femoral vein, (3) previous VTE history, (4) being under anticoagulation therapy presently, (5) severe arteriosclerosis obliterans with no palpable dorsalis pedis pulse, (6) open fracture, hemorrhagic condition, or extensive dermatitis of the lower legs, and (7) congestive heart failure. Additional exclusion criteria included a documented malignant tumor, because pharmacoprophylaxis with anticoagulants would be more reasonable in such a case. D-dimer levels were checked on day 1 preoperatively and on day 3 postoperatively, to serve as a guide to the extent of VTE.</p><p>The primary outcome measure was the incidence of DVT, detected by bilateral duplex ultrasonography. Detection of a DVT warranted the addition of low-molecular-weight heparin therapy. The secondary outcome measure was venous hemodynamic data.</p></sec><sec><title>Description of IPC Devices (SCD Express and DVT-3000) and Their Use</title><p>In the ASCD group, SCD Express devices (Tyco Healthcare) were used, which provide alternate sequential compression with customized compression-relaxation cycles in accordance with an individual's separate venous refill times in the lower limbs. In the SSCD group, DVT-3000 devices (DS MAREF, Gunpo, Korea) were used, which can provide simultaneous sequential compression of both legs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). The two devices used were designed to improve overall compliance of both patients and the medical team, and therefore optimize thromboprophylaxis. Both manufacturers had reduced the size and weight (&#x0003c; 2 kg) to improve portability and for better handling. The SCD Express has optional battery power, which can support full function for 6-8 hours and the DVT-3000 for 8-10 hours. Noise had been reduced to 60 dB in the DVT-3000 and 80 dB in the SCD Express. Similarly, the sleeves consisted of three air chambers running the length from the foot to the lower thigh and inflated sequentially. However, the compression profiles differed. DVT-3000 provided 12 seconds of sequential inflation, with a maximum lower calf pressure of 40-45 mmHg, which was similar to that of the SCD Express. Device refill time, or relaxation time, was constant, but could be set to three different values (24, 48, 60 seconds). We selected 48 seconds as the fixed relaxation time on the basis of pilot study results. Thus, the cycling rate of the DVT-3000 was fixed as 60 cycles/hr and the compression was simultaneous. In contrast, the SCD Express provided 11 seconds of inflation and a customized device refill time, which varied with the individual's venous refill time. Using the technique of segmental air plethysmography,<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16)</xref> the SCD Express measures the postcompression time of the two legs separately and then uses the longest refill time for both legs. Thus, the cycling rate of the SCD Express was not fixed and the compression was not simultaneous.</p><p>It was recommended that all patients used IPC devices during their hospital stay. All patients began using graduated compression stockings during their operations and were supported by IPC after operation completion. IPC was applied at 6 cycles per day. One cycle consisted of a continuous 2-hour compression and subsequent 2-hour interruption. On the general ward, the sleeves were removed and the patients ambulated during these 2-hour interruptions.</p></sec><sec><title>Measurements of Venous Hemodynamics (Flow and Velocity)</title><p>Duplex ultrasonography exams were performed on the 4th and 7th postoperative days in the knee and spine surgery patients, respectively. All exams were performed by single radiologist using a 12.5 MHz linear-array transducer (iU22, Philips Ultrasound, Bothell, WA, USA). To obtain flow and velocity measurements, we followed the detailed methodology described by Kakkos et al.<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11)</xref> Briefly, longitudinal scans of bilateral superficial femoral veins, just distal to the confluence of the profunda femoral veins, were performed. Baseline velocity, flow pattern, and augmented flow for 11 seconds (ASCD group) or 12 seconds (SSCD group) were recorded. Under a fixed state of other ultrasound scan parameters, peak velocity (PV) was measured by determining the maximum point of the augmented waveform. Total volume flow (TVF) was calculated automatically by the software. Peak volume flow (PVF) was also calculated with a 1-second interval around the PV. Expelled volume was calculated theoretically to determine how much blood was squeezed by the compression for 1 hour: expelled total volume (ETV) = single cycle augmented TVF &#x000d7; cycling rate (cycles/hr), expelled peak volume (EPV) = single cycle augmented PVF &#x000d7; cycling rate (cycles/hr). All the measurements were performed in the supine position. More than four consecutive measurements were recorded and the mean value calculated.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analyses</title><p>We performed a small-scale preliminary physiological study that included four subjects for the program to ascertain the basic values for the venous hemodynamic parameters and they were used in the determination of an appropriate sample size. Statistical power was set at 80% and <italic>p</italic> levels were set at 0.05. The continuous data of the two groups are expressed as means &#x000b1; standard deviation and analyzed using a two-tailed, unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test. Relative frequencies of unpaired samples were compared using Fisher exact test. We considered mixed effects models that might be viewed as ANCOVA models, but allowed violating independence. A <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance. The SPSS ver. 14.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used for statistical analyses.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Primary Outcome: The Rate of DVT</title><p>The rates of DVT developed after the operation are shown in Table 1. In total, 34 patients were provided with IPC support postoperatively. DVT developed in 7 patients (20.6%). Two of them were in the ASCD group (SCD Express, 11.8%) and the other five were in the SSCD group (DVT-3000, 29.4%). The difference was not significant (<italic>p</italic> = 0.331). No patient was symptomatic. Although the evaluation of potential PEs using chest computed tomography should be made if a proximal DVT is found, there was no proximal DVT. All DVTs were confined to the calves. All of them involved axial veins of the calves. In the SSCD group (DVT-3000), four patients with DVT underwent unilateral TKRA. All DVTs developed on the ipsilateral side in TKRA patients. In the ASCD group (SCD Express), one patient with DVT underwent bilateral TKRA and the other patient, an open reduction of lumbosacral spine. Both of these patients showed bilateral DVT. The device model, age, and the method of operation were not significant risk factors as a result of risk factor analysis for development of DVT using a multivariate logistic regression model (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Secondary Outcome: Venous Velocity and Flow</title><p>Venous hemodynamic data are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>. For the comparison of hemodynamic values in the same group (baseline vs. augmented values), baseline PV, mean velocity, PVF, and TVF were enhanced significantly as much as, or more than 2-fold, in both device groups (all <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). In particular, PVF enhancement in the SSCD group was impressive, reaching as much as a 3.5-fold increase. Comparing the two groups, the hemodynamic values divided by BSA, the value indices were used for the analysis. The baseline and augmented value indices were not significantly different between the groups. Furthermore, the amounts of venous flow and volume enhancements were not different between the devices. The mean value of ETV index (ETV/BSA) was 28.8% higher with the SCD Express (ASCD group; 2,632 mL/hr vs. 1,834 mL/hr; <italic>p</italic> = 0.072) and EPV index (EPV/BSA) 55.9% higher with the SCD Express (ASCD group; 357 mL/hr vs. 229 mL/hr; <italic>p</italic> = 0.039), compared with the DVT-3000 (SSCD group).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>This was a prospectively randomized study to compare the clinical and physiological efficacies of two different IPC devices with respect to the prevention of VTE. The results demonstrated that (1) the clinical efficacies in preventing DVT did not differ between the devices, (2) the DVT incidence in the patients undergoing surgery with a moderate-to-high risk of VTE was 20.6% and there was no proximal/symptomatic DVT, with postoperative application of IPC, and (3) venous flow and velocity were significantly improved by both the DVT-3000 and SCD Express, but there was no significant differences between the groups.</p><p>Although most of the subjects underwent TKRA, which has a high risk of postoperative VTE, and the other operations had a moderate risk of VTE,<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2)</xref> the patients showed a relatively low incidence of DVT, with no symptomatic or proximal DVT. Without thromboprophylaxis, randomized clinical trials have demonstrated that venographic DVT was identified in 41%-85% and proximal DVT in 5%-22% of patients.<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19)</xref> Although the prevalence of DVT after TKRA in Asian populations is known to be lower,<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21)</xref> it is considered that both devices contributed to preventing DVT. IPC devices have important advantages and limitations. The most attractive advantage is the lack of bleeding potential, so that patients at high risk of bleeding can obtain thromboprophylaxis without depending on an anticoagulation-based method. However, there are many specific IPC devices that have various non-standardized modes of operation that have never been assessed or compared in any clinical trial. In this study, we tried to determine differences in clinical efficacy and venous hemodynamic changes according to the different modes of sequential compression (simultaneous vs. alternate compression and fixed relaxation time vs. changing relaxation time in accordance with venous refill time).</p><p>The compression pressure, duration, cycling rate, compression area, and compression sequence have been major issues with respect to the optimal application of IPC, including the problem of poor compliance in patients and the medical team. Both the devices in this study adopted sequential IPC, covering the foot and calf, with cuff pressures of 130 mm Hg and 40 mm Hg, respectively, for 2 hours with 2-hour intervals. According to the results of some representative studies, the range of compression should include the foot and calf at applied pressures of 60-140 mm Hg to lower venous pressure effectively.<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22)</xref> Additionally, the use of sequential IPC has shown evidence of increased local and systemic fibrinolytic activity, adding some protection against acute DVT to the direct mechanical emptying of the lower leg veins.<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23)</xref> For the evidence-based reason why we adopted continuous application of IPC for 2 hours in this study, Giddings et al.<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24)</xref> indicated that IPC over 2 hours had a significant effect in enhancing fibrinolysis and suppressing procoagulant activation.</p><p>To our knowledge, there has been no reported study concerning the comparison of simultaneous versus alternate compression. It was observed that the SCD Express was providing near-alternate compression in both legs due to dealing with different compressions in accordance with the different refill times. From the results of this study, the augmented amounts of velocities and volume flows, expressed as ratios, were generally larger with the DVT-3000, but the differences were not significant between the devices. The accumulated volumes expelled per hour were in favor of the SCD Express, consistent with observations in similar studies.<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13)</xref> It appeared that this significant difference was not directly associated with refill time-adjusted compression, but with increased cycling rates. That is, if we increased the cycling rate by reducing the relaxation time of DVT-3000, we are unsure whether the significant difference would be maintained or reversed. Unfortunately, we did not distinguish more determining factors for optimal IPC between the simultaneous and refill time-adjusted alternate compression from the observations of our study. In a risk factor analysis for the development of DVT using a multivariate logistic regression model, IPC device was not a risk factor (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). Thus, under the conditions tested, it was demonstrated that the contributions of the two devices in preventing DVT were equivalent.</p><p>During this study, as many as six patients were excluded, due to lack of adherence to the protocol. Unfortunately, the present study did not deal with the problem of compliance. In fact, relatively poor compliance with optimal fitting and following of instructions made the IPC less effective in clinical practice.<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25)</xref> For this reason, the ACCP guidelines emphasize that careful attention should be directed towards ensuring the proper use of, and optimal adherence with, this mechanical thromboprophylaxis.<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2)</xref> With respect to reduced size, improved portability, less noise, and simplified operation method, we felt that the two devices were equivalent, but an additional studies on true compliance and ease of use are warranted.</p><p>In conclusion, the two devices tested showed similar results not only in clinical efficacy of preventing DVT but also in the enhancing venous flow velocity and volume flow. The SSCD was not obviously superior to the ASCD. The accumulated volume flow (EPV and ETV indices) favored the IPC by the SCD Express, primarily due to the increased cycling rate. However, superiority between the devices defined by simultaneous and alternate refill time-adjusted compression was not determined. Further studies are required for the complete evaluation of combined simultaneous compression and a more frequent cycling rate.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>This study was supported by a Research Grant from DS MAREF, Gunpo, Korea.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="conflict"><p>No potential conflict of interest relevant to this article was reported.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bang</surname><given-names>SM</given-names></name><name><surname>Jang</surname><given-names>MJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Oh</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Korean guidelines for the prevention of venous thromboembolism</article-title><source>J Korean Med Sci</source><year>2010</year><volume>25</volume><issue>11</issue><fpage>1553</fpage><lpage>1559</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">21060742</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Geerts</surname><given-names>WH</given-names></name><name><surname>Bergqvist</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Pineo</surname><given-names>GF</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Prevention of venous thromboembolism: American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines (8th Edition)</article-title><source>Chest</source><year>2008</year><volume>133</volume><issue>6 Suppl</issue><fpage>381S</fpage><lpage>453S</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">18574271</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Nicolaides</surname><given-names>AN</given-names></name><name><surname>Breddin</surname><given-names>HK</given-names></name><name><surname>Fareed</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Prevention of venous thromboembolism.
