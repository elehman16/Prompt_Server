Within this patient population, the medial compartment is the most commonly affected compartment and is often accompanied with varus knee deformity [<xref rid="b1-medscimonit-23-3817" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b3-medscimonit-23-3817" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. TKA can be challenging in these knees with varus deformity as it is typically followed by progressively contracted medial soft tissues and attenuated lateral soft tissues. Ligament balance is therefore been considered essential to the success of TKA [<xref rid="b4-medscimonit-23-3817" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="b5-medscimonit-23-3817" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Obtaining balanced mediolateral (ML) ligamentous structures during TKA requires release of contracted medial soft tissues and removal of medial peripheral osteophytes. A widely applied technique to correct varus knee deformity is a step-by-step release of contracted medial soft tissues from their attachment sites until appropriate medial-lateral soft tissue tension is achieved. In patients presenting with severe varus knee deformity, an extensive medial release is almost always required; including progressive release of the deep medial collateral ligament (MCL), superficial MCL, posteromedial capsule, semimembranosus tendon, and pes tendons [<xref rid="b2-medscimonit-23-3817" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="b3-medscimonit-23-3817" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b6-medscimonit-23-3817" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b7-medscimonit-23-3817" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. This technique, however, has a risk of over-release leading to subsequent ML instability, which can in turn require a thicker polyethylene insert or even a constrained implant [<xref rid="b8-medscimonit-23-3817" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b10-medscimonit-23-3817" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Recently, reduction osteotomy (RO) has been proposed as a soft tissue-sparing technique to achieve ML gap balance [<xref rid="b11-medscimonit-23-3817" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b16-medscimonit-23-3817" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. It is a technique capable of reducing the amount of medial release and preventing over-release of the medial soft tissue structures. Dixon et al. [<xref rid="b14-medscimonit-23-3817" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and Mullaji et al. [<xref rid="b15-medscimonit-23-3817" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] reported the effectiveness of downsizing the tibial component for RO in cases with severe varus knee deformity. This technique is expected to be a safer option to correct varus deformity. However, removal of the medial tibia plateau bony margin may decrease the bone quality of the medial tibia, which probably leads to a premature loosening or subsidence of the tibia prosthesis. Yasuo et al. [<xref rid="b16-medscimonit-23-3817" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] reported nine cases of tibial component subsidence in a group of 39 knees treated with RO within the first postoperative year. In order to compare RO to traditional extensive medial soft tissue release (ER) for correction of varus deformity, we designed a prospective randomized controlled trial. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to assign, within the same patient, one knee to RO and the other knee to ER. We hypothesized that there would be no significant differences in clinical outcomes between knees treated with RO and knees treated with ER on intraoperative and postoperative clinical outcomes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title><p>From July 2014 to December 20l5, we prospectively enrolled patients with knee osteoarthritis and bilateral varus knee deformities undergoing primary simultaneous bilateral TKA.

Under tourniquet control, a standard TKA procedure was performed through a perpendicular midline incision and a medial parapatellar approach. With a minimal quadriceps tendon longitudinal split, the patella was laterally retracted instead of totally everted. The peripheral osteophytes of the proximal tibia and the distal femur were totally removed. The deep MCL was released in all patients. Following this release, each knee was treated with either RO or EE in accordance to randomization. All operations in this study were performed and supervised by a senior surgeon in our hospital, who is also the corresponding author of this article. All procedures were the same except the technique for varus knee deformity correction.

Knee ROM was measured with a leg goniometer; every knee was measured three times and the average value was recorded. VAS scores were calculated on a 0&#x02013;10 scale with 0 being &#x0201c;no pain&#x0201d; and 10 being &#x0201c;unbearable pain.&#x0201d; Additionally, a standardized weight-bearing anteroposterior radiograph of the whole lower extremities was flushed to assess the preoperative and postoperative knee alignment angle of the joint. The hip center, notching center of the distal femur, and the ankle talus center were identified and connected with a line. The preoperative varus knee angle was assessed using the preoperative radiograph, and the corrected knee angle was assessed with the postoperative radiograph of the whole lower extremities before the second operation. Existing knee scoring systems, such as the HSS, WOMAC, and SF-36 scores, are not designed for simultaneous bilateral TKAs in the same patient; therefore, we constructed a questionnaire based upon previous clinical experience [<xref rid="b17-medscimonit-23-3817" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Based on a patient&#x02019;s subjective satisfaction, with 10 the most satisfied and 1 the least satisfied, a total score of 10 items was identified as the degree of a patient&#x02019;s subjective satisfaction.</p></sec><sec><title>Randomization and blinding</title><p>A computer-generated random sequence was used to randomize knee treatments. Using a sealed envelope, assignment was concealed until the patient was in the operation room. While the surgeon was not blinded to treatment assignment, he was not responsible for collecting clinical outcome measures.

For those patients with varus knee deformities, surgeons have conventionally carried out a technique of extensive medial soft tissue release (ER) to achieve varus deformity correction. In the present study, we found that reduction osteotomy (RO) was better than conventional technique for correction of varus deformity. This technique of RO could decrease postoperative pain, achieve early knee functional recovery, and increase patients&#x02019; subjective satisfaction after TKA; no additional risks were found regarding other clinical outcomes.</p><p>Varus knee deformity can be corrected by various methods during TKA surgery, including the step-by-step medial soft tissue release [<xref rid="b1-medscimonit-23-3817" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b2-medscimonit-23-3817" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="b18-medscimonit-23-3817" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], pie-crusting of the superficial medial collateral ligament [<xref rid="b19-medscimonit-23-3817" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b24-medscimonit-23-3817" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], RO of the uncapped tibia plateau surface with a one-size minimal tibia component [<xref rid="b11-medscimonit-23-3817" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b16-medscimonit-23-3817" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and medial epicondylar osteotomy of the distal femur [<xref rid="b25-medscimonit-23-3817" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Each technique has its own potential advantages and disadvantages. One retrospective study [<xref rid="b25-medscimonit-23-3817" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] proposed an alternative method of medial epicondylar osteotomy of the distal femur and found medial epicondylar osteotomy for varus deformity in TKA could provide reliable medial stability. However, a review study [<xref rid="b26-medscimonit-23-3817" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] questioned the need for an epicondylar osteotomy in severely varus knees. With this technique, the knee can become more unstable in flexion and an implant with higher constraint may be necessary. A previous study [<xref rid="b19-medscimonit-23-3817" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] found the pie-crusting technique was safe, efficient, and reliable for the soft tissue balancing in varus TKA. However, a cadaver study [<xref rid="b24-medscimonit-23-3817" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] considered the success of the MCL pie-crusting technique is likely technique dependent since failure occurs within the ligament itself. A new-published article [<xref rid="b23-medscimonit-23-3817" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] also found that the pie-crusting technique has a higher rate of failure in the ML gap balance compared with RO.</p><p>The technique of ER was one of the major focuses in our present study. In the ER group, we performed a careful progressive soft tissue release until ML balance was achieved. Dixon et al. [<xref rid="b14-medscimonit-23-3817" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] described the technique of resecting the medial uncapped tibia plateau bone after downsizing and lateralizing the tibia tray for correction of the varus deformity. This technique can indirectly increase the length of the medial ligamentous structures by shortening the distance between the origin and insertion without an ER.</p><p>In RO, the tense medial ligamentous structures are decompressed by downsizing of the medial uncapped tibia plateau. Furthermore, medial soft tissue stripping id only limited to the deep MCL and those structures attached to the resected bone fragments. The advantage of this technique of RO is achievement of ML soft tissue balance but with less bleeding and decreased risk of medial instability. The medial soft tissue structures also gradually lengthen after resection of the medial tibia bone. This lengthening with limited soft tissue release was enough to completely correct the varus deformities in our cohort. In our present study, knees treated with RO had lower pain scores than knees treated with ER at one-month follow-up. We attribute this preferable clinical outcome to greater preservation of the medial soft tissues. Due to better pain control at postoperative times, functional exercises in the less painful knee may have been easier for patients. Along with an alleviation of pain, we also observed that the knees achieved early 90&#x000b0; flexion at earlier time point. During one-year follow-up, we found no case of premature loosening or subsidence of the tibia prosthesis.</p><p>Given the aforementioned clinical outcomes, we suggest that RO can be used as a primary technique for correcting varus deformity during TKA, as it has the potential ability to completely correct the deformity without excessively disturbing the medial soft ligamentous structures. This in turn could decrease postoperative pain reaction, achieve early knee functional recovery, and promote patient&#x02019;s subjective satisfaction.</p><p>The strength of this study was that it was a prospective randomized controlled and blinded trial. We compared Ro and ER using clinical outcome measures in simultaneous bilateral TKA. By using the same surgeon and assigning knees within the same patient to different conditions, we were able to reduce variability.</p><p>However, several limitations of this study should be noted. First, this study had a small sample size; we only enrolled 24 patients in the one-year study period. This was hard to avoid as bilateral asymmetric varus knee deformities are less common than unilateral varus knee deformities. Second, the senior surgeon could not be blinded to the procedure, which may bring potential bias to the study. Last, we only evaluated the clinical outcomes between the groups in the early postoperative period. Some complications, such as loosening and tibial component subsidence, can occur years later. Therefore, further studies examining long-term follow-up outcomes beyond two years are necessary.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This prospective randomized controlled trial on simultaneous bilateral TKA indicated that RO was better than the conventional technique for correction of the varus deformity, it could decrease postoperative pain reaction, achieve early knee functional recovery, and promote the patient&#x02019;s subjective satisfaction after TKA; no additional risks were found regarding other clinical outcomes.
