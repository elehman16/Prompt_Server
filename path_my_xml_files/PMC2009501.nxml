The duration of first remission was slightly, but not significantly, longer in those patients who received immunotherapy. This was true also for the duration of survival after relapse. Comparison with other series suggested that the effect of such immunotherapy on duration of survival after relapse is probably real, but did not clearly indicate whether or not any real difference in the first remission duration existed.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00159-0004.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00159-0005.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00159-0006.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00159-0007.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00159-0008.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00159-0009.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00159-0010.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00159-0011.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00159-0012.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00159-0013.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="10" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00159-0014.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="11" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00159-0015.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="12" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00159-0016.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="13" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00159-0017.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="14" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
