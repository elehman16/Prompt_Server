However, it is still unknown which type of exercise affects cognition. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that a demanding balance training program improves memory and spatial cognition. Forty healthy participants aged 19&#x02013;65 years were randomly assigned to either a balance or relaxation training intervention. Each group exercised twice a week for a total of 12 weeks. Pre- and posttests assessed balance performance, cardiorespiratory fitness, memory, spatial cognition, and executive functions. Only the balance group significantly increased in balance performance from pre- to posttest, while cardiorespiratory fitness remained unchanged in both groups. Moreover, the balance group significantly improved in memory and spatial cognition. Effects on executive functions were not observed. These results suggest that balance training is capable of improving particularly memory and spatial cognition. Therefore, an increase in cardiorespiratory fitness does not seem to be necessary to induce beneficial effects of physical exercise on cognition. It might be speculated that stimulating the vestibular system during balance training induces changes of the hippocampus and parietal cortex possibly via direct pathways between the vestibular system and these brain regions.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Developing methods to enhance neuroplasticity and cognitive functioning has become a major research interest of psychologists in the light of quickly advancing technologies and aging societies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Among a large variety of behavioral interventions such as cognitive training programs and special nutrition, physical exercise programs have been suggested to improve cognition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Physical exercise over a course of several months has been shown to improve cognitive performance, including executive functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, speed of processing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, and memory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Moreover, aerobic exercise has been found to slow down gray matter volume loss in the hippocampus and frontal lobes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. So far, most of the studies investigating the effects of physical exercise on cognitive functions have focused on aerobic training like running, walking and cycling. However, a recent meta-analysis on the effects of aerobic training on cognitive functions in older adults concluded that there is still no clear evidence for a causal link between an increase in cardiorespiratory fitness and cognitive benefits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Thus, cardiorespiratory fitness improvements following aerobic training might only be one of multiple factors mediating the positive effects of exercise on cognition. This hypothesis is supported by recent reports suggesting beneficial effects of other types of exercise on cognitive functions. For example, randomized controlled intervention studies employing coordination training<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> and dancing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> reported positive effects on memory, selective attention, executive functions and spatial cognition compared to control groups.</p><p id="Par3">Physical exercise, regardless of its aerobic or anaerobic metabolic demands, provides a stimulus to vestibular, neuromuscular and proprioceptive systems. The perception of self-motion and balance is coded by vestibular detection of inertial motion, in conjunction with proprioceptive and visual signals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Connections between vestibular nuclei and the cerebellum, hippocampus, as well as prefrontal and parietal cortices provide information for cognitive functions such as spatial functions, navigation and memory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. For example, bilateral vestibular lesions were found to result in decreased performance in spatial memory tasks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, hippocampal atrophy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, and reduced fractional anisotropy in white matter tracts within the limbic system and the thalamus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Caloric stimulation of the vestibular nuclei in healthy adults, on the other hand, improved verbal and spatial memory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> and Galvanic vestibular stimulation modulated mental rotation and perspective taking abilities, depending on the threshold of the current<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">It has been speculated that an increased stimulation of the vestibular system during self-motion might be an essential mediator between physical exercise and cognitive functioning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Accordingly, animal studies have shown that improved balance performance resulted in higher survival rates of neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> and increased volume of the hippocampus and prefrontal areas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. In humans, balance skills have been associated with an increased volume of the hippocampus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, the basal ganglia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, and frontal and parietal brain areas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. However, data on the effects of balance training on cognitive functions, particularly related to memory and spatial cognition, are rare so far. A recent study in young adults found improvements in a spatial orientation task after one month of balance training<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, compared to a passive control group.</p><p id="Par5">The goal of the present study was to test the hypothesis that a physical exercise program with high demands on the vestibular system improves particularly memory and spatial cognition. To this end, we implemented a demanding balance training program in healthy adults in comparison to a relaxation training intervention. Both training types were expected to not affect cardiorespiratory fitness. Memory, spatial cognition and executive functions were assessed before and after the 12-week training program.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Participants</title><p id="Par6">A total of 70 healthy participants were recruited via public advertisements in the city of Hamburg (Germany). Participants between the age of 18 and 65 years were included if they reported sport activities of no more than five times a month during the last five years and no extensive experience in balance or relaxation training. All participants had normal or corrected-to-normal vision and normal hearing abilities. Exclusion criteria were untreated heart diseases, untreated respiratory diseases, neurological or psychiatric illnesses, acute musculoskeletal diseases or arthropathies. Additionally, participants underwent a sport medical examination. Based on meta-analysis of previous exercise-cognition studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> we expected a medium effect size.

Both training groups were instructed by the same professional trainers. Each participant was supposed to take part in 24 training sessions. The training was offered for a total of 13 weeks, so that participants could catch up missed training sessions. All participants were advised not to change their habitual level of physical activity throughout the intervention period.</p><sec id="Sec6"><title>Balance training</title><p id="Par10">Participants conducted a balance circuit training on varying surfaces, either on one leg or on both legs. They had to complete eight different balance stations per session, each lasting for 5&#x02009;minutes. The training favored a situational approach: Tasks were designed to induce reactive postural adjustments, forcing participants to permanently re-stabilize. For example, one task was to keep balance in a single-leg stance while being consistently pulled to one side with a strong elastic strap around the hips. On half of the stations, working in tandems was required. For example, participants were standing on a wobble board, throwing a medicine ball to their partner and back while trying to regain balance. Exercises were progressively adjustable to the skill level of the participants by combining and increasing the difficulty of the balance components, i.e. by increasing the strap tension, the distance to the partner, or by closing the eyes while standing on one leg on a soft surface. No explicit strategies were taught. After six weeks, exercises were replaced with a new set, in order to keep the training interesting and sufficiently challenging.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Relaxation training</title><p id="Par11">The relaxation group practiced two well-known relaxation techniques: Progressive muscle relaxation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> and autogenic training<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Participants were laying or sitting on mats. They were instructed to practice relaxation approaches by actively increasing and decreasing muscle tension of single body parts (progressive muscle relaxation) or by concentrating on the rhythm and depth of breathing (autogenic training). During the first half of the training period, progressive muscle relaxation was taught, and after six weeks, autogenic training was introduced to keep the participants&#x02019; motivation and attention high.</p><p id="Par12">Both training groups were comparable with regard to duration, place, social contacts, group size and concentration on the body, yet only the experimental group received active balance training.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Assessments</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Physical assessments</title><p id="Par13">Balance: To assess dynamic, functional and static balance parameters prior to and after the intervention, three different tests were used.<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par14">Dynamic balance was assessed with a stability platform (Stability Platform, Modell 16030&#x02009;L, Lafayette Instrument Company, Lafayette, IN, USA).

They were asked to keep the platform in a horizontal position for 30&#x02009;sec. A handrail was available to prevent falls, but during a trial participants placed their hands on their hips. After a one-minute practice trial, three trials per condition (eyes open and eyes closed) were conducted with rests of 30&#x02009;sec in-between. Whether participants started with eyes open or with eyes closed was counter-balanced across participants.

Participants were tested barefoot with eyes closed using three different stances: double-leg stance (feet parallel to each other), single-leg stance (standing on the non-dominant leg) and a semi-tandem stance (non-dominant foot behind the dominant foot, heel-to-toe joint). During all trials, participants were instructed to stand as motionless as possible with their hands resting on their hips. The underground was either a firm surface or a 10&#x02009;cm flat cushion of medium density foam (Airex&#x000ae; Balance-Pad, Gaugler &#x00026; Lutz oHG, Germany). Following the BESS protocol, each position was tested twice on each underground; each trial lasted for 20&#x02009;sec. Participants were video-recorded and two trained observers independently scored errors using a standardized rating scale. Error categories included opening eyes, lifting hands off the hips, stepping, stumbling or falling out of the position, lifting the forefoot or heel, abducting the hip by more than 30&#x000b0;, or failing to return to the starting position within 5&#x02009;sec. To determine reliability, intraclass correlations (ICC) were calculated, ranging from r&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.86 to r&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.93 for each position and underground.

For this, center of pressure data were collected during double leg, single leg and tandem leg stances, using the software BioWare (Kistler Instruments AG, version 4.0.1.2). Each position was tested three times with eyes closed and three times with eyes open. The order of eyes open/closed conditions was randomized across participants. Trials lasted 30&#x02009;sec each; the last 20&#x02009;sec of each trial were used for the analyses to avoid initial motion biases. A lowpass butterworth-filter implemented in MATLAB (The MathWorks Inc., USA) was used to preprocess the data. The sway velocity of the center of pressure (CoP) was determined by dividing the cumulative of medial&#x02013;lateral and anterior&#x02013;posterior CoP displacement by the trial time. The overall CoP score was calculated as the mean of the three trials per position, condition and sway axes (medial - lateral; anterior - posterior).

Dynamic balance performance improved only in the balance group from pre- to posttest. By contrast and as expected, changes in cardiorespiratory fitness (VO<sub>2</sub>peak) were observed neither in the balance group nor in the relaxation group. Only the balance group improved in memory and spatial cognitive abilities. Finally, none of the two groups displayed changes in executive functions.</p><p id="Par44">The findings suggest that systematic balance training is capable of enhancing some cognitive functions, such as memory and spatial cognition. Crucially, an increase in cardiorespiratory fitness does not seem to be necessary for eliciting beneficial effects of physical exercise on cognitive functions. This pattern implies multiple mechanisms for physical activity affecting cognitive functions.</p><p id="Par45">In the present study, we used a balance training in order to particularly engage the vestibular system. The vestibular system essentially contributes to spatial cognition and orientation by detecting linear acceleration during self-motion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Moreover, the vestibular system has anatomical connections to the medial-temporal lobe as well as to parieto-temporal cortical networks which are known to be involved in spatial navigation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Structural changes after short-term balance training were found in frontal and parietal areas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Moreover, professional dancers and slackliners were found to have larger gray matter volumes in the posterior hippocampus but smaller volumes in the anterior hippocampus compared to non-balance experts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. The authors interpreted the structural differences as indicator of plastic changes following perseverative stimulation of the vestibular-visual pathways to the hippocampus. The behavioral improvements in memory and spatial cognition after 12 weeks of balance training of the present study are in accord with these structural data. The balance training group improved in a paired-associative learning task which is associated with the hippocampal memory system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. Perspective taking abilities and mental rotation tasks seem both to rely on bilateral parietal cortices and the hippocampus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>, respectively.</p><p id="Par46">We did not find improvements of executive functions after the balance (and relaxation) training. Results of a study comparing coordination, aerobic and stretching training in older adults reported benefits in both physically active training groups on executive functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. The coordination training in the study of Voelcker-Rehage <italic>et al</italic>. focused on fine and gross motor coordination rather than on balance like the present study. The effects of balance training might be more restricted to memory and spatial functioning. Improvements in executive functions in studies implementing aerobic exercise programs have been repeatedly observed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. In the present study, participants underwent a graded ergospirometry before and after the intervention to control for possible changes in cardiorespiratory fitness. Neither the balance group nor the relaxation group significantly changed in cardiorespiratory fitness.</p><p id="Par47">In addition, participants of the present sample were on average younger and the age range was much broader than in previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. It has been hypothesized that cognitive functions are particularly susceptible to treatment such as physical exercise interventions, when they undergo age-related change<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Therefore, another reason for lacking a significant effect in executive functions might be the broad age range of the present sample. We did not find differences in the performance change between younger and older participants, neither in physical nor in cognitive variables. Future studies should comprise larger sample sizes to investigate possible differences between age groups with a higher power.</p><p id="Par48">The present findings demonstrate beneficial effects of balance training, compared to relaxation training, on memory and spatial cognition. In order to conclude that group differences at posttest are explained by the specific balance training, possible alternative accounts need to be discussed: Balance training comprises proprioceptive, visual and motor learning to a larger degree than relaxation training. The vestibular neural pathways are inherently multisensory, and vestibular signals converge with proprioceptive, visual and tactile information at early stages, such as brainstem vestibular nuclei and deep cerebellar fastigial nuclei in the afferent pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Whether one of the sub-processes or rather the integration of vestibular, somatosensory and visual signals are essential for the training induced increase in memory and spatial cognition, must be addressed in future studies. Tasks requiring coordination with a partner and objects were introduced to make the training diversified and more appealing for the participants. Although the relaxation group acquired two different relaxation techniques, overall task complexity was higher in the balance training group. We cannot fully exclude the possibility that complexity as such improved performance in the experimental group, though we consider this account as unlikely: Practicing to handle and coordinate more complex task demands is a typical executive function, rather than being specifically linked to memory and spatial skills. However, groups did not differ in executive functions at posttest.</p><p id="Par49">Physical activity is known to have antidepressant and anxiolytic effects and to increase resilience to stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. In the present study, a global score of psychopathological symptoms was assessed at baseline and after the intervention. Importantly, the score did not differ between groups at pretest, nor did groups differ in their change from pretest to posttest, rendering it unlikely that a reduction in psychological distress might account for the present findings. Additionally, both training groups displayed the same level of self-reported habitual physical activity (MET) over time. The increase of two additional hours of physical activity per week at posttest compared to pretest was recorded in both groups and reflected the participation in the intervention. Therefore, the observed improvements in memory and spatial cognition are likely related to the balance intervention.</p><p id="Par50">In sum, we are able to conclude that 12 weeks of balance training in healthy adults has positive effects on memory and spatial cognition, and an increase in cardiorespiratory fitness does not seem to be necessary to induce beneficial effects of physical exercise on cognition.</p><p id="Par51">From an applied perspective, balance training might represent a promising alternative intervention for individuals who are not able to participate in aerobic training following health restrictions.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>
