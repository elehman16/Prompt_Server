Globally, only an estimated 3% of patients in RLS receive second-line ART [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The reasons include limited access to viral load monitoring, which impedes timely diagnosis of treatment failure and lack of convenient, co-formulated and safe second-line treatments. Guidelines issued by the WHO in 2013 [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] recommend a second-line regimen based on boosted protease inhibitors (bPIs), with two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), after failure of a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-based first-line treatment. This strategy was recently validated in three randomized clinical trials [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], but data on the NRTI and bPI options are lacking. In the WHO recommendations, the possible choice of bPI is between ritonavir-boosted atazanavir (ATZ/r) and ritonavir-boosted lopinavir (LPV/r), whereas ritonavir-boosted darunavir (DRV/r), considered as an option by the WHO expert panel, is finally not recommended due to non-availability as a generic co-formulation, its high price and limited registration [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The choice of the NRTI backbone is based on previous NRTI exposures: patients having received thymidine analogues should receive a combination with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), whereas those who failed on TDF should receive zidovudine (ZDV). Lamivudine (3TC) or emtricitabine (FTC) is always continued. The NRTI combination with didanosine (ddI) and abacavir (ABC) recommended in WHO 2006 guidelines [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] as an alternative for the possible residual activity in patients with long-term virological failure was never evaluated, and was discarded in 2010 because of complexity and cost criteria [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. No direct comparison of these possible combinations is available, and evidence for the choice is deemed of low quality [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we compared the efficacy and safety of one of the current WHO standard regimens (TDF/FTC and LPV/r), chosen for its availability in national programmes with two alternatives: TDF/FTC and DRV/r &#x02013; a new-generation protease inhibitor with a once-daily dose, providing improved tolerability [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]; and ABC, ddI and LPV/r &#x02013; a combination still in use in RLS due to availability of the drugs and lack of exposure to these two NRTIs in first line.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study design and sites</title><p>We conducted a 48-week randomized, parallel, open-label, multicentre, non-inferiority trial to compare efficacy and safety of three bPI-based second-line antiretroviral combinations in three African countries: the HIV services of the Central and Military Hospitals of Yaound&#x000e9; in Cameroon; the Clinical Research Centre and the Day Care Centre of the Fann Hospital of Dakar in Senegal; and the Day Care Hospital of the University Hospital of Bobo Dioulasso in Burkina Faso. The institutional Ethics Committee of the Institut de Recherche pour le D&#x000e9;veloppement (IRD) in France and the participating countries&#x02019; national Ethic Committees approved the protocol.

The following were excluded: pregnant and nursing women, HIV-1 group O, N or P-infected patients, those previously exposed to study drugs (except 3TC/FTC), those with renal [creatinine clearance (Cockcroft&#x02013;Gault) &#x0003c; 50&#x0200a;ml/min] or hepatic failure (prothrombine time &#x0003c; 50%), or with severe ongoing AIDS-related illness, including tuberculosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Randomization and masking</title><p>Randomization was stratified by study site.

Participants in the ABC/ddI group with chronic hepatitis B continued 3TC 150&#x0200a;mg after enrolment. All drugs were originators (donated by Gilead Sciences and Janssen) or WHO-prequalified generics provided by the National Programmes. Human leucocyte antigen B&#x02217;5701 routine screening was not performed because it was not recommended by WHO, was unavailable in the national laboratories and the allele have a low prevalence in the African population [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Outcomes</title><p>Primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with viral load below 50&#x0200a;copies/ml at week 48 in the modified intention-to-treat (mITT) population. Secondary endpoints were the proportions of patients with viral load below 200 and 1000&#x0200a;copies/ml at week 48. Immunological (CD4<sup>+</sup> cell count changes) and clinical (occurrence of HIV and non-HIV-related events) endpoints were also evaluated. Safety and tolerance were measured using clinical and laboratory assessments. The number of adverse and serious adverse events, together with study drug interruptions, was also reported.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Procedures</title><p>Patients on first-line ART having viral load above 1000&#x0200a;copies/ml underwent structured interviews to support adherence (details about intervention in supplemental material page 4). One month later, after providing written, informed consent, viral load control and screening visit were proposed. Randomization occurred if the control viral load was still above 1000&#x0200a;copies/ml. Follow-up visits were scheduled at weeks 4, 12, 24, 36 and 48, and every 6 months thereafter, until the end of the study (week 48 visit of last included patient). Visits included clinical evaluation, renal and liver function tests, total blood count and plasma storage. Plasma HIV-1 viral load using m2000rt RealTime HIV-1 assay (Abbott, Abbott Park, Illinois, USA) and CD4<sup>+</sup> cell count (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, New Jersey, USA) measurements were performed at all time points (except CD4<sup>+</sup> at week 4) in national reference laboratories. Baseline genotypic drug resistance was performed retrospectively for all patients, at the end of the study, on stored plasma. Samples from Senegal and Burkina Faso were tested in the IRD WHO-accredited laboratory in Montpellier, France. Samples from Cameroon were analysed locally at Centre de Recherche sur les Maladies Emergentes et R&#x000e9;&#x000e9;mergentes/ Institut de Recherches M&#x000e9;dicales et d&#x02019;Etudes des Plantes M&#x000e9;dicinales (CREMER/IMPM) &#x02013; a WHO-accredited laboratory for antiretroviral resistance surveillance in Yaound&#x000e9;.</p><p>Participants attended the pharmacy quarterly for prescribed drugs. Pharmacists administered a standard questionnaire [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and performed pill count to measure adherence. Intensive adherence support was proposed to patients with increased viral load.</p><p>Participants were followed using standardized medical protocols: for tuberculosis, DRV/r was replaced with LPV/r with increased ritonavir doses (+300&#x0200a;mg twice as from WHO recommendations [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]). For virological failure, that is, confirmed viral load above 1000&#x0200a;copies/ml after adherence support, resistance testing was performed on baseline and last visit samples, and patients were managed accordingly. A third-line regimen including DRV, etravirine and raltegravir was available.</p><p>An independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board supervised the study. Two non-blinded interim analyses were performed, the Board approving study continuation on each occasion.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Cross-arm comparison of patient proportions with viral load below 50&#x0200a;copies/ml at week 48 was performed using a mITT analysis, which included patients who received at least one dose of the assigned treatment and excluded patients with major protocol violations. The following were considered failures: patients with viral load at least 50&#x0200a;copies/ml at week 48, non-completers at week 48 for whatever reason and those who switched ART before week 48 for whatever reason, except pregnancy and tuberculosis. We also performed per protocol comparison of the three groups which included patients still receiving the assigned treatment at week 48 and those who changed ART because of virological failure before week 48. Patients who interrupted the assigned treatment for at least 15 days were excluded from the per protocol analysis. Those with viral load at least 50&#x0200a;copies/ml at week 48 or who switched ART because of virological failure before week 48 were deemed failures in the per protocol analysis.</p><p>The differences between proportions of patients with viral load below 50&#x0200a;copies/ml at week 48 in the control group and in the two other groups, respectively, were calculated, and the non-inferiority was thus tested by comparing the upper limits of the 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of these differences with the pre-defined non-inferiority margin of 15%. Similar analyses were performed for the proportion of patients with viral load below 200 and 1000&#x0200a;copies/ml at week 48. In a subgroup exploratory analysis, we compared the proportion of patients with viral load below 50&#x0200a;copies/ml at week 48 across all arms stratifying by baseline viral load (&#x0003c;100&#x0200a;000&#x0200a;copies/ml versus &#x02265;100&#x0200a;000&#x0200a;copies/ml). All other endpoints were tested for superiority. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) or Kruskal&#x02013;Wallis test was used for continuous variables, and chi-square or Fisher's exact test was used for categorical ones. Factors associated with baseline viral load at least 100&#x0200a;000 and 50 at week 48 were identified using logistic regression models. STATA version 12 (STATA Corp., College Station, Texas, USA) was used for statistical analyses.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample size</title><p>Hypothesizing 80% efficacy at the 50&#x0200a;copies/ml viral load threshold in the control group at week 48, we calculated a required sample size of 150 participants per group to show non-inferiority of ABC/ddI and DRV groups compared with the control group in ITT analysis, with a non-inferiority margin of 15%, a power of 90% and a two-sided <italic>&#x003b1;</italic> of 5%.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Baseline characteristics</title><p>Between January 2010 and September 2012, of the 584 patients assessed for eligibility, 130 were excluded, primarily [81 (13.9%)] because control viral load decreased below 1000&#x0200a;copies/ml after adherence support.

In the subgroup of patients with baseline viral load at least 100&#x0200a;000&#x0200a;copies/ml, the proportion of participants with viral load below 50&#x0200a;copies/ml at week 48 was only 46 of 122 (37.7%) compared to 248 of 329 (75.4%) for those with lower viral load (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003c;&#x0200a;0.001), making high viral load the most important prognostic factor for successful second-line treatment (Supplementary Table S2). In this population, patients in the DRV group had the worst results [10/44 (22.7%) with viral load &#x0003c;50&#x0200a;copies/ml]. Compared with patients with baseline viral load below 100&#x0200a;000&#x0200a;copies/ml (Supplementary Table S3), the 122 with baseline viral load at least 100&#x0200a;000&#x0200a;copies/ml were significantly more often men [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.9, 95% CI 1.1&#x02013;3.2], had lower CD4<sup>+</sup> cell counts (aOR 1.9, 95% CI 1.1&#x02013;3.2) and had more often virus with intermediate-high resistance to two drugs of their second-line combination (aOR 4.7, 95% CI 2.6&#x02013;8.5), but were not less adherent during the study (adherence was 94 versus 92% in the group with viral load above or below 100&#x0200a;000&#x0200a;copies/ml at baseline, respectively; <italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.34). During the 48 weeks, 5 of the 451 patients had virological failure (confirmed viral load &#x0003e;1000&#x0200a;copies/ml). Resistance testing was performed and compared with genotype at baseline: no protease inhibitor resistance or change in NRTI mutations were detected (data not shown). Median gain in CD4<sup>+</sup> at week 48 was 127&#x0200a;cells/&#x003bc;l (IQR 72&#x02013;203) with no significant differences across groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical outcomes and safety</title><p>Eighty-seven HIV-related events occurred in 70 (16%) participants (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>), mainly in the first 3 months after second-line initiation: only two were stage 4 (extra-pulmonary tuberculosis). Six (1%) patients died during the 48 weeks. One died from liver cancer and another from severe tuberculosis (TB). The other four patients died at home of unknown causes (two were on the ABC/ddI arm, but the short treatment duration before death &#x02013; 3 to 4 days &#x02013; excluded an ABC hyper-sensibility reaction). Grade 3 or 4 adverse events occurred in 58 (13%) patients, with no difference between groups (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). Only five patients stopped assigned treatment because of adverse events: one for suspected ABC reaction (not confirmed by the expert review committee), one in DRV group for severe kidney failure not related to study drug, two for progressive neuropathy on ddI in patients with pre-existent stavudine-related neuropathic pain and one patient requesting to reduce pill burden (ABC/ddI group on TB treatment).</p><p>Gastrointestinal complaints were common and significantly different between the DRV/r and the LPV/r groups [26 (17%) versus 48 and 50 (33%); <italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.001]. Twenty-four (5%) participants reported symptoms of neuropathy, mainly from baseline: 11 were in ABC/ddI group. No statistically significant differences were recorded across groups for liver and kidney toxicity: only one patient had increased alanine aminotransferase (&#x0003e;5&#x0200a;&#x000d7;&#x0200a;upper limit of normal). Sixty-one (14%) participants experienced a 25% decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR &#x02013; Cockcroft&#x02013;Gault formula) between baseline and week 48, with a higher frequency in those taking TDF. Globally, adherence was good throughout the study, with only 29 of 439 (7%) having a score at questionnaire of less than 80% at least once between inclusion and week 48 (Supplementary Table S4).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>WHO's preferred strategy for second-line ART, based on two NRTIs + bPI combination, when NNRTI-containing regimens are used in first line, has been validated in recent clinical trials [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], but evidence for the choice of combinations is deemed of low quality and is derived from settings in high-resource countries [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>The 2LADY study aimed at providing more evidence for the choice of NRTIs and bPI for second-line ART in RLS settings. The study was conducted in field conditions very similar to those of national programmes, with late diagnosis of first-line ART failure and no resistance testing to inform decisions about drug choice. Importantly, in our study, patients were selected after a confirmed virological failure following an adherence intervention, as recommended by the WHO. Accordingly, retrospective genotypic testing showed that 95% of the participants had a virus resistant to at least two first-line drugs.</p><p>Until recently, data on second-line treatment efficacy had mainly been based on observational retrospective cohorts in multiple settings, with diverse populations, follow-up durations and viral load thresholds. Reported success rates varied from 65 to 86% [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Different factors associated with second-line efficacy had been identified and were mainly adherence [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] or accumulation of mutations due to late diagnosis of failure [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Recently, two clinical trials [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], testing the combination of an integrase inhibitor (raltegravir) + boosted LPV versus the standard WHO recommendation, validated the WHO choice with response rate of 70.5 and 75%, respectively, for viral load below 50&#x0200a;copies/ml, showing that the alternative combination was not superior to NRTI + LPV/r. Monotherapy with bPI was also less efficacious than the combination with NRTI in two trials [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>In our study, we observed a response rate of 65.2% for the protocol-defined primary endpoint of viral load below 50&#x0200a;copies/ml at week 48, failing to demonstrate non-inferiority of the tested regimens to the standard WHO 2013 recommended second line, therefore confirming once more WHO choice as a valid option.</p><p>Globally, at week 48, 83.2% of enrolled patients had a viral load below 200&#x0200a;copies/ml. We thus showed that bPI-based regimens provide satisfactory results in bPI-naive patients even with NRTI-resistant viral strains.</p><p>Moreover, we observed good immune recovery and reassuring results of safety and tolerance for all three regimens, with very few interruptions or adverse events due to drug toxicity. Nevertheless, the worst toxic profile (especially neuropathy) and more complicated schedule of the combination with ABC/ddI with no advantages in terms of efficacy argue for its elimination from the WHO recommendations.</p><p>The three regimens shared comparable efficacy for viral load thresholds of 200 and 1000&#x0200a;copies/ml, suggesting that the efficacy of the combination is independent from the choice of regimen and the presence of resistance to NRTI [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In fact, despite differences in adherence (the DRV group having a significantly better score than the ABC/ddI group, but not the control group despite the once-daily regimen) and in resistances to one or two drugs of the second-line combination, response rate to treatment was similar among arms.</p><p>For patients with baseline viral load at least 100&#x0200a;000&#x0200a;copies/ml, we, however, observed a suboptimal response despite no difference in adherence during the study. In multivariate analysis, viral load at least 100&#x0200a;000&#x0200a;copies/ml at baseline was associated with the presence of mutations, conferring intermediate-high resistance to two drugs of the second-line combination (aOR 4.7, 95% CI 2.6&#x02013;8.5) (Supplementary Table S3). This may suggest that patients with more mutations have been longer on failing first-line treatment and had uncontrolled viral replication with high viral load at baseline and worst results therefore on the long run, which may be partly explained by a higher frequency of resistance to backbone in this group. For the TDF/FTC + DRV/r combination, we observed a lower response (22.7%) at the 50&#x0200a;copies/ml threshold. Our patient population differed from those of other trials using DRV-based regimens [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. We may hypothesize that once-daily dose of 800/100&#x0200a;mg might be insufficient for patients with partially active triple therapy, despite results from the Once-daily Darunavir in Treatment-experienced Patients (ODIN) trial which showed non-inferiority of once-daily to twice-daily doses [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], irrespective of viral load thresholds at baseline or number of active NRTI in the backbone [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In addition, we could not verify the actual intake with food assuring therapeutic blood concentrations. These results suggest that use of DRV/r could in fact be more strategic in third line due to the residual activity of this drug on protease inhibitor-resistant viral strains with no advantages in second line.</p><p>Patients with high viral load at switch are at high risk of early failure and may deserve special strategies: to note that both clinical trials testing combinations with raltegravir [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] showed a trend towards a better response in patients with high viral load using raltegravir than NRTI in combination with bPI.</p><p>Our study has some limitations as the open-label design may have introduced bias and the random imbalance at baseline in group characteristics could have complicated interpretations. We could not show non-inferiority of alternative regimens, but we believe our findings are influenced by the over-optimistic working hypothesis of 80% viral success (50&#x0200a;copies/ml) for the standard regimen which was not reached (69% in the control group). Therefore, the study power was reduced (80%).</p><p>The study includes populations representative of those followed in National HIV Programmes in Africa where viral load monitoring and genotyping are not readily available in routine care. Therefore, we believe that the results can be applied to other settings with these constraints and provide critical information for second-line strategies in different RLS. The results appear reliable, as very few patients were lost to follow-up, and randomization sequence was concealed from study personnel.</p><p>Finally, although results about second-line regimen efficacy are, for the moment, reassuring, our results suggest that patients with high viral load at first-line failure may need special management to avoid early second-line failure. Additional studies are requested to define an approach compatible with public health and programmes&#x02019; constrains, but ensuring to those patients a second line of long duration.</p></sec><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Authors&#x02019; contribution: L.C., S.K.S., A.S., C.T.N. and E.D. contributed to the conception and design of the study, overviewed the conduct of the project and participated in the interpretation of the data and critical revision of the manuscript.
