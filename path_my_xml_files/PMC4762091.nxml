<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p><p>The presence and extent of ethnic inequalities in childhood obesity in the UK are hard to determine given the lack of consensus from previous studies,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> probably due to the different measures used and the possible inappropriateness of standard BMI cut-offs in SA. Nightingale <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> found that British SA children had a higher body fat percentage and higher combined skinfold thickness (mainly due to higher trunk skinfold) despite having lower BMI and a lower waist circumference compared to British white children in England. These findings are consistent with studies using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) as a measure of adiposity.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Sex differences in adiposity are also apparent with studies showing a higher percentage of body fat<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> and skinfold thickness in infant British SA girls<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> compared to boys. Despite the increased propensity for central obesity and cardiometabolic disease, intervention studies aimed at reducing adiposity in SA children are lacking.</p><p>The Birmingham healthy Eating and Active lifestyle for CHildren Study (BEACHeS) developed an obesity prevention programme tailored for children of SA origin at 5&#x02013;7&#x02005;years of age, and included a feasibility study to inform a subsequent trial of the intervention. The clinical and cost-effectiveness of the intervention programme is now being evaluated in the West Midlands ActiVe lifestyle and healthy Eating in School children study (WAVES),<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> a cluster randomised controlled trial which includes 54 schools. With the exception of the ongoing WAVES trial and the developmental DiEt and Active Living (DEAL) study,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> the BEACHeS study is the only known obesity intervention in SA children in the UK.</p><p>We examined several standard anthropometric measures including skinfold thickness to explore adiposity and response to this obesity prevention intervention in Pakistani and Bangladeshi children by sex.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study population</title><p>The methods and main results of the BEACHeS study and intervention are published in detail.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14&#x02013;16</xref> Eight Birmingham primary schools with high percentages of SA children were selected. Parents/guardians of each child received a letter distributed through the schools. Our study enrolled 574 school children aged 5&#x02013;7&#x02005;years old (school years 1 and 2) with the verbal and written consent of their parents. Baseline data were collected between December 2006 and June 2007 and follow-up data between November 2008 and June 2009. Schools were matched by size and proportion of children eligible for free school meals, and then assigned to either control or intervention status after taking account of the geographical location, in order to minimise contamination between schools. The intervention programme was delivered in four schools over 1&#x02005;year.</p><p>The intervention programme included both dietary and physical activity components, targeting children and their families. These included family cooking workshops and a range of additional physical activity opportunities within and outside of school, all delivered to varying degrees by each school.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> A key feature of the intervention development process was the involvement of family, school and community stakeholders, to enable identification of theoretical pathways to behaviour change and relevant barriers and facilitators to achieving these changes. This informed the design and delivery of the intervention programme.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> This local stakeholder involvement helped to build an intervention programme that considered the sociocultural and religious context of these communities, and included flexibility in delivery so that intervention components could be adapted by families and schools according to their needs, while delivering the same objectives. For example, while the cooking workshops included the same basic messages around healthy eating, the sample recipes and types of foods discussed varied according to the ethnic mix of those attending. Similarly, schools were provided with a wide range of materials to deliver structured physical activity opportunities during the school day, but were given flexibility in terms of which materials to use and when and how to deliver these.</p><p>Child ethnicity was reported by parents and was obtained from the school records. Children were mainly of SA origin (67% Pakistani, 14% Bangladeshi, 5% Indian) with a few from black (8%), white (2%) and other ethnic (4%) backgrounds. We restricted this analysis to Pakistani and Bangladeshi children who were found to be similar in terms of demographic and anthropometric characteristics. Collectively, they formed 81% of the BEACHeS study population.</p><p>The population analysed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2015007907F1">figure 1</xref>) comprises 384 Pakistani (82%) and 82 Bangladeshi (18%) children (466 SA in total), of whom 236 (50.6%) were boys. Of these, 413 children (89%) had follow-up information with 101 boys and 118 girls in the control group and 102 boys and 92 girls in the intervention group. Follow-up data was not available for 33 boys and 20 girls, either because the children had left the school, or were absent on the follow-up measurement day.</p><fig id="BMJOPEN2015007907F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Flow diagram of the cohort selected for analysis. *Allocation matched on school size and percentage of children eligible for free school meals, and took account of geographical location to minimise contamination between schools.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen2015007907f01"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Measurements</title><p>Equipment for measurement was supplied by Harlow Printing Limited (South Shields, UK). Weight (kg) was taken using a standardised and medically approved Tanita Body Fat Monitor and height (cm) was measured using the Leicester Height Measure. Waist circumference (cm) was measured twice midway between the 10th rib and the iliac crest using a flexible non-stretchable tape measure (Seca 200 BMI body tape) and averaged. Biceps, triceps, subscapular, suprailiac and thigh skinfold thickness measurements (mm) were taken twice using Holtain skin-fold callipers (four times if the difference between the first measurements was greater than 0.4&#x02005;mm) and averaged for analysis. All measurements were taken by trained researchers following standardised measurement protocols developed for the study (available on request).</p><p>BMI was calculated using weight (kg) divided by the squared height (m<sup>2</sup>). BMI SD-scores were derived using the sex-age-specific British 1990 Growth data reference with LMS Growth using Cole's method.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>
<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> The measure of central skinfold was a summation of subscapular and suprailiac skinfold measurements. The measure of peripheral skinfold was a summation of biceps, triceps and thigh skinfold measurements. The measure of total skinfold summed the five skinfold measurements. Central-to-peripheral ratio and waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) were also calculated.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Data analysis was conducted using SAS V.9.3 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, North Carolina, USA).</p><p>Descriptive statistics on age, ethnicity, language and religion by sex were calculated to show the demographic profile of the population at baseline and follow-up.</p><p>For anthropometric measures, mean and SD or median and IQR [q1,q3] were provided depending on the underlying distribution (normality). It is usually appropriate to log-transform non-normally distributed anthropometric measures and use the Edwards transformation for skinfold measures;<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> however, our data did not reach normality even after log and Edwards transformations. According to normality distribution, two-sample independent t tests or the non-parametric Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney two-sample rank sum tests were performed to determine sex differences in adiposity at baseline and at follow-up, separately in the control and intervention arms.</p><p>Differences between follow-up and baseline measures were calculated. As none were normally distributed, median and IQRs were presented and the non-parametric test was performed to compare changes in adipose measures between the intervention and the control group in boys and in girls. Using a second approach, we analysed the differences in adiposity gain by sex and intervention group and their interaction with linear regressions. The results (not reported) confirmed the observed patterns and are available on request.</p><table-wrap id="BMJOPEN2015007907TB4" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table&#x000a0;4</label><caption><p>Differences in anthropometric gain from baseline to follow-up between the control and intervention arms in boys and in girls</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/></colgroup><thead valign="bottom"><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="left" colspan="5" rowspan="1">Gain in boys<hr/></th><th align="left" colspan="5" rowspan="1">Gain in girls<hr/></th></tr><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Control<hr/></th><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Intervention<hr/></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Control<hr/></th><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Intervention<hr/></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Statistics</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x00394;

Sex differences in central-to-peripheral skinfold ratio increased from baseline in the control group due to a larger increase in girls but remained in the same range in the intervention group.</p><table-wrap id="BMJOPEN2015007907TB3" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table&#x000a0;3</label><caption><p>Differences in anthropometric measures between boys and girls at follow-up (separately in control and intervention arms)</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/></colgroup><thead valign="bottom"><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="left" colspan="5" rowspan="1">Control<hr/></th><th align="left" colspan="5" rowspan="1">Intervention<hr/></th></tr><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Boys<hr/></th><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Girls<hr/></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Boys<hr/></th><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Girls<hr/></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Statistics</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mean (SD)*</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mean (SD)*</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mean (SD)*</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mean (SD)*</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Variable</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">N</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Median [q1;

However, our findings are consistent with previous work demonstrating the inability of BMI to reveal subgroup differences in adiposity. Shaw <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> showed ethnic and gender differences in percentage body fat measured by DXA in British school children as young as 5&#x02005;years of age. SA children had the highest proportion of body fat (&#x0003e;25%) and girls in each ethnic group had a higher proportion than boys which BMI did not detect. Similarly, Bansal <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> showed that SA girls had more adiposity at birth than boys with higher skinfold thickness. In a UK study, Nightingale <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> found higher adiposity measured by sum of skinfolds and bioimpedence in SA children aged 9&#x02013;10 compared to white Europeans, but lower BMI in SA. In 7&#x02013;10-year-old British children, Henderson <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> found subscapular skinfold thickness to be higher in British Pakistani children compared to their white counterpart as well as higher triceps skinfold thickness after controlling for BMI but there was no difference in BMI. This study, together with previous research evidence, suggests that measures of skinfold thickness have more value than BMI when evaluating adiposity in SA children and may be more discriminating in terms of detecting ethnic and sex differences in response to intervention.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, there are no similar intervention studies focusing on South Asian children. However, several childhood obesity prevention studies have reported sex differences in response to intervention. A meta-analysis of school-based interventions to reduce BMI found a significant BMI reduction in girls but not in boys.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Gortmaker <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> reported a positive effect of a curricular intervention targeting diet and physical activity on obesity prevalence in girls but not boys. Similarly, Mo-Suwan <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> reported an exercise intervention had the effect of preventing BMI gain in girls but not boys. Lazaar <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> reported similar findings, showing a greater effect of a physical activity intervention targeting children aged 6&#x02013;10&#x02005;years on skinfold thickness and waist circumference in girls compared to boys. In contrast to these studies, Sallis <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> found a gender difference in response to a combined dietary and physical activity intervention in the opposite direction and suggested that girls may need an effective intervention combining physical activity opportunities, health promotion and education. While several studies have considered differential intervention effects by sex, most obesity prevention studies do not consider subgroup effects,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> which may lead to missed opportunities for tailoring interventions during implementation. The effect of the BEACHeS intervention on girls but not boys fits with previous findings and may be due to the adherence of girls to specific components. This finding will be explored in the ongoing WAVES trial.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Limitations of this study</title><p>The analysis of sex differences in adiposity and response to the BEACHeS intervention was a secondary analysis. The BEACHeS study was a phase II feasibility study designed to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention components and techniques. As such, this was not a randomised trial and did not aim to detect statistical differences in end outcome between intervention and control arms. Furthermore, as allocation to intervention and control arms was not random, imbalance between groups may have biased the results. We tried to minimise this through matching of schools prior to allocation. Individual exposure to each intervention component was not assessed. Our findings are context specific and our sample may not be representative of other SA populations. There was a lack of statistical power to analyse sex differences in adiposity in other ethnic groups.</p><p>This study assessed adiposity differences using BMI, waist circumference and skinfold measures, the latter being specifically useful to look at body fat distribution and central fat in SAs. However, an exact body fat percentage was not measured. DXA has been shown to be a precise measurement but concerns have also been raised about its validity as a gold standard to measure body fat composition.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> DXA is also expensive, logistically difficult with children recruited through schools (outside of the health service) and potentially seen as invasive and harmful (due to radiation) by parents, despite the fact that the radiation exposure from a DXA is less than 1/10th that of a chest X-ray.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our study suggests that a tailored obesity intervention can reduce central and overall adiposity in British Pakistani and Bangladeshi schoolgirls and highlights the need for inclusion of measures of fat and fat distribution in addition to BMI in the assessment of adiposity in these groups. This emphasises the need for both the development of culturally acceptable components of an obesity prevention programme and the use of appropriate measures of fat composition. Our findings need corroboration and further research is required to identify which intervention component may lead to differential effect in SA boys and girls adiposity levels. As a result of our analysis, the on-going WAVES trial<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> will now include analysis by sex to provide further evidence.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The Birmingham healthy Eating, Active lifestyle for Children Study (BEACHeS) is funded by the National Prevention Research Initiative (NPRI, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.npri.org.uk">http://www.npri.org.uk</ext-link>) and the authors are grateful to all the funding partners for their support: British Heart Foundation; Cancer Research UK; Department of Health; Diabetes UK; Economic and Social Research Council; Medical Research Council; Research and Development Office for the Northern Ireland Health and Social Services; Chief Scientist Office, Scottish Executive Health Department; Welsh Assembly Government and World Cancer Research Fund.
