This was a randomized, observer-blinded, 2-arm, controlled, multicenter phase III study performed in Thailand to assess and describe the immunogenicity and safety of PPV23 as a booster dose in children who had received the 3 primary doses of PCV7, the pneumococcal vaccine available during the study period. Children primed with 3 doses of PCV7 were randomized 1:1 to receive a booster immunization with PPV23 or PCV7. Pneumococcal antibody concentrations were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and functional antibody levels by multiplex opsonophagocytosis assay on day 30. A total of 339 children were enrolled. Geometric mean serum antibody concentrations against serotypes common to PCV7 and PPV23 (4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, and 23F) increased in both groups but they were higher for serotypes 4, 9V, 18C, and 19F in the PPV23 group. Opsonization indices increased in both groups for all measured serotypes (1, 6B, 14, 19A, and 23F) and were higher for serotypes 6B, 14, and 23F in the PCV7 group and for serotypes 1 and 19A in PPV23 group. Solicited reactions and unsolicited adverse events were similar in the 2 groups and generally mild and transient. No treatment-related serious adverse events were reported. These results confirm that boosting with PPV23 is immunogenic and well tolerated in healthy toddlers primed with PCV7.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><title>Keywords: </title><kwd>23-valent pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide vaccine</kwd><kwd>booster</kwd><kwd>clinical trial</kwd><kwd>heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine</kwd><kwd>immunization</kwd><kwd>infant</kwd><kwd>phase III</kwd><kwd>pneumococcal vaccines</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Pneumococcal disease is the leading cause of death in children under the age of 5 y.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> Every year, children less than 5 y of age suffer from an estimated 14.5 million episodes of serious pneumococcal disease and 826&#x02009;000 pneumococcal-related deaths, which accounted for 11% of all deaths in this age group.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> This continues to be a significant problem in developing countries where approximately 90% children less than 5 y of age live.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref></p><p>Treatment of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> with antibiotics has greatly reduced mortality due to pneumococcal disease, but antibiotic overuse has resulted in the emergence of resistant strains; therefore, vaccines are considered an important way of limiting the impact of pneumococcal disease.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> Prevnar<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (Pfizer, formerly Wyeth Ltd.), a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV), is the most widely used.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> The heptavalent version of Prevnar (PCV7), available since 2000, contains CRM<sub>197</sub> diphtheria toxin-conjugated polysaccharides from serotypes 4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, and 23F.

We showed that boosting with PPV23 can increase serum pneumococcal antibody concentrations and functional antibody titers against certain PCV7 and non-PCV7 serotypes as much as or more than boosting by PCV7.

Despite this, functional antibody responses were induced in the PPV23 group even to serotypes for which the children had not been primed. We also found that boosting with PCV7 induced both ELISA and MOPA responses to serotype 19A, which is not included in PCV7.
