Although crying is a common spontaneous behavior, it can induce parental concern, which often results in requests for assistance from health services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Most infants follow a universal crying pattern during the first few months of life, in which crying peaks at 6&#x000a0;weeks of age and then declines until 3&#x000a0;months of age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Crying also has a typical diurnal pattern: 40% of crying episodes occur between 1600 and 2200&#x000a0;h, and after the third month of life, crying episodes are more distributed throughout the day. Infant crying is usually believed to be related to abdominal discomfort, whereas crying for more than 3&#x000a0;hours per day (cumulative), without relation to a medical problem, is termed infantile colic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The prevalence of abdominal discomfort, colic, and their associated potential effects demonstrates the importance of identifying determinants of infant crying behavior, particularly for determinants that can be modified (e.g., feeding choice) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>Human milk is the optimal choice for the vast majority of infants. In human breast milk and most infant formulas, approximately 50% of the dietary calories come from fat, with more than 98% in the form of triglycerides (TGs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Infants easily absorb human milk fat despite its high content of saturated fatty acids (45% of total fatty acids), primarily palmitic acid (C16:0), of which 70-75% is esterified at the sn-2 (beta) position of the TG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. This configuration is characterized by a unique, highly specific, positional distribution on the glycerol backbone observed only in TG synthesis in the mammary gland [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Studies have shown that palmitic acid is absorbed from human milk as an sn-2 monoacylglycerol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and is conserved in that form through digestion, absorption, and chylomicron triacylglycerol synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In contrast, palmitic acid, which is present in the vegetable oils that are commonly used in the manufacturing of infant formulas, is mainly (&#x0003e;80%) esterified to the sn-1 and sn-3 positions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and is therefore poorly absorbed by an infant&#x02019;s intestine. The main cause of this low absorption is the high tendency of palmitic acid esterified at the sn-1 and sn-3 positions to create complexes with dietary minerals, such as calcium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. These complexes, known as fatty acid soaps, are insoluble, indigestible, and positively related to stool hardness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The formation of calcium soaps may partly explain the substantial differences in bowel habits and stool consistency between breast- and formula-fed infants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>The goal of this study was to compare the effects of high-sn-2 palmitate (beta-palmitate) and low-sn-2 palmitate formulas on infant crying patterns and stool characteristics. We hypothesized that infants who consumed high beta-palmitate formula would demonstrate reduced crying and more frequent, softer stools compared to infants consuming low beta-palmitate formula.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Subjects and study design</title><p>The study was a single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Healthy term infants whose weights were appropriate for gestational age (AGA) were eligible for the study. Infants were excluded from the study if they had been diagnosed with congenital, chromosomal, or metabolic disorders. Subjects were enrolled within their first 2&#x000a0;weeks of life to one of two formula groups if their mother made an unequivocal decision not to breastfeed or to a matched reference group of term breastfed infants. Parents provided written informed consent prior to enrollment. Formula-fed infants were randomly assigned (using a computerized automatic randomization system) to receive either (1) formula with a high level of beta-palmitate (HBP group) consisting of 44% of palmitic acids esterified at the midpoint position of the glycerol backbone (INFAT&#x000ae;, Advanced Lipids) or (2) a regular infant formula (LBP Control group) with a standard vegetable oil mix consisting of 14% of palmitic acids esterified to the midpoint position of the glycerol backbone. Both of the preparations were commercial formulas produced by Materna Laboratories (Maabarot, Israel) under the same conditions using minerals and vitamins from the same batches, resulting in formulas that were identical except for their fatty acid structural distribution. Formulas were packed in identical and unmarked boxes, and the personnel caring for the infants and mothers were blinded to their contents. The formulas did not contain pre- or probiotic components.</p><p>This study was conducted according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and good clinical practice. The protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of Meir Medical Center, Kfar-Saba, Israel, and by the Israeli Ministry of Health.</p></sec><sec><title>Anthropometric measurements</title><p>Anthropometric measurements, performed at birth and at 6 and 12&#x000a0;weeks, by a trained technician (who was blinded to the study group assignment) included the following:</p><p>Body Weight: the mean of three measurements on an electronic infant scale (Model 20 Tabletop Infant Scale, Olympic Medical, Seattle, WA).</p><p>Body Length: the mean of two measurements of recumbent crown-heel length on a length board (O&#x02019;Leary Premier Length Board, Ellard Instrumentation Ltd., Monroe, WA) to the nearest 0.1&#x000a0;cm.</p><p>Head Circumference: fronto-occipital head circumference measured with a standard 1-cm wide measuring tape to the nearest 0.1&#x000a0;cm.</p></sec><sec><title>Parent questionnaires</title><p>Data on crying and stool characteristics were reported by the parents, who used 24-hr behavior diaries for 3&#x000a0;days before the infants&#x02019; 6- and 12-week visits. The reports also included (1) the volume of formula used in feedings and (2) stool characteristics, including color (yellow, green, brown, and black), frequency and consistency (hard, mushy, or watery). Crying episodes of more than 5&#x000a0;minutes were reported. The parents reported the duration, time of the day, and their assumption of what caused the crying. The mean number of crying periods per day, the mean crying duration per day, and the pattern of crying during the day were calculated. The pattern of crying during the day was analyzed at 6 and 12&#x000a0;weeks by calculating the percentage of crying infants and the total length of crying during each 6-hour period of the day, where morning&#x02009;=&#x02009;6&#x000a0;am&#x02013;noon, afternoon&#x02009;=&#x02009;noon&#x02013;6&#x000a0;pm, evening&#x02009;=&#x02009;6&#x000a0;pm&#x02013;midnight, and night&#x02009;=&#x02009;midnight&#x02013;6&#x000a0;am.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The baseline characteristics of the mothers and infants in the HBP and LBP formula groups were compared with pairwise <italic>t</italic>-tests for scale outcomes and pairwise chi-square tests for nominal outcomes.

The crying duration and patterns in the HBP group were comparable to those of breastfed infants, and the percentage of crying infants was significantly lower in the HBP group than in the LBP group during the evening and night hours.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that the daily duration of crying and fussing in infants increases until 6&#x000a0;weeks of age and then decreases progressively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Our study showed similar peaks of daily crying at 6&#x000a0;weeks for all groups. Harrison et al. found a 50% reduction in daily crying duration from 6 to 12&#x000a0;weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]; however, in their study, the type of feeding was not specified. Our study revealed a similar reduction in daily crying duration, both in the BF group (50%) and the HBP group (80%).

We also observed this peak in this study for all three groups; however, we found that infants in the HBP group cried less during the afternoon and evening hours and had significantly greater reductions in crying duration in the afternoon between 6 and 12&#x000a0;weeks postnatal.</p><p>The effects of breastfeeding versus formula feeding on infant crying are controversial. Many studies support breastfeeding as an effective method of calming infants due to its emotional impacts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Kennedy et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] monitored crying duration in infants who consumed formula containing high versus low levels of beta-palmitate. In contrast to our study, they did not find differences in crying between the groups. Savino et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] evaluated the efficacy of formula that was partially hydrolyzed with prebiotic oligosaccharides (OSs) and contained a high level of beta palmitate. The authors found significant differences in crying that were primarily due to a significant reduction in the afternoon crying duration between 6 and 12&#x000a0;weeks postnatal. In their study, however, the formulas contained several different components (partially hydrolyzed whey proteins, prebiotic OSs, and beta palmitate); therefore, the relative contribution of the HBP component could not be determined.</p><p>Crying behavior in infants is a complex phenomenon that includes spontaneous "endogenous" crying and &#x0201c;distress-related&#x0201d; crying, which can be linked to separation, hunger, or other physical distresses; therefore, several mechanisms can explain the positive effect of HBP on crying. One mechanism can be attributed to the effect that HBP has on stool characteristics. In this study, HBP-fed infants demonstrated more favorable stool characteristics than LBP-fed infants at 12&#x000a0;weeks. Improvement of stool characteristics is one of the well-known benefits of beta-palmitate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. In a previous study, we showed that high beta-palmitate formula beneficially affected infant gut microbiota by increasing the lactobacillus and bifidobacteria counts in stools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. This is another possible mechanism because changes in gut microflora induced by probiotic supplementation likely improve infant colic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>Animal studies suggest that diet can alter endogenous crying by modifying neuro-endocrine metabolism in the gut (e.g., through the endocannabinoid system, which is associated with a variety of functions, including pain and circadian rhythm). Using a rat model, Banni et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] showed that a diet rich in beta-palmitate led to higher efficiency and enhanced endocannabinoid biosynthesis.</p><p>One possible limitation of our study is that we relied on the parents to record crying measurements. Parent diaries of infant crying have become the standard and most widely used tool for studying infant crying [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]; however, this method is still subjective and requires a high degree of parental cooperation. In this study, this limitation was partially overcome by the double-blind nature of our study. We were also limited in this study because crying is known to be highly affected by an infant&#x02019;s temperament [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], which could have biased our results. We could not, however, overcome this limitation because we did not assess the temperaments of the infants included in this study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our study indicates that high beta-palmitate (sn-2 palmitate) formula affects infant crying patterns during the first weeks of life.
