Health Belief Model is recommended for nutrition education to increase the impact of educational programs.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref> A major feature of this model holds that the patients have choices and are able to make suitable decisions regarding their health. This model suggests that whether or not individuals take action to protect their health depends on whether they believe that they are susceptible to an ill health condition; that the occurrence of that condition would have serious consequences; and that they have a course of action to avoid the condition and benefits of taking the action outweigh the costs.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></p><p>The components of this model are perceived as severity, susceptibility, threatened, benefits and barriers.

To control potential confounding factors, the two groups were matched. Inclusion criteria included age of 30 to 60 years, not to be illiterate, at least one year attendance in Iranian Diabetes Association seminars, regular followups and no sever and chronic complications of diabetes. Those patients who were not willing to participate or continue the study were excluded. The intervention was consisted of two educational sessions, each 80 minutes. Data were collected using a questionnaire with 58 questions in four sections including demographic data, nutritional knowledge, health belief models components, and nutritional practice. Validity and reliability of the questionnaire was assessed by the standard methods (the details will be reported in a forthcoming paper) .</p><p>The questionnaire was completed before and after intervention.

One month after intervention, patients were evaluated by completing the questionnaire. The knowledge section consisted of questions about dietary planning, energy intake, number of meals, and some information about healthy food for diabetic patients. Practice was assessed by food records. The components of HBM were perceived as severity, susceptibility, threatened, benefits and barriers. Data were analyzed by SPSS (version 13.0, Chicago IL). Student's t test was used to compare the values between the two groups before and after intervention. The mean differences of variables were compared by paired t test.
