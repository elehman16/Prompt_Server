It is induced by chronic inflammatory lesions caused under the repeated actions of pathogenic factors such as microorganism, drugs and bile regurgitation on gastric mucosa epithelium. Its clinical symptoms include dyspepsia, stomachache, bloating, belching, nausea and emesis, which can produce severe impacts on the physical and psychological health and living quality.<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Epidemiological investigations demonstrated that, CSG had the highest incidence among all gastrointestinal diseases, which was 51.7%~85.45% that of chronic gastritis; the incidence increased with the increase of age; it might evolve to atrophic gastritis or gastric carcinoma if it was not treated timely.<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>-<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Thus, the early treatment of CSG and the inhibition of disease progress are meaningful to the prevention of gastric mucosa diseases.</p><p>A clinical trial<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> demonstrated that, 50%~80% of patients who developed CSG had helicobacter pylori infection. Thus based on the onset mechanisms of chronic gastritis and relevant research data, the key treatment for CSG is to control helicobacter pylori infection and inhibiting excessive secretion of gastric acid. Currently, treating CSG with omeprazole has been a common therapy in clinics. Omeprazole as a proton pump inhibitor can produce selective effect on gastric mucosa wall cells, effectively inhibit tubular bubble inside cytoplasm and the activity of enzymes secreted by gastric wall cells, and finally inhibit the secretion of gastric acid; however, its effect is not quite satisfactory.<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> A recent study<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> indicated that, omeprazole in combination with domperidone was highly effective in treating CSG; but it has not been clarified clearly. To further clarify the effectiveness of the therapy, this study treated CSG patients with omeprazole in combination with domperidone, aiming to provide a scientific basis for clinical medication.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><p>Ninety-six patients with CSG who received treatment in the Binzhou People&#x02019;s Hospital from July 2013 to July 2015 and conformed to relevant diagnostic criteria were selected as research subjects. All of them were diagnosed by gastroscopic examination and pathological changes. They were divided into a control group and a test group using randomized double-blind method, 48 in each group. In the control group, there were 30 males and 18 females, with an average age of 42.8&#x000b1;2.7 years (14~82 years) and an average disease course of 1.2&#x000b1;0.2 years (2~13 months). In the test group, there were 27 females and 21 males, with an average age of 42.7&#x000b1;2.6 years (15~82 years old) and an average disease course of 1.4&#x000b1;0.4 years (2~11 months). The general data of patients in the two groups including gender, disease course and age had no remarkable difference (P&#x0003e;0.05); thus the results were comparable. All the patients were observed with dyspepsia and digestive system disorders. They had signed informed consent. They were forbidden to take other treatment drugs two weeks before this test. Patients with peptic ulcer or occupying lesions in digestive system were excluded.</p><p>Patients in the test group were treated by omeprazole (Actavis (Fushan) Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., Guangdong, China; batch no.: H10930087) and domperidone (Xian Yangsen Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., Shanxi; batch no.: H10910003). Domperidone was orally administrated in a dose of 10 mg each time 30 minutes before breakfast, lunch and supper; omeprazole was orally administrated in a dose of 20 mg each time in the morning and evening when patients were in the fasting state. Three weeks was regarded as one course.<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Patients in the control group orally took omeprazole, 20 mg each time in the morning and evening when patients were in the fasting state. The treatment lasted for three weeks. The patients were followed up and examined according to test procedures once each week after medication; the daily record of last week was recycled, and drugs that were needed in the next stage were issued to the patients.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Observation index</title><p>Scores for the symptoms such as swelling pain, burning sensation and sour regurgitation of the upper abdomen were observed and recorded. The determination criteria for symptom scores were as follows. Mild symptoms were determined as 1~3 points, medium as 4~7 points, and severe as 8~10 points. The patients made self-assessment using visual analogue scale (VAS). The response rate of the two groups was compared. The determination criteria for curative effects were as follows. The complete disappearance of clinical symptoms and the disappearance of gastric mucosa inflammation observed by gastroscope were determined as cured. Treatment was determined as markedly effective if the clinical symptoms were obviously relieved and most of gastric mucosa inflammation disappeared. Treatment was determined as effective if some clinical symptoms still remained but relieved compared to before treatment and mucosal lesions reduced for more than 50% under gastroscope. Treatment was considered as ineffective if the symptoms showed no improvement or even aggravated and inflammation was not relived. The overall response rate was the sum of cure rate, markedly effective rate and effective rate. The last one was the repair effect of gastric mucosa, i.e., score of chronic inflammation and score of active inflammation. Lower score indicated better repair effect.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data were processed by SPSS ver. 20.0.

CSG is induced by chronic inflammatory lesions on gastric mucosa epithelium under the stimulation of pathogenic factors. The main pathogenic factors of CSG include toxin, microorganism, bile regurgitation and drugs. The causes for pathogenic factors are complex; hence it is difficult to make accurate diagnosis during treatment, which leads to difficulty in the early prevention of CSG.<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> With the constant development of clinical medicine, drugs for treating CSG have increased, but clinical effects have large difference. Therefore, the key of its clinical treatment is to select safe and effective treatment drugs and methods.</p><p>In the occurrence of CSG, the erosion effect of gastric acid plays an important role. Omeprazole as a kind of white crystalline powder can reduce the activity of H<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup> and APT enzyme, inhibit the secretion of gastric acid and prevent bacterial infection by acting on gastric mucosal wall cells directly. Omeprazole can be distributed in the secretory tubules in gastric mucosal walls through blood circulation and block the secretion of gastric acid by inhibiting the activity of proton pump through combining with it.<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> In the process of gastric acid secretion inhibition, it can reduce the evacuation of drugs, improve drug utilization rate, and effectively relieve clinical symptoms of patients; hence it has been extensively applied in clinical treatment of chronic gastritis. In addition, omeprazole can combine with urease to inhibit the activity of urease and eliminate Hp by penetrating mucous layer and Hp surface.<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Therefore, it is frequently used to treat CG. However, a study<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> demonstrated that, omeprazole could be used for treating CSG, but its effect was not satisfactory. The results of this study demonstrated that, 12 cases out of the 48 cases in the control group showed no response to the treatment using omeprazole, with an efficacy rate of 75.00%, which was consistent with relevant research results.</p><p>Domperidone as a kind of peripheral dopamine receptor inhibitor can resist emesis. It will not produce bad effects on the central nervous system as it is difficult to enter the brain. Besides, it can selectively block dopamine 2 and mainly act on the peripheral nervous system.<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Domperidone can improve the power of digestive tract and promote gastric emptying.<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Compared to metoclopramide and cisapride, domperidone was safer and extensively applied. In the treatment of chronic gastritis cannot inhibit gastric acid and protect gastric mucosa. But omeprazole in combination with domperidone can give full play to the acid and helicobacter pylori inhibition effects of omeprazole as well as the emesis resistance and gastric emptying effect of domperidone. The two drugs can act on the different clinical symptoms of CSG, with remarkable effect and less reverse reactions. The results of this study demonstrated that, the overall effective rate of the test group was higher than that of the control group, and the difference had statistical significance (P&#x0003c;0.05). The scores of clinical symptoms such as swelling pain, burning sensation and sour regurgitation of the test group had better improvement compared to the control group; the gastric mucosa repair effect and the postoperative recurrence rate of the test group were both superior to those of the control group, and the difference was statistically significant (P&#x0003c;0.05). All the findings suggested, the combined therapy could significantly improve the clinical symptoms, repair gastric mucosa, and improve treatment effect, with a high safety.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>In conclusion, omeprazole in combination with domperidone was highly effective in treating CSG, with simple operation and high safety. It can accelerate cure and obviously relieve the clinical symptoms of patients. Hence it can be regarded as a preferred method for treating CSG in clinics.</p><sec id="sec2-7"><title>Authors&#x02019; Contribution</title><p><bold>FXW:</bold> Study design, data collection and
