Additionally, the acute hormonal responses to WBV exercise have not been extensively studied.</p><p>In the extensive resistance training literature, a bout of resistance exercise produces acute hormonal environment changes that are largely dependent on the resistance exercise parameters <xref rid="pone.0111521-Crewther1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0111521-Kraemer1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. The increases in the concentrations of hormones, such as testosterone and GH, are proportional to the recruited muscle volume relative to the exercise intensity <xref rid="pone.0111521-Kraemer1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Consequently, training principles have been constructed to maximize the post-exercise increase in these hormones based on the hypothesis that exercise-induced systemic hormone increases will influence or optimize functional performance gains in whole body skeletal muscle mass and strength adaptations <xref rid="pone.0111521-Ronnestad1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0111521-Schroeder1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. In this regard, the gravitational load has been increased to superimpose an additional external load during WBV to better stimulate the neuroendocrine system and maximize the post-exercise increases in testosterone and GH hormone concentrations <xref rid="pone.0111521-Giunta1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0111521-Giunta2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. However, the gravitational load was not defined with respect to the WBV responsiveness of the subjects. Therefore, an additive pulsatile GH secretion effect was attained in healthy females <xref rid="pone.0111521-Giunta1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> by combining WBV with an external load, but this effect was not detected in severely obese females <xref rid="pone.0111521-Giunta2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.</p><p>To date, no previous studies of the acute hormonal WBV response have examined the optimal combination of the acceleration load (hyper-gravity condition) and the posture assumed on the vibrating plate in an attempt to recruit a greater number of muscle fibers that would enable a greater hormone-tissue interaction within a relatively larger total muscle volume <xref rid="pone.0111521-Kraemer1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. During WBV, as the vibrating platform movement is sinusoidal, the acceleration load is quantified by calculating the acceleration transmitted to the body according to the following equation a&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;<bold><italic>A</italic></bold>(2&#x003c0;<italic>f</italic>)<sup>2</sup>
<xref rid="pone.0111521-Rittweger1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. In this equation, A represents the oscillation amplitude and f represents the frequency. The changes in the amplitude and/or the frequency therefore determine the acceleration and vibrational magnitude changes that are transmitted to the body.</p><p>Regarding posture or exercise on the vibrating plate, push-ups (isometric) can provide an adequate stimulus to acutely increase testosterone concentrations <xref rid="pone.0111521-Gyulai1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. This basic exercise could represent a potent physiological neuroendocrine system stressor because it involves a large muscle volume (trunk + upper arm + lower arm) <xref rid="pone.0111521-Tanaka1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Notably, many muscles of this volume require considerable muscle activation relative to their maximal isometric values <xref rid="pone.0111521-Freeman1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0111521-Youdas1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Additionally, by comparing the standing (half squat) and horizontal positions (similar to a push-up), the trunk muscles are more strongly activated in the horizontal position during WBV <xref rid="pone.0111521-Wirth1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.</p><sec id="s1a"><title>Hypotheses</title><p>Based on these previous findings, we hypothesized the following:</p><p>Vibration applied to the upper body induces pronounced hormonal and neuromuscular responses, and the magnitudes of the hormonal and neuromuscular responses are dependent on the acceleration load relative to the subjects' responsiveness.</p></sec><sec id="s1b"><title>Aim</title><p>The purpose of the present study was to determine the acute residual hormonal (GH and testosterone) and neuromuscular (maximal voluntary contraction, mechanical power, and EMG activity) responses following a single WBV bout superimposed on an isometric push-up using two different acceleration loads.

The participants were blinded to the study hypotheses, and the assessors were blinded to the group allocation. Among two hundred students within a sport sciences department, 30 male students elected to participate in this experiment after being informed of the procedures and potential risks involved in the study. The exclusion criteria included a history of back pain, acute inflammation in the pelvis and/or lower extremities, acute thrombosis, tumors, recent fractures, recent implants, gallstones, kidney or bladder stones, any disease of the spine, peripheral vascular disease, and severe delayed trunk and arm muscle soreness onset. All participants gave written informed consent. One investigator in the study (author's last name) enrolled the participants. The sample size for the primary outcomes was computed a priori based on the &#x003b1; (0.05), power (1-&#x003b2;; 0.90) and effect size values of previous studies <xref rid="pone.0111521-Bosco1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0111521-Giunta1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0111521-Gyulai1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> by means of a statistical software for power analysis (G*Power 3.1.9, Heinrich Heine-Dusseldorf University). The sample size computation was performed while taking into account the study design and using both parametric and nonparametric procedures. The participants were randomly assigned to a high-vibration group (HVG) (age: 25.0&#x000b1;0.9 years; weight: 73.0&#x000b1;2.9 kg; height: 177&#x000b1;2.1 cm; body mass index: 23.2&#x000b1;0.7 kg m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>; lean body mass: 57.8&#x000b1;1.8 kg), a low-vibration group (LVG) (age: 26.0&#x000b1;1.5 years; weight: 76.0&#x000b1;2.8 kg; height: 178&#x000b1;2.3 cm; body mass index: 23.7&#x000b1;0.6 kg m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>; lean body mass: 59.6&#x000b1;1.8 kg) or a control group (CG) (age: 24.0&#x000b1;0.8 years; weight: 75.7&#x000b1;2.9 kg; height: 178&#x000b1;2.1 cm; body mass index: 23.7&#x000b1;0.6 kg m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>; lean body mass: 59.3&#x000b1;1.82 kg). The lean body mass values were estimated using a semi-mechanistic model <xref rid="pone.0111521-Janmahasatian1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. The random allocation sequence was generated using an algorithm with equal allocation ratios, random sorting, and a maximum allowable deviation of 20%. The requirements for this algorithm were that each group had exactly 10 subjects and the maximum % deviation was no larger than 20% of the target sample size. The sequences were generated using statistical software (Pass 13-NCSS, LLC Kaysville, Utah 84037, USA). The Ethics Committee of the University of L'Aquila approved the study conducted between May and July 2012. The measurements and interventions were performed at the Laboratory of Biomechanics of the University of L'Aquila. The participants were healthy and recreationally active and all within similar fitness levels to reduce the possible influence on the hormonal serum changes. Similarly, the participants had to eliminate strength and endurance exercises from their training during the period of the experiment. Therefore, the training regimen was composed of only the physical activities (no strenuous exercises) performed in their sport sciences department. No participants reported drug or nutritional supplement ingestion known to interfere with GH and/or testosterone secretion.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Experimental day procedures</title><p>For each participant, the measurements were performed over a 2-day period to reduce any potential boredom and fatigue effects. Each test session began with a 15-min warm-up (6 min of treadmill running at a speed of 6 km h<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>; 4 min of stretching; conventional trunk, arm, and shoulder joint exercises; and five low-speed push-ups). The participants were introduced to the equipment and procedures during a familiarization period. On the first day, each participant performed maximal voluntary isometric contractions (MVC) during bench press and handgrip tests. The EMG activity, which was synchronized to these strength measurements, was also recorded. Then, the EMG activity was recorded during WBV to estimate the optimal acceleration load in relation to subject responsiveness. All measurements taken on the first day were thus performed to determine the vibrational load, which was normalized to each subject's MVCs. On the second day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111521-g001">Figure 1</xref>), baseline measurements (Pre) were taken, including blood sampling for hormones analyses, MVC synchronized to EMG activities and mechanical variables during the eccentric-concentric bench press test. Next, each subject was provided a treatment (specific to his assigned experimental group, see below), and EMG activities were recorded during the interventions. The measurements were repeated immediately after the treatments ended (Post1) and 1 hour after the treatment ended (Post 2). Blood was sampled also during Post 2 due to hormonal profile changes observed in a previous pilot study All measurements were performed at consistent times of day (4.00&#x02013;8.00 PM) to reduce the potential diurnal variation effect on hormone secretion and neuromuscular variables <xref rid="pone.0111521-Hayes1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.</p><fig id="pone-0111521-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0111521.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Experimental protocol of the study design.</title><p>

Blood samples were drawn into vacutainers from the antecubital forearm vein using a 20-gauge needle (without additives) for the total serum testosterone and GH concentration measurements. All samples were obtained with the subjects placed in a seated position in a climate-controlled environment (21&#x000b0;C). Whole blood was stored at 18&#x02013;25&#x000b0;C until a clot formed (15&#x02013;45 min); then, the blood was centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 5 min to obtain the serum specimen for future assays. The serum samples were stored at 2&#x02013;8&#x000b0;C and analyzed within 24 h. All samples were assayed in duplicate and were decoded only after the analyses were completed. The total testosterone and GH concentrations were determined using commercially available enzyme immunoassay kits (ST AIA-PACK 2000, Tosoh Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The testosterone and GH assay sensitivities were 0.07 ng/ml. The intra- and inter-assay variation coefficients were 3.3% and 3.7% for testosterone and 1.4% and 3.3% for GH, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s2b2"><title>Maximal voluntary isometric contraction</title><p>MVC was performed using a custom exercise rack in which the subjects were positioned in a supine isometric bench press position <xref rid="pone.0111521-Falvo1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. MVC was also measured on the dominant hand using a custom handgrip attached to a strain gauge (Ergotest-Innovation, Porsgrunn, Norway). The handgrip measurements were performed using a standardized method <xref rid="pone.0111521-Roberts1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. During MVC, following a 2-min warm-up period, the subjects performed a maximum of three attempts without a time constraint, and the final average value was calculated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111521.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Each warm-up and maximal attempt was separated by 1&#x02013;2 min of rest. The participants were instructed to contract their muscles as hard and fast as possible, and strong verbal encouragement was provided during each MVC attempt <xref rid="pone.0111521-Wilson1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. The intra-day MVC during bench press and handgrip reliabilities were 0.96 for both tests, whereas the inter-day reliabilities were 0.82 and 0.88, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s2b3"><title>Eccentric-concentric bench press</title><p>The participants performed an eccentric-concentric bench press exercise at a maximal speed. The external load applied to the bar was equal to 35% of the MVC. During the movement, the bar was mechanically linked to a linear encoder (Ergotest-Innovation, Porsgrunn, Norway). Thus, it was possible to calculate the power that corresponded to the load displacement <xref rid="pone.0111521-Bosco2" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Strong verbal encouragement was provided to the subjects, and three attempts were performed. The mean of the three attempts was calculated for further analyses.

The force times and the EMG time histories were synchronized with respect to time and during the off-line analyses, the maximum force values and the EMGs (400 ms window) were considered in the analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111521.s001">Figure S1</xref>). The intra-day and inter-day EMG reliabilities were 0.97 and 0.97 for the PM muscle, 0.96 and 0.85 for the DE muscle, 0.95 and 0.85 for the TB muscle, and 0.96 and 0.68 for the FCR muscle, respectively. The EMGrms was also recorded during the treatments (in each trial) for all of the subjects. Delta (&#x00394;, %) was calculated as the difference between the first and last trials according to the following formula: [(last trial &#x02013; first trial)/first trial]*100. The intra-day reliabilities were 0.95, 0.92, 0.94, and 0.80 for the PM, DE, TB, and FCR muscles, respectively.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Interventions</title><p>The participants postured themselves in the push-up position on the vibration device (Nemes-Lsb, Bosco-System, Rome, Italy) while flexing the elbow at approximately 90&#x000b0; (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0111521.s002">Figure S2</xref>). The HVG and LVG participants were exposed to a series of 20 trials &#x000d7;10-s synchronous WBV with a 10-s pause between each trial and a 4-min pause after the first 10 trials.

The between-group comparisons were performed using the Kruskal-Wallis test. Cronbach's alpha coefficient was used to determine the reliability between the participants. The analyses were performed using XLSTAT 13.02 statistical software (Addinsoft, SARL, NY, USA).

Additionally, the GH concentration remained elevated until 1 h after the end of WBV exercise (+180-fold). In contrast, the testosterone concentration was elevated for both the 2.88 <italic>g</italic> (+15%, HVG) and 0.12 <italic>g</italic> (+21%, LVG) acceleration loads.</p><p>It is well known that plasma GH concentrations increase during exercise and that the magnitude of this response appears to be dependent on the exercise selected and the volume of muscle mass recruited, the muscle contraction type, the exercise intensity, the exercise duration, the rest interval between sets, and the total magnitude of work performed <xref rid="pone.0111521-Kraemer1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. In this study, the GH response magnitude was associated with the peak exercise intensity, as all other variables were equal between the groups. The WBV exercise intensity in the HVG, which was estimated based on the EMGrms activity, produced the greatest muscle activation during the vibrational conditions. Therefore, upon exercise onset (WBV and isometric push-ups), the signals that arose in the central areas of the brain (central command) activated the motor cortex to induce muscle contractions in a potentially parallel manner and activated more endocrine centers to cause increased GH release <xref rid="pone.0111521-Kjaer1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Thus, the GH response in our study appears to be proportional to the recruited muscle volume relative to the exercise intensity, similar to resistance exercise <xref rid="pone.0111521-Kraemer1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Additionally, the increase in EMG activity recorded toward the end of each repetition (Delta) could cause an increase in reflex activation <xref rid="pone.0111521-Biro1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0111521-Pollock1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, which indicates that the &#x0201c;central command&#x0201d; can be intensified via feed-back signaling from the exercising muscles mediated by the afferent nerves as neural reflex mechanisms <xref rid="pone.0111521-Kraemer1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0111521-Kjaer1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Concisely, it may be possible for higher brain centers (i.e., the motor cortex) to play an active role in regulating GH secretion during WBV and this regulatory mechanism may be sensitive to specific peripheral neural mechanisms.</p><p>With respect to the testosterone response, it is unclear why this response was not dependent on the WBV intensity. Traditionally, the physiological function of testosterone in skeletal muscle tissue is the maintenance of an increase in skeletal muscle mass (hypertrophy) via genomic (long-term, transcriptional) mechanisms and subsequent indirect increases in muscle strength <xref rid="pone.0111521-Crewther1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0111521-Kraemer1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. However, steroid hormones, including testosterone, have been demonstrated to elicit rapid responses (within seconds to minutes) in rat muscle fibers <xref rid="pone.0111521-Hamdi1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> via non-genomic mechanisms (short-term, non-transcriptional). According to this perspective, given that testosterone regulates a wide biological body function spectrum with respect to environmental changes, the acute control of testosterone levels might be more complex (by the system) than the simple and direct regulation of testosterone levels by WBV exercise intensity.</p><p>The WBV-induced suppression of MVC and EMG activity could indicate the presence of significant &#x02018;central fatigue&#x02019;. However, the increase in EMG activity during the treatments (delta) suggests an increase in reflex activation in which the motor units are recruited at the lowest force thresholds (compared with voluntary activation) to compensate for a reduced descending drive in an attempt to maintain the force output during fatigue <xref rid="pone.0111521-Biro1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Additionally, the selective attenuation of the maximal muscle EMG activity following WBV is dependent on the acceleration load, which suggests that the afferent input could be dependent on the activated muscle fiber types <xref rid="pone.0111521-Pollock1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0111521-Ushiyama1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, the different muscle spindle responses to muscle vibration, and the specific sensory receptor population <xref rid="pone.0111521-Mottram1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0111521-Shinohara1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Neuromuscular propagation failure, muscle-tendon unit compliance, motor cortex excitability, and muscle fatigue status may be related to WBV-induced suppression of the maximal voluntary contraction <xref rid="pone.0111521-Ushiyama1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>.</p><p>Muscle fatigue is characterized by not only a loss of force generation capacity but also a slowing of the muscle contractile speed. Indeed, loss of power is a major consequence of muscle fatigue due to changes in three muscle properties: a decrease in the isometric force, a slowing of the maximal velocity, and an increase in the force&#x02013;velocity function slope <xref rid="pone.0111521-Jones1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. The metabolic mechanisms underlying these changes have not been identified, but it has been speculated that a decrease in activating calcium might trigger the loss of power during fatigue <xref rid="pone.0111521-Jones1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. In this study, the negative and positive power measured during the eccentric-concentric bench press exercise remained unchanged in all three groups after WBV. Therefore, it appears most likely that WBV-induced suppression of the MVC is not caused by changes in the muscle or tendon mechanical and metabolic properties. Based on the results of prior non-genomic testosterone analyses and the absence of a significant loss of power in our study, we cannot exclude the possibility of protective effects of testosterone against skeletal muscle fatigue as suggested by Bosco et al. <xref rid="pone.0111521-Bosco1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0111521-Dent1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>.</p><p>Although histological alterations provide a direct evidence for muscle damage, often, this damage is assessed indirectly by increases in muscle proteins in the blood (e.g., creatine kinase: CK), ratings of delayed onset muscle soreness, and decreases in maximal voluntary contraction and range of motion <xref rid="pone.0111521-Warren1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Therefore, in the present study, the significant MVC decrease could also indicate the presence of muscle damage because MVC peak force measures have been considered to be valid markers of muscle damage <xref rid="pone.0111521-Warren1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. In this connection, a recent study of Hazell et al. <xref rid="pone.0111521-Hazell1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref> has demonstrated that synchronous whole-body vibration superimposed on moderate exercise determines significant increases in interleukins (IL-1b, IL-6, IL-10), indicating the effects on muscle damage and inflammation, even if the reported value in IL-6 (&#x0223c;2&#x02013;3 pg&#x02022;ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) is less than that reported after a traditional resistance training session (&#x0223c;5&#x02013;6 pg&#x02022;ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) <xref rid="pone.0111521-Izquierdo1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>.</p><p>In our study, the combination of vibration plus posture assumed on the vibrating plate produced an intense exercise during the vibrational interventions, particularly within the high vibration group.

Therefore, during the vibration training (toward the end of the treatment-the last two repetitions) the participants were not be able to sustain the workload and dropped on the plate. As previously described, the fatiguing task is speculated to cause a myofibril disruption that triggers an inflammatory response increasing the circulation of cytokines and hormones that promote muscle tissue remodeling <xref rid="pone.0111521-Schroeder1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0111521-Izquierdo1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0111521-Mitchell1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>.
