The same analyses were used to compare azacitidine with low-dose cytarabine in patients who had been preselected to low-dose cytarabine before they were randomized to receive azacitidine or CCR (ie, low-dose cytarabine).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Median overall survival was significantly prolonged with azacitidine (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x02009;129) versus CCR (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x02009;133): 8.9 versus 4.9&#x000a0;months (hazard ratio 0.74, [95%CI 0.57, 0.97]). Among patients with intermediate-risk cytogenetics, median overall survival with azacitidine was 16.4&#x000a0;months, and with CCR was 8.9&#x000a0;months (hazard ratio 0.73 [95%CI 0.48, 1.10]).

AML pathogenesis is characterised by recurrent chromosomal translocations and specific somatic mutations that define biologically distinct disease subtypes. The World Health Organization (WHO) classification of myeloid neoplasms includes four distinct types of AML [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]: AML with recurrent genetic abnormalities; therapy-related AML (tAML); AML with myelodysplasia-related changes (AML-MRC); and AML not otherwise specified (AML-NOS). Among WHO-defined AML classifications, the most common are AML-MRC and AML-NOS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. AML-MRC is defined by the presence of multilineage dysplasia, prior history of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) (secondary AML [sAML]), or MDS-related cytogenetic abnormalities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Compared with AML-NOS, patients with AML-MRC are generally older and more likely to have poor-risk cytogenetics, leading to poor response and prognosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Moreover, older patients with sAML tend to have disease that is more chemoresistant than do patients with AML-NOS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. While choice of AML treatment can depend on age, cytogenetic risk, performance status, and other factors, no particular therapy has yet been found to provide specific benefits in AML-MRC.</p><p id="Par31">In the United States, azacitidine is recommended first-line therapy for patients with higher-risk MDS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], and is indicated for all FAB subtypes of MDS and for treatment of low-blast-count AML (20&#x02013;30% bone marrow [BM] blasts) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Azacitidine is also indicated in the European Union&#x000a0;for higher-risk MDS and for treatment of adult patients with AML with any BM blast count who are unable to undergo allogeneic stem cell transplantation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. MDS and AML may reflect a continuum of myeloid disease, particularly in the older patient population with low white blood cell (WBC) counts. The international, randomised, phase 3&#x000a0;AZA-AML-001 (AZA-AML) study in older patients with newly diagnosed AML with &#x0003e;30% BM blasts showed overall survival (OS) was 10.4&#x000a0;months in azacitidine-treated patients compared with 6.5&#x000a0;months for patients who received conventional care regimens (CCR; <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x02009;0.101) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Consistent with&#x000a0;azacitidine efficacy in higher-risk MDS, a prospective univariate analysis of 158 patients (32% of all patients in the AZA-AML study) with locally diagnosed AML-MRC showed that azacitidine was associated with significantly improved OS compared with CCR (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x02009;0.036), and the difference approached statistical significance in multivariate analysis (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x02009;0.097) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Subsequently, central review of patients&#x02019; BM samples identified a much larger proportion of patients who met WHO criteria for AML-MRC, suggesting the possibility of substantial under-diagnosis of AML-MRC in routine clinical practise. To help clarify whether patients with AML with myelodysplasia-related features respond preferentially to azacitidine, we evaluated efficacy and safety outcomes for this larger group of patients with centrally adjudicated AML-MRC in the AZA-AML trial.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par32">The AZA-AML study was approved by the relevant institutional review boards or independent ethics committees and was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki. All patients provided written informed consent before study participation.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Patients</title><p id="Par33">Inclusion and exclusion criteria and study design are reported in detail elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Briefly, patients aged &#x02265;65&#x000a0;years with newly diagnosed de novo AML or sAML with &#x0003e;30% BM blasts, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) scores 0&#x02013;2, intermediate- or poor-risk cytogenetics per National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) 2009 criteria, and WBC counts &#x02264;15&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>9</sup>/L were eligible. Before randomisation, patients were preselected to 1 of 3 protocol-specified CCR: intensive chemotherapy (IC; standard 7&#x02009;+&#x02009;3 regimen with one induction course and up to two additional courses of consolidation), low-dose cytarabine (LDAC; 20&#x000a0;mg BID for 10&#x000a0;days per 28-day treatment cycle), or best supportive care (BSC) only. Patients were then randomised 1:1 to azacitidine (75&#x000a0;mg/m<sup>2</sup>/day for 7&#x000a0;days per 28-day cycle) or to CCR. Those randomised to CCR received their preselected treatment. All participants could receive BSC as needed.</p><p id="Par34">Diagnosis and disease classification were recorded before study entry&#x000a0;for each patient by&#x000a0;the treating physician. Subsequently, assignment of AML-MRC according to WHO criteria was performed by the sponsor. Patients with centrally adjudicated&#x000a0;AML-MRC must have met at least one of the following criteria: (1) dysplasia in &#x02265;50% of cells in at least two of the three myeloid lineages, (2) sAML with antecedent history of MDS or myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), or (3) MDS-related cytogenetic abnormalities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Dysplasia and cytogenetic assessments of baseline BM aspirate samples were performed centrally by an independent expert pathologist (John M. Bennett, MD) and cytogeneticist (Anne Hagemeijer, MD), blinded to local pathology and cytogenetic reports and treatment assignments. Proportions of dysplastic cells in the erythroid, granulocytic, and megakaryocytic lineages were determined by independent haemato-pathologist review of BM aspirates. History of MDS was based on local site reporting. Patients who met criteria for AML-MRC but who had received prior systemic anti-cancer therapy or prior radiation treatment were considered to have tAML per WHO definition and were excluded from analyses.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Efficacy endpoints</title><p id="Par35">Analyses included only those patients in AZA-AML with a centrally confirmed AML-MRC diagnosis. The primary analysis compared the OS for azacitidine- and CCR-treated patients. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis of OS, similar to one that was predefined for the overall AZA-AML study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], was performed, in which patients who had switched to alternate therapy at some point from their randomised treatment were censored at the time they did so.</p><p id="Par36">Secondary analyses included Kaplan-Meier estimates of 1-year survival and overall response rate (i.e., complete remission [CR] plus CR with incomplete haematologic recovery [CRi]) as defined by International Working Group (IWG) response criteria for AML [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Stable disease was defined as the absence of an IWG-defined hematologic response with no evidence of disease progression, sustained&#x000a0;for a period of&#x000a0;&#x02265;8 weeks.

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par55">While slightly less than one-third of patients in the AZA-AML study were identified as having AML-MRC at local diagnosis, more than one-half of all patients were so identified upon central review. The discrepancy between local and central adjudication suggests that&#x000a0;diagnosing dysplasia in routine clinical practice is a challenge, although dysplasia assessments are known to be subject to high interobserver variability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. As noted, 89 patients in AZA-AML with multilineage dysplasia determined in independent central review of BM aspirates were originally reported to have single-lineage or no dysplasia in local assessments, and&#x000a0;66 of these patients were not considered to have had AML-MRC at study entry. It is also noteworthy that only ~30% of centrally-defined AML-MRC cases were associated with locally reported prior MDS; a potential limitation of the current analysis was the inability to independently verify local reports of prior MDS. Potential under-recognition of prior MDS is consistent with results of a recent study indicating that the leukaemia cells of some older patients with apparent de novo AML harboured MDS-associated mutations, suggesting that such leukaemias may have had an unrecognised MDS prodrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par56">The prognostic significance of morphologic dysplasia in AML has been analysed extensively. A preponderance of evidence suggests that dysplasia alone has no overall prognostic value [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], although within the AML-MRC classification, the presence of &#x0003e;50% micromegakaryocytes or &#x0003e;50% hypogranulated myeloid cells has been associated with poorer event-free survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Prognosis in AML-MRC may be better defined by the associated mutational profile; for example, in the presence of wild-type rather than mutated <italic>NPM1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], or the presence of mutated <italic>ASXL1</italic> or <italic>TP53</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In the current analysis, patients with multilineage dysplasia only (i.e., no prior MDS or MDS-related cytogenetics) treated with azacitidine had much improved OS (16.3&#x000a0;months) compared with all AML-MRC azacitidine-treated patients (8.9&#x000a0;months), and compared with similar CCR-treated patients (7.1&#x000a0;months), suggesting that the presence of multilineage dysplasia alone may have prognostic value. Accurate morphologic assessment of multilineage dysplasia may be important for identifying the patients who might benefit most from azacitidine.</p><p id="Par57">Even in this study of older patients with AML, the AML-MRC subgroup presented substantial treatment challenges; 57% of these patients were aged &#x02265;75&#x000a0;years, 53% had poor-risk cytogenetics, and approximately one-third were reported to have had antecedent MDS. In the overall AZA-AML study population, only ~35% of patients had poor-risk cytogenetics, and as expected, proportionately fewer patients had antecedent MDS/MPN (~20%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Consistent with this prognostic profile, the median OS for AZA-AML patients treated with azacitidine was 8.9&#x000a0;months for patients with AML-MRC, compared with 10.4&#x000a0;months for all azacitidine-treated patients in the study. Likewise, median OS with CCR was 4.9&#x000a0;months for patients with AML-MRC compared with 6.5&#x000a0;months among all CCR-treated patients. Nevertheless, the relative survival benefit for azacitidine observed overall in the study was also&#x000a0;maintained in the AML-MRC population, with a significant improvement in median OS of 4.0&#x000a0;months and a 26% reduced risk of death compared with CCR. Additionally, median OS with azacitidine was almost double that of CCR in patients with intermediate-risk cytogenetics and among &#x0201c;younger&#x0201d; patients (ages 65&#x02013;74&#x000a0;years) compared with CCR.</p><p id="Par58">This analysis also suggested an OS benefit with azacitidine in the subgroup of patients preselected to receive low-intensity LDAC treatment before randomisation. Median OS with azacitidine was more than twice that with LDAC in patients with AML-MRC. Keeping in mind that comparisons between azacitidine and LDAC by age and cytogenetic risk comprised relatively small patient subgroups, median OS was more than twice as long for LDAC-preselected patients with intermediate-risk cytogenetics treated with azacitidine, and almost 3-fold longer for patients aged 65&#x02013;74&#x000a0;years. While they did not fare as well, azacitidine-treated patients with poor-risk cytogenetics, and those aged &#x02265;75&#x000a0;years, had 2- to 5-month improvement in median OS compared with LDAC-treated patients. LDAC has previously been shown to be ineffective in patients with AML with adverse cytogenetics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. It should be noted that better outcomes for azacitidine-treated patients in this preselection group may in part reflect differences in treatment exposure; the median number of azacitidine treatment cycles for this population was 3 times that of LDAC treatment cycles (6 vs 2&#x000a0;cycles). Nevertheless, compared with all LDAC-treated patients in AZA-AML (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x02009;158), LDAC-treated patients with AML-MRC (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x02009;79, 50%) had a somewhat lower median OS (6.4 vs 4.6&#x000a0;months, respectively), suggesting that LDAC may not be optimal in this patient population. Another approach that has shown promise in a partially overlapping patient population to that evaluated in this study is CPX-351 (a liposomal formulation of cytarabine and daunorubicin at a fixed 5:1&#x000a0;M ratio) which has been compared in a phase 3 study to standard &#x0201c;7&#x02009;+&#x02009;3&#x0201d; induction chemotherapy in 309 patients aged 60&#x02013;75&#x000a0;years with previously untreated sAML, tAML, or AML with MDS-related cytogenetic abnormalities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. CPX-351 treatment resulted in a median OS of 9.6&#x000a0;months compared with 6&#x000a0;months with standard induction chemotherapy (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x02009;0.005) in this somewhat younger cohort who were considered fit for standard induction therapy.</p><p id="Par59">Overall response rates in azacitidine-treated patients ranged from 17 to 33% in these analyses, and were higher than response rates with CCR. Interestingly, the difference between azacitidine and CCR overall response rates in AML-MRC (7.5% improvement with azacitidine) was larger than was the difference seen for all patients in the AZA-AML study (2.7% in favour of azacitidine) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Similarly, the significant 13.3% improvement in overall response rate with azacitidine compared with LDAC in LDAC-preselected patients with AML-MRC was much larger than was the difference in response rates for all AML patients in the LDAC preselection group in AZA-AML (1.4% improvement with azacitidine vs LDAC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Overall response rate with azacitidine in the current AML-MRC analyses was similar to that for all azacitidine-treated patients in AZA-AML (27.8%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]; in contrast, the overall response for LDAC-treated patients with AML-MRC (13.9%) is lower than that reported for all LDAC-treated patients in AZA-AML (25.9%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].

Once AML-MRC is diagnosed, azacitidine may be the treatment of choice for patients who are not candidates for induction chemotherapy or stem cell transplantation.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>95%CI</term><def><p id="Par6">95% confidence interval</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AML</term><def><p id="Par7">Acute myeloid leukaemia</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AML-MRC</term><def><p id="Par8">AML with myelodysplasia-related changes</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AML-NOS</term><def><p id="Par9">AML not otherwise specified</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AZA-AML</term><def><p id="Par10">AZA-AML-001 phase 3 trial</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BM</term><def><p id="Par11">Bone marrow</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BSC</term><def><p id="Par12">Best supportive care</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CCR</term><def><p id="Par13">Conventional care regimens</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CR</term><def><p id="Par14">Complete remission</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CRi</term><def><p id="Par15">CR with incomplete haematologic recovery</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ECOG PS</term><def><p id="Par16">Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HR</term><def><p id="Par17">Hazard ratio</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IC</term><def><p id="Par18">Intensive chemotherapy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IWG</term><def><p id="Par19">International Working Group</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LDAC</term><def><p id="Par20">Low-dose cytarabine</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MDS</term><def><p id="Par21">Myelodysplastic syndromes</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MedDRA</term><def><p id="Par22">Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NCCN</term><def><p id="Par23">National Comprehensive Cancer Network</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OS</term><def><p id="Par24">Overall survival</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>sAML</term><def><p id="Par25">Secondary AML</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>tAML</term><def><p id="Par26">Therapy-related AML</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TEAE</term><def><p id="Par27">Treatment-emergent adverse event</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WBC</term><def><p id="Par28">White blood cell</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WHO</term><def><p id="Par29">World Health Organization</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><p>We thank Nora Tu, PhD, of Celgene Corporation for statistical support for these analyses.
