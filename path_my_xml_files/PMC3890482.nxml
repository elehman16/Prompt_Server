This study was a 24-week prospective, open-label, randomized, active-controlled multi-center study. Participants were randomized to receive either acarbose (n=59, 300 mg/day) or voglibose (n=62, 0.9 mg/day). The mean HbA<sub>1c</sub> at week 24 was significantly decreased approximately 0.7% from baseline in both acarbose (from 8.43% &#x000b1; 0.71% to 7.71% &#x000b1; 0.93%) and voglibose groups (from 8.38% &#x000b1; 0.73% to 7.68% &#x000b1; 0.94%). The mean fasting plasma glucose level and self-monitoring of blood glucose data from 1 hr before and after each meal were significantly decreased at week 24 in comparison to baseline in both groups. The levels 1 hr after dinner at week 24 were significantly decreased in the acarbose group (from 233.54 &#x000b1; 69.38 to 176.80 &#x000b1; 46.63 mg/dL) compared with the voglibose group (from 224.18 &#x000b1; 70.07 to 193.01 &#x000b1; 55.39 mg/dL). In conclusion, both acarbose and voglibose are efficacious and safe in patients with type 2 diabetes who are inadequately controlled with basal insulin.

The American Diabetes Association (ADA) and European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) recommend that an HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x02265; 7.0% should serve as a call to action, using insulin therapy to reverse the inevitable deterioration in glycemic control. Initial treatment targeting fasting blood glucose is expected to facilitate reaching treatment goals and is the recommended approach for early insulin initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). A once-daily injection of basal insulin, with once-daily monitoring of blood glucose, provides a simple-to-manage cornerstone of therapy.</p><p>However, basal insulin treatment, such as insulin glargine and detemir, has less effect on postprandial glucose level management compared with fasting glucose levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Furthermore, a recent study suggests that a gradual loss in daytime postprandial glycemic control precedes a stepwise deterioration in nocturnal fasting periods in worsening diabetes, whereas nocturnal fasting glycemic control remains essentially unchanged as long as HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels remain &#x0003c; 8% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Once fasting glucose is tightly controlled with basal insulin, adding oral hypoglycemic agents or short-acting insulin can help achieve the target goal of HbA<sub>1c</sub> through improving postprandial blood glucose excursion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>).</p><p>Acarbose and voglibose are &#x003b1;-glucosidase inhibitors that typically reduce postprandial glucose concentrations by delaying carbohydrate digestion and therefore absorption in the gut, and can be a useful first-line treatment in the patients who have a combination of slightly raised basal glucose concentrations and marked postprandial hyperglycemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). &#x003b1;-glucosidase inhibitors have been used in Asian patients with type 2 diabetes as first-line and second-line therapies targeting the postprandial glucose level, and often used with a basal insulin regimen when basal insulin treatment alone did not result in glycemic control because they had eaten a high carbohydrate containing meal. However, there are no direct comparison data between acarbose and voglibose regarding glycemic control and side effects when added to basal insulin treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes.</p><p>In this study, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of acarbose and voglibose in type 2 diabetes patients whose blood glucose levels were inadequately controlled with insulin glargine (or insulin detemir) alone or in combination with metformin (or a sulfonylurea).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Study population and design</title><p>This study was a prospective, parallel group, open-label, randomized, active-controlled clinical trial that was conducted at 11 study centers in Korea. Patients with type 2 diabetes aged 18-79 yr who were already taking insulin glargine (or insulin detemir) alone or in combination with metformin (or a sulfonylurea) for at least 3 months prior to screening, and had an HbA<sub>1C</sub> &#x0003e; 7.0% and &#x02264; 10.0%, were eligible to be randomized.</p><p>Eligible patients gave informed consent and were randomized in a ratio of 1:1 to receive acarbose (up to 100 mg three times daily) or voglibose (up to 0.3 mg three times daily). All subjects were instructed to keep their metformin and sulfonylurea dose throughout the study.</p><p>Of the 156 subjects screened for this study, 124 subjects were randomized to either the acarbose or voglibose group. A total of 32 subjects was screened but not randomized. Of these 32 subjects, 29 were excluded for unmet eligibility criteria (24 for inclusion and 5 for exclusion criteria). The other 3 subjects were excluded for the following reasons: one subject was recommended to be hospitalized for blood glucose control by the investigator, another was not able to be contacted and was withdrawn from the study due to problems related to patient's diary, and the final subject was withdrawn with consent.</p><p>Among 124 randomized subjects, 2 subjects in the acarbose group whose medication compliance was not reported were regarded as non-treated with the study drug. A total of 122 subjects (60 in the acarbose group and 62 in the voglibose group) who were treated with study medications were included in the safety set. Of those subjects who were included in the safety set, one subject in the treatment group was excluded from the modified intent-to-treat (mITT) set due to no HbA<sub>1c</sub> values after treatment. A total of 121 subjects (59 in the acarbose group and 62 in the voglibose group) were included in the mITT set. A total of 102 subjects (47 in the acarbose group and 55 in the voglibose group) who complied with all study protocol criteria and the study medication regimen was included in the per-protocol (PP) set.</p></sec><sec><title>Efficacy and safety evaluation</title><p>The primary endpoint was mean HbA<sub>1c</sub> change from baseline to week 24. Secondary endpoints were diurnal glucose concentration checked by self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG), fasting plasma glucose level, lipid parameters including total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), triglycerides (TG), apolipoprotein A (Apo A), apolipoprotein B (Apo B), as well as body weight, body mass index (BMI), and high sensitivity C reactive protein (hs-CRP) level. The HbA<sub>1c</sub> level was evaluated at 0, 8, 24 weeks, and fasting glucose and SMBG information were collected from patient diary at every visit. The other parameters were checked at baseline and week 24. To determine efficacy parameters, all laboratory determinations were performed by a central laboratory, Seoul Clinical Laboratories (SCL) in Korea. HbA1C was determined by turbidimetric inhibition immunoassay (NGSP, Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN, USA). Lipid profiles were done by enzymatic colorimetic assays (HITACHI, Tokyo, Japan) and hs-CRP level was determined by immunoturbidimetric assays (HITACHI).</p><p>Subjects tested six-point SMBG profiles (pre-meal and 1 hr post-meal) using the same type of blood-glucose meter (provided by investigators) on any 2 days within a week and recorded it in a patient diary prior to every visit (CareSens, i-sens, Seoul, Korea). Subjects checked preprandial glucose levels 1 hr before each meal and postprandial glucose levels 1 hr after the beginning of each meal. At every visit, we performed physical examinations and checked whether patients experienced hypoglycemic events. Hypoglycemia was defined as blood glucose concentrations less than 50 mg/dL with or without symptoms of hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia symptoms included fatigue, sweating, palpitation, tremor, confusion, seizure, and loss of consciousness. Severe hypoglycemia was defined as an event with symptoms consistent with hypoglycemia which the subject required assistance from another person and was associated with prompt recovery after oral carbohydrates, or intravenous glucose or glucagon administration. Subjects were asked to self-monitor glucose values whenever they experienced symptoms that might have resulted from hypoglycemia.</p><p>To evaluate adverse events, blood pressure, electrocardiography, hematologic parameters, blood chemistry, and urine analyses were also monitored.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical methods</title><p>The primary efficacy variable was mean HbA<sub>1c</sub> change from baseline to week 24 in the modified intent to treat (mITT) population with last observation carried forward for the patients who discontinued prematurely, comparing acarbose group with voglibose group. Subjects included in the mITT analysis received at least one dose of study medication, had efficacy data at baseline, and had at least one post-baseline measurement of the respective variable. Sample size calculation was based on a margin of non-inferiority, the value of 0.5, in adjusted mean change from baseline to HbA<sub>1c</sub> and standard deviation of difference between groups of 1.0. We calculated that 51 patients per group were needed to demonstrate non-inferiority of acarbose group (alpha 0.05, one-sided, 80% power).</p><p>Statistics were performed using the SAS 9.1 package. Data were presented as mean &#x000b1; SD for continuous variables and as frequency and percentage for categorical variables, unless otherwise specified. Baseline characteristics and safety evaluation were compared using two sample t-test and Pearson's chi-square test, as appropriate. Primary and secondary variables were analyzed using an ANCOVA model with treatment and pooled center as the classification variables and baseline value as the covariate. Except for efficacy analysis, all statistical analysis for the baseline character and safety evaluation was performed by using two-sided test and at 5% level of significance. Efficacy analysis was performed by using one-sided test and at 5% level of significance. And all <italic>P</italic> value were considered statistically significant when <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05. Safety analyses were performed in the all treated patients, which included randomized patients who received at least one dose of study medication. Safety parameters included any adverse events, hypoglycemia, laboratory safety findings, vital signs and physical examination.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics statement</title><p>This study protocol was reviewed and approved by the institutional review board of Korea University Anam Hospital (AN09158) and other involved centers.

Currently, four AGIs (acarbose, miglitol, voglibose, and emiglitate) have been used. Of these, acarbose is the most commonly prescribed. AGIs are much cheaper than many other newly developed medications and therefore these drugs can be continued for long periods of time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). In particular, because AGIs lower the postprandial elevation of glucose and insulin levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>), they may be used as an additional therapy to basal insulin, which targets control of fasting blood glucose but not postprandial glucose excursion. AGIs have been widely used in Asian patients with type 2 diabetes who consume high carbohydrate diets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>).</p><p>In this study, the mean HbA<sub>1c</sub> level at week 24 decreased significantly by approximately 0.7% from baseline in both acarbose and voglibose groups. There was no statistically significant difference between two groups in the change of HbA<sub>1c</sub> level. We consider the reduction in HbA<sub>1c</sub> level after the addition of acarbose or voglibose might be derived not only from decreased postprandial glucose levels but also from decreased fasting glucose level, although the mean changes in SMBG levels 1 hr after the meal were larger than 1 hr before the meal. In many studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>), AGIs reduce both fasting and postprandial glucose levels, a phenomenon that the authors suggest was due to a greater reduction in postprandial hyperglycemia that secondarily leads to a decreased fasting plasma glucose concentration. In our study, the mean changes in SMBG levels were not significantly different between the groups, except the SMBG level 1 hr after dinner. The mean change in SMBG levels 1 hr after dinner in acarbose group was larger than in voglibose group. Based on these results, both drugs were regarded to have similar effects on glycemic control. However, the effects of acarbose on postprandial glucose were slightly superior to those of voglibose.</p><p>In this study, both acarbose and voglibose reduced body weight, which is thought to result from improving the postprandial hyperinsulinemia that causes weight gain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). Although several studies have reported that AGIs have neutral effects on body weight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>), many other studies and latest meta-analyses showed that AGIs positively affect body weight change due to decreased caloric absorption and less food intake as a result of gastrointestinal adverse effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>).</p><p>Upon examining the lipid profiles, ApoA showed a tendency to decrease in both groups. Total cholesterol, HDL-C, non-HDL-C, and LDL-C did not change significantly in both group. However, both acarbose and voglibose significantly elevated the ApoB level, which is associated with LDL-cholesterol. Hegele et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>) also reported ApoB elevation after acarbose treatment, which is thought to be caused by chronically increased acetate production due to fermentation of non-absorbed carbohydrates, similar to lactulose ingestion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). However, the exact mechanism has not yet been studied and requires further investigation. Currently available studies on cardiovascular disease (CVD) contain no evidence of an increased CVD risk associated with AGI use, despite the elevation in ApoB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). In addition, CRP, which is a marker of CVD, was not elevated after using these medications. These results suggest that the drugs exert greater influence on secondary changes due to reduced blood glucose rather than directly influencing dyslipidemia.</p><p>The most common reported side effect of AGIs is abdominal flatulence, and other gastrointestinal side effects are frequently found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). Gastrointestinal adverse effects (flatulence, diarrhea, etc.) were the most frequent side effect in this study as well, but there was only a single case in each study group resulting in discontinuation of the medication because of an adverse event. Therefore, there were no major problems using the drugs. Hypoglycemia was reported in 11.7% of subjects in the acarbose group and 9.7% of subjects in the voglibose group. Hypoglycemic events in this study do not appear to have been caused by AGIs because the frequencies are similar to or lower than that reported in studies on glargine or detemir (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). Furthermore, there is a report that acarbose usage may reduce necessary insulin dose, therefore minimizing the risk of hypoglycemia and weight gain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). Thus, both drugs seem to have no serious side effects and may be safely used.</p><p>Taken together, these data showed that the addition of &#x003b1;-glucosidase inhibitors could help lower the levels of HbA<sub>1c</sub> and blood glucose in patients with type 2 diabetes who were inadequately controlled with insulin glargine (or insulin detemir) alone or in combination with metformin (or a sulfonylurea). In conclusion, both acarbose and voglibose are comparably effective on glycemic control of HbA<sub>1c</sub> and blood glucose levels.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p>The work was funded by a research grant from the Bayer Korea Ltd 2009.09.22-2012.09.18).</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p>The authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose.
