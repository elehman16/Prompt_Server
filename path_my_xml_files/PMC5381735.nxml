Reactivation of infection in transplanted kidneys is the unintended consequence of the powerful antirejection agents, and its incidence has increased with modern immunosuppression.<sup><xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Early detection of virus by programmed screening<sup><xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> allows reduction of immunosuppression and reconstitution of recipient immunity and potential viral clearance. However, established BK virus allograft nephropathy (BKVAN) is a destructive allograft infection that occurs in 5% and progresses to transplant failure in 46%.<sup><xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup></p><p>Inflammatory BKVAN (pattern B histopathology) is characterized by viral cytopathic tubular destruction, interstitial fibrosis and interstitial cellular infiltration, with graft loss rates of 25% to 75%, depending on extent of inflammation (subclassified as B1, B2, and B3).<sup><xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Treatment is problematical,<sup><xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> because reduction of immunosuppression recommended by consensus guidelines is prejudiced by viral-mediated interstitial inflammation, often morphologically indistinguishable from acute rejection.<sup><xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>-<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Available antiviral treatments for severe BKVAN are relatively ineffectual. A large systematic review of 40 studies found that the death-censored graft loss rate for immunosuppression reduction was not greatly improved by the addition of cidofovir or leflunomide.<sup><xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Guidelines are hampered by a poor evidence base and lack of randomized control trials,<sup><xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> and better evidence-based treatment options are desperately needed.</p><p>Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is a nondepleting agent, with antiviral and immunomodulatory properties, advocated for treatment of BKVAN. IVIG is familiar to transplant clinicians for acute rejection,<sup><xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> but also successfully used against chronic viral infections such as post-transplant cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, and parvovirus B19 infections.<sup><xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>-<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Promising recent reports of IVIG used as salvage therapy for BKVAN<sup><xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>-<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> are small and lack control groups. Concomitant reduced immunosuppression confounds clinical interpretation, more data are needed. The purpose of this single-center retrospective cohort study was to evaluate the efficacy of IVIG, when added to a multidimensional antiviral strategy to treat established BKVAN in kidney transplant recipients. We used a combination of treatments including ciprofloxacin, conversions of tacrolimus to cyclosporine, and mycophenolate to leflunomide (with therapeutic monitoring and dose adjustment), intravenous cidofovir&#x02014;to which additional IVIG was used over a 3-month treatment period. This combinatorial approach with adjuvant IVIG appeared significantly more effective clearing BK virus from blood and renal transplant tissue as the primary endpoints.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Study Population</title><p>The study group comprised consecutive kidney and kidney-pancreas transplant recipients diagnosed with histologically-proven BKVAN from 2002 to 2014, where accessible data were available. All patients were treated at Westmead Hospital, Sydney. The institutional ethics approvals were HREC 2012/6/6.4 (3563) and LNR/12/WMEAD/244 (amendment 1). Immunosuppression for standard-risk patients comprised basiliximab induction, tacrolimus, mycophenolate, and prednisolone.</p></sec><sec><title>Diagnosis of BKVAN</title><p>BKVAN was confirmed by abnormal renal transplant pathology in all cases, characterized by intranuclear inclusions, typical smudgy nuclear chromatin, cellular atypia, tubular epithelial cell degeneration with rounding, detachment, and apoptosis, and supported in all cases by positive simian virus 40 T (SV40T) immunohistochemistry (and in some early case by electron microscopy). The categories of BKVAN pathology were classified by extent of disease and severity of associated inflammation and damage.<sup><xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup></p><p>BK viremia was present in all cases. DNA was confirmed as BK virus DNA after nucleic acid extraction from whole blood and specific quantitative real-time PCR (Affigene BKV trender kit; Cepheid AB, Solna, Sweden), with a quantitative range 10<sup>3</sup> to 10<sup>8</sup> copies/mL, (assay limit, 898 copies/mL). From July 2013, BK detection used the specific <italic>Iam</italic> BKV kit with LIASION analyser (DiaSorin, Vercelli, Italy), with a sensitivity of 450 copies/mL (quantitative range, 10<sup>4</sup>-10<sup>10</sup> copies/mL). Quantitative tests successfully complied with independent external quality assurance in molecular diagnostics (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.qcmd.org">www.qcmd.org</ext-link>).

After BKVAN diagnosis, repeat pathology at 3 months was frequently supplemented by indication biopsy samples and SV40 staining. Tissue viral load was assessed by a 3-tier score (1, &#x02264;1%; 2, &#x0003e;1%-10%; 3, &#x0003e;10% tubules with viral replication), for both SV40 staining and cytopathic changes.<sup><xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Presumptive cases of high-level BK viremia (&#x0003e;10<sup>4</sup> copies/mL) without biopsy confirmation were not included.</p></sec><sec><title>Treatment of BKVAN</title><p>Treatment of established BKVAN entailed reduced immunosuppression, with tacrolimus reduction or conversion to cyclosporine (2-hour target concentration, 600-800 ng/mL), reduced mycophenolate or replacement by leflunomide (60 mg/d load for 2 days then 20 mg/d; targeting plasma teriflunomide, 50-100 &#x003bc;g/mL)<sup><xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> or azathioprine, and prednisolone tapering to 10 mg per day. Additional therapies included ciprofloxacin (500 mg twice daily for 1 month), IV cidofovir (0.5 mg/kg per second weekly for 10 weeks), and IVIG, initially reserved for severe inflammatory BKVAN infection, but later expanded to include primary treatment of less severe disease.</p><p>IVIG was given weekly at 100 mg/kg per dose for 10 weeks (totalling 1 g/kg), using 1 L normal saline prehydration and predose enoxaparin 1 mg/kg subcutaneously to prevent thrombosis, unless contraindicated. The IVIG products used included Octagam 5% and 10% (Octapharma, Vienna, Austria), Flebogamma 5% (Instituto Grifol, Barcelona, Spain), Kiovig 10% (Baxter AG, Vienna, Belgium), Intragam P6% and Privigen 10% (both CSL Behring, Broadmeadows, Australia).</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>The research design was a retrospective, case-control historical cohort study. The principal treatment group were patients who received IVIG as part of BKVAN treatment. The control group received standard-of-care treatment without IVIG.</p><p>The prespecified primary outcomes were clearance of viremia, and tissue clearance defined by resolution of cytopathic effect and SV40 on repeat histopathology. Secondary outcomes were death-censored graft survival, patient survival, and adverse events. Sustained viral response (SVR) was defined as complete clearance of BK viremia by repeated blood testing, partial clearance as low-level persistent viremia (1E + 03 copies/mL or less, sometimes intermittently), and failed clearance with high-level viremia (when quantification exceeded 1E + 04 copies/mL).</p><p>STROBE reporting guidelines cohort studies were used.<sup><xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> We used an unpaired Student <italic>t</italic> test or Wilcoxon rank sum test for nominal data, conditional binomial test for categorical data, Pearson and Spearman coefficients for correlations, logistic regression for dichotomous data analysis, and Cox regression for survival data (both univariate and multivariate models).

Although effective screening strategies reduce incidence, severe BKVAN presenting with active inflammation are difficult to eradicate because of limited therapies with activity against BK virus. Our results demonstrate that adjuvant IVIG when used simultaneously with intensive antiviral treatment including cyclosporine conversion more effectively cleared viremia and histological BKVAN, compared with standard-of-care reduced immunosuppression with cidofovir. A single deep venous thrombosis requiring anticoagulation was the only adverse reaction attributable to IVIG, and other potential reactions, such as headache, allergic reactions, or aseptic meningitis, did not occur with our low-dose regime.</p><p>Although further validation of IVIG treatment by randomized trial is needed, the more rapid and complete resolution of BK virus observed is encouraging and agrees with the experience of others. Published data generally comprise small, retrospective single-center observational studies that lack control groups, and some case reports, all using heterogeneous treatment protocols. Nevertheless and despite this variability, IVIG was consistently found to successfully clear BK virus, without excessive acute rejection rates that often penalize immunosuppression reduction. Most BKVAN cases were severe and associated with high-level viremia, active inflammation (category B where graft loss rates of 25-75% are expected) and coexistent allograft dysfunction; and IVIG used as salvage treatment after conventional therapy had failed (as was in 31.8% of IVIG uses in our series).</p><p>Sener et al<sup><xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> treated 8 patients with BKVAN causing graft dysfunction 11.4 months posttransplant using primary IVIG therapy (2 g/kg divided over 2-5 days) and 50% reduction of immunosuppression, without cidofovir. Viremia was cleared in 50% by 6.5 months, and 88% graft survival at 15.3 months was superior to contemporary published results. Sharma et al<sup><xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> reported stabilization of renal dysfunction, clearance of viremia and histological resolution of BKVAN (grade B2) in a 3-year old boy after salvage IVIG treatment (0.6 g/kg &#x000d7; 7 doses), after failed mycophenolate elimination, tacrolimus reduction, and cidofovir. Anyaegbu et al<sup><xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> reported clearance of persisting mid-range BK viremia (negative histology) with a single 2 g/kg IVIG dose in 3 pediatric recipients, despite mycophenolate elimination and tacrolimus reduction; and histological resolution of biopsy-proven BKVAN (grade A) in a fourth child, all with stable allograft function. Vu and colleagues<sup><xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> used IVIG (cumulative 1.0 g/kg) to treat 30 BK viremic patients who failed calcineurin inhibitor reduction and mycophenolate replacement with leflunomide (from 53 screened with viremia of 280 transplanted). These comprised 10 histologically proven BKVAN and 20 viremia cases (&#x0003e;10E4 copies with negative pathology) occurring 13.1 &#x000b1; 5.4 months after transplantation. BK quantitative levels fell rapidly after IVIG treatment, 90% cleared viremia by 1 year, graft survival was 96.7%, and 1 kidney failed from vascular rejection. Dheir et al successfully treated 19 recipients with biopsy-proven BKVAN, viremia and allograft dysfunction (6.8 &#x000b1; 2.9 months posttransplant); with leflunomide replacement of mycophenolate (68%), cidofovir (32%) and IVIG in 74% (0.5 g/kg daily &#x000d7;3 days). Two transplants failed from BKVAN, but acute rejection rates were unchanged.</p><p>Although these data confirm that IVIG is effective for BKVAN treatment, its mechanism of action is less understood. IVIG is a pooled product containing antibodies to potential pathogens, and by passive immunity reported to clear chronic viral infections from transplanted recients.<sup><xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>-<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Human IVIG preparations at clinically relevant concentrations contain sufficient neutralizing antibodies against BK virus to inhibit 90% of viral DNA yield, when coincubated with infected human host cells.<sup><xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> Some IVIG preparations exceeded 95% viral inhibition at 0.1 &#x003bc;g/mL, without cytotoxicity and impressive therapeutic ratios, easily exceeding cidofovir and lefunomide by in vitro screening.<sup><xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> A single 5-g vial of IVIG is estimated to neutralize 9.5E + 09 BK genome equivalents, or 1.9E + 06 genomic copies/ml within 5 L of circulating blood.<sup><xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> Pooled IVIG preparations neutralized all BKV genotypes, although high EC50 titres against prevalent genotype Ia fell with the less common genotype IV.<sup><xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> Neutralization of virus by antibody was dose-dependent, modestly enhanced by complement, genotype-specific, and achieved without viral aggregation, capsid morphology, elution, or host cell release.<sup><xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup></p><p>The 150-kDa gammaglobulin major constituent of IVIG, exceeds the upper size limit for glomerular filtration (approximating 70 kDa for podocytes), however, easily diffuses out of the bloodstream into tissues and throughout the extracellular space. The intrarenal distribution of IVIG into interstitial fluid is inferred from <sup>131</sup>I radiolabeled immunoglobulin studies of human volunteers. The half-life of intravenous gammaglobulin is 15 to 21 days and gradually exits from the intravascular into the extravascular compartment, reaching equilibration at 5 days, then slower decay kinetics.<sup><xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> An apparent mass ratio of extravascular to intravascular exogenously administered gammaglobulin of 1.2 to 1.6 compares with concentration ratios of interstitial fluid to plasma (0.52 and 0.62, for endogenous IgG and albumin, respectively) in normal men.<sup><xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> Diffusion of immunoglobulin into the renal interstitial space is likely determined by endothelium type (the fenestrated interendothelial pores exceeding 50 to 60 angstroms characteristic of peritubular capillaries or postcapillary venules exceeds smaller continuous endothelial pores),<sup><xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> endothelial uptake and paracellular transport&#x02014;and influenced by local inflammation. Local interstitial IgG could persist for several weeks after IVIG administration, and neutralizing antibodies against viral capsid protein VP-1 could bind free virus released after lytic tubular cell disruption and limit further viral spread to adjacent cells. The reduced viral SV40 immunohistochemistry scores by 3 months after IVIG treatment support this hypothesis.</p><p>Other indirect mechanisms could explain IVIG benefit. IVIG can regulate innate and adaptive immune responses, interacting with dendritic cells, monocytes, and macrophages via its Fc&#x003b3; receptors. IVIG possesses immunomodulatory properties and can treat refractory T cell&#x02013;mediated or antibody-mediated rejection.<sup><xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> IVIG may safely allow reconstitution of an antiviral immune response with reduced immunosuppression, without increasing the risk of acute rejection. Our results showed that inflammation at the diagnosis of BKVAN, and later episodes of acute dysfunction with mononuclear cell infiltration treated with corticosteroids, were both common accompaniments of BKVAN, but comparable between treatment groups. The transcriptional profile of BKVAN and acute rejection are remarkably similar, both expressing excessive proinflammatory and fibrogenic genes.<sup><xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> IVIG, by virtue of its immunomodulatory properties, could mitigate the destructive effects of antiviral CD8+ cytotoxic T cells and accompanying noncognate cells which infiltrate the allograft and contribute to &#x0201c;collateral&#x0201d; tubular damage from an exuberant antiviral response.<sup><xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Although greater reduction of mononuclear infiltration occurred in the IVIG group, differences failed significance. Other postulated mechanisms include steric hindrance, conformational change of the bound protein, complement-dependent cytotoxicity, viral agglutination, and phagocytosis.<sup><xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup></p><p>The strengths of our study include substantial numbers of BKVAN cases, validated by histopathology, detailed granular subject data including multiple transplant pathology and virology during treatment, and use of a control group to allow statistical inferences. The cohort was compliant with STROBE reporting guidelines.<sup><xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> One study limitation is its case-controlled cohort study design, which is not randomized. However, study groups were comparable in virtually all BK risk factors at baseline by chance. The only potential confounding factor that required adjustment by multivariate modelling was the greater numbers of patients converted from tacrolimus to cyclosporine in the IVIG group and where multivariate modelling actually demonstrated independent benefit for both strategies. Cyclosporine complexes and inhibits activity of cyclophilin A and NFATc3 (nuclear factor of activated T cells) and suppresses BK viral replication in vitro.<sup><xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> We suggest both IVIG and cyclosporine conversion for severe cases of inflammatory BKVAN. Because 31.8% of the IVIG group comprised unresponsive cases of BKVAN used as salvage therapy after conventional therapy failed, the benefit of IVIG is underestimated, as indicated by the sensitivity analysis.</p><p>If the effectiveness of IVIG is established by future trials, its place in management algorithm of BKVN protocols will then need clarification, with optimal dose (low vs high total dose) and frequency (single-larger vs frequent-smaller doses), and duration of therapy. We propose IVIG as adjuvant therapy, added synchronously with intensive approach using a combination of cyclosporine, leflunomide, cidofovir, and ciprofloxacin, rather than substitution of a single component of a strategy. Because of increased rejection risks with reduced immunosuppression for BKVAN, we suggest adjuvant IVIG combination as initial primary therapy, where histology demonstrates interstitial inflammation (pattern associated with substantial graft loss), and for those patients of high immunological risk, rather than fail conventional therapy with graft damage and use for late salvage treatment.</p><p>In conclusion, combination treatment incorporating IVIG was more effective in clearing viral expression in patients with BKVAN, compared with conventional standard-of-care treatment. Prospected multicenter randomized trials are needed for validation of its efficacy, and indications for use and optimal incorporation into current management algorithms need to be established.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx" xlink:href="txd-3-e142-s001.docx" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e801" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>The authors would like to thank Ms Elaine Chan, Dr Germaine Wong, Julie McKelvey, and Vivien Lobhedahn for help with clinical data collection, and their transplant unit nursing staff for patient management.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p>Published online 10 March, 2017.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p>All authors participated in article writing and editing.
