However, it has been reported that healthy individuals without wakefulness disorders are using modafinil off-label to enhance cognitive functioning. Although some studies have reported that modafinil improves cognitive task performance in healthy volunteers, numerous other studies have failed to detect cognitive enhancing effects of modafinil on several well-established neuropsychological tasks. Interestingly, several clinical and preclinical studies have found that improved cognitive task performance by modafinil is accompanied by slower response times. This observation raises the question as to whether this slowing of response time in healthy volunteers is a necessary and sufficient condition for cognitive enhancement with modafinil. The aim of the current experiment was to explore this question by investigating the effects of modafinil on the Hayling Sentence Completion Test (HSCT).</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology</title><p>Sixty-four healthy volunteers received either a single dose (200 mg) of modafinil (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;32) or placebo (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;32) in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study in which the principal outcome measures were response latencies on the response initiation and response inhibition sections of the HSCT.</p></sec><sec><title>Principal Findings</title><p>Participants dosed with modafinil had significantly longer mean response latencies on the HSCT for both the response initiation and response inhibition compared to participants dosed with placebo. However, participants in both groups made a similar number of errors on each of these measures, indicating that modafinil did not enhance the accuracy of performance of the task relative to placebo.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study demonstrated that administration of single 200 mg doses of modafinil to healthy individuals increased the latency of responses in the performance of the HSCT, a task that is highly sensitive to prefrontal executive function, without enhancing accuracy of performance. This finding may provide important clues to defining the limitations of modafinil as a putative cognitive enhancer.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02051153">NCT02051153</ext-link>

Experimental studies have reported that modafinil improves the performance of working memory and planning tasks in healthy volunteers, and in patients with neuropsychiatric disorders <xref rid="pone.0110639-Minzenberg1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. More specifically, several studies have reported improvements in some, but not all, neuropsychological tasks, which assess cognitive functions such as memory, visuo-spatial skills, planning and attention <xref rid="pone.0110639-Mller1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0110639-WinderRhodes1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.

Several research reports indicate that a significant number of healthy individuals without wakefulness disorders have used modafinil off-label with the intention of improving their cognitive functioning, for example, to boost academic <xref rid="pone.0110639-Baranski1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0110639-Lynch1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> or job performance <xref rid="pone.0110639-Franke1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Consistent with these reports, it has been claimed that increasing numbers of healthy physicians on-call, students, and academic professionals are using modafinil with the aim of enhancing their cognitive abilities <xref rid="pone.0110639-Franke1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0110639-Greely1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.</p><p>Nevertheless, double-blind, placebo-controlled experimental trials in healthy volunteers have failed to find cognitive-enhancing effects of modafinil on several well-established neuropsychological tasks <xref rid="pone.0110639-Randall1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0110639-Randall3" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. For example, M&#x000fc;ller et al. <xref rid="pone.0110639-Mller1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> failed to find effects of 200 mg of modafinil on simple digit maintenance, letter cancellation and trail making, while Turner et al. <xref rid="pone.0110639-Turner1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> reported that 100 mg and 200 mg of modafinil did not have any significant effects on spatial memory span, spatial working memory, rapid visual processing or attentional set-shifting task performance. Additionally, no beneficial effects of modafinil were observed on the paired associates learning task, which assesses memory, and the &#x02018;one-touch&#x02019; Tower of London spatial planning task. Furthermore, Turner et al. <xref rid="pone.0110639-Turner1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> also reported no effects of modafinil on the Cambridge Gambling task.</p><p>Other subsequent studies showed that higher doses of modafinil also seem to be unbeneficial for cognitive improvements in healthy, non-sleep deprived individuals. For instance, Winder-Rhodes et al. <xref rid="pone.0110639-WinderRhodes1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> showed that 300 mg of modafinil failed to have an effect on a planning task. Similarly, Baranski at al. <xref rid="pone.0110639-Baranski1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> also used high doses of modafinil (4 mg/kg or 300 mg) with healthy volunteers and found no cognitive enhancing effects of modafinil on addition, line discrimination and subjective confidence judgment during the performance on cognitive tasks. Likewise, Wesensten et al. <xref rid="pone.0110639-Wesensten1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> reported lack of effects of 400 mg of modafinil over and above 600 mg of caffeine on the Stroop, verbal fluency, simple reaction time, and the Wisconsin's Card Sorting task. More importantly, several studies failed to replicate Turner et al.'s <xref rid="pone.0110639-Turner1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> positive findings in the same neuropsychological tasks with healthy non-sleep deprived individuals <xref rid="pone.0110639-Randall1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0110639-Randall3" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Winder-Rhodes et al. <xref rid="pone.0110639-WinderRhodes1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> argued that the influence of modafinil may be subtle, restricted to challenging tasks and limited in healthy non-sleep-deprived participants.</p><p>Consistent with these negative findings, a series of studies with healthy volunteers by Randall et al. <xref rid="pone.0110639-Randall1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0110639-Randall3" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> failed to find any effect of 100 or 200 mg of modafinil on spatial working memory, logic memory, the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test, symbol copy, digit cancellation, verbal fluency, ID/ED-an attentional set-shifting task, trail A/B task, verbal fluency, clock drawing, visual delayed matching to sample, spatial planning, digit span, sustained attention, logical memory, Stroop and verbal fluency tasks.</p><p>Turner et al., <xref rid="pone.0110639-Turner2" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> reported that modafinil improved cognition and response inhibition in adults diagnosed with Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), a condition often characterized by impulsivity, inattention, and hyperactivity. However, Turner et al. <xref rid="pone.0110639-Turner2" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> found that the observed sustained attention and accuracy by modafinil was due to the drug slowing response latency. This is consistent with earlier evidence from healthy non-sleep deprived individuals suggesting that, relative to placebo, modafinil increases performance accuracy in conjunction with a slowing of response latency on several tasks <xref rid="pone.0110639-Turner1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.</p><p>Pre-clinically, there is also evidence that treatment of mice with modafinil produces a delay-dependent enhancement in spatial working memory <xref rid="pone.0110639-Bracocha1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, a cognitive function that depends critically upon alertness and attention. However, in a subsequent study of the role of modafinil as a potential enhancer of attentional processes in rat, Waters et al., <xref rid="pone.0110639-Waters1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> reported that modafinil failed to significantly enhance five-choice serial reaction time test performance under standard conditions. Similarly, modafinil was unable to reverse the deficits in accuracy and/or increased omission errors induced by either parametric or pharmacological manipulations. Indeed, at higher doses, it was reported that modafinil caused an increase in premature responding or impulsivity under certain test conditions. These investigators concluded that they had found no evidence to support a modafinil-induced improvement in response control; rather, under conditions of increased attentional load, modafinil appeared to facilitate impulsive responding <xref rid="pone.0110639-Waters1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.</p><p>One explanation for the lack of cognitive enhancing effects of modafinil in these studies might be that the drug could have highly cognitive domain-specific effects, and thereby affect neuropsychological test performance only to the extent that such domains are critically involved in the performance on that test. Alternatively, it is possible that modafinil does not improve cognition in a meaningful way in most healthy individuals. Conceivably, positive results in some studies could be due to the presence of sufficient numbers of individuals with a relatively low level of alertness, such that the known wakefulness-enhancing effect of the drug improves performance on certain tasks that are relatively sensitive to modest decrements in alertness. The foregoing negative studies, in addition to other evidence supporting the notion that modafinil does not always improve or enhance several neuropsychological task measures <xref rid="pone.0110639-Minzenberg1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0110639-Advokat1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, raise the possibility that modafinil may be mechanistically unable to enhance certain task-specific, sophisticated problem-solving abilities in healthy individuals <xref rid="pone.0110639-Mohamed1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.</p><p>These conflicting results challenge the view that modafinil is a &#x0201c;broad spectrum&#x0201d; cognitive enhancer, particularly in humans who exhibit presumably neurotypical levels of cognitive function and alertness/arousal. Moreover, the mechanisms by which modafinil exerts its known therapeutic effects in patients with narcolepsy are still unclear <xref rid="pone.0110639-Minzenberg1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0110639-Repantis1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Furthermore, despite the high level of reported off-label use of modafinil as a cognitive enhancer <xref rid="pone.0110639-Mohamed2" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, the mechanisms by which modafinil modulates cognitive and affective processes in healthy individuals are currently unknown and need to be thoroughly investigated <xref rid="pone.0110639-Mohamed3" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0110639-Mohamed6" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Crucially, and more specifically, it is still unclear how modafinil affects cognitive domains that involve response initiation and inhibition in healthy individuals.</p><p>In view of the foregoing evidence that modafinil increases performance accuracy in conjunction with a slowing of response latency on several tasks, an outstanding question regarding the effects of modafinil on cognitive responses is whether the drug generally increases the latency of response to all cognitive tasks or whether it increases the latency of response only for tasks that measure impulsivity and require cognitive and behavioural control. If modafinil is acting selectively as a cognitive enhancer, the drug would be expected to reduce impulsivity in tasks that require preparedness and cognitively controlled responses while not slowing the responses during tasks that require both planning and quick decision making. However, if modafinil is acting non-selectively to slow the rate of responding, regardless of the task requirements, then the apparent cognitive performance-enhancing effects of the drug for certain tasks might be more correctly understood as an indirect effect rather than a direct cognition-enhancing mode of action.</p><p>The aim of the current experiment was to address this question by investigating the effects of modafinil on the HSCT, a robust neuropsychological measure of response initiation and response inhibition <xref rid="pone.0110639-Burgess1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> that is highly sensitive to frontal lobe dysfunction <xref rid="pone.0110639-Hornberger1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0110639-Burgess2" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Previous neuropsychological research has consistently shown that patients with neuropsychiatric disorders and those with brain damage perform significantly worse on the HSCT than neurologically healthy individuals <xref rid="pone.0110639-Burgess1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0110639-Volle1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, as do patients with narcolepsy <xref rid="pone.0110639-Naumann1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. The HSCT requires quick and accurate responses and activates brain areas that are dependent on language retrieval, semantic activation and selection in semantic search <xref rid="pone.0110639-Gabrieli1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. For example, studies using positron emission tomography (PET) <xref rid="pone.0110639-Collette1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref> and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) <xref rid="pone.0110639-NathanielJames1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref> that examined the cortical areas involved during the performance of the HSCT have shown that response initiation processes are associated with increases of activity in the left inferior frontal gyrus (BA 10/45/47), whereas response inhibition processes increased the left prefrontal areas, including the middle (BA 9 and BA 10) and inferior (BA 45) frontal areas. The left frontal areas (BA 45) are important for semantic response selection when there are numerous alternatives available <xref rid="pone.0110639-Collette2" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Hence, we used the HSCT to investigate the effects of modafinil on response inhibition and response initiation in healthy volunteers. Based on the above reviewed studies, we hypothesized that modafinil will increase the latency of response to the HSCT. Furthermore, we hypothesized that modafinil will not improve accuracy of the HSCT.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethical approval</title><p>The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0110639.s001">Checklist S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0110639.s002">Protocol S1</xref>.</p><p>The study was approved by the East of England&#x02013;Cambridge Central Research and Ethics Committee (LRECT No: 10/H0305/39) and the Medicines and Health Care Products Regulatory Agency <xref rid="pone.0110639-MHRA1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, the national drug licensing agency, London.

A qualified psychologist screened all volunteers for the presence of any of the pre-specified exclusion criteria. Participants were excluded if they had any significant psychiatric history, visual or motor impairment, or the concurrent use of any psychotropic medications or any medication contraindicated with modafinil. In addition, participants with a history of hypertension, cardiac disorders, epilepsy, and drug or alcohol abuse were also excluded. All participants were advised not to consume alcohol or caffeine for 12 hours before the testing sessions. A computer, using separate randomization schedules for each drug (modafinil or placebo), performed the randomization (see Randomization and Masking). All participants were questioned about compliance with alcohol and caffeine restrictions before inclusion into the study. A light breakfast or snack and juice were allowed before, but not during the experimental session. Each participant gave a written informed consent prior to testing and received monetary compensation of &#x000a3;25, plus local transport expenses. After participants were assessed by the psychologist, they then completed baseline physiological measures (blood pressure and pulse rate) and the National Adult Reading Test (NART), which is used to calculate estimated IQ and matches participants' level of verbal IQ <xref rid="pone.0110639-Nelson1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. Two consultant neurologists signed off the modafinil medications and the placebo before they were administered and were standing by in case of any adverse effects.

They were then asked to rest in a quiet room. Two hours post-drug administration, participants completed the HSCT. Participants also completed an hourly visual analogue mood scale at four hourly points.

In the first section (automatic completion section), participants were asked to listen carefully to each sentence, and were asked to provide, as quickly as possible, a word that correctly and sensibly completed the sentence. In the remaining sentences (inhibition completion section), participants were asked to complete the sentences, as quickly as possible, with words unrelated to the meaning of the sentences in every way. Participants' responses and reaction times were recorded. The response times were captured by the experimenter with a stopwatch (model: Acctim Tim901r) with 1/100 second lap and split timing. Both sections were scored separately first, and then together, to yield a total score.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Visual analogue scales (VAS, Mood)</title><p>The visual analogue scale (VAS, Bond and Lader <xref rid="pone.0110639-Bond1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>) is a rapid, highly reliable (&#x003b1;&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.76) measure that assesses transient changes in participants feelings <xref rid="pone.0110639-Cella1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>.

Thus, in the present study, there was no evidence of delay-dependent cognitive enhancement by single 200 mg doses of modafinil.</p><p>The slowing effect of modafinil on the HSCT response latency measures is consistent with previous research indicating that modafinil slows latency of response during behavioural tasks in rats <xref rid="pone.0110639-Bracocha1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> and during the performance of cognitive decision-making tasks in patients diagnosed with ADHD <xref rid="pone.0110639-Turner2" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0110639-Turner3" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref> and in healthy non-sleep deprived volunteers <xref rid="pone.0110639-Turner1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. These observations suggest that some beneficial effects of modafinil (e.g., decreasing impulsive responses) may come at the cost of slowing responses in tasks that tap into frontal lobe function and require quick and accurate responses. The present findings indicate that such cognitive response slowing can occur without any commensurate benefit on other parameters of task performance, i.e., in reducing errors on the HSCT.</p><p>The lack of cognitive enhancing effects of modafinil on the HSCT is consistent with previous double-blind, placebo-controlled studies that investigated the effects of modafinil on several neuropsychological tasks but failed to find cognitive enhancing effects in healthy individuals <xref rid="pone.0110639-Mller1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0110639-Randall1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0110639-Turner1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0110639-Mohamed1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0110639-Randall4" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0110639-Randall5" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>. Two recent reviews of the field also corroborate that modafinil does not always improve performance on several neuropsychological tasks <xref rid="pone.0110639-Minzenberg1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0110639-Repantis1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Furthermore, our findings are also consistent with a recent review <xref rid="pone.0110639-Advokat1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> of several widely-used alleged cognitive enhancers, which suggested that, in studies with non-ADHD adults, psychostimulant medications do not promote acquisition of new information and might impair performance of tasks that require adaptation, flexibility and planning. The review concluded that the evidence does not support the conclusion that stimulants are cognitive &#x02018;enhancers&#x02019; <xref rid="pone.0110639-Advokat1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Recently findings on the effects of modafinil on creativity tasks in healthy volunteers support this review <xref rid="pone.0110639-Mohamed1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Taken together, this previous research raises the possibility that modafinil does not improve the performance of certain neuropsychological tasks because these tasks involve not only wakefulness and attentional components, but also sophisticated problem-solving abilities which modafinil may not be able to enhance <xref rid="pone.0110639-Mohamed1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0110639-Mohamed5" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>.</p><p>Alternatively, this published evidence may indicate that modafinil could have highly domain- specific actions, with some functions being enhanced while others are impaired and/or not affected <xref rid="pone.0110639-Mohamed1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. In the current study, modafinil slowed the production of verbal responses on the HSCT without improving the accuracy of performance of the task. Of particular importance is the need to further clarify the robust observed slowing effect of modafinil in healthy individuals, because recent research has found that posterior inferolateral cortical injury also resulted, to a greater extent, in slowing of verbal responses in both the response initiation and inhibition sections of the HSCT <xref rid="pone.0110639-Volle1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Thus, it is still unclear how modafinil affects broad cognitive domains that are beyond attention and alertness. Hence, the mechanisms by which modafinil exerts its cognitive enhancing effects, and on what level it acts as a cognitive enhancing agent in healthy participants, are still unknown.</p><p>The goal of this study was to further explore the previously reported effect of modafinil in enhancing cognitive task performance while slowing performance of the task, which has been referred to as &#x0201c;delay-dependent cognitive enhancement&#x0201d;. This observation raised the question about whether modafinil was acting selectively as a cognitive enhancer, regardless of the temporal demands of the task, or whether the drug acts to slow responding less specifically, without necessarily providing any improvement in the quality of cognitive performance. The results of the present study suggest that the response-slowing effect of modafinil need not result in enhanced cognitive function, at least with respect to the frontal lobe-sensitive executive functions represented by accurate, time-efficient performance of the HSCT. This task is of particular interest with respect to modafinil because individuals with narcolepsy exhibit impaired performance on this task with respect to longer latencies to respond, as well as response errors <xref rid="pone.0110639-Naumann1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. In the present study, modafinil appeared not to enhance the accuracy of performance of the HSCT in healthy individuals but increased the latency of producing verbal responses to the task. These results argue against the notion that the slowing of response time in healthy volunteers is a necessary and sufficient condition for cognitive enhancement with modafinil.</p><p>An important objective of the present study was to explore the reported phenomenon of &#x0201c;delay-dependent cognitive enhancement&#x0201d; with modafinil, because the drug is reportedly widely used &#x0201c;off-label&#x0201d; by healthy individuals with the objective of improving cognitive performance (e.g., in school exams or in the work environment). Assuming that the perceived cognitive benefits of modafinil by off-label users are not merely a placebo response or secondary to an affective response, such as increased task enjoyment <xref rid="pone.0110639-Stoops1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0110639-Baranski2" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>, it is possible that these benefits are related to previously reported, possibly cognitive domain-specific effects of modafinil that are measured by certain neuropsychological tests (e.g., non-verbal response inhibition, measured with the stop-signal task <xref rid="pone.0110639-Turner1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>). Likewise, the response-slowing activity of modafinil, and the relationship of that effect to cognition, could also be domain-specific. In this context, to further understand the basis of modafinil users' reported impressions of enhanced cognition, it may be important to assess these potential benefits with cognitive tests that have demonstrated ecological validity <xref rid="pone.0110639-Chaytor1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref> with respect to the school or work environment in which users have reportedly experienced benefits <xref rid="pone.0110639-Franke1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Although we cannot exclude the possibility that such enhancement could have been seen at a lower dose (e.g., 100 mg) or higher doses than employed in the present study, previous studies demonstrating both delays in responding and cognitive enhancement on selected tasks have reported these effects in a dose-independent manner at both 100 and 200 mg doses of modafinil in healthy participants <xref rid="pone.0110639-Turner1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.</p><p>Finally, since slowed responding in the performance of the HSTC due to modafinil administration is the key finding of this study, it is appropriate to consider the accuracy of the time measurement method used in the study. Previous investigations of the reliability and accuracy of handheld stopwatches compared to electronic timing methods have indicated very high intra-class correlations between these methods, approaching 0.99 <xref rid="pone.0110639-Hetzler1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0110639-Mayhew1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>. In addition, the response times were captured by the experimenter with a stopwatch with 1/100 second lap and split timing accuracy, and the mean response times of the modafinil group were almost double the mean response times of the placebo group, which are much greater than the demonstrated measurement error for stopwatches. Hence, it is unlikely that the findings were influenced by how the experimenter captured the data. The findings suggest that that modafinil increases the latency of response in the HSCT in healthy volunteers, a phenomenon which requires additional study.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, the goal of this study was to investigate the effects of modafinil on the HSCT, which is sensitive to frontal lobe function. Our results show that relative to placebo, participants administered modafinil were significantly slower in the performance of the task overall. This finding is consistent with previous research indicating that modafinil slows latency of response during cognitive tasks in patients diagnosed with ADHD and in healthy non-sleep deprived volunteers. The lack of improvement in accuracy of performance on the HSCT following modafinil administration extends previous research with healthy volunteers that also failed to find cognitive-enhancing effects of modafinil on several neuropsychological tasks. We suggest that future studies should investigate the effects of modafinil with testing procedures that involve not only basic executive functions but also cognitive flexibility, language retrieval, and creativity, as well as tasks that exhibit &#x0201c;ecological validity&#x0201d; with respect to the demanding environments in which this drug is often used. Investigating these higher order cognitive processes is likely to lead to better understanding of the effects of modafinil on cognition in healthy individuals. In sum, the current study shows that modafinil increases the latency of response to the HSCT without improving accuracy of the task, and thus provides new information to better define the limits of cognitive enhancement with this drug.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0110639.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>
