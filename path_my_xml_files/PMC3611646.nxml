Senile Memory Impairment is a common condition characterized by mild symptoms of cognitive decline and occurs as a part of the normal aging process. It can be correlated to &#x0201c;<italic>Jarajanya Smrtibhramsha</italic>&#x0201d; according to <italic>Ayurveda</italic>. The present study deals with the efficacy of <italic>Guduchyadi Medhya Rasayana</italic> on Senile Memory Impairment. A total of 138 patients aged in between 55&#x02013;75 years were registered and randomly divided into two groups as the trial and control groups. The drugs were administered for 3. The trial drug showed memory enhancement, anti-stress, anti-depressant and anxiolytic properties. The trial group showed better results in the management compared to the control group.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Aging</kwd><kwd><italic>Guduchyadi Medhya Rasayana</italic></kwd><kwd>Senile Memory Impairment</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1-1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Aging has become a great issue for many countries due to a worldwide life prolongation. Number of people over 60 years has grown rapidly to 10% of the world population.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] In India too, in the last decade, increasing population aged has been projected significantly.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] So, it is associated with physiological, functional, and pathological changes affecting physical, psychological, emotional and social well-being.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] The major consequences of the increasing number of individuals in advanced age group is the increase in number of patients suffering from age-related disorders. Conservative estimation revealed that 25% of the elderly persons have significant psychiatric symptoms[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] and the number of psychologicaly ill elderly persons was estimated to be 9 million in the year 2005.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] Though psychological disorders are common among the aged, it frequently remains undetected and untreated. It induces functional disability, disturbs rehabilitation, burdens the health system and impairs the quality of life of elderly individuals.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] Research based on the psychological health revealed that age-associated cognitive like memory disorders are found in high prevalence among the aged.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] Subjective complaints from individuals with age-associated memory impairment often include difficulties in remembering names and words, etc. So, this condition is the result of physiological changes in the aging brain and not a specific neurological disorder.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] In Ayurveda literature, impairment of memory is mentioned as <italic>Smritibhramsha</italic> which occurs due to vitiation of <italic>Rajas</italic> and <italic>Tamas Doshas</italic> in the mind.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] The appearance of <italic>Jara</italic> (aging) at the appropriate age is termed as &#x0201c;<italic>Kalaja Jara</italic>&#x0201d;,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] and memory impairment appears as a clinical <italic>Rupa</italic> (feature) of <italic>Jara</italic>,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] hence Senile Memory Impairment can be correlated as <italic>Jarajanya Smritibhramsha</italic> according to Ayurveda.</p><p>In <italic>Sarangadhara Samhita</italic>, it is clearly emphasized that <italic>Medha</italic> (intellect) and <italic>Buddhi</italic> (wisdom) deteriorate in the fourth and ninth decades of life accordingly.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] Both are closely associated with the mind and help for the normal function of the mind. If these components decrease in the mind, then it will affect the normal function of mind.</p><p>Moreover, <italic>Caraka</italic> has noted that cognitive functions are thoroughly affected in old age as <italic>Grahana</italic> (power of understanding), <italic>Dharana</italic> (power of retention), <italic>Smarana</italic> (power of memorizing), <italic>Vachana</italic> (speech) and functions of sense organs qualitatively.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>]</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Importance of <italic>Medhya Rasayana</italic> on aging</title><p>The aging process occurs over all the body. It does not occur in the same way in every human being. People&#x02019;s lifestyles also have additional influence on aging.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] The decline in brain weight and volume, degeneration of intracellular organelles, changes in cellular DNA and RNA, neuronal degeneration as well as significant loss of synapses are the salient features of aging in the brain.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] Therefore, psychological and neurological manifestations often form the hallmark of senility. Hence, Ayurveda clearly emphasizes that in the fourth and ninth decades of lifespan, individuals are subjected to the loss of <italic>Medha</italic> (intellect) and <italic>Buddhi</italic> (wisdom). Hence, it seems therapeutic measures of <italic>Medhya Rasayanas</italic> are exclusively needed for elders because they are brain tonics and improve the psychological faculties.

On the basis of <italic>Rasapanchaka</italic>, the pharmacotherapeutic properties reveal that it contains <italic>Katu, Tikta</italic> and <italic>Madhura</italic> in <italic>Rasa</italic>, and the effect of <italic>Katu</italic> and <italic>Madhura</italic> in <italic>Vipaka</italic>. Moreover, due to various properties of <italic>Tikshna, Laghu, Ruksha, Sara, Guru and Snigdha</italic>, it possesses markedly <italic>Ushna Virya</italic> and <italic>mildly Sheeta Virya</italic>. Accordingly, GMR was considered to be an effective treatment for <italic>Tridoshahara</italic>. In Ayurveda, it is clearly emphasized that <italic>Smritibhramsha</italic> (memory impairment) results due to <italic>Rajas</italic> and <italic>Tamasdoshas</italic> in the mind. These <italic>doshas are</italic> responsible for producing <italic>avarana</italic> over the mind. The relief from the symptoms has been found to be statistically highly significant.</p><p>These observations reveal that the drug might have counteracted or pacified <italic>Raja</italic> and <italic>Tamo Doshas</italic>, so <italic>Avarana</italic> of mind was removed and the disease was subsided or controlled. Further pharmacological studies have proven that <italic>Vaca</italic> (<italic>Acorus calemus</italic> Linn.) and <italic>Shankhapushpi</italic> (<italic>Convolvulus pluricaulis</italic> Chois) have anxiolytic, memory enhancing, anti-stress, antidepressant, tranquilizing and sedative activities.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>] Further, it was found that there was a significant improvement by 14.84% on the total score of the Mini Mental State Examination [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>]. So, these evidences indicate the positive role of <italic>Medhya</italic> property of GMR on Senile Memory Impairment among elderly individuals. Considering the symptoms of memory impairment along with the cognitive decline, a highly significant result was obtained both from GMR and SG [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>]. However, in comparison, GMR has given better relief for the majority of symptoms [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>]. The <italic>Medhya Rasayanas</italic> are special Ayurvedic neuro nutraceuticals which are specific to brain and nervous system. They are claimed to promote cognitive function of the brain.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>] Further, it was mentioned in the <italic>Caraka Samhita</italic> that <italic>Shankhapushpi</italic>, a <italic>Rasayana</italic> drug, has the property of promoting intellect.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>] Moreover, Group B also showed improvement of memory due to the <italic>Medhya</italic> effect of ghee.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>] The serum AChE value has shown an upper range in both the groups before the treatment and a significant decrease was observed after the treatment in Group A [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T6">Table 6</xref>]. The recent advances in clinical research reveal that AChE activity is increased in human cerebrospinal fluid during aging[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>] and scientists believe that dementia-related memory issues stem from the increased breakdown of acetylcholine due to a preponderance of AChE which degrades acetylcholine.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>] Furthermore, a decrease in AChE activity has noted in the treated animals, leading to an increase in the cholinergic activity in the brain.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>] The significant reduction of AChE in Group A shows that GMR exerts its effect on memory enhancement by increasing the cholinergic function by preventing the breakdown of acetylcholine in the aging human brain.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Senile Memory Impairment can be correlated to <italic>Jarajanya Smritibhramsha</italic> according to Ayurveda, and imbalance of <italic>Trigunas</italic> through aggravation of <italic>Rajas</italic> and <italic>Tamas Doshas</italic> in the mind leads to development of Senile Memory Impairment among elders. Modern literature reveals that Senile Memory Impairment is closely associated with cognitive decline during aging. All the patients of Senile Memory Impairment were having features of impairment of short memory and long memory in this study. <italic>Manasika Nidana</italic> (psychic factors), <italic>Aharaja</italic> (dietary) and <italic>Viharaja</italic> (behavioral) factors, which were reported by the patients, play a major role in the pathogenesis of Senile Memory Impairment by vitiating <italic>Rajas</italic> and <italic>Tamas Doshas</italic> in the mind. Those factors were <italic>Chinta</italic> (thoughts), <italic>Krodha</italic> (anger), <italic>Shoka</italic> (worries), <italic>Chittodvega</italic> (anxiety), <italic>Bhaya</italic> (fear), <italic>Moha</italic> (illusions), <italic>Ruksha Ahara</italic> (dried food), <italic>Ratri Jagarana</italic> (awaking at night), etc. GMR has shown statistically highly significant improvement on short memory impairment as well as long memory impairment in Senile Memory Impairment, at the level of <italic>P</italic>`0.001. Reduction of AChE showed enhancement of memory functions due to improvement of cholinergic actions in the human brain in the trial group (Group A). GMR has shown memory enhancing, antidepressant, anti-stress, and anxiolytic potential.
