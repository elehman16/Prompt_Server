Some of these methods consist of patients' referral to care centers or home visits by health care personnel. Although these methods are effective, they require human resources, time, and are very expensive;[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] therefore, in recent years, the use of mobile phone in following up patients with heart disease has increased, which enables nurses to monitor the patient, train them, and perform nursing interventions.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] One of the principal functions of mobile phones is text messaging,[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] which is efficient, easy, and cost-effective.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] However, many cases are one-sided and there are few cases where there is an interaction between the patient and the nurse.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Using a mobile phone makes it possible for both the sides to interact with one another.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] This interaction makes patients motivated to change their behavior and it makes it easier for them to reach their goals.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>The efficacy of text message follow-up in the management of ACS and healthy behaviors has been studied in a number of previous studies.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] Conflicting results have been obtained from these studies regarding the efficiency of this method; whereas the results of a number of these studies confirm the positive effect of the text message follow-up on changing patients' healthy behaviors.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] The results of a number ofthese studies showed that this method hadbeen unable to affect the healthy behaviors of the patients or management of risk factors.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] For instance, Dale <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] (2015) in Auckland hospital, New Zealand aimed to review the effect of a comprehensive rehabilitation program using text message on healthy lifestyle, depression, and anxiety. For 24 weeks, a message was sent to the patients on a daily basis and they were able to ask their own questions. Three months after the beginning of the program, the results showed that sending text message improved healthy lifestyle (<italic>P</italic> = 0.03), but had no significant impact on anxiety and depression (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05).[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] The number of these patients is increasing in Iran, with majority being old; it might be difficult for such patients to attend the follow-up sessions. Moreover, nurses are the key members of the health care team who have the most significant relationship with the patients in the health care centers; therefore, they need an appropriate method to use. Taking into consideration the conflicting results of the previous studies and the fact that other methods have been used in such studies along with this one, it is clear that there are only few studies that have focused on the effect of using text messages on the lifestyle of patients diagnosed with ACS. Thus, the present study aims to determine the effect of this method on the health-improving lifestyle of these patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>The present study was a clinical trial (IRCT 2015111625077N1). The study participants consisted of patients with ACS who hospitalized in the cardiac wards of Shahid Chamran Hospital (Isfahan, Iran) during October&#x02013;February 2016. The sample size was calculated according to power analysis at 95% confidence interval and 80% power, with 43 individuals in each group. Because of the possibility of loss of participants, in total, 100 individuals were included in the study. The participants were randomly divided into two groups (100 same-sized cards). Number 1 was written on 50 of them and number 2 was written on the other 50. All of the 100 cards were put in a sealed envelope. Then each of the participant was asked to choose a card at the time of the random division. If the card they picked said number 1, they would be in the intervention group, and if it said 2, they would be in the control group.</p><p>The inclusion criteria consisted of diagnosis of ACS by a cardiologist,[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] age 35&#x02013;70 years,[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] lack of any recognizedmental condition or mental and motor disabilities,[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] havingaccess to a personal or family mobile phone,[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] being able to read and write and being familiar with Farsi,[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] not having any problems with their vision, having access to a third person who can type and read the text messages for them,[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] being able to do the daily activities,[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] the cardiologist confirmed that the selected patients were eligible for receiving text messages, and finally, their normal blood tests (creatinine, potassium, and blood urea nitrogen).

The data collection tool comprised two parts. The first part consisted of questions on demographic characteristics andinformation on the disease (age, gender, education, marital status, history of risk factors such as hyperglycemia, hypertension, dyslipidemia, smoking, and history of hospitalization). The second part consisted of Walker's standard health-promoting lifestyle questionnaire that has six subscales (nutrition, physical activity, stress management, interpersonal relationships, health responsibility, and self-realization). This questionnaire is scored using a four-point Likert scale (1 = never, 2 = sometimes, 3 = often, and 4 = always). The minimum score of the questionnaire is 52 and the maximum score is 208. A separate score can be calculated for each area and a higher score is an indication of a better health condition.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] The reliability and validity of this questionnaire has been calculated in Iran, and a Cronbach's alpha of 82% has been calculated for the tools and Cronbach's alpha of 64% to 91% have been reported for the subcategories. The total reliability of the test was 91% and the reliability of the food, physical activity, stress management, interpersonal relationships, taking on responsibility, and self- realization dimensions were 089, 075, 0.78, 0.80, 0.78, and 0.71, respectively.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] In the present study, The Cronbach's alpha of the scale was0.84, and these patients were eliminated from the study. The patients were informed of the goals of the study and informed consents were obtained from them. Then, the researcher's colleague filled out the questionnaire through interviews with the patients without any information about the groups and the purposes of the study. After primary data collection, mobile phone number of the patients were obtained. To ensure that messages were sent, the researcher activated the delivered option in her mobile phone. Then, the researcher sent one of the prepared messages to ensure that the messages were sent and received at the same time.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] The patients were asked to give an alternate mobile phone number to the researcher in case they failed to receive more than two messages so that they would receive others.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Finally, the participants were randomly divided into two groups.</p><p>During the 12 weeks of the text message follow-up, six messages were sent to the participants in the experimental group each week (except the weekends) between 8 AM and 8 PM. If the participants had any questions regarding their disease or their medicine or text messages, they could ask questions from 8 AM to 8 PM via text messages and the researcher would reply to the questions. In addition, the number of messages exchanged between the participants and the researcher was increased for this purpose. Each message had a maximum of 160 characters.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] The context of the text messages sent to the intervention group comprised training based on the content of the dimensions of Walker's health-promoting lifestyle questionnaireand risk factors of ACS [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>].[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] For instance, a message sent to the participants was: Use less salt while cooking food and use garlic or herbs powder instead.

In this respect, the study by Khonsari <italic>et al</italic>. was performed with the aim of determining the effect of a reminder system using an automated text message service on medication adherence following ACS. They found no significant difference between the two groups in terms of demographic variables, information on the disease, medication adherence, and physical activity.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</p><p>The results of the present study showed that, 3 and 4 months after the beginning of the intervention, mean of the total score and dimensions of lifestyle were significantly higher in the intervention group than those in the control group. In this respect, Maddison <italic>et al</italic>. studied the effect and the cost-effectiveness of interventions using mobile phone on the physical capacity and physical activity of patients with ischemic heart disease.

Hence, it was expected that, as time passed and the symptoms improved, patients in the control group showed more behaviors which were indicative of better health. In addition, the information obtained from the treatment team, peers, and media can influence patients' health-related behaviors,[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and sending messages regarding health care can make the results significant. Nonetheless, the results of this study showed that the mean of the total score and the score of the dimensions of lifestyle in the intervention group 3 and 4 months after the beginning of the intervention were higher than the control group. This indicates that the interactive text message follow-up is effective. The study byBoroumand and Moeini was performed with the aim of determining the efficacy of afollow-up program via text messages and telephone on the self-efficacy of patients with coronary heart disease. They found that at the three different times of the study, the scores of cardiac self-efficacy of patients in the experimental group were significantly different (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) and the score of cardiac self-efficacy was significantly higher 3 and 4 months after the beginning of the intervention than that before the intervention.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] The study bySadri <italic>et al</italic>. was performed with the aim of comparing two methods of text messages (interactive and noninteractive) on anticoagulant adherence of patients with prosthetic heart valve. They found that text message follow-up led to an increase in the mean of the score of anticoagulant adherence in three groups, however, the scores were higher in the interactive group. This result indicates that using text messages to interact with the patients effects anticoagulant adherence (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001), and a significant difference was seen between the score of anticoagulant adherence in groups with the interactive and noninteractive methods of text messages after the intervention (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05).[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Unlike the present study, Frederix <italic>et al</italic>. performed a study on the effect of a comprehensive rehabilitation program via the internet and text messaging in patients with coronary heart disease. They found that the number of steps taken per day increased in the experimental group, however, the mean of the score of physical activity was not significant and no change was seen in the weight and blood pressure of the patients.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</p><p>The most important limitation of the present study is that the information were obtained from other sources such as treatment team and media which could affect patients' lifestyle and could not be controlled. Another limitation is that the study was done in a health center. It is suggested that further studies be conducted in various centers with a bigger population. Another limitation was the short follow-up time after intervention. Therefore, it is suggested that further studies be conducted in this respect with longer duration.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>According to the findings of the present study, an interactive text message follow-up is a proper method for promoting the lifestyle of patients with ACS. Because ACS is very prevalent and it is essentially important to follow-up, sample and cheap methods have been used to promote the lifestyle of these patients. It also seems that text message follow-up reduces the patients' need to visit the treatment team when it is not necessary. This method can also give the patients quick and easy access to health-related information, and if this relationship is interactive, it can reinforce people's motive to change their behavior and achieve their goals more successfully. When patients ask their questions via text messages, they will be more motivated to read their messages and do not look at them as advertisement and insignificant. In this case, nurses are the key members of the health care team who have the most communication with the patients and have a more comprehensive understanding of the needs of patients in terms of promoting their lifestyle and can use the findings of this study to follow up patients suffering from ACS.</p><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Isfahan University of Medical Sciences.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgement</title><p>This study was derived from the Masters' thesis with the research code of 394473 in Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran.
