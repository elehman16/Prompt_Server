The present study was designed to investigate whether the essential amino acid (EAA) enriched high-protein enteral nutrition (EN) modulates the insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) system and activates the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) anabolic signaling pathway in a trauma-hemorrhagic shock (T-HS) rat model.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>Male Sprague-Dawley rats (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;90, 278.18&#x000b1;0.94 g) were randomly assigned to 5 groups: (1) normal control, (2) pair-fed, (3) T-HS, (4) T-HS and standard EN, and (5) T-HS and EAA enriched high-protein EN. Six animals from each group were harvested on days 2, 4, and 6 for serum, gastrocnemius, soleus, and extensor digitorum longus sample collection. T-HS significantly reduced muscle mass. Nutrition support maintained muscle mass, especially the EAA enriched high-protein EN. Meanwhile, a pronounced derangement in IGF-1-IGFBPs axis as well as impaired mTOR transduction was observed in the T-HS group. Compared with animals receiving standard EN, those receiving EAA enriched high-protein EN presented 18% higher serum free IGF-1 levels following 3 days of nutrition support and 22% higher after 5 days. These changes were consistent with the concomitant elevation in serum insulin and reduction in corticosterone levels.

Nearly 20% of total body protein can be lost in critically ill patients <xref rid="pone.0077823-Biolo1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, and this severely negative nitrogen balance can adversely affect morbidity and mortality. The erosion of lean body mass is undoubtedly multifactorial <xref rid="pone.0077823-Skipworth1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0077823-Klaude1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>; but it is in part attributed to the reduction in circulating insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) levels or IGF-1 signaling <xref rid="pone.0077823-Okamoto1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0077823-Elijah1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. In normal physiological state, IGF-1 bonds to the type-1 cell-surface receptor and then exerts an anabolic effect by activating the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-protein kinase B (PKB/Akt)-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway <xref rid="pone.0077823-Janssen1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0077823-Clemmons1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Stimulation of mTOR complex1 (mTORC1) contributes to the phosphorylations of two key downstream effectors, eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) and p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase1 (p70S6K1), which then induce protein translation initiation <xref rid="pone.0077823-Howell1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0077823-Ma1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. The sustained decrease in circulating IGF-1 levels under catabolic states is thus believed to be responsible, at least in part, for the impaired IGF-1 bioactivity and damaged muscle protein anabolism.</p><p>IGF-1 circulating in the peripheral vasculature bonds to specific binding proteins. Approximate 95% of circulating IGF-1 forms a ternary complex consisting with insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3) and an acid-labile subunit (ALS) <xref rid="pone.0077823-Kelley1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. This ternary complex regulates the biologic effect of IGF-1, functioning as a storage reservoir of IGF-1 in plasma and extending its half-life.</p><p>Endogenous IGF-1 synthesis is quite sensitive to nutrient availability. In previous work, a 60% reduction in plasma IGF-1 concentrations as well as 8% decrease in gastrocnemius mass was observed in rats receiving a protein-free diet, while recovering to normal after standard casein diet refeeding <xref rid="pone.0077823-Gomes1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Dietary protein intake is also associated with IGF-1 status and whole-body nitrogen economy <xref rid="pone.0077823-SanchezGomez1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. In patients with recent hip fracture, a significant elevation of serum IGF-1 levels was observed as early as 7 days after 20 g/(kg&#x000b7;d) protein supplementation <xref rid="pone.0077823-Chevalley1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Meanwhile, clinical study revealed that amino acid infusion during anesthesia could attenuate the decrease in IGF-1 levels and maintain glucose homeostasis after surgery <xref rid="pone.0077823-Wallin1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. These results collectively indicated that elevated serum IGF-1 levels appeared to be associated with the response to protein or amino acid supplementation during fasting or stress period. In addition, Takenaka <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0077823-Takenaka1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> reported that dietary restriction of signal essential amino acid (EAA) decreased IGF-1 production, suggesting that adequate EAA in diet might be required for the IGF-1 synthesis. A recent study regarding acute regulation of the IGF-1 system by macronutrients further demonstrated that EAA/carbohydrate mixture ingestion following high-intensity exercise promoted a significant increase in circulating free IGF-1 levels <xref rid="pone.0077823-Foster1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p><p>The essential role of nutrition support for critically ill patients is to promote protein anabolism and protect the lean body mass and function. Historically, providing equivalent amounts of protein or amino acids in nutrition support attempted to counteract the dramatic nitrogen loss <xref rid="pone.0077823-McClave1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. However, it remains to be elucidated whether adequate protein intake modulates the stress response and muscle protein anabolism during critical illness through the IGF-1 system regulation.</p><p>Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to investigate the role of long-term enteral nutrition (EN), in particular EAA enriched high-protein EN, upon the regulation of IGF-1 system function and downstream mTOR-related signaling transduction in a Sprague-Dawley (SD) rat model of trauma-hemorrhagic shock (T-HS). Serum levels of insulin and corticosterone were also measured, since both factors were implicated in the regulation of IGF-1 by their respective roles in IGFBP regulation <xref rid="pone.0077823-Wojnar1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Animals</title><p>Male SD rats weighted 278.18&#x000b1;0.94 g (Medical Experiment Animal Center of Jinling Hospital, Nanjing, China) were housed in a temperature (25&#x0223c;28&#x000b0;C) and light (12&#x02236;12-hour light-dark cycle) controlled environment for 1 week prior to the experiment.

Our study illustrates that EAA enriched high-protein EN favors early recovery of the IGF-1 system in T-HS injured rats, accompanying with the obvious muscle mass maintenance and downstream mTOR pathway activation, which indicates effective stimulation of muscle protein translation initiation. These results provide valuable insight into the metabolic regulation stimulated by high-protein nutrition support during the stress response to critical illness.</p><p>The composition of EAA supplementation used in this study contained a large proportion of leucine. Recently, leucine is shown to be capable of stimulating insulin secretion <xref rid="pone.0077823-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0077823-Amaral1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. This is consistent with our data, which the insulin levels were highest in the T-HS/EAA group by day 4 compared with the T-HS/SE and T-HS/Ctr groups. As reported, insulin is a known regulator to inhibit hepatic IGFBP-1 production <xref rid="pone.0077823-Frost1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, and elevated IGFBP-1 levels under catabolic stress can act to inhibit the anabolic effect of IGF-1 <xref rid="pone.0077823-Lang1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. In the present study, serum IGFBP-1 concentrations appeared to correlate well with these data, displaying dramatically decreasing levels that were consistent with the increase in circulating insulin levels observed in enterally fed rats at the time point coinciding with the emergence of elevation in serum free IGF-1 levels. And this response appeared more pronounced in the T-HS/EAA group than T-HS/SE group. Regression analysis of insulin and IGF-1 further indicated a strong positive correlation (<italic>y</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.038<italic>x</italic>&#x02212;1.08; <italic>R<sup>2</sup></italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.483; <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.01), which was in line with the previous work <xref rid="pone.0077823-Wojnar1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.</p><p>However, Ma <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0077823-Ma2" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> found that hepatic IGFBP-1 gene expression was dramatically increased immediately following T-HS along with hyperinsulinemia at 90 and 210 minutes. This does not entirely fit with our results, which appears to depend upon the different time points selected. During the &#x0201c;ebb&#x0201d; phase of injury, insulin levels are commonly decreased or remain unchanged <xref rid="pone.0077823-Wilmore1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0077823-Carey1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Insulin requires the PI3K pathway for inhibition of hepatic IGFBP-1 production <xref rid="pone.0077823-Guo1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Hepatic insulin resistance, characterized by a defect in insulin-induced PI3K-Akt signal transduction, rapidly develops within 90 minutes following T-HS <xref rid="pone.0077823-Ma2" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, but may have been alleviated within 48 hours post-T-HS in the present study.</p><p>Endogenous glucocorticoids also mediate IGFBP-1 production. Previous work demonstrated that pretreating animals with glucocorticoid receptor antagonist RU486 partially prevented burn-induced increase in IGFBP-1 and further contributed to the increase in plasma IGF-1 levels <xref rid="pone.0077823-Lang2" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. The enterally fed rats in the present study appeared to have an early reduction in serum corticosterone levels following T-HS, which is possibly related to the modulation of host defense by enteral nutrients <xref rid="pone.0077823-Minard1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. This change was correlated with decreased IGFBP-1 as well as increased IGF-1 levels following 3 days of nutrition support.</p><p>Previous studies using a similar EAA formula or leucine alone to investigate the stimulatory effect upon skeletal muscle protein synthesis did not demonstrate changes in serum IGF-1 <xref rid="pone.0077823-Fujita1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0077823-Pedrosa1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0077823-Lang3" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Despite various experimental conditions, those studies measured total IGF-1, instead of free levels. Meanwhile, acute dosing of EAA or leucine solution on the background of inadequate nutrient availability is not sufficient for stimulation of IGF-1 production. In our study, we provided a high-protein diet to the T-HS/EAA animals, with additional EAA supplementation based on the standard EN formula, to investigate the changes in free IGF-1 levels, which represent the &#x0201c;bioavailable&#x0201d; portion of the IGF-1 pool in the circulation <xref rid="pone.0077823-Foster1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Our study indicated that feeding with EAA enriched high-protein EN greatly increased serum free IGF-1 levels compared with the standard EN-fed rats as early as at day 4. This is a desirable outcome, since it has been concluded that IGF-1 plays an important role in skeletal muscle mass maintenance <xref rid="pone.0077823-Yang2" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. In our study, significantly increased muscle mass, especially in the fast-twitch gastrocnemius muscle, was identified 2 days following T-HS in the T-HS/EAA group.</p><p>We also detected that EAA enriched high-protein EN significantly enhanced the activation of mTOR signaling pathway; phosphorylations of mTOR and its downstream effector S6K1 in rats receiving EAA enriched high-protein formula increased nearly two-fold compared with those receiving standard EN. Recently, a large body of evidence has established that amino acid, especially leucine, can be considered as a signaling molecule to stimulate protein translation initiation through an Akt-independent pathway. Acute leucine ingestion can effectively increase protein synthesis and promote the mTOR-related signaling transduction in both normal and stress conditions <xref rid="pone.0077823-Dickinson1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0077823-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. The stimulation of muscle protein synthesis, as previously reported by Boh&#x000e9; <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0077823-Boh1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, was positively associated with blood EAA concentrations in a dose-response manner. In our study, blood amino acid analysis revealed that leucine and other EAA were significantly increased after EAA enriched high-protein EN treatment. Thus, we speculate that the response to muscle protein translation initiation induced by EAA enriched high-protein EN may be partly attributed to the nutrient-mediated mTOR signaling regulation.</p><p>The PI3K-Akt pathway, upstream of mTOR, can be phosphorylated by ligands including IGF-1 and insulin and that in turn stimulates the mTOR phosphorylation to induce the muscle protein translation initiation. Previous studies demonstrated the rapid development of insulin resistance in skeletal muscle following T-HS, with the earliest insulin signaling defect occurring at 60 minutes <xref rid="pone.0077823-Chaudry1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0077823-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Zhai <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0077823-Zhai1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref> further indicated that the T-HS-induced acute muscle insulin resistance was specific to 6- and 10- week old rats, but not the post-weaning. However, the insulin signaling defect is not permanent. Thompson <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0077823-Thompson1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref> reported that insulin-induced phospho-Akt signaling in skeletal muscle would be gradually restored by 5 and 24 hours following fluid resuscitation. Therefore, it can reasonably be inferred that muscle insulin resistance is a metabolic feature in the acute phase of T-HS, and the diminished signaling transduction associated with the PI3K-Akt pathway may be partially responsible for the increased muscle protein wasting following T-HS.</p><p>In our study, three later time points following T-HS were selected. Activated Akt was observed at day 6 in both enterally fed groups, but with greater in rats receiving EAA enriched high-protein EN, coinciding with the emergence of significant elevation in both insulin and IGF-1 levels. Previous studies demonstrated the protein retention effect of insulin was likely to be exerted by reducing the protein catabolism after trauma or surgery, because no correlation between changes in muscle protein synthesis and insulin sensitivity was found <xref rid="pone.0077823-Thorell1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0077823-Thorell2" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. However, administration of IGF-1 effectively attenuates the inhibition of protein synthesis in sepsis or trauma and further ameliorates the loss of muscle mass <xref rid="pone.0077823-Nystrom1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0077823-Svanberg1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. Therefore, in addition to the nutrient-dependent mechanism described above, the increased mTOR anabolic signaling in the T-HS/EAA group may be partially due to IGF-1 signaling pathway activation.</p><p>A limitation to the current study is that it is not yet clear whether the increased serum free IGF-1 levels following EAA-enriched high-protein EN are due to the overall increase in IGF-1 production or reduced IGF-1 degradation. As mentioned previously, IGFBP-3 has been shown to be regulated by proteolysis. Increasing proteolytic cleavage of IGFBP-3 causes a decreased affinity for IGF-1, which is responsible for the decrease in circulating IGF-1 levels during stress <xref rid="pone.0077823-Belizon1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. In the present study, high serum free IGF-1 levels were observed in the T-HS/EAA group, which were quite consistent with increased IGFBP-3 concentrations. Therefore, further study is required to investigate the IGFBP-3 proteolysis activity and total IGF-1 levels following nutrition support, using a T-HS injured rat model, to make a better interpretation of our data <xref rid="pone.0077823-Foster1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p><p>In summary, our findings firstly demonstrate the effect of EAA enriched high-protein EN upon the metabolic regulation of skeletal muscle protein anabolism by regulating the IGF-1 system and downstream anabolic signaling transduction. We demonstrated that early nutrition support favored the recovery of serum free IGF-1 levels following T-HS, and the EAA enriched high-protein EN treatment appeared more effective. It was beneficial for the muscle mass maintenance in T-HS injured rats. Moreover, long-term treatment with EAA enriched high-protein EN effectively activated the mTOR related translation initiation factors, indicating the stimulation of muscle protein synthesis. And this response might be based on cooperation between IGF-1- and nutrient- mediated signal transduction pathways.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0077823-Biolo1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
