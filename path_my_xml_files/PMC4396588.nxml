A total of 109 participants with osteoarthritis of the knee (grades 1&#x02013;4) in the tibio&#x02013;femoral compartment were recruited in Jordan. Data were collected from each participant during the baseline visit. Each participant received Crespine<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Gel injection, and follow-up visits took place at 3 months, 6 months, and 9 months post-injection.</p></sec><sec><title>Main outcome measure(s)</title><p>An assessment of participants by phone was conducted at 1 month, 2 months, 4 months, 5 months, 7 months, and 8 months post-injection. Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index questionnaires were completed during each visit. A 72-hour visit questionnaire was used to assess the safety of the injection. Statistical analysis included a two-sided 95% confidence interval for the difference between pain scores across visits, and the percent change from baseline was calculated.</p></sec><sec><title>Main results</title><p>The full analysis included 84 participants who gave their informed consent and finished the necessary baseline and follow-up visits needed to assess efficacy and safety. Peak improvement was noted at 5 months post-injection, when pain and physical performance scores had decreased to 2.60 and 9.90, respectively, and the stiffness score was 0.33. The peak improvement in stiffness was noted at 8 months post-injection, when the stiffness score had decreased to 0.32. Significant improvements were still apparent at 9 months post-injection, when the pain score was 3.36, the stiffness score was 0.42, and the physical performance score was 11.5. All side effects were local and transient, and included pain, swelling, and redness of the knee.

Knee OA may or may not be symptomatic, and the associated radiographs are either normal or abnormal.<xref rid="b3-dddt-9-2063" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p><p>To date, the management strategies for OA have been directed at symptoms, primarily pain.<xref rid="b2-dddt-9-2063" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Clinical management of OA is directed at reducing pain, maintaining or improving joint mobility, and limiting functional impairment. The American College of Rheumatology (ACR) guidelines suggest initial nonpharmacological therapy (involving patient education, physical therapy, weight loss, exercise, unloaders, or assistive devices), followed by various oral medications for alleviating pain, as the first-line therapy for OA. For patients with defined mechanical abnormalities or severe OA, surgical intervention, including arthroscopy and joint replacement, may be indicated.<xref rid="b4-dddt-9-2063" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="b5-dddt-9-2063" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>Pharmacological therapy for OA initially includes simple analgesics, such as acetaminophen and over-the-counter nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and may also consist of topical agents such as capsaicin cream. However, oral NSAIDs have been associated with serious side effects, including severe adverse effects on the gastrointestinal system, and their long-term use is not advised.<xref rid="b4-dddt-9-2063" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="b6-dddt-9-2063" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> In patients who fail to obtain adequate pain relief from the aforementioned conservative treatments, selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors or prescription NSAIDs with gastro-protective agents are recommended. Some studies have suggested that COX-2 inhibitors may reduce some of the serious adverse events associated with NSAIDs, but this remains an area of controversy, particularly since the worldwide withdrawal of rofecoxib in September 2004. Treatment with short-term opioids or intra-articular steroids may be considered for acute exacerbations of pain caused by OA flares, but long-term use of these agents can be detrimental.<xref rid="b4-dddt-9-2063" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> In such cases, intra-articular corticosteroids are widely used because they provide rapid pain relief, but their benefit appears to be short-lived.<xref rid="b6-dddt-9-2063" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Recently, the ACR guidelines have been updated to include recommendations for the use of intra-articular hyaluronan (HA).<xref rid="b4-dddt-9-2063" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p><p>HA is a carbohydrate polymer that is widely distributed in the cartilage, synovial fluid, skin, and aqueous humor, where it plays an important role in maintaining normal joint function by providing support and lubrication, as well as by regulating biochemical processes.<xref rid="b2-dddt-9-2063" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="b6-dddt-9-2063" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b7-dddt-9-2063" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> The viscoelastic properties of HA are responsible for some of the protective functions of synovial fluid, including shock absorption, traumatic energy dissipation, protective coating of the articular surface, and lubrication.

All investigators used identical case report forms to record data. The case report form included each participant&#x02019;s demographics, physical examination results, inclusion/exclusion criteria, medical history, and dated X-ray imaging. Participant screening took place 2 weeks prior to the baseline visit.</p><p>The Ethics Committee and Health Authority approved the study protocol and all participants gave their informed written consent prior to their inclusion in the study. The study involved participants with knee OA, in whom the investigators had decided to start treatment with intra-articular Crespine<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Gel injection. Standing plain radiographs were taken with the knee extended. Rotation of the foot was adjusted to keep the second metatarsal bone parallel to the X-ray beam. X-ray radiographs were evaluated for the presence of OA as defined by the Kellgren&#x02013;Lawrence (KL) scale depicted in the Atlas of Standard Radiographs of Arthritis (0= normal, 1= doubtful OA, 2= minimal OA, 3= moderate OA, and 4= severe OA). The KL scale is based on the degree of osteophyte formation, joint space narrowing, sclerosis, and joint deformity. All efficacy analyses were performed on the intent-to-treat population, which was defined as those participants who received the single injection of HA, and for whom post-baseline data from follow-up visits at 3 months, 6 months, and 9 months post-treatment were available.</p><p>The safety profile of HA viscosupplementation has been well established over its 20 years of clinical use. In fact, no viscosupplement product has been withdrawn because of safety concerns. Intra-articular HA is generally well tolerated and has a low incidence (approximately 1%&#x02013;4% per injection) of local adverse events. The most common adverse event associated with HA viscosupplementation is a local reaction at the injection site, consisting of mild pain, swelling, or effusion, as well as warmth, redness, or both warmth and redness. Such injection site reactions are usually mild and self-limiting, resolve within 1&#x02013;3 days, and generally respond to NSAIDs and local modalities. Other mild adverse effects reported after HA viscosupplementation include post-injection itching, headaches, and calf pain. Furthermore, the incidence of adverse events associated with HA viscosupplementation is similar to that observed with other intra-articular procedures and is significantly related to the injection technique used; a medial HA injection for a partially bent knee was associated with an adverse event rate of 5.2%, in comparison with a rate of 1.5% for straight lateral injections. Interestingly, lateral injection has also been shown to be a more accurate intra-articular administration method than injections into a flexed knee using conventional arthroscopic portal approaches.<xref rid="b9-dddt-9-2063" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p><p>The safety assessment was based on reports of adverse events collected between the signing of the informed consent form and the completion of the final follow-up visit for each participant. The frequency of local adverse events, defined as the occurrence of an effusion (evidence from clinical examination or arthrocentesis) or a flare (hot, painful, swollen knee occurring within 48 hours of injection of the study preparation), of corticosteroid injections or treatment interpretations due to local adverse events, and of serious adverse events (adverse events leading to serious disability, hospital admission, life-threatening events, or death) were included in the protocol to be reported.</p><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title><p>Participants were 40+ years old and diagnosed with OA of the knee in the tibio-femoral compartment.

The WOMAC Likert 3.0 produces one aggregate total score and scores for three subscales: pain, stiffness, and physical functioning. A higher score for each subscale corresponds to a worse condition. The pain subscale includes five questions concerning the degree of pain experienced with certain positions and activities (eg, sitting or lying), with a subscale score ranging from 0 to 20. The function subscale includes 17 questions involving the degree of difficulty experienced while completing activities (eg, descending stairs), with a sub-scale score ranging from 0 to 68. The stiffness subscale includes two questions on stiffness severity (ie, after first awaking and later in the day), with the subscale score ranging from 0 to 8. For every question in the WOMAC, participants rate their pain, stiffness, or function using five ordinal responses: none, mild, moderate, severe, and extreme.<xref rid="b10-dddt-9-2063" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> The WOMAC scale was designed to measure the dysfunction and pain associated with OA of the lower extremities by assessing 17 functional ADLs, five pain related activities, and two stiffness categories. The WOMAC pain category covers pain associated with walking and stair climbing, as well as nocturnal, rest, and weight-bearing pain, while the stiffness category includes morning stiffness and stiffness occurring later in the day. The physical function category includes descending stairs, ascending stairs, rising from sitting, standing, bending to floor, walking on a flat surface, getting in or out of a car, going shopping, putting on socks, rising from bed, taking off socks, lying in bed, sitting, getting on or off of the toilet, heavy domestic duties, and light domestic duties. Performance on social functions and the status of emotional function were also included in the 17 functional activities, in addition to five functions describing the symptoms. The 17 questions were scored as slight (mild), moderate, severe, extreme, or none to determine the daily functional activity status of each participant. Higher WOMAC scores indicated worse pain, stiffness, and functional limitations.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample size</title><p>The study sample size was not calculated statistically, but the study was estimated to have sufficient power with a 10% dropout rate, and to provide sufficient evidence that HA is an effective treatment for knee OA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>The primary statistical analysis of efficacy was performed on the full analysis set (FAS). The percent change from baseline and a two-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) for the difference between pain scores between visits were calculated, and the same procedure was performed for the secondary variables (stiffness and physical function). Quantitative variables were described by the mean, standard deviation, and range. The efficacy of the treatment was examined by a paired <italic>t</italic>-test for both primary and secondary variables. All analyses were performed using the SAS System Release 9.1.3 Software Program (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). Three SAS procedures were added for use in visit evaluations: 1) SAS Proc for means of equal and unequal variances, 2) SAS Proc for histograms (G-plots), and 3) SAS Proc for Box Plots.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Participant flow</title><p>The FAS consisted of all participants who gave their informed consent and completed the study.

The numbers of 20% responders, 50% responders, and 70% responders were reported. Most participants (83, 99%) showed 20% improvement and were considered to be 20% responders, while 82% of participants (69 patients) showed 50% improvement or better, while 75% of participants (63 patients) were considered 70% responders. These results confirmed the efficacy of intra-articular injection of Crespine<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Gel on OA.</p></sec><sec><title>Safety assessment and adverse events</title><p>The safety evaluation was performed 72 hours after analyzing the questionnaire, in order to determine whether the pain in the knee receiving the Crespine<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Gel injection had increased. Redness and swelling, in addition to pain at the site of injection, were observed. Thirty three of the 84 participants in the FAS suffered from increased pain 72 hours after receiving the Crespine<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Gel injection (ie, 39% of participants completing the study and the follow-up visits had pain due to the injection). Of the 33 participants with increased pain after the Crespine<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Gel injection, 17 participants suffered from pain alone, seven participants suffered from pain and redness of the knee joint, five participants suffered from pain and swelling, and four participants suffered from simultaneous pain, swelling, and redness. All 33 patients with increased pain after the Crespine<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Gel injection had limited mobility of the knee joint at 72 hours post-injection. Most participants suffering from the aforementioned side effects were treated with pain medications, including paracetamol (500 mg tablets), diclofenac tablets, and mefenamic acid tablets. The pain caused by the injection improved after about 2&#x02013;3 days in patients taking pain medications, while this pain persisted slightly longer in patients who did not receive any pain medications. Four participants suffered from limited mobility of the knee after receiving the Crespine<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Gel injection without experiencing pain, redness, or swelling. Of these 4 participants, three took paracetamol (500 mg tablets), while one patient took diclofenac potassium tablets, and all four participants improved in about 2&#x02013;3 days.</p><p>These results show that Crespine<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Gel injections have an excellent safety and tolerability profile with no serious side effects. The side effects associated with Crespine<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Gel injections were primarily local, such as transient pain, redness, and swelling at the injection site. The local side effects that occurred during the study as a result of Crespine<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Gel injections resolved spontaneously or with symptomatic treatment of pain and swelling.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Current treatment approaches, such as those developed by the ACR and the OARSI, position HA as a secondary treatment following nonpharmacological therapies for people who are unresponsive to acetaminophen or NSAIDs, or who cannot take these medications. However, there is evidence to support the use of HAs earlier in the OA treatment paradigm. Patients with lower grades of OA reported a significantly better or much better response to hylan G-F 20 than patients with higher grades of OA. Patients who have been diagnosed with OA within a year are more likely to benefit from hylan G-F 20 than those who have been diagnosed for longer than a year. It has also been demonstrated that patients with less severe OA who received an HA product required fewer analgesics and were less likely to need assistive devices. Collectively, these findings suggest that using HA sooner after OA diagnosis could benefit patients.<xref rid="b11-dddt-9-2063" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="b12-dddt-9-2063" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p><p>In addition, HAs are at least as effective as NSAIDs, if not more effective, and have been shown to be safer than NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors. HAs are not associated with the potentially serious gastrointestinal problems of NSAIDs or the cardiovascular safety issues of newer COX-2 inhibitors. Given their demonstrated efficacy and safety, as well as the drawbacks of more conservative therapies, HAs could decrease the need for concomitant NSAIDs and corticosteroids in patients with OA, although hylans and HAs are not currently recommended for concomitant use with any other therapies.<xref rid="b11-dddt-9-2063" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="b12-dddt-9-2063" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Interpretation</title><p>This study demonstrated that HA present in Crespine<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Gel injection improves physical knee function, and reduces pain and stiffness associated with knee OA, while exhibiting an excellent safety profile, especially in comparison with NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors. At 1 month post-injection, statistically significant improvements in WOMAC pain, stiffness, and functional performance subscores were noted. The pretreatment subscores for pain, stiffness, and functional performance were eleven (total score of 20), 3.8 (total score of eight), and 34 (total score of 68), respectively, and these scores improved to 4.8, 1.0, and 16.2, respectively after Crespine<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Gel administration (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001 for each variable). Peak improvement was noted 5 months after Crespine<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Gel administration, when the scores for pain, stiffness, and functional performance had decreased to 2.60, 0.33, and 9.90, respectively. Significant improvement was maintained 9 months after the injection, as indicated by a pain score of 3.36, a stiffness score of 0.42, and a functional performance score of 11.5.</p><p>The reductions in the rates of pain, stiffness, and difficulty performing necessary physical functions (73.8%, 90.2%, and 69% of patients, respectively) were statistically and clinically relevant. Moreover, these changes were associated with reduced rates of difficulty performing social and emotional functions (77.9% and 84.3% of patients, respectively). Thus, the efficacy of intra-articular Crespine<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Gel injection was high in the FAS of selected participants.</p></sec><sec><title>Limitation</title><p>The current study is limited in that it was not a double-blinded controlled trial, and thus the treatment used in the study was not compared to a placebo or to commonly used medications such as NSAIDs. Therefore, the design may have introduced bias into the results. Additionally, the sample size was not calculated statistically, but was instead estimated after the study to have sufficient power to exclude the patients who dropped out of the study, and to provide sufficient evidence that intra-articular Crespine<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Gel injection is an effective treatment for OA of the knee. Finally, the WOMAC clinical questionnaire does not distinguish one knee from the other when the patient has bilateral knee OA. Therefore, in cases where both knees are affected, the knee selected for treatment was the one considered &#x0201c;worse&#x0201d; by the patient.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our results show that HA should be encouraged as an alternative to oral analgesics and considered as an adjunct treatment, because it can decrease the required dose of oral analgesics and delay potential future surgical intervention. Therefore, HA viscosupplementation is a valuable treatment option for OA of the knee. By demonstrating the efficacy and safety of intra-articular Crespine<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Gel administration, the results reported here provide a rationale for the use of Crespine<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Gel as a treatment for patients with OA of the knee.</p><p>Future randomized trials should be carried out with larger sample sizes to identify optimal treatment alternatives for patients with OA of the knee. Furthermore, studies should be conducted to evaluate whether there are synergistic effects of combining an HA product with current products used for treating patients with OA, as well as to determine the effect of intra-articular Crespine<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Gel injections on patients with different grades of knee OA.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Clinical Quest (a clinical research center) prepared the study protocol and handled the data, statistics, and initial study report (Tel +962 6461 0014; Fax +962 6461 6605).
