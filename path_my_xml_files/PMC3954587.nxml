For this purpose training programs at health facility and community level were evaluated.</p></sec><sec><title>Design and Methods</title><p>A pre-post control-test group design in two administrative divisions of Nairobi East District was used. Clinical competencies of PHWs (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;32 intervention, and n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;27 control) at health facility level were assessed 9 months after training, and after 6 months for community health workers, (CHWs) (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;411 intervention and n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;404 control) using written questionnaires, clinical data and patient interviews. Effects on referral for HIV testing and actual HIV testing were assessed by comparing laboratory registries pre- and post training.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>PHWs in intervention (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;27; 84%) and control (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;15; 60%) divisions, and CHWs in intervention (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;330; 80%) and control (189; 47%) divisions, completed all questionnaires. Trained PHWs significantly increased their knowledge of HROLs (p&#x0003c;0.02), frequency of oral examinations, diagnosis of HROLs and referral of patients with HROLs for HIV testing. Trained CHWs significantly gained knowledge about HROLs (p&#x0003c;0.02) and referred more patients with HROLs to health facilities. Overall percentage of HIV-positive test results was three-fold for HROLs compared to non-HROLs. Specifically, 70% of patients with oro pharyngeal candidiasis (OPC), the most commonly diagnosed HROL, were confirmed as being HIV-positive. Increase in overall HIV testing rates (1.6% pre-, 1.2% post training) and overall percentage of HIV-positive results (13% pre-, 16% post-intervention) was not significant.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Training programs significantly increased PHW and CHW knowledge, recognition and management of HROLs but increased neither overall HIV testing rates nor overall percentage of positive tests. Speculation is that the health system and patient-related barriers seriously limit HIV testing.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>Netherlands Trial Register NTR2627 (date registered 22nd November 2010), and NTR2697 (date registered 13th January 2011).</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study is funded by a research grant from The Netherlands Organization for International Cooperation in Higher Education (NUFFIC, Grant nr: C&#x00026;B-NFP-PHD.10/110, The Hague, The Netherlands.

Confirmation of HIV infection has been described in up to 98% of patients with HIV-related oral lesions (HROLs), the most common being oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC) <xref rid="pone.0090927-Agbelusi1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. OPC is not only an indicator of (early) HIV infection but may also function as a warning sign of immunological and virologic failure in patients on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) <xref rid="pone.0090927-Anver1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090927-Hamza1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090927-Miziara1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Thus, recognition of HROLs is important for patient care as well as from a public health perspective.</p><p>Patients presenting with HROLs at health facilities might not be identified as high-risk patients and consequently not be tested for HIV infection. This may result from inadequate oral health knowledge of professional health workers (PHWs), who are mainly clinical officers (COs), nurses and community health workers (CHWs) <xref rid="pone.0090927-Koyio1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090927-Koyio2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. In Kenya, PHWs in health facilities collaboratively work with CHWs to provide primary health care to the community <xref rid="pone.0090927-MoH1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Different strategies may be implemented in Kenya to improve oral health knowledge and subsequent HIV testing. In order to increase referrals for HIV testing, a training program focused on improving knowledge and skills of PHWs in identification and management of HROLs was implemented in combination with a training program aimed at improving recognition of common HORLs by CHWs at community level.</p><p>The primary objective of the present study was to analyze the effects of both training programs <xref rid="pone.0090927-Koyio3" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090927-Koyio4" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> in Nairobi East district in Kenya aimed at increasing the knowledge and competence of health care providers in the recognition of HROLs. Secondary objectives were to explore: 1) whether the implementation of these training programs would increase oral examinations by PHWs; 2) whether more patients with suspected HIV infection would be referred from the community to the health facilities; 3) whether overall HIV testing and the capacity to identify high risk patients would increase.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study Design</title><p>This pre-post control group study design <xref rid="pone.0090927-Zwarenstein1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> was administered as a: a) retrospective clinical records study and; b) prospective controlled study. The study covered two administrative divisions of Nairobi East District. Randomization Software EASY RA1 Easy Randomizer Version 4.1, State University of Michigan, USA was used and Njiru was randomly designated as the intervention division and Makadara as the control area. According to health records, these two divisions were comparable in terms of population numbers, staff numbers, personal and background characteristics of the staff and workloads at the health facilities. Each division comprised four health facilities. The study included all PHWs (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;32 in intervention and n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;25 in control division) and all CHWs (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;411 and 404 in the intervention and control division, respectively). Flow of the participants, as well as activities and types of data that were collected at various stages of the study, are described below and illustrated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0090927.s001">Boxes S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0090927.s002">S2</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Improvement of Knowledge in Recognition of HROLs by Health Care Providers</title><p>Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Center, Department of Global Oral Health and the University of Nairobi Dental School collaboratively developed two one-day training programs, to equip the health workers with basic knowledge and skills for recognition and management of (HIV-related) oral lesions, as well as reminding programs, as described elsewhere <xref rid="pone.0090927-Koyio3" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090927-Koyio4" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p><p>PowerPoint presentations contained simplified text and selected photographs of common (HIV-related) oral lesions (pseudo membranous candidiasis, erythematous candidiasis, angular cheilitis, oral hairy leukoplakia, necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis, Kaposi&#x02019;s sarcoma, parotid enlargement, herpes zoster, dental caries, periodontitis, dental fluorosis) <xref rid="pone.0090927-Agbelusi1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090927-Hamza1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090927-Ranganathan1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> to enhance healthcare provider ability to recognize these lesions. During the training, PHWs also received practical training, involving HIV-infected patients with HROLs, to improve their clinical skills. In the first three months after the training, PHWs were visited and reminded to review patients with questionable lesions and use PowerPoint presentations containing photographs of HROLs to update their knowledge. Barrier factors affecting their performance were also assessed. All health centers received monthly telephone reminders about the correct use of routine recording tools.</p><p>CHWs received an additional module on communication skills and use of educational brochures and posters, to enable them to do community mobilization.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Pre- and Post-training Assessments</title><p>A baseline written assessment was done, to analyse background characteristics and baseline knowledge amongst PHWs and CHWs in the intervention and control divisions, as described elsewhere <xref rid="pone.0090927-Koyio1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. On the one hand, oral health care tasks are relatively new among professional primary health care providers as this topic is neither emphasised during pre-service nor in-service training. On the other hand, low literacy levels in this community and lack of formal medical training among CHWs explains the numerous traditional beliefs and practices as well as misconceptions regarding HIV related (oral) diseases. To gather as much information as possible from both health workers and the CHWs, open ended questions were additionally used. The PHW questionnaire covered knowledge of symptoms of HROLs, the clinical appearance of HIV-suspected conditions, general dental knowledge, knowledge of OPC, common appearances of OPC, knowledge of periodontitis, causes of dental caries, past training in oral health topics and clinical experiences (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0090927-t001">Table 1</xref>). The 5 domains in the CHW questionnaire were: general oral health knowledge, knowledge of HROLs, opinions regarding oral health problems, encounter of HROLs in the community and current care at community level (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0090927-t002">Table 2</xref>). Both questionnaires were in English. The CHW questionnaire had an additional translated version, in their local language, to enable them to express their views accurately. General results of this assessment have been presented elsewhere <xref rid="pone.0090927-Koyio1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090927-Koyio2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. These questionnaires were again administered; 9 months after the training for PHWs and 6 months after training for CHWs (post-training assessment). Training and evaluation of PHWs was performed between February 2010 and November 2010. Thereafter, CHW training was done and evaluated (February 2011 to September 2011).</p><table-wrap id="pone-0090927-t001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0090927.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Pre- and post-training single item questions and mean domain scores, standard deviations (sd), p-values and maximum scores in the PHW questionnaire for intervention and control division.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone-0090927-t001-1" xlink:href="pone.0090927.t001"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Domain</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td colspan="3" align="left" rowspan="1">pre test<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="nt101">1</xref>

record outpatient consultation details, including oral pathologies (dental decay, periodontal diseases, malocclusion and (HIV-related) oral mucosal lesions) in daily tally sheets and outpatient registers. These indicators were retrospectively and manually extracted from the clinical records from the year prior to the training as well as after training, in the intervention and control divisions. Clinical records were studied in assessing whether or not an oral examination had been performed. This was subject to limitations such as: failure of PHWs to record oral examinations if they did not find relevant oral pathology; some orofacial lesions such herpes zoster had been diagnosed without oral examination. Therefore, additional assessments were done by structured exit interviews (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;924) in the intervention area and (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;666) control division, a month before the training and thereafter on patients leaving the health facilities, to assess whether an oral examination had been performed by PHWs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0090927.s001">Box S1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Referral by CHWs of Patients from the Community with HIV-related Oral Lesions</title><p>At recruitment, all CHW and PHWs had been introduced to their roles: educating the community, referral of patients to PHWs for further care and use of the government- owned CHW service delivery log book (CHWSDLB) for recording all referrals that they made from the community. The CHWSDLB was modified, through addition of two columns for the capture of data on the number of referred HROLs. CHWs received short messages on their mobile phones, known to be effective reminders in this setting <xref rid="pone.0090927-Zurovac1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, and supervisory visits to remind them to record and submit monthly data from the community through community health extension workers. Data were collected two months before the aforementioned CHW training program and throughout the succeeding 6 months after the training.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>HIV Testing Rates and Capacity to Identify High Risk Patients</title><p>The expectation was that: a) trained PHWs would refer more patients with HROLs from outpatient consultation rooms to the laboratory for HIV testing and; b) trained CHWs would refer more patients with HROLs from the community to the PHWs and consequently further increase the number of patients with HROLs referred to the laboratory for HIV testing. This would increase overall HIV testing rates. PHWs refer patients to the laboratory within the same health facility for HIV testing. There a rapid HIV diagnostic test is done. All laboratories at each health facility keep records including the number and results of the tests. However, reasons for referral are routinely not included. The latter, including specific types of HROLs referred, were included after the training. Routine HIV laboratory data from voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) clinics, from prevention of mother to child transmission of HIV infection (PMTCT) and from diagnostic counseling and testing (DTC) in tuberculosis clinics were not part of the present analysis. In cases where patients with HROLs were referred by PHWs from these clinics to the laboratory for testing, the data was captured in the laboratory register.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Data Analysis</title><p>Data were checked for completeness and consistency before entry into Excel files. Data analyses were conducted, using SAS software (version 9.2, SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) by JM (biostatistician at Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre). Background characteristics were described, using frequency and descriptive statistics. Chi-square tests were used in comparing differences in percentages. Pre-test means were analyzed, using Student-T-tests, whereas a multiple regression model with correction for pre-test values was used for analyzing post-test means.</p><p>For all tests, a significance level of 0.05 was used.

To generate an initial codebook for open-ended questions, the panel discussed to reach consensus on correct and wrong responses for open ended questionnaires with multiple responses. To improve the code book the scope of right and wrong answers was further defined using the questionnaire responses. The coders identified and discussed unsatisfactory responses, partially answered questionnaires, ambiguous statements as well as wordings of correct responses. Codes were assigned to agreed correct responses, wrong responses, unanswered questions and &#x02018;I do not know&#x02019; responses. The number of unanswered questions was negligible since the respondents had the &#x02018;I do not know&#x02019; option. In addition research assistants checked for completeness of the scripts during questionnaire administration. For analysis, unanswered questions and &#x02018;I do not know&#x02019; questions were regarded as lack of knowledge and were therefore considered as wrong responses. The two open ended questions that had no right or wrong answer, as that they needed &#x02018;further explanation&#x02019; were analysed separately. After coding the first seven scripts, results were checked for agreements and differences. Disagreements were discussed until consensus was reached; 90% agreement between the two coders permitted reliable coding of the remaining transcripts.</p><p>Data were analysed in line with the aforementioned domains. After correction for baseline differences, pre- and post-training study mean scores for PHWs and CHWs were compared at (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.05).

Although the total percentage of referrals could not be reliably calculated because of overlapping general indicators in the CHWSDLB, our results indicate that CHWs in the intervention division referred much more patients with HROLs to the health facilities after having been trained.</p></sec><sec id="s3e"><title>Effects on HIV Testing Rates and Capacity to Identify High-risk Patients</title><p>At baseline, the HIV testing rate was 1.6% (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;946 out of 60,216) in the intervention division and 3.3% (1,842 out of 56,222) in the control division. The difference between the intervention and control divisions was attributed to the presence of a large educational institution in the control area, which was found to have referred many students for medical check-ups that often included an HIV test.

Earlier studies showed that these PHWs and CHWs were willing to include oral healthcare tasks related to HIV patients into their routine practice <xref rid="pone.0090927-Koyio2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090927-Koyio5" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Effects on Knowledge Related to Health Care Provider Recognition of HIV-related Oral Lesions</title><p>The training program significantly improved PHWs and CHWs knowledge about (HIV related) oral health topics. This study showed that CHWs could play an important role in educating the community in the clinical importance HROLs and the need to seek early medical care. The marginal gain in knowledge of PHWS about the clinical appearance of suspected HIV oral lesions suggests a need for more emphasis on teaching these healthcare workers about various lesions, in future training programmes. Periodontal diseases need to be particularly emphasised, as none of the diagnosed lesions were referred for HIV testing. Emphasis may also need to be placed on identification of oral hairy leukoplakia as this could be mistaken for OPC.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Effects on Performance of Oral Examinations and Identification of HIV-related Oral Lesions</title><p>An increase in the frequency of examinations as well as in the proportion of HIV lesions diagnosed in outpatient consultations was seen in post-training data, in the intervention division. This was attributed to the increased knowledge. This finding is supported by data derived from patient interviews; from self-reporting in written assessments and from laboratory registers. However, although there was a two-fold increase in the frequency of oral examinations and in diagnosis of HROLs in the intervention division, the frequency was very low for this population with high HIV prevalence.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Effects on PHW Capacity to Identify High-risk Groups</title><p>The overall HIV-positive result for patients with HROLs was up to three times higher than for referrals of patients with non-oral lesions, even when HROLS included unspecified mouth lesions not strongly associated with HIV infection as defined in the 1993 European Economic Community Clearinghouse on oral problems related to HIV infection and WHO Collaborating Centre on Oral manifestations of the immunodeficiency virus <xref rid="pone.0090927-ECClearinghouse1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> criteria. However, the increase in overall HIV-positive results for patients with HROLs did not increase the overall percentage of all HIV-positive tests in either division. OPC, the most common HROL, was highly predictive of HIV infection in the intervention division. The performance of trained PHWs was comparable to that of experienced examiners <xref rid="pone.0090927-Agbelusi1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0090927-Bhayat1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, thereby indicating improvement of practical skills among trained PHWs. The importance of training in practical skills was particularly underlined by the low percentage of positive HIV test results in patients with diagnosed OPC and Kaposi&#x02019;s sarcoma in the control group. Overall, test results could also be further improved if augmented with good medical history <xref rid="pone.0090927-Robinson1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Although identification of HROLs cannot be considered an HIV screening test oral examination, as a simple and non-invasive procedure it may increase the chance of detecting HIV infection in a person. PHWs also identified other oral conditions such as dental caries and counselled patients on preventive care. Most importantly, PHWs also identified HAART patients with virological failure <xref rid="pone.0090927-Koyio6" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Effects on HIV Testing Rates, Patient Referrals and Perceived Barriers</title><p>Overall, considering the high HIV prevalence in the country, HIV testing rates from outpatient clinics remained very low in both divisions. Although trained PHWs increased the frequency of oral examinations and the number of HROLs diagnosed, their performance did not increase HIV testing rates. During reminder visits, their high workload was mentioned by PHWs as a barrier to HIV testing. High workloads averaging to 60&#x02013;100 consultations per PHW per day, as presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0090927-t003">Table 3</xref>, may prevent PHWs from having sufficient consultation time for each patient <xref rid="pone.0090927-Ferrinho1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. PHWs also reported reluctance of patients with HROLs to have an HIV test done. Over 65% of patients diagnosed with HROLs did not get tested for HIV. Refusal of 28% of routine dental patients with HROLs to undergo an HIV test was also reported <xref rid="pone.0090927-Agbelusi1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. PHWs further attributed refusal to undergo HIV testing to the HIV testing point. Because outpatient clinics are busy, patients are routinely referred to the laboratory for HIV testing. Opting out of some patients was due to the long waiting time and to stigma from patients in the waiting bays. It was noted that PHWs failed to refer patients with periodontal diseases, although diagnoses were made. PHWs may also fail to refer patients with HROLs if they do not have the skills for diagnosing the lesions, as observed in the relatively lower number of referrals of HROLs in the control division.</p><p>Contrary to expectation, increased referral patients with HROLs by CHWs to the health facilities did not translate to increased PHW identification of oral HIV lesions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0090927-t003">Table 3</xref>), suggesting that patients did not seek consultations at the health facilities. It was unlikely that they went directly to the VCT clinics, although this was not checked. Resistance to HIV testing is a concern in Kenya, often related to low risk perception and fear of social stigma <xref rid="pone.0090927-KDHS1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. In this community additional barriers included misconceptions about HROLs, particularly OPC. Baseline assessment showed that nearly 30% of CHWs related OPC to witchcraft, gastrointestinal disorders, sugary or hot foods and consumption of milk. This often resulted in patients&#x02019; seeking traditional remedies.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Study Limitations</title><p>Retrospective clinical data were sometimes incomplete, owing to countrywide shortages and unskilled record clerks. Although all PHWs were included in the two divisions, the sample size for PHWs in the control group was smaller than had been planned for. This was due to nationwide staff shortages. Three months after the PHW training, the government, through the Economic Stimulus Program <xref rid="pone.0090927-KESP1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> employed additional (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;17) PHWs in the intervention and (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;10) PHWs in the control division, who may have diluted the effect of the intervention division as seen after July 2010 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0090927.s003">Box S3</xref>). In the control division, there was a big fire accident during the CHW evaluation <xref rid="pone.0090927-Kenya1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, leading to massive displacements of CHWs and the low post-training response rate. The observed peak in oral examination frequency in both divisions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0090927.s003">Box S3</xref>) in June 2012 coincided with a nationwide HIV campaign termed &#x02018;The FIFA World Cup HIV campaign&#x02019;, which led to a massive increase in community mobilization during the observation period. The other limitation was caused by nationwide shortages in supply of HIV test kits in June and early July 2010, which lowered the total number of HIV tests for 2010. Towards the end of 2010, the government introduced new laboratory regulations (for HIV testing and counseling (HTC)) that made it difficult to identify HIV tests that were performed in outpatient clinics in 2011 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0090927-t004">Table 4</xref>). This being an early evaluation of the implementation project, the results presented may only in part reflect the actual effect of the project.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The competence of PHWs and CHWs in Nairobi East district in diagnosing and managing HROLs is insufficient. Training programs significantly improved knowledge of PHWS and competences in their clinical performance regarding routine oral examination and identification of HIV-high-risk patients but did not significantly increase overall HIV testing rates. Training of CHWs significantly increased their knowledge of HROLs and their referrals of community members with HROLs to a health facility but referrals from community did not significantly increase the number of HROLs diagnosed in the health facilities. The speculation is that health system barriers seriously limit HIV testing. Health system related barriers particularly high workloads among health providers seriously hindered HIV testing in outpatient clinics. The alternative of referring of patients to the laboratory for HIV tests was both stigmatizing and time consuming to the patients leading to &#x02018;loss&#x02019; of patients. Patient-related barriers such as low HIV risk perception, fear of discrimination and misconceptions about (HIV related) oral diseases further contributed to patients opting out from HIV testing. Health workers related barriers which included insufficient knowledge and low risk perception of HIV related oral diseases could be addressed through emphasis on oral health topics during the pre-service and in-service training as well as support supervision of the health care workers. Interventions to integrate oral health care of HIV patients into the primary healthcare system should address these barriers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0090927.s001"><label>Box S1</label><caption><p>
