Linear growth retardation (stunting) is associated with poor cognitive, language and behavioral development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], high rates of morbidity and mortality, and negative long term outcomes including compromised labor market participation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Outcomes are even worse for severely stunted children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Despite evidence of the potential effectiveness of interventions in early childhood, policy makers and planners are challenged by designing interventions that sustainably improve growth and child development, particularly in the context of extreme poverty. Furthermore, since linear growth retardation is largely irreversible after the age of two or three [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], there is an urgent need to design interventions that begin early in life.</p><p>Madagascar is a very low-income country (gross national annual income per capita of 430 USD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]), with a prevalence of stunting of almost 50&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Children in Madagascar living in poverty show deficits in developmental outcomes, such as language and cognition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In order to address the severity and prevalence of poor nutrition in Madagascar, the National Office of Nutrition (ONN) initiated a large-scale community-based nutrition intervention in 1999, which is still operational throughout the country. The community-based program includes monthly growth-monitoring activities for infants and young children, cooking demonstrations, community mobilization, and nutrition and hygiene education of their primary caregivers. A rigorous multi-year evaluation of the long term effects of the existing program on weight-for-age showed small, significant effects of the program for young children, but no effects of the program on height-for-age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. To address the lack of effectiveness of Madagascar&#x02019;s current program on linear growth faltering, the interventions described here were developed in collaboration with the research team and Madagascar&#x02019;s Office of Nutrition.</p><p>The proposed evaluation has as its goal to identify the most effective, cost-effective and scalable interventions to address linear growth faltering and promote child development in Madagascar. Our study uses a multi-arm randomized-controlled trial (RCT) to test the effects and cost-effectiveness of interventions designed to address chronic malnutrition and poor child development, and has been designed based on the existing evidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The questions we are addressing through this research are described in detail below.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Question 1: How do intensive counseling and/or nutritional supplementation affect linear growth faltering and child development?</title><p>Common strategies to improve nutritional status include the promotion of behavior change to increase dietary quality; the fortification of food to improve micronutrient content of staple foods; or the use of nutritional supplements for vulnerable population groups (e.g. very young children) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Our study aims to test the added value of variations of these strategies over and above the existing, community-based, growth monitoring. Growth monitoring and education strategies are only successful when they involve intensive counseling and strongly emphasize dietary diversity and the promotion and consumption of animal source foods; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] the quality of counseling and its intensity are believed to be a necessary condition for growth monitoring programs to be effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Two existing programs (one in Peru [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], and the other in China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]) have demonstrated that primary caregivers are able to act on the advice of community nutrition workers to provide higher quality, micronutrient rich foods. Similarly, home visits in Malawi including nutritional information from birth to the first year of life showed significant improvements in the consumption of protein rich foods and in measures of height for age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The findings are in line with evidence from behavioral economics on the importance of the way the messages are framed, perceived and internalized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>In spite of these encouraging studies, intensive counseling and behavioral change may not be sufficient to address severe nutritional deficiencies in settings with high food insecurity and intense poverty. Thus, nutritional supplementation may be a more effective option and can come in the form of micronutrient tablets or drops, multiple micronutrient powders (e.g. &#x0201c;Sprinkles&#x0201d;) mixed into the child&#x02019;s typical complementary foods, or lipid-based nutrient supplements (LNS). While multiple micronutrient powders appear to be effective for improving hemoglobin, iron status and some cognitive outcomes in children, they have shown limited effects on child growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Multiple micronutrient supplements in pregnancy have been found to have a small impact on birth weight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], though the effects appear to be minimal in women of low BMI in early pregnancy. For LNS findings, evidence is emerging from a number of efficacy trials in Africa and Asia that suggest there are important benefits of LNS products to infant growth and development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. For example, in Malawi, LNS supplementation reduced severe stunting to 3.5&#x000a0;% or less as compared to 12.5&#x000a0;% in the control group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], an effect that was maintained 12&#x000a0;months after the intervention period ceased [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. In Ghana, LNS supplementation has been associated with higher length-for-age z-score when provided to infants from 6&#x02013;12 months of age compared to a micronutrient tablet or powder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. In Burkina Faso, mothers starting LNS in early pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] showed an increase in birth length; effects were biggest for those women with low early pregnancy BMI, and in those whose late pregnancy stage occurred during the rainy/lean season [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. In a separate trial in Burkina Faso, LNS supplementation for children 9&#x02013;18 mo together with morbidity monitoring and treatment, was associated with a 10 percentage point reduction in stunting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Thus far, few studies have examined developmental outcomes after LNS supplementation and the data available are conflicting. In Malawi, children supplemented from 6&#x02013;18 months of age with LNS had no difference in age of achievement of motor or language developmental milestones compared to controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. In contrast, in Ghana, the group receiving LNS from 6&#x02013;12 months of age had a greater proportion of children who could walk independently at 12&#x000a0;months (49&#x000a0;%) compared to a non-intervention group (25&#x000a0;%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Question 2: What is the optimal timing and composition of interventions to promote growth and child development?</title><p>The existing data and evidence relating to LNS interventions suggest that lipid-based supplements have the potential to improve size at birth and growth through infancy, but the optimal timing and composition of the supplements is not clear. It is possible that if supplementation were to cover <italic>both</italic> mothers and infants during critical periods of growth and development, the effect sizes could be larger than supplementing at one time point alone. Although the evidence from such combined interventions is not yet available, there are some trials of LNS for pregnant women and/or children underway in other settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Testing the added value of supplementation of pregnant and lactating women over and above supplementation of children during a critical age window of 6&#x02013;18 months of age will be very informative for understanding&#x000a0;the importance of pre- and post-natal nutrition as a strategy for stunting prevention. The biological and economic literature suggests that there are dynamic complementarities between early and later investments in human capital.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Question 3: What is the most cost-effective way to promote growth and child development and is it scalable within the existing program structure?</title><p>Our study will test the cost-effectiveness of LNS targeted to children, as well as pregnant and lactating women, as tools&#x000a0;to prevent child stunting and promote optimal child development. While the results from the pregnancy and child LNS supplementation studies are promising, there are important considerations about the cost-effectiveness of these interventions. Given the high prevalence of stunting, and the&#x000a0;particularly severe stunting in Madagascar, the rationale for this intervention is strong, particularly if it can be combined with an improved behavior change intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The quantities of LNS are intended to be preventative, and thus are less likely to be shared with household members other than the targeted child or pregnant women. Thus, there should be little dilution of the benefits due to food sharing within the household or substitution of existing food intake. While we think that there are likely to be important nutritional benefits of supplementing <italic>both</italic> mothers and their children, it is important to consider that this approach will represent a two year period of supplementation per target child (one year to mothers plus one year of supplementation to their children). Thus, the costs of this intervention will need to be weighed carefully compared to one year of direct supplementation to the child only.</p><p>The program under study is already at scale, covering 6500 communities across Madagascar. The community-based program is implemented by the Government and is a key component of the country's nutrition and food security strategy. There are undeniable strengths of the existing program, which builds on an existing large scale infrastructure of service delivery, a strong sense of ownership, and many people intensely dedicated to making the program work. Each of the alternative program designs will compare estimated impacts in terms of reduced stunting and improved cognitive development against the marginal cost of each additional intervention. The preventive new lipid-based supplements are going to be imported from abroad for the purpose of this study. The implementing agency (PNNC/ONN) has already begun discussion for local production of the supplements, however, which would make it a more sustainable approach in the future. The new projected local unit cost of the intervention will be used to assess the benefit/cost ratios of the different packages that include LNS.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Question 4: What are the synergies and complementarities of integrating nutrition and early stimulation home visits within a large scale program?</title><p>There has been a call for large scale programs that integrate health, nutrition and the promotion of child development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], but there are limited data on the feasibility, advantages, or disadvantages of integrating such interventions. Existing studies consist primarily of small, efficacy trials, and have shown little evidence of synergistic interaction between nutrition and stimulation on child development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. There are clear benefits to integrating interventions, because health and nutrition sectors are often the only services reaching children under three years. Thus, delivering support for child development through these mechanisms may be a key way to reach young children, particularly those at risk of poor development. It is also possible that integration can provide additive benefits for children at a lower cost than for a stand-alone program.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Objectives of the MAHAY study</title><p>The objective of the MAHAY (&#x0201c;smart&#x0201d; in Malagasy) study is to determine whether any of the specified intervention packages can significantly alter the pattern of severe growth faltering and delays in child development among young children in Madagascar. The design will not only allow us to measure the impact of each treatment arm compared to the status quo, but also to estimate differential effects and costs of each incremental layer.</p><p>Our primary objectives are:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Determine whether there are benefits of intensive counseling, nutritional supplementation, or a scaled-up home visiting program&#x000a0;for child nutritional status and development, within the structure of an existing government program.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Examine the optimal timing and composition of interventions to promote growth and development by comparing intervention arms to each other in terms of effectiveness.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Calculate cost-effectiveness of trial arms and explore scalability of various options.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Identify where and when synergies and complementarities of integrating early childhood stimulation into the existing nutrition program are feasible.</p></list-item></list></p><p>Our secondary objective&#x000a0;is to measure intermediate indicators such as knowledge and hygiene, feeding and stimulation practices that can help us model the pathways through which the different interventions might have an effect&#x000a0;on child growth and development.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Overview of the design</title><p>The evaluation is a cluster RCT with assignment at the community level. The sample of eligible program communities is assigned to either the current status quo or to one of four arms, based on the randomized design. The study is longitudinal, with sampled children and their households interviewed at three points in time, with a baseline survey administered right before the interventions&#x000a0;begin, and two follow-up surveys (midline and endline) administered approximately one and two years after the baseline survey.</p><p>Our sampling frame is the universe of eligible project sites in the 5 target regions of the program. From this universe of project communities, a sample of 25 program sites is randomly assigned to one of five groups. The comparison group for our study is the program as currently designed (as opposed to "no program" in most of the evaluation literature). In the four randomized arms, we sequentially add increasing levels of intensity and complexity to the current intervention, starting with the lowest cost option and incrementally adding layers of intensity (and cost) to test the value added of each layer in terms of its ability to reduce growth faltering and promote child development. We will then compare the added value of each layer with its added cost, and will use this information to&#x000a0; assess the cost-effectiveness of alternative modes for service delivery.</p><p>In order to identify the variants in program design that could be added to the status quo program, we examined interventions that have shown effectiveness in previous studies. Most of the evidence stems from efficacy trials or small scale interventions, so our objective is to test the implementation within an existing large scale program. Furthermore, we considered interventions that can reasonably be incorporated into the existing program in Madagascar, which is already at scale, will be acceptable to the local population, and that the government would consider adopting as a new package of services.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Description of the interventions</title><p>The interventions are summarized briefly here and then described in more detail below (see also Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>):<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Summary of intervention components</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Study arm</th><th>Intensive counseling on nutrition (IC)</th><th>IC&#x02009;+&#x02009;LNS for children 6&#x02013;18 months</th><th>IC&#x02009;+&#x02009;LNS for pregnant &#x00026; lactating women +LNS for children 6-18 months</th><th>IC&#x02009;+&#x02009;Early childhood stimulation and development</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>T<sub>0</sub>) <italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;25 Communities</td><td/><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>T<sub>1</sub>) <italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;25 Communities</td><td>&#x02713;</td><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>T<sub>2</sub>) <italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;25 Communities</td><td>&#x02713;</td><td>&#x02713;</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>T<sub>3</sub>) <italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;25 Communities</td><td>&#x02713;</td><td>&#x02713;</td><td>&#x02713;</td><td/></tr><tr><td>T<sub>4</sub>) <italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;25 Communities</td><td>&#x02713;</td><td/><td/><td>&#x02713;</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>T<sub>0</sub>) (comparison) program as currently designed (&#x0201c;status quo&#x0201d;): community-based nutrition program with growth monitoring and education.</p></list-item><list-item><p>T<sub>1</sub>) Intensive counseling: the existing community-based program enhanced with preventive home visits that focus on personalized counseling.</p></list-item><list-item><p>T<sub>2</sub>) Intensive counseling&#x02009;+&#x02009;lipid based supplementation to children 6&#x02013;18 months (&#x0201c;Kalina Zaza&#x0201d;), delivered in a weekly ration of supplement providing 20&#x000a0;g/day/child.</p></list-item><list-item><p>T<sub>3</sub>) Intensive counseling&#x02009;+&#x02009;lipid based supplementation to children 6&#x02013;18 months&#x02009;+&#x02009;pregnant and lactating women [&#x02212;6,+6] (&#x0201c;Kalina Reny&#x0201d;), delivered in a weekly ration of supplement providing 20&#x000a0;g/day/child plus 40&#x000a0;g/day/pregnant women and mothers of children who are 0&#x02013;6 months old.</p></list-item><list-item><p>T<sub>4</sub>) Intensive counseling on infant and young child feeding practices&#x02009;+&#x02009;early childhood stimulation for children 6&#x02013;24 months</p></list-item></list></p><sec id="Sec12"><title>T<sub>0</sub>: The status quo program</title><p>The community-based nutrition program in Madagascar originated from a World Bank financed program (SEECALINE). It is a large-scale program that started in 1999 and was gradually scaled up until 2003 to cover 3600 project sites in more than half of the country&#x02019;s districts. In 2004/2005 the program was institutionalized and adopted to become the national nutrition program (<italic>Programme National de Nutrition Communautaire</italic> or PNNC), which was subsequently scaled up to cover all districts of the country. To maximize geographical coverage as well as to provide quality services on a large-scale, the program is contracted out to local NGOs for implementation (management, delivery, operations research and supervision) at the local level, reporting to the regional units of the National Nutrition Office. The services are delivered locally by community nutrition workers (<italic>agent communautaire de la nutrition, ACN</italic>), who are usually women elected by the local communities. The basic counseling model was built upon the Essential Nutrition Actions model developed by UNICEF and GAIN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Key messages include information about maternal nutrition, early initiation of breastfeeding, exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6&#x000a0;months, continued breastfeeding through 2&#x000a0;years, dietary diversification, and food conservation and preparation using locally available products, together with the promotion of age-appropriate infant feeding practices and hygiene practices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. The messages are delivered at monthly growth monitoring sessions attended by pregnant/lactating women as well all eligible children (0&#x02013;3 years, subsequently raised to 0&#x02013;5).

Finally, in the third stage, we assigned sites to a trial arm by performing a stratified random sample of 5 sites per intervention arm per region for a total of 125 sites (25 sites per region). The final sample was balanced across trial arms along average underweight prevalence and average size of the target population, based on program monitoring data. Local Malagasy government officials were notified of the site selection and program assignment after the above process was completed by the research team.</p><p>The compliance with the community random assignment is closely monitored by the implementing agency in collaboration with the research team.</p></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Sampling of children</title><p>The initial sampling frame of survey participants within selected community sites was based on a census performed by the local community nutrition workers in November/December 2013. These same nutrition workers provided updates to the census in April 2014 for all sites and up to a week before the team&#x02019;s arrival for each individual site. Upon the team&#x02019;s arrival for the baseline data collection, the list received a final update with the help of the nutrition worker to add newborns and newly pregnant women, update that status of pregnant women who had given birth, and remove those who were traveling, had migrated or died. In the case where we had an insufficient number of pregnant women or children in the updated list, then the catchment area was extended to villages within 5&#x000a0;km of the site that do not currently participate in the government program, but are eligible to participate.</p><p>The final sample is stratified in the following way: pregnant women, women with children 0&#x02013;5 months of age, and women with children 6&#x02013;11 months of age. Ten eligible participants were systematically sampled from each stratum using a random starting point and sampling interval. In each stratum, we&#x000a0;over-sampled by&#x000a0;two additional women to anticipate needing to&#x000a0;exclude&#x000a0;households from the sample for three possible reasons. The first reason women were over-sampled was to be prepared for possible refusals. Second, in order to avoid clustering within households, if two women were found to be from the same household, one was replaced (so that&#x000a0;no household was represented twice). Pregnant women were given priority, followed by the woman with the youngest child in the household. Finally, screening questions were used during the household interview to exclude children with a serious developmental disability (sight, hearing, physical, or mental). The final sample of 30 women and their respective households are interviewed at baseline, midline and endline. A time difference of at least 18&#x000a0;months allows for sufficient exposure to the program and account for potential delay in implementation of the intervention.</p><p>All children at midline and endline will be tested for anemia as measured by hemoglobin concentration, a secondary outcome measure. Additionally, a subsample of 384 children at endline will be directly assessed for biomarker data and direct assessment of their cognitive, language, motor and socioemotional development using the BSID. The specialized data collection will take place in a random sample of 64 communities stratified by treatment status. In each of these 64 communities, 6 children aged 18-24 months of age will be administered the biomarker data (ELISA method) and 6 children aged 28-34 will be administered the BSID.</p></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Blinding</title><p>Due to the nature of the interventions, it is impossible to blind participants to their intervention group assignment. Interviewers will not be blinded either as they will ask participants and community health workers about their program-related experiences. However, the data will be masked to group assignment during the data analysis phase to blind the data analysts.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec31"><title>Analysis plan</title><sec id="Sec32"><title>General analytic approach</title><p>Primary analyses will be performed on an intention-to-treat (ITT) basis, to minimize the selection bias that could occur if there are selective take-up rates. The intention-to-treat provides the lower bound on the estimated impact of the program, and represents the parameter of interest for cost-benefit analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>].</p><p>Identification of causal impacts will rely on the random assignment of treatment at the community level. The main impact of the program activities and alternative treatment arms will be estimated through a series of pair-wise comparisons of mean outcomes between the study arms. However, due to the small number of communities assigned to each arm (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;25), it is possible that by chance alone we will find covariate imbalance between communities in different treatment arms. Therefore, we will measure important covariates at the individual and community level in order to include them as a subset of conditioning variables in a regression framework.</p><p>The potential for contamination or spillover effects across communities for the program currently implemented is low, as community sites are self-contained and provide services to mothers and children registered in the local community. The concern, however, may arise for communities that distribute LNS for free. Monitoring distribution to eligible mothers and children through the administrative data from the program monitoring system, as well as sampling communities with a sufficient buffer zone/minimum distance among them, should minimize the extent of contamination.</p><p>There are no plans for broad-scale social marketing of LNS outside of information materials developed for the purposes of this study. LNS is not available for purchase or for free through government or any other NGO programs. The only way to obtain it will be through this project. For these reasons, we anticipate little contamination of control areas. We will continue to monitor the availability of LNS in non-study areas throughout the course of the trial to determine if this situation should change in the future. We acknowledge the possibility of sharing with other household members or other community members. To minimize this risk, all individuals in the community in the designated age range or pregnancy/postpartum window will be eligible to receive LNS, regardless of whether or not they participate in the evaluation. Communication material and instructions provided to mothers will discourage sharing and explain how the LNS has been developed specifically for children 6&#x02013;24 months or pregnant/lactating women.</p></sec><sec id="Sec33"><title>Parameters of interest</title><p>In this section, we introduce notation to simplify the description of our parameters of interest. Treatment, D assigned at the community level, is represented by four arms: Intensive counseling (I), Intensive counseling&#x02009;+&#x02009;Nutrition for children 6&#x02013;18 months (IN<sub>C</sub>), Intensive counseling&#x02009;+&#x02009;Nutrition for pregnant/lactating mothers and children 6&#x02013;18 mo (IN<sub>MC</sub>), and Intensive counseling&#x02009;+&#x02009;child Stimulation (IS).

However, decisions to stop or change the intervention protocols will not be made solely based on these estimates for two main reasons. First, a 12-month follow-up period is an insufficient amount of time for the youngest children to have received a full course of treatment in the LNS and stimulation arms. Second, using data from all three time points will give a more complete and reliable understanding of the impacts of the different treatment arms in our study, and how the relative effectiveness across the arms may vary over time.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec37"><title>Stopping guidelines</title><p>No external data safety monitoring board is pre-planned, but quality control during data collection is ensured by the Madagascar Office of National Nutrition using their standard operating procedures and regular collection of the monitoring data system. We do not anticipate serious risk to our participants from participating in the study. However, there may be adverse consequences to participation that were unintended or unexpected. In the absence of a local or external monitoring board, we rely on local internal monitoring for reports of adverse events, as well as preliminary analyses following the midline study, to stop any intervention arm if clear evidence of harm is found from program participation. In the event that the monitoring reports or midline analyses indicate evidence of substantial early benefit from one of the intervention arms, we will continue the trial, with the Government&#x02019;s approval, in order to capture differential effects of the intervention arms over time and by age cohort of the children.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are indebted to Norotiana Rakotomalala (PNNC) for her support of, and contributions to the current study, to Voahirana Rajoela from the World Bank for her guidance and operational support, and to Mamane Zeilani from Nutriset for help developing the supplement for mothers used in this trial.
