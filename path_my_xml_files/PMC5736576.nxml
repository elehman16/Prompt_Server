This study aimed to evaluate the efficiacy and safety of a combined regimen of rhIL-2 injection and standard chemotherapy within 18-month duration in a randomized controlled trial conducted in 14 centres in eastern China. From Jan. 2009 to July. 2016, 271 MDR-TB cases were enrolled and followed up in two groups, 142 cases in study group while 129 cases in control group. Clinical efficacy, safety and immune activity (Th1, Th17, Treg, IFN-&#x003b3;, IL-17) among the two groups were evaluated and compared. After 24-month following up, cure rate in IL-2 group show higher than that in control group (56% VS 36%, P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01). Rate of mycobacterium clearance (sputum negative) within 3&#x02009;months was significantly higher in IL-2 group (74% VS 59%, P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) with no adverse events raised. Patients after rhIL-2 treatment showed increasing of Th1 populations and decreasing of Th17 and Regulatory T cells (Treg) populations, while levels of IL-17A, ROR-&#x003b3;t, and Foxp3 mRNA decreased and level of IFN-&#x003b3; mRNA increased in PBMCs. Thus, rhIL-2 combined regimen within shorter duration achieved high conversion and success rates and improved Th1/Th17 immune responses, with no safety concerns emerging in MDR-TB patients.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), defined as resistance to at least isoniazid and rifampin, has emerged as a lethal global threat, according to a 2009 WHO report<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>.

In 2003 Johnson <italic>et al</italic>. conducted another study of 101 cases cohorts IL-2 did not enhance bacillary clearance or improvement in symptoms in human immunodeficiency virus-seronegative adults with drug-susceptible tuberculosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. These reports suggested a potential role for IL-2 in TB treatment and show mixed results of IL-2 treatment for TB.</p><p id="Par15">Our study demonstrated that 8-month duration of rhIL-2 adjunctive therapy was safe and led to shortening of the traditional 24-month regimen by at least 6 months, with a striking increase in the cure rate from 37.2% to 55.6%. Consequently, the reduced toxicity of the shorter treatment course increased the tolerability and compliance rate of anti-TB chemotherapeutics. As for general trend of our study data, IL-2 immunotherapy accelerated clearance of intrapulmonary mycobacteria and effective tissue repair, thus accelerated clinical cure.</p><p id="Par16">Although the mechanisms underlying the beneficial effect of rhIL-2 immunotherapy remained uncompletely understood, our previous work indicated that the responses of the Th1 and Th2 subsets in patients with MDR-TB are more substantially suppressed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, while Th17 subset response seemed more preferentially enhanced<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, as it was reported that CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells fail to produce IL-2 during chronic TB infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>.

It is thus possible that IL-2 therapy improved anti-TB immune responses and thereby had an effect on the bacterial load.</p><p id="Par17">To elucidate the mechanisms underlying rhIL-2 effect <italic>in vivo</italic>, we observed activations of T subsets induced by rhIL-2 adjunctive treatment in these participants. We reported an restriction of CD3<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>&#x02212;</sup>IL-17<sup>+</sup> cells generation and an expansion of CD3<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>&#x02212;</sup>IFN-&#x003b3;<sup>+</sup> T cells activation as well as limitation of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup>cells population <italic>in vivo</italic> induced by adjunctive rhIL-2 immunotherapy. Interestingly, the trends of CD3<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>&#x02212;</sup>IFN-&#x003b3;<sup>+</sup>cells and CD3<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>&#x02212;</sup>IL-17<sup>+</sup>cells populations were inversed during rhIL-2 immunotherapy as the clinical symptoms improved.</p><p id="Par18">Recent studies have demonstrated that the balance between Th17-mediated protection and pathology is crucial for defining the outcome of infections at the mucosa with IL-17 attracting IFN-&#x003b3;-producing CD4<sup>+</sup> Th1 cells to the lungs to control the infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Our previous study suggested that chronic infection with MDR-TB probably exhausted Th1 cells and activated the Th17 cell response. As was reported, pathogen specific Th17 cells generated during mycobacterium infection induce the expression of CXCL9, CXCL10 and CXCL11, as well as IL-17 produced dictate the migration of other important effectors cell types to control the infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. In our previous study we detected that MDR-TB patients more remarkably suppressed Th1 and Th2 cell response and more significantly enhanced IL-17 expression versus DS-TB according to our publications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, which are characterized in early infection of MDR-TB. From these evidence we obtained we supposed that higher Th17 frequency in MDR-TB manifested were potentially related to symptom severity especially in drug-resistant TB infection. We speculated the expansion of circulating Th17 cells in MDR-TB patients developed from three T cell populations. Firstly, the &#x003b3;&#x003b4;T cell population, which is recently elucidated to be a major and primary source of mycobacterium-induced IL-17 during mycobacterium infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Secondly, the conversion of Treg to Th17 cells has now been reported, in both mouse and human in an IL-1-dependent manner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>.

Thirdly, the impaired Th1 response induced the generation of Th17 and IL-17 to promote the clearance of micobacteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par19">IL-2 derived from lung DC cells was recently reported to induce protective Th17 response and restrain fatal hyperinflammation <italic>in vivo</italic>
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. IL-2 restrictes <italic>in vitro</italic> generation of IL-17-Secreting CD4<sup>+</sup>T cells via STATA-5, IL-2 and STAT5a/b, which were known to be key regulators of Treg cells, also serve to constrain Th17 polarization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. IL-2 can also act T cell intrinsically to dampen differentiation of pathogenic IL-17-producing Th17 cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>.

However the role of Treg cell in the infection of TB is complicated as whether it is protective, deteriorated, or bystanding is still not clear.</p><p id="Par22">Infection with M. tuberculosis may induce Treg cell-surface molecular changes with increased numbers of cell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. However, the mechanisms for Treg cells decreased in number after cure of active TB was not clear. On the one hand, the minimum dose of IL-2 necessary to stimulate Treg cells has not yet been established, and may vary according to the patient and the diseases. The main conclusions are that IL-2 induces robust expansion of the Treg cell population in mice and in patients with autoimmune vasculitis secondary to hepatitis C virus infection chronic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. However on the other hand, it seemed that the decreased trend of Treg cells in these patients after IL-2 treatment overpowered the increasing trend induced by IL-2 itself. The bacterial burden may induce the increase in Treg cells and consequently as the burden released (mycobacterium clearance) Treg cells decreased, which was evidenced from the patients with cavity MDR-TB, showing higher proportion of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25 high cells before treatment and CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>FoxP3<sup>+</sup>cells was significantly decreased in peripheral blood at 6-months after surgery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par23">Three limitations of this study should be noted. Firstly, our clinical outcomes analysis unbound cellular immunity data due to limited sample size for immunology test, while we found some patients of rhIL-2 group, who failed to benefit from immune treatment,. Stratified analyses according to cellular immune baseline in MDR-TB patients are needed in further study to prognosticate and select patients beneficial from rhIL-2 therapy. Secondly, selection bias due to limited sample size cannot be completely avoided; our data only represent the retreated MDR-TB categories. Thirdly, the present study was designed as an open-label trial unavoidable for comparing the compliance of MDR-TB patient under subcutaneous injection treatment as well as the effectiveness of rhIL-2 immunotherapy to intensive standard chemotherapy, which was not appropriate to a blind control study and consequently increasing biases.</p><p id="Par24">In conclusion, the adjunctive rhIL-2 therapy in proved to be safe and conferred significant improvement in cure rate, earlier culture negativity and lung focus absorption in MDR-TB patients, with the standard chemotherapy duration potentially shortened for 6 months, and The results showed that rhIL-2 immunotherapy seemed to promote the conversion of the Th1/Th17 activation imbalance and limit the Treg activation <italic>in vivo</italic>.

Target mRNA (IFN-&#x003b3;, IL-17A, Foxp3, and ROR-&#x003b3;t) primers design and sequence tested for qRT-PCR amplification were summarized in Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S7</xref>. We performed 3-step assays on mRNA expression (&#x003b2;-action and Target mRNA). The qRT-PCR reaction included an initial denaturation step at 95&#x02009;&#x000b0;C for 10&#x02009;min, which was then followed by 40 cycles of 92&#x02009;&#x000b0;C for 15&#x02009;s and 55&#x02009;&#x000b0;C (annealing temperature) for 1&#x02009;min. We used the &#x00394;&#x00394; Ct method to determine expression fold changes (patients vs. normal) in subsequent calculations. Conditions of qRT-PCR amplification system were summarized in Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S8</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p id="Par36">All statistical tests in this study were performed using SPSS 17.0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The data were expressed as the mean&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;standard deviation. The clinical characteristics of the rhIL-2 group and the control group were compared using Levene&#x02019;s variance test of homogeneity. We used the chi-squared (&#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>) test or Mehta&#x02019;s modification to Fisher&#x02019;s exact test across the treatment groups for comparisons of proportions. We compared Th17, Treg, and Th1 cell frequencies and the relative levels of IL-17A, ROR-&#x003b3;t, Foxp3, and IFN-&#x003b3; mRNA in PBMCs among all groups at baseline and between the two treatment groups at 6-month and 12-month follow-ups using Student&#x02019;s t test or one-way ANOVA with Tukey&#x02019;s post-hoc test.
