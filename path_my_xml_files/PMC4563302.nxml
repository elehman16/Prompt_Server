mechanical ventilation, if the response of tidal volume during manually assisted breathing
is dependent upon both upper extremity muscle tone and the pressure intensity of manually
assisted breathing. [Subjects] We recruited 13 patients on prolonged mechanical
ventilation, and assessed their upper extremity muscle tone using the modified Ashworth
scale (MAS). The subjects were assigned to either the low MAS group (MAS&#x02264;2, n=7) or the
high MAS group (MAS&#x02265;3, n=6). [Methods] The manually assisted breathing technique was
applied at a pressure of 2 kgf and 4 kgf. A split-plot ANOVA was performed to compare the
tidal volume of each pressure during manually assisted breathing between the low and the
high MAS groups. [Results] Statistical analysis showed there were main effects of the
upper extremity muscle tone and the pressure intensity of the manually assisted breathing
technique. There was no interaction between these factors. [Conclusion] Our findings
reveal that the tidal volume during the manually assisted breathing technique for patients
with prolonged mechanical ventilation depends upon the patient&#x02019;s upper extremity muscle
tone and the pressure intensity.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Manually assisted breathing</kwd><kwd>Muscle tone</kwd><kwd>Prolonged mechanical ventilation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The number of patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation (PMV) has recently
increased due to advances in medical technology and the development of medical
equipment<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Physical therapy for
patients on PMV commonly includes range of motion exercises that aim to prevent joint
contracture in the extremities and trunk, activities of daily living (ADL) training that
aims to maintain and improve ADL, and pulmonary physical therapy that aims to improve airway
clearance using postural drainage, mobilization and manually assisted breathing techniques
(MBAT)<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>MBAT is primarily performed to improve of ventilation and airway clearance through using
manual compression of the rib cage in accordance with the physiological chest movement<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. It is one of the most used techniques in
clinical situations, and it can be performed for a broad range of patients with pulmonary
disease, such as pneumonia, chronic obstructive lung disease and postoperative conditions.
It has been recognized that gravity, improvement of air entry into the peripheral airway,
and increase of expiratory flow volume are important for the effective clearance of sputum
from the peripheral airways to the central airway<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. The cough action is also necessary for sputum expectoration to the
central airway.</p><p>For tracheostomy patients using mechanical ventilation, it is difficult to increase
expiratory flow during the cough action because they have difficulty in closing the glottis
and increasing the intrapleural pressure. Therefore, the tidal volume (VT) becomes an
important factor of airway clearance for them. When the mechanical ventilation is prolonged,
respiratory muscle weakness is induced which in turn will results in patients having greater
difficulty in increasing VT by themselves. In addition, when PMV patients have disturbance
of consciousness, they are unable to increase VT unless the settings of the mechanical
ventilator are changed. In contrast, MBAT can be performed to temporarily increase VT
without the use of special tools or changes in the ventilator settings. Thus MBAT is an
effective and practical pulmonary physical therapy maneuver which can be used in various
clinical situations, such as in the hospital and at home-based.</p><p>However, MBAT has been criticized for not being an evidence-based technique. Although it is
widely and commonly used in Japan, it is hardly mentioned in the published guidelines for
pulmonary rehabilitation<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Also few studies
have examined the technique, and those studies investigated the effects of MBAT on
airway-secretion removal in the acute phase<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>, effects of MBAT with shaking on VT in patients with central nervous
system disease<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>, and its efficacy in
respiratory conditioning in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Moreover, the majority of studies of MBAT did not define
the pressure of the compression; therefore, the results of the MBAT may have been affected
by the subjective pressure intensity of the therapists.</p><p>Some patients with respiratory failure due to hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy,
cerebrovascular disease, or neurodegenerative disease require mechanical ventilation. These
diseases often result in changes in muscle tone. Sadamori et al. reported that abnormality
of muscle tone affects the response of VT during MBAT in patients with severe motor and
intellectual disabilities<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Nevertheless, no study has examined whether MBAT improves VT, and whether VT is influenced
by the muscle tone of PMV patients.</p><p>Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the influence of muscle tone in the upper extremity on the
response of VT during MBAT for PMV patients. The muscle tone of the upper extremity is
easily assessed in clinical situations. In the present study, MBAT was defined as a maneuver
that compresses the rib cage during expiration and releases it just before the initiation of
inspiration, and the magnitude of MBAT pressure was quantified.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This prospective observational study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of
Heiseikai Hospital (approval number: 11H23), and written informed consent was obtained from
all of the participants or their legal guardians.</p><p>The study was carried out at the Heiseikai Hospital. The subjects were recruited from among
those who required tracheostomy for prolonged mechanical ventilation and were receiving
rehabilitation. Patients who had hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, cerebrovascular disease or
neurodegenerative disease, and had been on a mechanical ventilator (Servo s, Fukuda Denshi,
Tokyo, Japan) for more than a month were considered eligible for this study. The ventilator
was set for synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation. Exclusion criteria were patient
difficulty in synchronizing with the ventilator, rib fracture, presence of a chest tube,
hemodynamic instability, or a history of pneumonia in the two weeks prior to the initiation
of the study.</p><p>To measure the muscle tone in the upper extremity, elbow flexor muscles on the side of
greater hypertonicity were assessed using the modified Ashworth scale (MAS)<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. The patients were assigned to either a
low MAS group (MAS&#x02264;2) or a high MAS group (MAS&#x02265;3).</p><p>The position for the MBAT was a 30 degree laterally inclined position which is often used
for the prevention of pressure ulcers<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.
The patients were then randomly assigned to either right or left side-lying with a 1:1
allocation. The upper and lower extremities were positioned comfortably in order to avoid
increasing the muscle tone during periods of rest. MBAT was applied at pressures of 2 kgf
and 4 kgf which were set as light and normal pressures, based upon a previous study<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. In order to measure pressure intensity, a
hand-held dynamometer (HHD; &#x003bc;Tas F-1, Anima Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) with a fixing-belt
was used; the dimensions of the pressure sensor were 56 millimeters (length) by 56
millimeters (width). MBAT was applied through the HHD. With the subjects lying on their
sides, the center of the HHD pressure sensor was placed on the intersection of the seventh
intercostal space, halfway between the middle axillary line and the mid-clavicular line on
the upmost side. All of the MBAT applications were administered by a single physical
therapist, who had 11&#x02005;years&#x02019; clinical experience, and was well trained in respiratory
rehabilitation. During MBAT, the PT directed the manual pressure in accordance with the
respiratory chest movement of the patients, while paying attention to the HHD monitor so as
to achieve and maintain the target pressure intensity. The pressure was applied throughout
the expiration, and the pressure was released just before the initiation of inspiration. No
other maneuvers, such as vibration and/or springing were performed. The reproducibility of
the intervention by the PT was confirmed in advance by calculating the intraclass
correlation coefficients (ICC<sub>(1,1)</sub>) of VT, which were 0.964 and 0.971 for 2 kgf
and 4 kgf manual assistance, respectively.</p><p>Each MBAT was initially applied at 2 kgf pressure, allowed for each followed by 4 kgf
pressure. Before and after each application, a sufficient stabilization period was set for
the patient. After application the patient was allowed to re-stabilize and then once
stabilized a further two minutes of rest was observed before MBAT was applied again.</p><p>Upon commencing the measurement, the PT visually confirmed that there was no water in the
corrugated tube of the mechanical ventilator, and confirmed that no retention of sputum was
present on auscultation. Throughout the maneuver, the PT concentrated on performing the MBAT
and did not watch the instantaneous changes shown on the ventilator monitor. Those changes
were filmed by a video camera, and reviewed after the application had been completed.</p><p>The following information regarding subjects&#x02019; characteristics and medical conditions was
collected from their medical records: age, gender, body weight, the primary disease leading
to the use of mechanical ventilator, the duration of mechanical ventilator use, and the
presence of pleural effusion. The level of consciousness was assessed using the Glasgow Coma
Scale (GCS)<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Additionally, the resting
chest expansion difference (CED) under the mechanical ventilator was measured at three
levels (axially, and at the xiphoid and the tenth rib levels) using a tape measure. The
measurement was repeated three times, and the highest value was recorded as the CED.</p><p>Ten respiration events were recorded for each condition (at rest, and with 2 kgf and 4 kgf
manual assistance), once the pressure maneuver was sufficiently synchronized with the
mechanical ventilator. The VT and respiratory rate (RR) were obtained from the average of
eight respiration events, after excluding the highest and lowest valued respiration
events.</p><p>As associated indicators of mechanical ventilation, the following settings and values were
recorded from the ventilator monitor: peak inspiratory pressure (PIP), pressure control
(PC), pressure support (PS), positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP).</p><p>Statistical analysis was conducted of the patients&#x02019; characteristics between the low and
high MAS groups using Fisher&#x02019;s exact test, the unpaired t-test, and the Mann-Whitney U test.
A split-plot analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to analyze the data for VT at the
different MBAT pressures between the low and high MAS groups. When a main effect was
detected by ANOVA, Dunnett&#x02019;s post-hoc test was additionally performed. R2.8.1 was used for
the statistical work, and statistical significance was accepted for values of p &#x0003c; 0.05 in
all analyses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p><xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Characteristics of the patients</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Low MAS group<break/>(n=7)</th><th align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">High MAS group<break/>(n=6)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (years)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">72.3 &#x000b1; 16.7</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">63.3 &#x000b1; 19.6</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Gender (M/F)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2/5</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5/1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Body weight (kg)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">41.5 &#x000b1; 7.4</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">53.9 &#x000b1; 11.5</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Disease (number of patients)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" style="padding-left:10pt" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" style="padding-left:10pt" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Cerebrovascular disease</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" style="padding-left:10pt" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Neurodegenerative disease</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Glasgow coma scale<sup> &#x000a7;</sup></td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3.0 (3.0&#x02013;6.0)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.0 (3.0&#x02013;7.0)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">MAS in the upper extremity</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" style="padding-left:10pt" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0/1/1+/2/3/4 (number of each grade) ***</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2/3/0/2/0/0</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0/0/0/0/6/0</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Duration of ventilator support (days)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">585.4 &#x000b1; 476.5</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1216.8 &#x000b1; 716.5</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">RR at rest (breath per minute) *</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">17.3 &#x000b1; 5.0</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10.4 &#x000b1; 2.1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Settings of ventilator</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" style="padding-left:10pt" rowspan="1" colspan="1">PIP (cmH<sub>2</sub>O)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">13.4 &#x000b1; 2.5</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">13.7 &#x000b1; 2.3</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" style="padding-left:10pt" rowspan="1" colspan="1">PC (cmH<sub>2</sub>O)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8.7 &#x000b1; 1.9</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8.2 &#x000b1; 1.8</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" style="padding-left:10pt" rowspan="1" colspan="1">PS (cmH<sub>2</sub>O)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7.4 &#x000b1; 2.5</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6.5 &#x000b1; 3.3</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" style="padding-left:10pt" rowspan="1" colspan="1">PEEP (cmH<sub>2</sub>O)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5.3 &#x000b1; 0.8</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5.5 &#x000b1; 1.0</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>&#x000a7; median (interquartile range), All data show means &#x000b1; SD, except &#x000a7;. * p &#x0003c; 0.05;

subjects, three patients were excluded because they had problems in synchronizing with the
mechanical ventilator, two patients were excluded because of hemodynamic instability, one
patient was excluded because of the presence of pneumothorax and an inserted thoracostomy
tube, and another patient was excluded because of a history of pneumonia in the two weeks
prior to the initiation of the study. Therefore, 13 patients were studied. Of those 13
participants, 7 and 6 patients were assigned to the low and the high MAS group,
respectively. The primary diseases leading to the patients receiving mechanical ventilation
were hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy for 6 patients, cerebrovascular disease for 5 patients
(of those, two had subarachnoid hemorrhage, two had brain-stem hemorrhage, and one had
cerebral infarction), and 2 patients had neurodegenerative disease. All patients presented
disturbance of consciousness and quadriplegia. In terms of patients characteristics, CED,
the duration of mechanical ventilation use, the settings and values of the mechanical
ventilator, there were no significant differences between the low and the high MAS groups.
The mean value of RR at rest was significantly lower in the high MAS group than that of the
low MAS group.</p><p>All values of VT with MBAT were measured under pressure support ventilation. The mean
values of VT were 286.7 &#x000b1; 87.4&#x02005;mL at rest, 338.9 &#x000b1; 98.7&#x02005;mL with 2 kgf MBAT, and 383.9 &#x000b1;
93.9&#x02005;mL with 4 kgf MBAT in the low MAS group. In the high MAS group, the mean VTs were 417.6
&#x000b1; 67.6&#x02005;mL at rest, 468.9 &#x000b1; 89.7&#x02005;mL with 2 kgf MBAT, and 540.7 &#x000b1; 118.7&#x02005;mL with 4 kgf
MBAT.</p><p>In the results of the split-plot ANOVA, a main effect was observed between the low and the
high MAS groups (F = 7.43, p = 0.020) as well as between the applied pressures (F = 68.86, p
&#x0003c; 0.001). However, no significant interaction was detected between the low and the high
MAS groups (F = 1.32, p = 0.280). Within both groups, Dunnett&#x02019;s post-hoc test following
multiple comparison indicated there was no significant difference between the applied
pressure intensities (low MAS group: p = 0.179, high MAS group: p = 0.109).</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The present study showed that VT is influenced by muscle tone in the upper extremity.
Patients who had higher muscle tone in the elbow flexor muscles had higher values of VT than
those with lower muscle tone.</p><p>To observe how chest movement influences VT, an assessment of muscle tone in and around the
chest wall, e.g. upper trapezius and pectoralis major muscles, should be considered.
However, the elbow flexor muscles were assessed in this study, and the reasons were as
follows: it is difficult to objectively assess muscle tone in the upper trapezius and
pectoralis major muscles in patients with disturbances of consciousness and prolonged
mechanical ventilation; it is easier to assess the elbow flexors rather than the
aforementioned muscles in daily clinical situations; and there was no objective way to
assess chest flexibility and expansibility<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. In patients with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, cerebrovascular
disease or neurodegenerative disease, elbow flexor muscle tone is likely to increase when
the muscular tonicity of the pectoralis major is increased. This is because the innervation
zone of the shoulder and elbow joints in the cerebral motor cortex are physically adjacent,
and the innervated segmental levels of the elbow flexor and pectoralis major muscles
partially overlap. The pectoralis major muscle is one of the major inspiratory muscles, and
the rib cage is induced at a high inspiratory level when this muscle&#x02019;s tone is increased.
Mechanical ventilation was set as pressure-limited in this study, therefore a more greatly
expanded rib cage resulted in higher values of VT when the same inspiratory pressure was
applied to patients. Given this, increased muscle tone in the elbow flexors i.e. pectoralis
major was considered to have induced significantly higher VTs in the high MAS group.</p><p>Another main finding of this study was that an increase of MBAT pressure intensity tended
to increase in VT. With pressure-limited ventilation, the expiratory volume is controlled by
balancing the intrapleural pressure with the alveolar pressure made by the mechanical
ventilator. MBAT is a maneuver which encourages the expiration of the air within the alveoli
by increasing intrapleural pressure, thus pressuring the alveoli through compression of the
rib cage while maintaining PEEP. The finding of increased VT with increased MBAT pressure in
the present study was in agreement with the findings of previous studies. Kurita et al.
studied central nervous system disease sufferers who were at level V according to the Gross
Motor Function Classification System, and reported that MBAT significantly increased VT
compared to its value at rest, while MBAT with vibration had no beneficial effect on VT<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. McCarren et al. reported that
administration of MBAT caused an increase in intrapleural pressure, as measured by an
oesophageal balloon catheter, and an increase in the expiratory flow rate<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Stronger compression of the rib cage
induces a higher volume of expiration.</p><p>This study had some limitations. First, the sample size was small. With a larger number of
subjects, it would be possible carry out subgroup analysis according to the diagnosis or
ventilator dependence, therby allowing the elucidation of the interactions between the
effects of MBAT and diagnosis or ventilator dependence. Second, the mechanical ventilator
should be configured with consideration of the individual&#x02019;s body type, thus predicted body
weight calculated using patient&#x02019;s height and gender is generally used for the settings.
However, we were unable to calculate the predicted body weight as we were unable to measure
the patient&#x02019;s height because the subjects in this study were patients who presented
disturbance of consciousness and quadriplegia, and required PMV. While there was no
significant difference of the average measured body weights between the groups, more careful
consideration of the influences of an individual&#x02019;s body type is needed. Third, this study
did not refer to the range of motion of the elbow, because the modified Ashworth scale was
performed within the maximum range of joint motion. However, the range of motion might
affect the tidal volume. Lastly, we did not consider the pressure-volume curve. Under
mechanical ventilation, the VT increase becomes significant when inspiratory pressure
exceeds the lower inflection point, and it becomes difficult to increase when inspiratory
pressure is over the upper inflection point<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. This requires further study as it would influence the changes in
VT.</p><p>In conclusion, our present research examined the changes in VT resulting from changes in
MBAT pressure applied to PMV patients. We found that the effects of these changes were
governed by differences in muscle tonicity in the upper extremity, and confirmed this by
quantifying the MBAT pressure intensity. VT had higher values in the high MAS group at rest,
and these higher values of VT continued to be observed during the MBAT application. This
study was more objective than previous research because it succeeded in quantifying the
magnitude of pressure intensity using an HHD. The HHD is a device which has recently become
popular in clinical situations due to the simplicity of its use and its relative cheapness.
The results of this study have important clinical implications. In order to administer
effective MBAT to patients on PMV, there should not only be a focus on the ventilator
settings and the MBAT pressure intensity, but also on the condition of muscle tone in the
upper extremity.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Tatara</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Ishikawa</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Survey on long-term ventilator individuals in Japanise
