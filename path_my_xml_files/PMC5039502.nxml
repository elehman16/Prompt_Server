The aim of this research was to provide results on some health effects of oral administration of spray-dried extracts of black or red maca (<italic>Lepidium meyenii</italic>) in adult human subjects living at low (LA) and high altitude (HA). A total of 175 participants were given 3 g of either placebo, black, or red maca extract daily for 12 weeks. Primary outcomes were changes in sexual desire, mood, energy, health-related quality of life score (HRQL), and chronic mountain sickness (CMS) score, or in glycaemia, blood pressure, and hemoglobin levels. Secondary outcomes were acceptability and safety, assessed using the Likert test and side effect self-recording, respectively, and the effect of altitude. At low altitude, 32, 30, and 32 participants started the study receiving placebo, red maca, or black maca, respectively. At high altitudes, 33, 35, and 31 participants started the study receiving placebo, red maca, and black maca, respectively. Consumption of spray-dried extracts of red and black maca resulted in improvement in mood, energy, and health status, and reduced CMS score. Fatty acids and macamides were higher in spray-dried extracts of black maca than in red maca. GABA predominated in spray-dried extracts of red maca. Effects on mood, energy, and CMS score were better with red maca. Black maca and, in smaller proportions, red maca reduced hemoglobin levels only in highlanders with abnormally high hemoglobin levels; neither variety of maca reduced hemoglobin levels in lowlanders. Black maca reduced blood glucose levels. Both varieties produced similar responses in mood, and HRQL score. Maca extracts consumed at LA or HA had good acceptability and did not show serious adverse effects. In conclusion, maca extract consumption relative to the placebo improved quality of life parameters. Differences in the level of improvement between red and black maca are probably due to differences in the composition of these two plant varieties. Both maca extracts were well tolerated and safe.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>toxicity</kwd><kwd>adverse effects</kwd><kwd>red maca</kwd><kwd>black maca</kwd><kwd><italic>Lepidium meyenii</italic></kwd><kwd>placebo</kwd><kwd>high altitude</kwd><kwd>human health</kwd><kwd>nutraceuticals</kwd><kwd>botanicals</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1-pharmaceuticals-09-00049"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Maca (<italic>Lepidium meyenii</italic>) is a plant grown at over 4000 m in Peru that belongs to the Brassicaceae family (Cruciferous vegetables). It has been consumed for centuries as food by inhabitants of the Peruvian Central Andes due to the nutritional and medicinal properties of its hypocotyls [<xref rid="B1-pharmaceuticals-09-00049" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>Maca is present in nature in different external colors or phenotypes [<xref rid="B2-pharmaceuticals-09-00049" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Several studies showed that different colors of maca produce different biological responses. In fact, experimental studies showed that red maca reverses testosterone-induced prostatic benign hyperplasia [<xref rid="B3-pharmaceuticals-09-00049" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and ovariectomized-induced osteoporosis in adults&#x02019; rats [<xref rid="B4-pharmaceuticals-09-00049" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], whereas black maca increases sperm count, reduces glycemia in streptozotocin-induced diabetes mellitus [<xref rid="B5-pharmaceuticals-09-00049" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], and enhances memory and learning [<xref rid="B6-pharmaceuticals-09-00049" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] in experimental animal models.</p><p>An in vitro study showed that maca decreased angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity, thereby reducing the availability of angiotensin, a hormone with hypertensive properties [<xref rid="B7-pharmaceuticals-09-00049" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Similarly, in a population traditionally consuming maca, aged 40&#x02013;70 years, a lower systolic blood pressure but not diastolic blood pressure was observed compared with a non-consuming population [<xref rid="B8-pharmaceuticals-09-00049" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>A cross-sectional study showed that maca consumption was associated with high scores on a health-related quality of life (HRQL) questionnaire (SF-20) in men and women aged 40&#x02013;70 years living at high altitude [<xref rid="B8-pharmaceuticals-09-00049" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. This high health status observed in maca consumers was also associated with low levels of cytokine interleukin 6 (IL-6) [<xref rid="B8-pharmaceuticals-09-00049" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. These results are in concordance with data showing that consumption of higher amounts of cruciferous vegetables was associated with reduced systemic levels of proinflammatory cytokines as interleukin 6 (IL-6) [<xref rid="B9-pharmaceuticals-09-00049" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-pharmaceuticals-09-00049" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] suggesting that cruciferous vegetables are healthy foods.</p><p>Chronic mountain sickness (CMS) is a pathology observed only in populations living at high altitude (HA) and represents a lack of adaptation to live at high elevations [<xref rid="B11-pharmaceuticals-09-00049" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In a cross-sectional study at high altitudes, maca consumption was associated with reduced prevalence of CMS in adult men and women, based on a questionnaire of seven signs/symptoms of CMS and elevated hemoglobin levels [<xref rid="B12-pharmaceuticals-09-00049" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>In humans, self-perception of sexual desire increased after eight weeks of consumption of gelatinized maca [<xref rid="B13-pharmaceuticals-09-00049" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] or four weeks after consumption of maca extracts [<xref rid="B14-pharmaceuticals-09-00049" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Blood pressure decreases with maca treatment in menopausal women [<xref rid="B15-pharmaceuticals-09-00049" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. However, it is unknown yet if such an effect depends on the different phenotypes of maca.</p><p>Since most of the results were based on a cross-sectional design, it is unlikely that we can prove a cause and effect relationship for consuming maca. For this reason, a prospective study is necessary to determine the efficacy on health status. In addition, interest in maca as a food supplement has increased worldwide, and so it is necessary to ensure the acceptability and safety of the products during its consumption.</p><p>The present work describes the possible effects of oral administration of spray-dried extracts of black or red maca (<italic>Lepidium meyenii</italic>) in adult human subjects placed in two areas: one located in the Peruvian central Andes, close to where maca is cultivated and where consumption is traditional, and a second population located at the coast where maca consumption is less common. This study assesses as primary outcomes the efficacy of spray-dried extracts of black or red maca on variables associated with health status and as secondary outcomes the acceptability of consumption of black maca or red maca extract as compared with a placebo. In addition, the study aims to describe the self-reported acceptability and side effects after oral administration of spray-dried extracts of black or red maca (<italic>Lepidium meyenii</italic>) in adult human subjects living at low (LA) and high altitude (HA) during 12 weeks in a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial. It was hypothesized that several variables associated with health status would improve more with spray-dried maca extracts than with the placebo. It was also expected that acceptability would be higher at high altitude than at low altitude and that effect size would be different between red and black maca extracts but similar between altitudes.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-pharmaceuticals-09-00049"><title>2.

Discussion</title><p>This study was primarily designed to determine the efficacy of oral consumption of extracts of black maca or red maca, a cruciferous plant, during a 12-week period in a double-blind placebo-controlled trial at LA and HA. Secondary objectives of the study were the determination of acceptability, adverse effects, and effect of altitude on outcomes after maca intervention.</p><sec id="sec3dot1-pharmaceuticals-09-00049"><title>3.1. Primary Outcomes: Efficacy</title><p>During the period of the study, consumption of spray-dried extracts of black and red maca increased self-perception of sexual desire, mood, and energy. This is in accordance with experimental studies and results in human beings with unidentified maca [<xref rid="B8-pharmaceuticals-09-00049" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>This trial was also able to demonstrate that spray-dried extracts of black maca and red maca have different biological properties. In fact, self-perception of increase of sexual desire, mood, and energy, and reduction in CMS score were more relevant with red maca than with black maca. This is in accordance with different properties shown for black maca and red maca in experimental designs [<xref rid="B8-pharmaceuticals-09-00049" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Black maca demonstrated better response with hemoglobin levels at high altitude. Both maca phenotypes have similar responses in HRQL score.</p><p>Although red maca increased sexual desire more than black maca, the effect seems to be modest since it represented only 50% of the subjects. Moreover, a placebo effect was observed particularly at HA. In a previous study using gelatinized maca in men at LA, sexual desire increased only in 42% and after eight weeks of treatment [<xref rid="B16-pharmaceuticals-09-00049" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Maca dry extract supplementation was also useful to improve subjective perception of general and sexual well-being in adult men with mild erectile dysfunction [<xref rid="B17-pharmaceuticals-09-00049" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Another study using maca flour at a dose of 3.3 g/day for six weeks was unable to show an increase in sexual desire in post-menopausal women [<xref rid="B15-pharmaceuticals-09-00049" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Stone et al. [<xref rid="B14-pharmaceuticals-09-00049" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] showed an increase in sexual desire at week 4 using an extract of unidentified maca. Although extract of maca, particularly the red phenotype, seems to be better than flour or gelatinized maca, the results are still modest.</p><p>Maca shows greater effects on mood and energy. In fact, over 80% of the population reported increased mood and energy following maca consumption.</p><p>Among the most notorious compounds in maca are macamides, a group of fatty acid lipids. These compounds seem to act on a widely expressed signaling system known as the endocannabinoid system (ECB) [<xref rid="B18-pharmaceuticals-09-00049" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-pharmaceuticals-09-00049" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Macamides inhibit anandamide degradation through the inhibition of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH). Anandamide acts on the CB1 receptor. Maca&#x02019;s effects on mood might be linked to its role on the CB1 receptor since other FAAH inhibitors have been shown to act as antidepressants by enhancing central serotonergic and noradrenergic transmission and promoting neurogenesis in the hippocampus [<xref rid="B20-pharmaceuticals-09-00049" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>The presence of GABA might also explain the elevated mood [<xref rid="B21-pharmaceuticals-09-00049" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] after the 12 weeks of treatment. GABA was higher in red than in black maca and this may explain the differences in the response on mood. Indeed, the present study showed that treatment with red maca was more effective at increasing mood than black maca.</p><p>Choline is another compound present in spray-dried extracts of maca. Choline supplementation improves neurocognitive functioning [<xref rid="B22-pharmaceuticals-09-00049" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-pharmaceuticals-09-00049" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-pharmaceuticals-09-00049" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Choline also plays a critical role in hepatic function and systemic lipid metabolism [<xref rid="B25-pharmaceuticals-09-00049" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Mood is also improved after choline supplementation [<xref rid="B26-pharmaceuticals-09-00049" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>Choline acts in the brain as an agonist of the alpha 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (&#x003b1;7 nAChR) [<xref rid="B27-pharmaceuticals-09-00049" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Choline is also antinociceptive [<xref rid="B27-pharmaceuticals-09-00049" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and this property may improve the score in the HRQL questionnaire. The generic health-related quality of life (HRQL) questionnaire used for assessment health status [<xref rid="B12-pharmaceuticals-09-00049" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] showed that the score increased with treatment with spray-dried extract of black or red maca compared to the placebo. This was an effect of maca and not a placebo effect. This finding confirms previous findings that populations consuming maca at HA have better HRQL scores than populations not consuming maca at the same altitude [<xref rid="B8-pharmaceuticals-09-00049" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B12-pharmaceuticals-09-00049" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Our finding of increased HRQL scores after maca consumption is also in concordance with the absence of serious or severe adverse effects due to consumption of spray-dried extracts of red or black maca reported in the present study.</p><p>In the present study, at LA or at HA, systolic or diastolic blood pressure did not change after consumption of spray-dried extracts of red or black maca compared to the placebo. In a previous study in postmenopausal Hong Kong Chinese women, there was a significant reduction in diastolic blood pressure over 12 weeks of treatment with 3.3 g/day of maca [<xref rid="B15-pharmaceuticals-09-00049" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. However, there is a report in patients with metabolic syndrome indicating that maca administration at a dose of 0.6 g/day for 90 days resulted in a moderate elevation of AST and diastolic blood pressure [<xref rid="B28-pharmaceuticals-09-00049" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. There is no other study confirming this finding. In fact, in a previous study, no increase in arterial blood pressure occurred in healthy men who took gelatinized maca at doses of 1.5 of 3.0 g/day for 90 days [<xref rid="B1-pharmaceuticals-09-00049" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The fact that maca contains high amounts of potassium and low of sodium [<xref rid="B1-pharmaceuticals-09-00049" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and inhibitory activity of ACE [<xref rid="B7-pharmaceuticals-09-00049" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] suggests that it is feasible that maca may reduce arterial blood pressure rather than increase it.</p><p>Spray-dried extract of black maca reduced fasting glucose levels over time whereas in the placebo group they did not change during the treatment period of 12 weeks at LA and at weeks 4 and 8 at HA. This result corroborates previous results from experimental studies in which black maca reduced fasting blood glucose levels in mice with streptozotocin-induced diabetes [<xref rid="B5-pharmaceuticals-09-00049" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In addition, maca, as well as rosiglitazone, significantly improved glucose tolerance, decreased the AUC (area under the curve) of glucose, and reduced glycemia [<xref rid="B29-pharmaceuticals-09-00049" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In our study, black maca reduced glycemia at both LA and HA. A placebo effect also occurred for glycemia reduction over time: glycemia was significantly lower at HA than at LA, confirming results previously reported [<xref rid="B30-pharmaceuticals-09-00049" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>Hemoglobin was another primary outcome assessed, since scientific publications without scientific evidence suggest maca has been used for centuries in the Andes to treat anemia [<xref rid="B15-pharmaceuticals-09-00049" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. This assumption is probably due to the presence of iron in maca [<xref rid="B1-pharmaceuticals-09-00049" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. However, our results at LA show that 12 weeks of treatment with spray-dried extract of black or red maca has no improving effect on hemoglobin level, suggesting that maca is not useful in treating anemia at LA.</p><p>On the contrary, our results indicating a reduction in hemoglobin levels at HA after black maca consumption are remarkable since high hemoglobin levels at HA are associated with chronic mountain sickness, a condition of lack of adaptation to HA compromising almost 20% of the population living over 4000 m [<xref rid="B11-pharmaceuticals-09-00049" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Previously, a cross-sectional study in a population close to Cerro de Pasco (over 4000 m) showed that maca consumers have lower CMS scores than those non-maca consumers living in the same place [<xref rid="B8-pharmaceuticals-09-00049" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Data suggest that red maca could be acting on signs and symptoms whereas black maca is acting on high hemoglobin levels. Our results suggest that this is an effect based on maca. The consumption of maca, particularly the red phenotype, could be an important alternative in cases of CMS.</p><p>Our study shows a placebo effect in several variables studied, although these were not consistent over time. This placebo effect was also observed in other studies with maca [<xref rid="B15-pharmaceuticals-09-00049" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B31-pharmaceuticals-09-00049" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], but our results are consistent, in which several of the primary outcomes studied were different with maca than with the placebo.</p><p>Our results are in accordance with other authors who suggest that the placebo effect should be part of alternative medicine [<xref rid="B32-pharmaceuticals-09-00049" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p><p>Recent findings showed that neurotransmitter pathways might mediate placebo effects [<xref rid="B33-pharmaceuticals-09-00049" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The higher placebo effect observed at HA than at LA is remarkable. Genetic signatures have been identified in those subjects responding to placebo [<xref rid="B34-pharmaceuticals-09-00049" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and this may explain the differences between populations at LA and HA. At HA, placebo administration to headache sufferers inhibited the nocebo-related component of pain and prostaglandin synthesis [<xref rid="B35-pharmaceuticals-09-00049" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. This may explain the reduction of CMS score with placebo in headache as part of the symptoms included in the CMS test.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot2-pharmaceuticals-09-00049"><title>3.2. Secondary Outcomes: Acceptability</title><p>Most of the subjects included in the present study were satisfied with the taste of the product consumed independently if they consumed a placebo or a spray-dried extract of maca. This high satisfaction occurred as early as the first week of treatment and reached its highest values at weeks 8 and 12.</p><p>This is an important finding since cruciferous vegetables are bitter, which might be off-putting to consumers [<xref rid="B36-pharmaceuticals-09-00049" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Thus, high acceptability of consuming a spray-dried extract of maca, another cruciferous vegetable, might be important to promote its consumption as a value-added product. Perceived bitterness of cruciferous vegetables varies from person to person, which suggests a genetic contribution in acceptability [<xref rid="B37-pharmaceuticals-09-00049" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Glucosinolates and metabolites, compounds present in maca (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pharmaceuticals-09-00049-t001">Table 1</xref>), impart the characteristic bitter taste and pungent odor of cruciferous vegetables [<xref rid="B38-pharmaceuticals-09-00049" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="B39-pharmaceuticals-09-00049" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Maca flour has a pungent smell and bitter taste and may result in aversion in persons not accustomed to its consumption.</p><p>Our results showed differences in acceptability between populations at LA and at HA. It is possible to think that subjects at LA are not as accustomed to the maca flavor as those living at HA. Our study used spray-dried extracts of black maca or red maca instead of flour, resulting in an improvement of the taste with maintenance of biological activity.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot3-pharmaceuticals-09-00049"><title>3.3. Adverse Effects</title><p>It is common to find severe adverse effects with medicinal plants&#x02019; usage [<xref rid="B40-pharmaceuticals-09-00049" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. For such reason, since interest in maca, a nutraceutical plant, has increased worldwide, it is important to know its adverse effects, particularly in populations with little or no experience with its consumption.</p><p>Another secondary outcome of this study was to determine the adverse effects after consumption of spray-dried extracts of maca and compare data with those obtained after placebo consumption during an intervention period of 12 weeks. There were no severe or serious adverse effects due to consumption of an extract of red or black maca, and no subject discontinued the trial due to an adverse effect. The discontinuation rate was similar in the three groups of treatment at LA and at HA. Most occurred at the first month due to reasons besides adverse effects or disagreement with the products. Moreover, the percentage of people missing the follow-up was similar between groups consuming the placebo, black maca extract, or red maca extract.</p><p>Previous findings in experimental animals receiving different phenotypes of maca (black, red, or yellow) showed no acute toxicity at &#x02264;17 g of dried hypocotyls/kg body weight (BW) [<xref rid="B1-pharmaceuticals-09-00049" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].

Design</title><p>This was a 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study comparing the efficacy, acceptability, and safety of oral administration of spray-dried extracts of black maca, red maca, or a placebo in adult human subjects living at 150 m (Lima, Peru) or 4340 m altitude (Cerro de Pasco, Peru). In each place, around one-third of the subjects received spray-dried extracts of black maca, red maca, or a placebo. Men and women were randomly assigned to each group.</p><p>All subjects received information on the purpose and procedures of the study. The participation of the volunteers included, among other things, filling out of a questionnaire and allowing sampling of venous blood. In Cerro de Pasco, 8% declared that they were smokers but less than one pack a year. In Lima, 16.8% smoked (41% smoked one packet a year, 35% one packet a month, and 24% less than one packet a month).</p><p>A CONSORT Herbal Extension checklist for the reporting of this study is inserted as a supplementary file.</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot4-pharmaceuticals-09-00049"><title>4.4. Intervention</title><p>This study used both spray-dried maca extracts or a placebo placed in individual sealed sachets, in an amount of 3 g. Spray-dried extracts of maca or placebo have the same appearance. Each subject only received one kind of product. Subjects were unable to differentiate between the products. Oral administration of sachets of maca extracts or the placebo occurred daily for a period of 12 weeks. The dose of 3 g per subject was calculated by extrapolating from data from previous animal studies [<xref rid="B3-pharmaceuticals-09-00049" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-pharmaceuticals-09-00049" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-pharmaceuticals-09-00049" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-pharmaceuticals-09-00049" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Follow-up occurred each week during the first four weeks and then at week 8 and 12. On each visit we recorded information about incidents. Adherence was monitored through sachets delivered each visit. Each subject returned empty sachets and they received new, full sachets.</p><p>The subjects were asked to consume the same diet they normally eat throughout the period of the study. However, they were told not to consume additional maca products.</p><p>Practitioners in charge of the intervention have all approved the CITI training course for research in human subjects.

Products</title><p>The plant was authenticated by Camilo D&#x000ed;az, Botanist, Section of Pharmaceutical Sciences, the Faculty of Sciences and Philosophy, Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia. The voucher specimen (HEPLAME-MG-2015) was placed at the Section of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University Peruana Cayetano Heredia. Authentication was done by morphological characteristics. In addition, authentication was performed by the presence of glucosinolates and macamides in the hypocotyls of maca by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). For this research, spray-dried hydro alcoholic extracts of black maca or red maca was used. For extract preparation, 70% ethanol was used. Maltodextrin was used as the placebo. The dried hypocotyls of maca were used to prepare the extracts. Twenty grams of dried hypocotyls of maca represents almost three grams of the spray-dried extract of maca. Enterprise A-1 del Per&#x000fa;, Industrial Comercial SAC was in charge of preparation of the maca extracts and placebo. The excipient for maca extract was maltodextrin. For this reason, maltodextrin was used as the placebo. According to the protocol, the sachets containing 3 g of powder each were packed in boxes containing 30 sachets by Artpack Per&#x000fa; SAC. Each box (display) was labeled as A, B, or C. Boxes had been kept under appropriate storage conditions at the Research and Development Laboratory building at the Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia in Lima and at the Laboratory of the High Altitude Research Institute in Cerro de Pasco.

Conclusions</title><p>The present study has demonstrated that consumption of a spray-dried extract of red and black maca for 12 weeks resulted in an improvement of mood, energy, and health status, and a reduced CMS score.</p><p>Fatty acids and macamides were higher in spray-dried extracts of black maca than in red maca. GABA predominated in spray-dried extracts of red maca. Effects on mood, energy, and CMS score were better with the spray-dried extract of red maca. Maca reduced hemoglobin levels only in high altitude, where abnormally high hemoglobin values are related to HA maladaptation. No effect on Hb levels was observed in LA. In addition, consumption of spray-dried extracts of red and black maca is safe and both have good acceptability, but better at high altitude.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors acknowledge support from Diana Alcantara, Ivan Condori, Jennifer Tello, and Aileen Rojas from Lima, and Julio Chammi, Alfredo Melo, Jesus Leandro, and Jhomar Cordova from Cerro de Pasco during fieldwork and analysis of data.</p></ack><notes><title>Author Contributions</title><p>C.G. participated in the design of the study, recruitment of volunteers, and monitoring of the study in Lima.
