Enoxaparin, a low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), is effective in prevention and treatment of VTE. Some small studies indicated that this benefit might extend to patients with cancer and probably prolong survival due to independent mechanisms. We initiated this safety investigation to get feasibility information on intensified chemotherapy combined with LMWH in outpatients with APC treated in 1<sup>st</sup> line.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The trial was a prospective, open-label, single center investigation in outpatients with inoperable pancreatic cancer who were treated with intensified first-line chemotherapy along with concomitant application of subcutaneous LMWH. The combined chemotherapy consisted of gemcitabine 1&#x000a0;g/m<sup>2</sup> (30&#x000a0;min), 5-FU 750&#x000a0;mg/m<sup>2</sup> (24&#x000a0;h), folinic acid 200&#x000a0;mg/m<sup>2</sup> (30&#x000a0;min), and Cisplatin 30&#x000a0;mg/m<sup>2</sup> (90&#x000a0;min) on day 1 and 8; q3w for the first 12&#x000a0;weeks (GFFC) followed by gemcitabine alone in patients without cancer progression. The simultaneous application of prophylactic enoxaparin started on day 1 of chemotherapy with a fixed dose of 40&#x000a0;mg daily. Statistical analyses were performed using R 3.01 with software package CMPRSK and SPSS software v19.0.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The investigation was stopped after recruitment of 19 patients.

One case (5%) of a symptomatic non-lethal thromboembolic event was observed while receiving LMWH treatment. No severe bleeding event as defined in the protocol has been observed.

This is accompanied by a case fatality rate of 90% and thus constitutes the fourth most-frequent cause of death from solid cancer in the western world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. In patients with non-resectable advanced pancreatic cancer (APC) median overall survival without effective systemic anticancer treatment is not higher than 4&#x000a0;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Despite intensive anticancer research in the last decade, five year overall survival in patients with APC is still less than 5% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Single agent gemcitabine (GEM) has become the standard first-line chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer 15&#x000a0;years ago [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. More recent trials using combination regimens with or without gemcitabine showed improvements in cancer control-rate and even survival advantages, most pronounced for patients with better performance status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Thus, patients with good performance status are indicated for intensified treatment with combined chemotherapy regimens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>Venous thromboembolic events (VTE) are considered to be a commonly accurring major lethal complication in cancer patients. Population based case&#x02013;control trials display a cumulative incidence of VTE of up to six-fold in cancer patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Cancer types with highest incidence rates are advanced malignancies of the brain, pancreas, lung, and stomach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. As compared to more limited stages metastatic disease results in a 4 to 13-fold elevated VTE risk, which is further increased by systemic anticancer therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The bidirectional interaction between cancer and hemostasis not only leads to activation of blood cells and the coagulation system resulting in clinically relevant thromboembolism but these processes are also under suspicion to enhance cancer growth and metastatic spread [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. VTE are considered to be a prognostic-negative factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and small studies showed astonishing survival advantages using heparin as prophylactic treatment to prevent VTE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Based on these assumptions our CONKO study group planned to conduct a randomized trial to investigate the impact of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) in a prospective setting in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer undergoing first line therapy, the CONKO-004 trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. During the preliminary stages we had to undertake a pilot trial to get information on safety and feasibility of combined chemotherapy with simultaneous treatment of the LMWH enoxaparin in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer who are at high risk of gastrointestinal bleeding due to local cancer spread. The toxicity profile, feasibility, and maximum tolerable dosage of the combination of gemcitabine/5-FU/Folinic Acid/Cisplatin was investigated in a past phase-I trial of our study group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Design and treatment</title><p>The trial was a prospective, open-label, single center investigation in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer who were treated with first-line chemotherapy in an outpatient setting. The intensified treatment consisted of gemcitabine 1&#x000a0;g/m<sup>2</sup> (30&#x000a0;min), 5-FU 750&#x000a0;mg/m<sup>2</sup> (24&#x000a0;h), folinic acid 200&#x000a0;mg/m<sup>2</sup> (30&#x000a0;min), and cisplatin 30&#x000a0;mg/m<sup>2</sup> (90&#x000a0;min) on day 1 and 8; q3w. The concomitant application of enoxaparin started on day 1 of chemotherapy with a fixed dose of 40&#x000a0;mg daily until cancer progression. Beyond the initial 3&#x000a0;months of intensified 1<sup>st</sup>-line chemotherapy all patients without cancer progression received further treatment with single agent gemcitabine and enoxaparin to prevent patients from cumulative toxicities. Dose adjustment for enoxaparin was recommended in patients with impaired kidney function or thrombocytopenia within the study according to NCI-CTC (National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria) guidelines to minimize bleeding risk. Dose adjustment for chemotherapy dosage was realised by protocol-defined regulations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Prophylactic antiemetic therapy and supportive care were provided according to individual symptoms and demand.</p><p>The study used a sequential design to be able to stop the feasibility investigation in case of severe side effects. After inclusion of three consecutive patients a hold of recruitment was arranged until all three patients received at least 4&#x000a0;weeks of concomitant enoxaparin treatment. In absence of inacceptable toxicity by confirmation of the protocol committee the recruitment was continued until a minimum of 15 patients received at least 12&#x000a0;weeks concomitant enoxaparin treatment. Patients were followed up until death of any reason or lost to follow-up.</p><p>The trial was approved by the scientific and research ethics committee of our institution (Ethikkommission der Charit&#x000e9; - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin). The investigation was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice Guidelines and within the CONSORT guidelines. Furthermore, the national principles for the proper execution of the clinical examination of drugs (Bundesanzeiger No. 243 of 30.12.1987), the national regulations of the German drug law, and the German drug test guidelines were adhered.

The application of medical anticoagulation for cancer patients was still discussed over the last decade, even for inpatients or patients with confirmed thrombosis. The assumed higher incidence of severe bleeding events due to medical anticoagulation, especially in patients with advanced gastrointestinal malignancies, reduced the number of sufficient treated patients in the past and thus may lead to impaired overall survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>This open label phase II feasibility investigation used intensified chemotherapy and simultaneous enoxaparin treatment in patients with first line chemotherapy. The dosage of enoxaparin to be used in our trial has been intensively discussed in terms of pre-existing prevention studies in other indications. Results from the PRINCE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] and MEDENOX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] studies demonstrated effective and well-tolerated VTE prevention in patients with severe cardiopulmonary disease using the LMWH enoxaparin. The given dosages in the MEDENOX trial were set at a high prophylactic level of 40&#x000a0;mg daily versus placebo and also in the PRINCE trial with 40&#x000a0;mg daily versus 5000&#x000a0;IU unfractioned heparin 3&#x000d7; daily. Thus 40&#x000a0;mg enoxaparin once a day was considered to be the minimal dose for primary symptomatic VTE prevention.</p><p>We used a safety step design to prevent patients from harmful increased toxicities due to the combination. The observed side effects were consistent with respect to the applied chemotherapy and were similar to those in our phase I trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. We therefore continued the investigation without need of modification of the regimen. Even the addition of heparin does not lead to increased toxicities. We suspected a raise in the local bleeding rate in our advanced pancreatic cancer patients by potential cancer infiltration of the stomach or duodenum. Major bleeding rates for patients with solid cancer using warfarin were 42% and 14% for controls in 431 patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], in our safety trial we therefore decided to accept no higher rate than 20% using prophylactic anticoagulation with enoxaparin. Fortunately we did not observe any patient with severe bleeding under concomitant application of 40&#x000a0;mg enoxaparin daily. Only one patient had a thromboembolic event while getting enoxaparin (5%), whereas the supposed rate of thromboembolic events without heparin use would be 15-20% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>We further observed a slightly increased overall survival compared to gemcitabine monotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. This finding and the open discussion about an independent effect of heparins with regard to metastasis and cancer growth has to be investigated by a randomized trial in a larger setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. On the other hand this observed effect is commonly seen in phase II studies with the potential bias of unconscious patient selection and the addition of placebo effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. But besides these considerations we can at least assume that the efficacy of the treatment is not negatively affected.</p><p>The finding of this investigation regarding feasibility and safety gives us confidence for using the researched combination in a larger trial to investigate the effect of heparin in a randomized setting.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In summary, the addition of enoxaparin to GFFC is feasible, safe and does not appear to affect the activity or the toxicity profile of the chemotherapy regimen in patients with advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma. To examine whether enoxaparin reduces the incidence of thromboembolic events and increases survival, we have initiated a randomized investigation study of GFFC (or single-agent gemcitabine for patients with impaired performance status) with or without enoxaparin (CONKO-004) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>No potential conflicts of interest relevant to this report of our investigator initiated trial are present.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>UP, AH, JMS, MS, MB and BG contributed to patient enrolment and to the collection and assembly of the data.
