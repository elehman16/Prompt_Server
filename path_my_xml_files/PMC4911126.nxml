Both groups performed two sessions weekly consisting of four sets of six repetitions of the bench press throw exercise, using the 30%, 50% and 70% of subjects&#x02019; individual 1 repetition maximum (1RM). In each set, two repetitions with each load were performed, but the order of the loads was randomised. In the KL group, researchers told the subjects the load to mobilise prior each repetition, while in the UL group, researchers did not provide any information. Maximal dynamic strength (1RM bench press), power output (with 30, 50 and 70% of 1RM) and throwing velocity (7 m standing throw and 9 m jumping throw) were assessed pre- and post-training intervention.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Results</title><p>Both UL and KL group improved similarly their 1RM bench press as well as mean and peak power with all loads.

Therefore, the athletes&#x02019; ability to generate higher power output may determine sporting success [<xref rid="pone.0157648.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The relationship between power and dynamic athletic performance has been well established in that muscular power is considered one of the main factors involved in sports that entail high force production over a short time [<xref rid="pone.0157648.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0157648.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In this regard, improvements in maximal power output have been accompanied by increased performance in several athletic pursuits such as jumping, sprinting and agility tests [<xref rid="pone.0157648.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Among the sports that are related to the application of high levels of force in short periods of time, team handball is highly power-dependent since it involves high-intensity muscular actions such as sprinting, jumping and throwing [<xref rid="pone.0157648.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Hermassi et al. [<xref rid="pone.0157648.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] showed significant improvements in both standing and jumping throw velocities after 10 weeks of heavy load strength training, but the moderate load group only improved the velocity in the jumping throw. Moreover, Hermassi et al. [<xref rid="pone.0157648.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] showed improvements in jumping height, sprinting performance and throwing velocities after 8 weeks of heavy-loads strength training in elite team handball players. Therefore, strength training seems to be a key point to improve specific team handball performance.</p><p>As a result, a wide number of studies have sought to improve muscle power performance through different strength training methodologies such as plyometrics [<xref rid="pone.0157648.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], heavy loads [<xref rid="pone.0157648.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], optimal loads [<xref rid="pone.0157648.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] or the combination of heavy and light loads [<xref rid="pone.0157648.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The theory behind the use of a combination of loads in a power training programme is to target all areas of the force-velocity relationship attempting to increase power adaptations throughout the entire curve. Thus, it is argued that training with a combination of loads may provide all-round improvements in the force-velocity relationship, which result in superior increases in maximal power output when compared with either light or heavy training loads alone [<xref rid="pone.0157648.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>In addition, the use of ballistic exercises (e.g. bench press throw) has shown greater power developments compared with traditional strength exercises [<xref rid="pone.0157648.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0157648.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The underlying mechanisms leading to power improvements when using ballistic exercises are not clearly defined. It is possible that these movements elicit adaptations in neural drive, the rate of neural activation, and inter-muscular coordination, which are commonly encountered in sports movements [<xref rid="pone.0157648.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The results of these adaptations involve increases in the ability to generate more force in shorter periods of time [<xref rid="pone.0157648.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0157648.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Some of athletic skills (e.g. throwing, kicking, jumping) involve contraction times shorter than 250 ms, therefore, ballistic exercises are generally more sport-specific in a vast number of sports, allowing greater transference to performance. Supporting this is research showing significant improvements in maximal power output during sports-specific movements after a training programme with ballistic exercises [<xref rid="pone.0157648.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0157648.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0157648.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0157648.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Despite the wide number of methodologies found in the literature aiming at improving rapid force/power production, there is an obvious need among coaches and researchers to find new methods that could optimize improvements in such variables.</p><p>It has been recently shown that concentric-only bench press throws performed without knowledge about the load lifted entailed greater power output in the early phases from movement onset [<xref rid="pone.0157648.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. It is suggested that when preparing for a lift, the lifter makes assumptions regarding the weight of the load. If the load characteristics are not known or incorrectly judged, lifts are likely to be done more rapidly [<xref rid="pone.0157648.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Thus, Marras et al. [<xref rid="pone.0157648.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] found that the increased muscle response under unexpected condition was equivalent to doubling the load from the expected condition. In addition, the authors found that the unexpected condition elicits more rapid increases in trunk force development. Nevertheless, no studies have evaluated if these acute responses produced by using unexpected/unknown loads may result in greater neuromuscular adaptations after a training intervention consisting of unknown loads.</p><p>Based on previous studies showing improvements in power performance and team handball throwing velocities after strength training interventions, and the increased acute EMG response and greater power developed by performing explosive movements with lack of load knowledge, it was hypothesized that a strength training intervention based on unknown loads would entail larger improvements in team handball performance compared with traditional strength training.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Subjects</title><p>Twenty-eight elite junior team handball players volunteered to participate in this study.

During the 4-week training intervention, both KL and UL group performed a specific bench press throw training added to their usual training two times per week (completing a total of 8 training sessions each group). In addition, a control group (C) who performed the usual training was also included. Pre-testing was carried out the week before starting the training intervention, while post-testing was conducted the week after finishing the 4 week training intervention. To avoid diurnal variation in training and testing measures, subjects were scheduled at approximately the same time for each testing and training sessions.</p></sec><sec id="sec009" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methodology</title><p>Tests were conducted at two different time points (the week before and following the 4-week training intervention). Subjects were required to attend 3 testing sessions on each time point, separated by 48h. On the first day, the 1RM test for the bench press exercise was carried out. On the second day, subjects performed the bench press throw power performance test. Both the first and second testing sessions were performed using a Smith Machine (Technogym, Gambettola, Italy). On the third day, subjects carried out the throwing velocity test. Testing selection was made based on the importance of both maximal strength and power output, as well as handball throwing velocity on handball performance [<xref rid="pone.0157648.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0157648.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Maximal dynamic strength</title><p>The 1-RM bench press was assessed using a previously established protocol [<xref rid="pone.0157648.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], which requires that subjects progressively increase resistance across attempts until the 1RM is achieved. Rest period between trials was at least 5 minutes. Subjects began by lying horizontally with the buttocks, lower back, upper back and head firmly planted on the bench, with elbows fully extended and gripping the bar. Subjects lowered the bar until the chest was slightly touched, approximately 3 cm superior to the xiphoid process. The elbows were extended equally with the head and hips remaining in contact with the bench, and the feet in contact with the floor throughout the lift. No bouncing or arching of the back was allowed.</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Bench press throw power performance</title><p>Three minutes after a warm-up consisting of two sets of 10 repetitions with the individuals 50% of 1RM, power performance was tested by performing one set of six repetitions of the bench press throw exercise using the individuals 30%, 50% and 70% 1RM. Rest period between sets was 5 minutes. An isoinertial dynamometer (T-Force Dynamic Measurement System, Ergotech, Murcia, Spain) was used for mechanical measurements. This system consists of a linear velocity transducer interfaced to a personal computer by means of a 14-bit resolution analog-to-digital data acquisition board, and custom software. Vertical instantaneous velocity was directly sampled by the device at a frequency of 1000 Hz. Instantaneous mechanical power output (P) was calculated as the product of vertical force and bar velocity (P = F &#x000b7; V). Peak power was taken as the maximum value of the power-time curve. The validity and reliability of this system have been previously established [<xref rid="pone.0157648.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. All data were saved to disk for subsequent analysis. The variables analysed were: peak power, mean power, and power in the early time intervals (30, 50, 100, and 150 ms) of the concentric phase.</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Throwing velocity</title><p>Handball throwing velocity was measured using a portable radar (Stalker sport 2, Applied Concepts Inc, USA) with an accuracy of 0.1 km&#x000b7;h<sup>-1</sup>. After 10 minutes of warm-up consisting of jogging, dynamic stretches and technical skills (passes and throws at submaximal velocities), each subject performed 3 maximal velocity throw attempts from both 7 m (standing throw) and 9 m (jumping throw). The standing throw has been described previously by Hermassi et al. [<xref rid="pone.0157648.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In the jumping throw, players made a preparatory 3 step run before jumping vertically and releasing the ball while in the air, behind a line 9 m from the goal. The fastest throw of each throwing type was used for statistical analysis.</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Training</title><p>After the pre-testing sessions, subjects were randomly divided into two different training intervention (KL (n = 12) vs UL (n = 11)) and a control group (n = 5). Both experimental groups performed two sessions weekly consisting of four sets of six repetitions of the bench press throw exercise.

Repetitions were executed in both groups every 10 seconds (as controlled by a metronome), during which the load was modified.</p><p>In the KL group, the main researcher told the subjects the load to mobilise before dropping the barbell, while in the UL group researchers dropped the barbell without providing any load information. To ensure subjects did not know the load in the UL, they performed the sets wearing special glasses.

The main finding of this study was that after 4 weeks of training, the unknown load (UL) group improved the performance variables to a greater extent than the known load (KL) group. In this regard, only the UL group obtained greater power increases in the early time intervals in all load-ranges (30%, 50%, and 70% 1RM) and significant increases in both standing and jumping throw velocities.</p><p>It is known that explosive actions such as sprinting and jumping are largely related to the force produced in the early intervals (&#x0003c; 250 ms) [<xref rid="pone.0157648.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0157648.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In this particular case, handball throw movement has been shown to last approximately 180&#x02013;240 ms [<xref rid="pone.0157648.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], thus, increases in force production in the early time intervals of a movement are of significant practical use. This early force production can be increased following training interventions requiring the subject to contract &#x02018;as fast and hard as possible&#x02019; [<xref rid="pone.0157648.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0157648.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], and with loads that are optimal for maximal power production [<xref rid="pone.0157648.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0157648.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, whether these adaptations may be enhanced following unknown loads remained to be elucidated. The present study is the first to highlight the usefulness of this kind of stimulus (unknown loads) for improving power output in the early time intervals (i.e. 150 ms) of a movement. It has been reported that both a greater power output and muscle activation can be produced at early time intervals as an acute response of using unknown loads, when compared to known loads [<xref rid="pone.0157648.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0157648.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The mechanism by which the use of unknown loads supposes a greater stimulus to the central nervous system may be due to a possible overestimation of the weight, causing a larger force production than that required to move the real mass [<xref rid="pone.0157648.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].Our results are in accordance with the acute studies, showing that the UL group improved to a larger extent when compared to the KL group (UL: + 14.3&#x02013;33.7%; KL: 8.2&#x02013;21.1%) in the power developed in the early time intervals (&#x0003c; 150 ms). The mechanisms underlying the greater improvements of the UL group could be explained by the subject&#x02019;s response to lifting unknown loads, which has been previously reported as increased EMG response in pectoralis major and anterior deltoid muscles in the early time intervals before and after the movement onset [<xref rid="pone.0157648.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], which is in agreement with the increases shown by several authors in muscle activation and movement velocities when using unknown loads compared with known loads [<xref rid="pone.0157648.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0157648.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The increases in power output in the early time intervals of the movement may be explained by both an increase in motor unit firing frequency [<xref rid="pone.0157648.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], and increases in motor unit recruitment due to are duced recruitment threshold of the motor units [<xref rid="pone.0157648.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>Dynamic maximum strength is known to be improved by several strength training modalities and is of interest in many team sports. Our results showed that both the UL and the KL group (10.1% and 9% respectively) significantly improved their 1RM bench press. The increases in maximal force found in the present study are smaller than those shown by Hermassi et al. [<xref rid="pone.0157648.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] after 8 weeks of training with heavy loads (16.8%), similar to those reported by Hermassi et al. [<xref rid="pone.0157648.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] after 10 weeks of training with heavy loads (12.9%), and higher than those reached in such study with moderate loads (6.2%). Therefore, the current study has demonstrated that the use of a ballistic movement (bench press throw) with a combination of loads (30, 50, and 70% 1RM) may be an efficient way of increasing not only early force production, but also maximal dynamic strength, in a relatively short period of time (4 weeks). Due to the fact that pre-season in some sports (i.e. handball) allows a very limited amount of weeks to achieve strength/power adaptations, these increases after such short period of time are noteworthy.</p><p>In addition to the improvements in both power-related variables and maximal dynamic strength, it is of great interest to see whether these neuromuscular adaptations may translate to an enhancement of in-field performance (i.e., throwing velocity). Research showing if these neuromuscular adaptations transfer to the in-field performance are scarce, and mostly descriptive [<xref rid="pone.0157648.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0157648.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Our results show that this increase was significant only for the UL group in both the standing throw (4.7%) and jumping throw (5.3%), while the KL group showed a non-significant increase of 2.4%. It is important to highlight that similar improvements in throwing velocity after longer training interventions have been previously reported (after 8-week [<xref rid="pone.0157648.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0157648.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], and 10-week [<xref rid="pone.0157648.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]). It can be speculated that it is needed a certain amount of early force production improvement to see a transference to in-field performance, thus, being UK loads a more useful method to rapidly increase throwing performance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec022"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study shows that 4 weeks of training intervention with unknown loads can enhance variables related to sports performance such as power output, and both standing and jumping throw velocity in time handball players. Given the importance of both power output and throwing velocity to team handball success, any training intervention leading to greater (or earlier) gains in this variables are of particular interest for coaches. The results of this study suggest that the use of unknown loads leads to greater improvements in such performance variables compared with known loads. Due to the limited weeks available in several sports&#x02019; preparatory period, these results are of practical relevance in terms of time-efficiency. Therefore, the use of unknown loads seems to offer a novel stimulus to the central nervous system leading to improvements in specific performance in sports where success is related to explosive force production, and especially when only a short period of training is possible.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec023"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0157648.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Written informed consent.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0157648.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0157648.s002"><label>S2 File</label><caption><title>Ethics statement.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0157648.s002.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0157648.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Cronin</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name>, <name><surname>McNair</surname><given-names>PJ</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Marshall</surname><given-names>RN</given-names></name>. <article-title>Developing explosive power: a comparison of technique and training</article-title>. <source>J Sci Med Sports</source>
