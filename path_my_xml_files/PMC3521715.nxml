In both MS and optic neuritis, neurodegenerative changes lead to persistent functional deficits. <xref rid="pone.0051645-Frohman1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0051645-Trip1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> Disease modifying therapy (DMT) with interferon-beta (IFN-&#x003b2;) belongs to the standard therapies of MS and has already been found to be beneficial in an early disease stage termed clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). <xref rid="pone.0051645-Polman1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0051645-Comi1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> However, irrespective of the documented effects on immune responses, it still is a subject of discussion whether and to what extent DMT counteracts inflammation-associated neurodegeneration. <xref rid="pone.0051645-Trip1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> Although treatment with IFN-&#x003b2; has been shown to delay conversion of CIS into clinically definite MS, neurological disability was not reduced five years later <xref rid="pone.0051645-Kappos1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> suggesting that neurodegeneration might not be influenced by early start of DMT. Direct monitoring of neurodegeneration in patients with CIS is challenging, particularly due to the heterogeneity of this patient group with different anatomical lesion localisation, variable numbers of initial lesions, and different dynamics of neurodegeneration.</p><p>Amongst the spectrum of CIS, optic neuritis represents a homogenous disease condition with a predictable extent of retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL) degeneration. By using optical coherence tomography (OCT), atrophy of the RNFL which contains the non-myelinated part of optic nerve axons can directly be assessed. <xref rid="pone.0051645-Frohman2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> Moreover, changes in RNFL thickness during MS allow conclusions to be drawn about neurodegenerative changes on a global level due to their association with brain atrophy. <xref rid="pone.0051645-GordonLipkin1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0051645-Zimmermann1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> In previous work, it has been shown that RNFL thinning can be observed during the first six months following optic neuritis and that more than 90% of this fibre loss has occurred by the end of three months. <xref rid="pone.0051645-Henderson1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> Additionally, in a recent study testing erythropoietin in optic neuritis, we had shown that an observational period of 16 weeks is appropriate to cover RNFL changes following optic neuritis and to detect potential effects of neuroprotective treatment. <xref rid="pone.0051645-Shs1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.</p><p>In the present study, we have chosen optic neuritis as a homogenous presentation of CIS in order to investigate neuroprotective effects of the most frequently prescribed DMT. Following optic neuritis, the time-course of RNFL thinning after early start of IFN-&#x003b2; therapy was compared to that of a group of untreated patients. In order to assess potential effects of early DMT on recovery of visual function, we additionally investigated changes in visual acuity, visual field, and latencies and amplitudes of visual evoked potentials (VEPs).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Patients and Therapy</title><p>Patients between 18&#x02013;50 years of age having presented at Saarland University Clinic (Germany) with optic neuritis as CIS were eligible to be included into this parallel group observation. Onset of symptoms had to be within the previous 10 days and visual acuity as assessed by an ophthalmologist had to be decreased to 0.5 (decimal system) or less. Please note that a decimal value of 0.5 corresponds to a logarithmic (log) visual acuity of &#x02212;0.3, a minimum angle of resolution (MAR) of 2.0, a logMAR value of 0.3, or a Snellen equivalent of 6/12 (with metres used instead of feet). Treatment with subcutaneously applied IFN-&#x003b2;1b (250 &#x000b5;g every other day; Betaferon&#x000ae;) or IFN-&#x003b2;1a (44 &#x000b5;g three times a week, Rebif&#x000ae;) was offered to all patients in agreement with the licensed use of the drug if oligoclonal bands were identified in the cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF) following routinely performed lumbar puncture, and/or at least one clinically silent demyelinating brain lesion was detected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Therefore, patients were identified to be at increased risk for the development of MS. <xref rid="pone.0051645-ORiordan1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0051645-Skov1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> Treatment was started within one week after methylprednisolone pulse therapy (1000 mg i.v. per day for three days). To reduce the risk of side effects, the dosage of IFN-&#x003b2; was gradually increased reaching full dosage within the first four weeks. Routine treatment with any other of the available IFN-&#x003b2;-containing products or with glatiramer acetate was offered as an alternative to study participation. Patients who did not wish to receive DMT were offered to be included into the non-treatment arm of this observational study. Prior to inclusion patients gave informed consent.</p><p>Exclusion criteria consisted of any ocular disease (affected or non-affected eye), visual acuity of &#x0003c;1.0 in the non-affected eye, significant hyperopia, myopia, or astigmatism, pregnancy, lactation period, or any disease interfering with the use of corticosteroids or IFN-&#x003b2;. Immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory pre-treatments were not allowed at any time as well as treatment with corticosteroids within 30 days prior to inclusion. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of the Saarland.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Procedures and Outcome Measures</title><p>OCT was performed with a time domain OCT (Stratus OCT Model 3000; Carl Zeiss Meditec, Jena, Germany) using the fast RNFL thickness protocol. OCT software employed an algorithm to calculate the average thickness of the RNFL, and to compare these measurements to a database of age-matched controls. Mean overall, quadrant, and sector RNFL measurements were obtained. Intra-class correlation coefficients (determined by using type 3,1 of the intracc.sas macro, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://euclid.psych.yorku.ca/ftp/sas/macros/intracc.sas">http://euclid.psych.yorku.ca/ftp/sas/macros/intracc.sas</ext-link>) for repeated OCT measurements of a control population of 15 healthy, age- and gender-matched subjects were in the range of 0.81 indicating good reproducibility of the measurements. Refractive errors were determined by retinoscopy and automated refractometry. After subjective refraction, the best correction was used to determine the distant visual acuity according to DIN58220 (Landolt rings, forced choice, 3/5 criterion). Near visual acuity was determined using the OCULUS text chart. Visual acuity was described according to the decimal system. The central 60&#x000b0; visual field (radius 30&#x000b0;) was measured by static automated perimetry using the program G1X of the OCTOPUS perimeter (INTERZEAG Switzerland). Perimetric results were analyzed with respect to age-related data and changes were calculated by the OCTOPUS software.</p><p>Recordings and analyses of VEPs were performed as described previously. <xref rid="pone.0051645-Diem1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> In cases of severe optic neuritis manifested by an inability to respond to VEP stimulation or visual testing, values of 170 ms and 0 &#x000b5;m were given for latency and amplitude <xref rid="pone.0051645-Naismith1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, and a value of 0 was given for visual acuity.</p><p>At each of the visits, patients underwent neurological examinations to assess disability according to the widely and routinely used Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). Additionally, MRI was performed at baseline. For MRI, a 1.5T machine (Siemens Magnetom Sonata, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) was used. The following images were obtained: 3 mm contiguous slices from transversal PD/T2-weighted turbo spin echo, from sagittal T2-weighted turbo spin echo, and from a sagittal T1-weighted 3D-sequence with application of gadolinium-diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid in a body weight-adapted dosage.</p><p>OCT, recordings of VEPs, and assessments of visual acuity and visual field parameters were performed according to established time-points for follow-up which have been shown to be appropriate for neuroprotection trials in optic neuritis. <xref rid="pone.0051645-Shs1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> These time-points include weeks 4, 8, and 16. RNFL thickness of the affected eye at week 16 was subtracted from the baseline value of the affected eye or, in an alternative analysis, from the baseline value of the non-affected eye in order to estimate the impact of initial RNFL swelling. Respectively, the amount of RNFL thinning over 16 weeks was compared between the groups. Additionally, we compared recovery of visual acuity and visual field, and changes in latencies and amplitudes of VEPs over the 16 week observation period in the affected eye. Comparison of absolute values at week 16 of the affected eyes was also performed in addition to comparison of differences between the non-affected and affected eye in each patient.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>A total of 20 patients were assigned to this observational study (10/10 IFN-&#x003b2;/no DMT) and underwent intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis. The ITT analysis included all patients who had baseline assessment and at least one follow-up. Six patients had incomplete datasets and missing values were replaced by the LOCF (&#x0201c;last observation carried forward&#x0201d;) method. Analyses were performed using student&#x02019;s t-test with assessment of 95% confidence intervals (CI). Furthermore, we performed an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) in order to test whether baseline differences may have any effects on the results of the primary outcome parameter.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Baseline Characteristics and Clinical Disease Course</title><p>Demographics, time to inclusion after symptom onset and baseline characteristics of the two groups (IFN-&#x003b2;/no DMT) consisting of 10 patients each are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0051645-t001">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0051645-t002">2</xref>. At baseline, mean VEP latencies were longer in patients which were assigned to the IFN-&#x003b2; treatment group (161.1&#x000b1;4.072) compared to untreated patients (144.1&#x000b1;6.414; &#x000b1;SD; p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.033; 95% CI 1.592 to 32.57) indicating potentially more severe optic neuritis in this group. As another indication for differences in general disease severity, five patients out of the IFN-&#x003b2; group had more than 9 T2-weighted MRI lesions, whereas in the non-DMT group, it was only one. None of the other outcome parameters showed significant baseline differences. Mean EDSS at baseline was 3.1&#x000b1;0.75 (&#x000b1;SD) in patients who received later IFN-&#x003b2; treatment and 3.0&#x000b1;0.58 in patients of the non-DMT group. During the observation period of 16 weeks, one patient in the IFN-&#x003b2; group and one patient without DMT experienced a second clinical relapse and was diagnosed with MS. As a consequence, treatment with IFN-&#x003b2; was initiated in the latter but since first dose was not applied before week 14, for final analysis this patient was still considered to be &#x0201c;untreated&#x0201d;. The frequency and spectrum of undesired drug effects was within the established tolerability profiles of methylprednisolone or IFN-&#x003b2;.</p><table-wrap id="pone-0051645-t001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0051645.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Demographic data and baseline characteristics.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone-0051645-t001-1" xlink:href="pone.0051645.t001"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">IFN-&#x003b2; (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;10)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">no DMT (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;10)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">p value (t-test)</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">

<xref rid="pone.0051645-Jin1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> further support this assumption. In clinical trials, effects of IFN-&#x003b2; on general brain atrophy as indirect evidence for neuroprotection have been described <xref rid="pone.0051645-Zivadinov1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, however, these effects were inconsistently seen for different formulations of IFN-&#x003b2; and reflect the sum of various tissue changes such as oedema resolution or demyelination. <xref rid="pone.0051645-Zivadinov2" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> Assessment of RNFL thinning in contrast allows direct investigation of neuroaxonal retinal damage <xref rid="pone.0051645-Frohman2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> and has recently been demonstrated to be a useful primary outcome parameter for neuroprotection trials in optic neuritis. <xref rid="pone.0051645-Shs1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> By comparing with RNFL thickness values of the contralateral healthy eyes, the time to oedema resolution can be determined and distinguished from atrophy of the RNFL caused by nerve fibre loss itself. In agreement with our previous observations <xref rid="pone.0051645-Shs1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, RNFL oedema in both of the groups studied here has been resolved within the first two months after disease onset with further RNFL thinning to levels more than 10 &#x000b5;m below those of the corresponding healthy eyes. Absolute RNFL thickness at week 16 in both of our groups was at a similar range to previously published 6-month values in patients after optic neuritis according to estimates derived from an exponential model which suggests 90% of RNFL thinning to be reached 2.38 months after disease onset and 99% of total RNFL loss to occur by a mean time of 4.75 months. <xref rid="pone.0051645-Henderson1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> However, as particularly revealed by longitudinal follow-up on unaffected eyes in both of our patient groups, some extent of intra-individual (intra-subject) variation occurs.

This is explained by the observational design of the study and could be circumvented by blinding the treatment but this would not be in accordance with ethical considerations of not withholding approved treatments from patients. Additionally, longer VEP latencies were observed in the group receiving later IFN-&#x003b2; treatment which might also have influenced the decision to start with DMT on the one hand, and on the other, might have influenced the results of the final outcome parameter comparison. In a recent study, prolonged VEP latency at disease onset as well as three months later has been shown to be associated with greater RNFL loss <xref rid="pone.0051645-Henderson2" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref> indicating that demyelination during acute optic neuritis increases vulnerability and later degeneration of optic nerve axons.

However, applying strict selection criteria for study participation restricted the numbers of patients available for inclusion, a limitation of this preliminary study which would require confirmation in a larger group of patients. Additionally, LOCF for replacing missing RNFL values of the final visit has been applied in 30% of our cohort. This is a procedure which although not ideal we consider to be acceptable for this special type of study since approximately 95% of the total RNFL loss takes place within the first three months following the onset of symptoms. <xref rid="pone.0051645-Henderson1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> In contrast to the large cohort included into the optic neuritis corticosteroid treatment trial <xref rid="pone.0051645-Beck1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> we did not allow MS to be present at the time of inclusion but we requested CSF or MRI risk factors for future MS development <xref rid="pone.0051645-ORiordan1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0051645-Optic1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> in order to select patients potentially responsive to DMT. However, the absence of any treatment effects on structural or functional parameters of vision induced by early IFN-&#x003b2; treatment in our study may be explained by one or more of the following: Firstly, the disease course of optic neuritis and the kinetics of neurodegeneration in particular might be too rapid <xref rid="pone.0051645-Henderson1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> to allow DMT to exert any influence. Beneficial effects of DMT in previous trials in CIS patients have been shown with respect to future conversion into MS and later progression of disability <xref rid="pone.0051645-Bates1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref> which represents effects related to disease dissemination rather than those on initial lesion recovery or neurodegeneration caused by the initial lesion. Secondly, neurodegeneration in the retina might in parts occur independently of full activation of the immune system and, therefore, might only be minimally affected by immunomodulatory treatment approaches. In support of this notion, recent findings in an animal model of optic neuritis suggest that retinal neurodegeneration precedes inflammatory infiltration of the optic nerves. In this study, prior to the development of a humoral immune response, early neurodegeneration following disease induction was detected occurring in parallel with alterations in the blood-brain barrier and local microglial activation within the retina. <xref rid="pone.0051645-Fairless1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref> Additionally, data from OCT and histological studies in MS patients point towards primary pathophysiological changes in the retina that are not fully explained by inflammation and demyelination of the optic nerve. <xref rid="pone.0051645-Saidha1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0051645-Gelfand1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>.</p><p>In conclusion, the absence of any effects on neurodegeneration and recovery of function after isolated optic neuritis does not imply that IFN-&#x003b2; treatment is generally not efficient in terms of further dissemination of the disease and conversion into MS. However, the results of this study suggest that present anti-inflammatory/immunomodulatory therapies are probably insufficient to successfully protect against neuronal loss, and therefore primary neuroprotective agents might be necessary as an add-on therapy to counteract neurodegeneration occurring during the acute phase of the disease.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Dr. Richard Fairless for helpful comments on the manuscript.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0051645-Frohman1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
