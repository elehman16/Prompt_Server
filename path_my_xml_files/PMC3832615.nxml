The extent to which its severity varies with task and cognitive processes remains unclear. We examined sleep inertia in alertness, attention, working memory and cognitive throughput with the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS), the Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT), n-back and add tasks, respectively. The tasks were administered 2 hours before bedtime and at regular intervals for four hours, starting immediately after awakening in the morning, in eleven participants, in a four-way cross-over laboratory design. We also investigated whether exposure to Blue-Enhanced or Bright Blue-Enhanced white light would reduce sleep inertia. Alertness and all cognitive processes were impaired immediately upon awakening (p&#x0003c;0.01). However, alertness and sustained attention were more affected than cognitive throughput and working memory. Moreover, speed was more affected than accuracy of responses. The light conditions had no differential effect on performance except in the 3-back task (p&#x0003c;0.01), where response times (RT) at the end of four hours in the two Blue-Enhanced white light conditions were faster (200 ms) than at wake time. We conclude that the effect of sleep inertia varies with cognitive domain and that it&#x02019;s spectral/intensity response to light is different from that of sleepiness. That is, just increasing blue-wavelength in light may not be sufficient to reduce sleep inertia. These findings have implications for critical professions like medicine, law-enforcement etc., in which, personnel routinely wake up from night-time sleep to respond to emergency situations. </p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Funding from Royal Philips Electronics N.

Awakening from sleep entails a temporary period of reduced alertness and impaired cognition known as sleep inertia. First described in the early 1960&#x02019;s [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], it&#x02019;s effects on performance, like sleep loss, includes a slowing of responses, loss of accuracy, increased attentional lapses and reduced alertness [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Whether this means that sleep inertia is a part of the sleepiness continuum driven by the homeostatic process remains an unresolved issue. In most current models of alertness and performance sleep inertia is conceptualized as a separate physiological state distinct from sleepiness [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. </p><p>Why sleep inertia occurs is not clear. It has been postulated that a temporal dissociation between two wake-up processes, one, a rapid restoration of conscious awareness and the other, a slower more progressive recovery to full alertness, underlies the phenomenon [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. This speculation by Balkin et al. [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] is based on their brain imaging study, in which, immediately after awakening, areas such as the brainstem, basal ganglia and thalamus appeared to be rapidly maximally reactivated and remained stable thereafter, whereas, anterior cortical areas associated with higher order cognitive functions continued to increase in activation for up to fifteen minutes post-awakening. More recently, Groeger et al. [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] provided additional support for this notion. They found that in sleep restricted participants awakening from an afternoon nap, executive functions took longer to recover to baseline levels than performance in simple tasks. </p><p>Sleep inertia is strongest at wake-time, dissipating rapidly thereafter. Estimates of the dissipation range from a minute to over two hours [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and this has been attributed to a number of factors including prior sleep duration [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], sleep stage at awakening [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], circadian phase at awakening [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], and even chronotype [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Crucially, a differential sensitivity of various cognitive processes to sleep inertia may be a significant contributing factor, but this has not been thoroughly investigated. To do so, it is necessary to compare performance in several tasks that differ appropriately, e.g. 1- back vs. 3-back (for executive function load in working memory) [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In fact, using such an approach, Groeger et al. [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] showed that executive loading worsens the impact of sleep inertia following afternoon naps but not morning naps. However, with a few exceptions [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], most studies have focused on subjective measures of alertness and a single cognitive task [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. </p><p> Although, sleep inertia is a robust phenomenon with obvious practical consequences, strategies to counteract it remain undeveloped. Given the fact that light has a powerful non-visual effect on behaviour, and, that brain activation while people are engaged in a cognitive task can be enhanced by light exposure [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], one wonders whether artificial light can be engineered to counteract sleep inertia. In this regard, blue-enhanced light may be an attractive candidate given that it enhances alertness and improves response times in simple cognitive tasks [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Also, given that changes in temperature and cortisol are associated with differential cognitive performance [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], the fact that simulated artificial dawn light affects temperature [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and cortisol [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] is encouraging. </p><p> We examined morning sleep inertia, concurrently, in several cognitive processes and investigated whether increasing the level of blue wavelength in artificial white light can counteract sleep inertia. We measured subjective sleepiness, sustained attention, cognitive throughput and working memory with the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS), the Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT), the add task and the verbal 1 and 3-back tasks, respectively [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], under four white light conditions, each with a different spectral and intensity characteristic. Sleep inertia affected sleepiness and all the cognitive processes tested, with the impact being strongest in subjective sleepiness. However, increasing blue wavelength in white light had little effect on sleep inertia with the exception of the 3-back task. </p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2.1"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p> This study was conducted in accordance with the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki.

All fourteen were healthy by history, physical examination (including the Ishihara test for color blindness) and standard biochemistry/haematology. They had regular self-reported sleep/wake patterns and were not on any medication. Self-reported need for at least 60 minutes to feel fully alert after awakening was a primary selection criteria [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].

Three participants withdrew early in the protocol and were replaced by the two reserves, resulting in eleven (7 females; mean age +/- SD: 22.27 +/- 4.22 years) completing the protocol. Additionally, at screening, buccal swab samples were collected for extracting genomic DNA to analyse for the Variable Number Tandem Repeat (VNTR) polymorphism in the clock gene <italic>PERIOD3</italic> (<italic>PER3</italic>), which is associated with diurnal preference [<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].

Following this, a week prior to each laboratory visit, participants were assigned an 8-hour sleep schedule (which was within an hour of their habitual bedtime). Their compliance was verified with actigraphy monitoring and sleep diary.

This cognitive session served to introduce the different tasks to the participants and provide them an opportunity to reach asymptotic levels of performance to minimize practice effects [<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. To preserve equivalence across laboratory sessions, the acclimation cognitive testing set-up included the light box (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079688-g001">Figure 1</xref>), but without light exposure.

All laboratory events were timed relative to a study designated bedtime (00:12, 00:37 and 00:57). Having these three staggered bedtimes enabled us to maintain precise timing of cognitive testing in multiple participants, while at the same time minimizing deviations from the subjects&#x02019; habitual bedtime (average +/- 1SD: 23:23 +/- 00:42). </p><fig id="pone-0079688-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0079688.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Protocol.</title><p>The timing of events in each laboratory session occurred as shown in the figure.

The dependant measures included RT, accuracy (number of correct responses) and aprime (index of accuracy based on Hits and false Alarms [<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]). We used the standard practice of analyzing the &#x02018;match&#x02019; and non-match&#x02019; trials, both, combined and separately, since the two types of trials are thought to involve different underlying mechanisms [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. </p></sec></sec><sec id="s2.7"><title>Polysomnography (PSG)</title><p>Data were recorded with the Siesta 802 digital PSG system (Compumedics Limited, Victoria, Australia).

To assess the severity of sleep inertia we used two measures of effect size, Cohen&#x02019;s d and Cohen&#x02019;s f<sup>2</sup>. The former, derived from the means and standard deviations of the student&#x02019;s t statistic, was used to assess the acute effect of sleep inertia [<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. It was based on the comparison of baseline performance (before sleep) with the first assessment after awakening in the morning. The latter, derived from the numerator and denominator degree of freedom of the F statistic from the mixed model ANOVA, was used to assess the dissipation in sleep inertia [<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. It was based on all the data from the morning testing sessions. </p><p> To characterize the effect of sleep inertia we focused on the data from the Dim light condition [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. We used a general linear mixed-model ANOVA with an autoregressive [ar (1)] covariance structure, with &#x02018;time relative to the start of the light exposure&#x02019; (time) as a repeated factor and as a fixed effect. To characterize the effect of the different white light conditions on sleep inertia, we used a similar model, but with both light condition and time as repeated factors and as fixed effects. For both analyses, &#x02018;Subject&#x02019; was a random factor and the &#x02018;randomization sequence of the light condition&#x02019; an additional factor to rule out order effects. Lastly, the baseline data (data from the evening session before the night sleep) was a covariate in the model. Normality of the residuals was checked for all the data sets and they did not deviate significantly from a normal distribution.

A paired t-test between baseline and the first post-sleep assessment revealed a significant difference in speed (mean RT: p&#x0003c;0.01; slow RT: p=0.05) and lapses (p=0.01), with two and half times as many lapses at awakening when compared to baseline (3 <underline>+</underline> 0.59 to 7.7 <underline>+</underline> 1.79).

While responses speeded up progressively over the four hours in the 1-back task, they remained unchanged in the 3-back task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079688-g002">Figure 2F</xref>). A separate analysis of the &#x02018;match&#x02019; and &#x02018;non-match&#x02019; showed a significant effect of time only on the &#x02018;non-match&#x02019; trials in the 1-back task (p&#x0003c;0.001); there was a 338 msec decrease in RT by the end the four hour sleep inertia testing period. A third ANOVA, in which n-back level (that is including data from both tasks) was a fixed effects factor, indicated no significant time by n-back level interaction (p&#x0003e;0.05).

First, the Cohen&#x02019;s d was largest in the KSS scores compared to measures from the other tasks. Second, Cohen&#x02019;s D was smaller in measures from the addition task and 3-back tasks in comparison to auditory RT task and the 1-back task. Third, regardless of task, the effect of sleep inertia was stronger in speed than in accuracy. The effect size based on Cohen&#x02019;s f<sup>2</sup> was again largest for the KSS scores, with performance in the addition and 3-back tasks showing smaller effect sizes in comparison to performance in the auditory PVT task and 1-back tasks. Again, the Cohen&#x02019;s f<sup>2</sup> was larger in speed than in accuracy.

We note that there were significant differences in body position (and variations in this position) between the two environments. While participants had to sit relatively still with their wrists placed on the table during the light exposure, they would not have done so home. We also report specifications for the experimental light conditions derived from the photopic sensitivity and melanopsin based sensitivity curves (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0079688-t001">Table 1</xref>). </p><p> These different light conditions were used to determine whether sleep inertia exhibits an intensity- and spectrum-dependent sensitivity to light such that it would be significantly reduced in blue-enhanced light. Our analyses indicated that a differential effect of our white light conditions on sleep inertia was minimal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079688-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). With the exception of RT in the 3-back task, there were no significant effects of light condition on KSS or any other performance measure. An analysis of combined &#x02018;match&#x02019; and &#x02018;non-match&#x02019; RT showed no effect of light condition (p=0.25) or a time x light condition (p=0.14) interaction in the 3-back task. But, the separate analysis of the &#x02018;match&#x02019; and &#x02018;non-match&#x02019; trials, revealed a significant effect of time x light condition interaction for the &#x02018;match&#x02019; trials in this task (p&#x0003c; 0.01; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079688-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). RT at the end of the four hours in the two Blue-Enhanced conditions was significantly faster than at waketime (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079688-g005">Figure 5B</xref>, inset). Lastly, there was no significant interaction between sleep-stage (at awakening) and light condition. </p><fig id="pone-0079688-g005" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0079688.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>The effect of white light conditions on sleep inertia in working memory.</title><p>Values shown here are the actual means +/- 1 SEM from the data.

First, the effect of morning sleep inertia was widespread and far from being short-lived, lasted well over two hours. Second, alertness was most strongly affected by sleep inertia followed by attention, working memory and cognitive throughput. Notably, the easier tasks were more affected than the more demanding 3-back task. Lastly, Blue-Enhanced light did not appear to be very effective counteracting sleep inertia; its positive impact was confined to the response speed on the 3-back task, a task with high executive loading. </p><p> Prior sleep modulates the effect of sleep inertia. Its severity appears to depend partly on the quality and duration of preceding sleep [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], that is shorter the sleep, the worse the sleep inertia. While the study did not directly test this, the 6.5 hr laboratory sleep episode was intended to optimise the opportunity to measure the effect of sleep inertia on performance not only by reducing sleep duration, but also by minimising wakefulness before &#x02018;lights on&#x02019;, which compromises the assessment of sleep inertia. While the effect of sleep inertia was strong in alertness, it was rather modest on cognitive performance. Besides duration and quality, the stage of sleep at awakening also appears to modulate sleep inertia [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], such that it has been shown to be worse following awakening from non-REM sleep, although there are results to the contrary [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. We did not find any effect of sleep-stage at awakening in our data. Our sleep inertia assessment was done following a nocturnal sleep episode while many of the studies reporting an influence of sleep stage at awakening involved a nap protocol. Our results are however consistent with studies that have examined sleep inertia after night time sleep [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Therefore, whether naps exacerbate the effect of sleep stage at awakening on sleep inertia needs to be further examined. </p><p> The fact that we struggle to function effectively after awakening suggests that alertness and cognitive functions take time to be fully restored. How quickly this recovery occurs appears to depend on a variety of factors related to outcome variables and experimental manipulations [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. We found that alertness/sleepiness and performance in tasks primarily involving lower cognitive processes, such as attention, were more affected than performance in tasks involving higher cognitive processes such as working memory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079688-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). The transition from sleep to wake, conceptualized as a &#x02018;switch-like&#x02019; mechanism involving several populations of sleep and wake-promoting neurons switching states offers a possible an explanation for this task difference in sleep inertia [<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. It is likely that not all populations of neurons switch instantly between sleep and wake states, rather the duration of this shift varies among them. Thus, the restoration of a cognitive process upon awakening may be related to how quickly the neurons, mediating the process, shift between sleep-wake states. Indeed, data from a recent study of regional Cerebral Blood Flow (rCBF) during awakening suggests that brain areas associated with consciousness or arousal recover immediately upon awakening, while those associated with higher cognitive processes do so more slowly [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p> Our participants appeared to be fully cognizant of their impairment in alertness, as was evident in the effect of sleep inertia on KSS ratings. However, the accuracy of self-ratings following sleep inertia or sleep loss has been debated in the literature [<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. While our results are consistent with some reports in the literature [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], it is at odds with more recent studies showing that sleep inertia may impair self-ratings of alertness, performance and mood [<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. It must be noted that our sleep inertia assessment was done after a nocturnal sleep episode while in the three studies [<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] it occurred after a nap. Moreover, the outcome measures in two of the studies constituted self-ratings of performance rather than sleepiness, although, recently, Groeger et al. [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] found an effect of sleep inertia on subjective ratings of performance. Clearly, even small methodological changes and circadian effects can yield substantive differences in sleep inertia in cognition. </p><p> Attention was one of the more strongly affected cognitive processes in our study. PVT performance in the morning showed that the slowest responses were significantly longer and lapses increased more than twofold when compared to baseline. Lapses or extremely long RT&#x02019;s (&#x0003e;500 msecs) in tasks like the PVT affect our ability to detect critical stimuli quickly and effectively. They are considered the hallmark of attention impairment [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] and constitute a unique behavioral state in that brain activity pattern during a lapse is different from the pattern during a normal or fast response [<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. </p><p> While sleep inertia in attention was as expected, the time course of its dissipation was unusual. It first worsened for two hours before improving and even then did not recover to baseline levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079688-g002">Figure 2 B and 2C</xref>). Two other studies that examined sleep inertia in PVT performance report a similar pattern [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The acute fatiguing effect of this task in combination with sleep inertia may have led to the non-linear pattern in recovery from the sleep inertia. Moreover, the monotonous nature of the task could result in boredom and/or a lack of motivation, both of which could have contributed to the unusual pattern in recovery [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The fact that sleep inertia is associated with increased lapses implies serious consequences in many work environments.</p><p> Sleep inertia had a very modest effect on cognitive throughput, and speed rather than in accuracy of performance was affected [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The data in the literature are rather contradictory in this regard. While some studies report an effect on speed in the addition task [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], others report an effect on accuracy [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Overall, findings from these studies suggest that various factors such as circadian phase, duration of sleep and conditions prior to sleep e.g. sleep deprivation, and experimental manipulations may modulate the relative sensitivity of speed and accuracy of performance in numerical tasks. For instance, sleep inertia appears strongest immediately upon awakening. In most studies of sleep inertia, the addition task is the first and often the only one to be administered [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In contrast, we administered the addition task after the N-back tasks and the PVT, and this may have diminished the effect of sleep inertia on this task; given the sample size of 11 it was not possible to vary the order of the tasks between participants to test this hypothesis. </p><p> As with the addition task, the effect of sleep inertia on working memory was seen in speed and not accuracy of performance. Most notably, the sleep inertia was stronger in the 1-back task compared to the 3-back task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079688-g003">Figure 3</xref>). These results are counterintuitive and in contrast to Groeger et al. [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. But key methodological differences between our study and theirs may explain the contrasting results. First, we used an auditory version of the task whereas Groeger et al. [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] used a visual version of the tasks. Secondly, our sleep inertia assessment occurred after a night of sleep, while theirs was done after a morning or an afternoon nap. Critically, they only found this effect following the afternoon nap, which may indicate a circadian modulation [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Lastly, it is worth noting that Lo et al. [<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] found a stronger effect of acute total sleep loss as well as repeated partial sleep loss on easier N-back tasks in comparison to the more challenging task. Why sleep inertia and sleep loss affect the easier n-back task more strongly is unclear. </p><p> Although the effect of sleep inertia is well documented, few studies have investigated therapeutic strategies for it [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Here, we asked whether modifying the composition of artificial light by making it brighter or blue-enhanced might reduce morning sleep inertia. Because, during the winter, in the higher latitudes, people wake up in darkness and turn on artificial light a few minutes later, we chose to simulate this morning light experience at home [<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Although similar in composition to the artificial light at home, the four experimental light conditions varied in intensity and/or spectral composition, specifically in blue wavelength (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079688-g004">Figure 4</xref>). We expected that blue-enhanced light would reduce the impact of sleep inertia. </p><p>Contrary to our expectation, the two blue-enhanced lights had no effect on alertness/sleepiness and most of the performance measures [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, we did find an effect of blue-enhanced white light on the &#x02018;non-match&#x02019; trials on the 3-back task. But, because this effect was small its clinical significance or practical relevance is unclear. Perhaps, if sleep inertia is distinct from the homeostatic process [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] then it may have a different spectral/intensity sensitivity to light. For instance, Werken et al. [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and Giminez et al. [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] found a positive effect on subjective alertness, albeit with a &#x02018;dawn simulation&#x02019; light and without sleep restriction to 6.5 hrs..</p><p> In conclusion findings from this study have implications for many socially critical professions e.g. medicine, law-enforcement and transportation, where personnel are routinely woken up from their night-time sleep, having to respond quickly and effectively to emergency situations. Clearly a phenomenon such as sleep inertia is of serious concern in these professions and it would be of great benefit to explore strategies to reduce its detrimental impact. Whether light exposure, a popular countermeasure for seasonal affective disorder, circadian misalignment and sleep loss during shift work, can be therapeutically used with sleep inertia needs to be more carefully examined. Although the light conditions in our study were not effective against sleep inertia, they may provide some useful information for future research in this regard. </p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We wish to thank the participants for volunteering in the protocol; Barsha Thapa, Abba Cruz Fernando and Kevin Poh for help with data collection; the recruitment, data management, clinical and research teams of the Surrey Clinical Research Centre for assistance with the study.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
