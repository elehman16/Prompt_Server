University men (<italic>n</italic> = 66) were randomly assigned to either a high or low social-evaluative body image threat condition. Participants provided saliva samples (to assess cortisol) and completed measures of state body shame prior to and following their condition, during which anthropometric and strength measures were assessed. Baseline corrected values indicated men in the high social-evaluative body image threat condition had higher body shame and cortisol than men in the low social-evaluative body image threat condition. These findings suggest that social evaluation in the context of situations that threaten body image leads to potentially negative psychobiological responses in college men.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>men</kwd><kwd>muscularity</kwd><kwd>social evaluation</kwd><kwd>cortisol</kwd><kwd>social self-preservation theory</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>The majority of research on body image has focused on adolescent and young adult women, leading to calls to examine more diverse samples, including boys and men (<xref rid="bibr77-1557988317723406" ref-type="bibr">Smolak &#x00026; Cash, 2011</xref>).

One theory that is gaining attention in the understanding of body image concerns which does use a psychobiological lens is social self-preservation theory (SSPT; <xref rid="bibr23-1557988317723406" ref-type="bibr">Dickerson, Gruenewald, &#x00026; Kemeny, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bibr44-1557988317723406" ref-type="bibr">Kemeny, Gruenewald, &#x00026; Dickerson, 2004</xref>). SSPT is rooted in the idea that humans have a basic need to belong and be accepted by others, and thus they monitor the environment for any threats to their social standing (<xref rid="bibr3-1557988317723406" ref-type="bibr">Baumeister &#x00026; Leary, 1995</xref>). According to SSPT, when one&#x02019;s social acceptance or standing is threatened due to potential negative evaluations from others (termed <italic>social-evaluative threat</italic>), a psychobiological response is initiated. This response includes self-conscious emotions (particularly shame) and cortisol (a stress hormone; <xref rid="bibr23-1557988317723406" ref-type="bibr">Dickerson, Gruenewald, et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bibr44-1557988317723406" ref-type="bibr">Kemeny et al., 2004</xref>). This psychobiological response is believed to signal to an individual that his or her social status is at risk, leading to the initiation of strategies designed to protect the self from further loss of status, including withdrawal, avoidance, or appeasement (<xref rid="bibr23-1557988317723406" ref-type="bibr">Dickerson, Gruenewald, et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bibr44-1557988317723406" ref-type="bibr">Kemeny et al., 2004</xref>). These psychobiological responses, if uncoordinated (i.e., responses are excessive relative to the threat or do not stop when the threat is removed) may have a damaging influence on health as they can overexpose individuals to chronic elevations in cortisol or shame. Numerous physical and health consequences have been linked to excessive cortisol levels or chronic shame, including depression, anxiety, low self-esteem, cardiovascular disease, and low bone mineral density (<xref rid="bibr36-1557988317723406" ref-type="bibr">Gilbert &#x00026; Trower, 1990</xref>; <xref rid="bibr52-1557988317723406" ref-type="bibr">Lewis, 1971</xref>; <xref rid="bibr61-1557988317723406" ref-type="bibr">McEwen, 1998</xref>).</p><p>The majority of research examining psychobiological responses to social-evaluative threats using SSPT in men and women has investigated responses in laboratory settings to performance-based tests. The most common performance-based test used is the Trier Social Stress Test (<xref rid="bibr45-1557988317723406" ref-type="bibr">Kirschbaum, Pirke, &#x00026; Hellhammer, 1993</xref>). This test requires participants to prepare and deliver a speech to a panel of judges (i.e., an evaluative audience). These studies have consistently identified that in situations of social-evaluative threat (compared to no social-evaluative threat), higher shame and cortisol result (<xref rid="bibr26-1557988317723406" ref-type="bibr">Dickerson, Mycek, &#x00026; Zaldivar, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bibr39-1557988317723406" ref-type="bibr">Gruenewald, Kemeny, Aziz, &#x00026; Fahey, 2004</xref>). While the Trier Social Stress Test has most commonly been used to examine contentions of SSPT, subsequent research has also suggested that other types of social-evaluative threat also elicit shame and cortisol responses consistent with the theory, including ballroom dancing and writing about a situation of self-blame (<xref rid="bibr25-1557988317723406" ref-type="bibr">Dickerson, Kemeny, Aziz, Kim, &#x00026; Fahey, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bibr71-1557988317723406" ref-type="bibr">Rohleder, Beilen, Chen, Wolf, &#x00026; Kirschbaum, 2007</xref>). More recently, research has also reported that body image threats may represent another class of social-evaluative threats, consistent with SSPT. In Western cultures, being physically attractive (e.g., having the ideal body) is linked with social acceptability, rank, and status (<xref rid="bibr35-1557988317723406" ref-type="bibr">Gilbert, 2002</xref>). As previously mentioned, the male ideal is associated with numerous social benefits (<xref rid="bibr59-1557988317723406" ref-type="bibr">McCreary, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bibr66-1557988317723406" ref-type="bibr">Petrie &#x00026; Greenleaf, 2011</xref>).</p><p><xref rid="bibr50-1557988317723406" ref-type="bibr">Lamarche, Kerr, Faulkner, Gammage, and Klentrou (2012)</xref> conducted a qualitative study in which women reported that uncomfortable body image situations contained elements of social evaluation (e.g., other people present and observing them), led to feelings such as shame and anxiety, and resulted in responses such as avoidance, consistent with SSPT. Subsequent experimental research has identified that body image situations characterized by social-evaluative threat can also elicit shame and cortisol responses (<xref rid="bibr17-1557988317723406" ref-type="bibr">Cloudt, Lamarche, &#x00026; Gammage, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bibr47-1557988317723406" ref-type="bibr">Lamarche, Bailey, &#x00026; Gammage, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bibr49-1557988317723406" ref-type="bibr">Lamarche, Gammage, Kerr, Faulkner, &#x00026; Klentrou, 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bibr48-1557988317723406" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; <xref rid="bibr56-1557988317723406" ref-type="bibr">Martin Ginis, Strong, Arent, &#x00026; Bray, 2012</xref>).</p><p><xref rid="bibr48-1557988317723406" ref-type="bibr">Lamarche, Gammage, Kerr, Faulkner, and Klentrou (2016)</xref> reported support for a cortisol and self-conscious emotional response (e.g., social physique anxiety) to body image social-evaluative threat, as well as evidence that outcomes return to baseline levels after the threat is no longer present, suggesting an efficient response-recovery profile. Women in the social-evaluative threat condition underwent a test to assess percent body fat while wearing spandex shorts and a jog bra, while women in the control group were asked to sit quietly. Women in the social-evaluative threat condition had higher cortisol and reported higher social physique anxiety compared to those in the control group.</p><p>Although growing evidence suggests that psychobiological responses occur to social-evaluative body image threats, it is unknown if findings generalize to men. Research to date has examined psychobiological responses to social-evaluative body image threats in women only. Given that men also experience body image concerns (<xref rid="bibr62-1557988317723406" ref-type="bibr">McFarland &#x00026; Petrie, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bibr64-1557988317723406" ref-type="bibr">Neighbors &#x00026; Sobal, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bibr80-1557988317723406" ref-type="bibr">Tylka et al., 2005</xref>), it is critical to investigate their responses to such threats from a psychobiological perspective. Men&#x02019;s body image concerns differ from women&#x02019;s as previously described and so the nature of the threat is likely to be very different between men and women&#x02014;it would be impossible to use the same threat that has been used previously in women. This contention is supported by research using the swimsuit/sweater paradigm to test to tenants of self-objectification theory (<xref rid="bibr33-1557988317723406" ref-type="bibr">Fredrickson, Roberts, Noll, Quinn, &#x00026; Twenge, 1998</xref>). For example, men reported the swimsuit condition as less shame-provoking than women and instead felt marginally more silly, awkward, or foolish.</p><p>It should be acknowledged that there is research to demonstrate that some men respond negatively to a number of body image situations (i.e., viewing media images of the male ideal, wearing speedos; <xref rid="bibr1-1557988317723406" ref-type="bibr">Arbour &#x00026; Martin Ginis, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bibr7-1557988317723406" ref-type="bibr">Brennan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bibr20-1557988317723406" ref-type="bibr">Cramblitt &#x00026; Pritchard, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bibr57-1557988317723406" ref-type="bibr">Martins, Tiggemann, &#x00026; Kirkbride, 2007</xref>) and that some factors exacerbate responses (i.e., presence of attractive female, presence of another male who is fit, wearing less clothing; <xref rid="bibr54-1557988317723406" ref-type="bibr">Marquez &#x00026; McAuley, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bibr72-1557988317723406" ref-type="bibr">Roney, Lukaszewski, &#x00026; Simmons, 2007</xref>). The body of research that has examined responses to body image situations in men has not taken a psychobiological approach grounded in theoretical thinking. SSPT offers theoretical support around contexts in which psychobiological responses are more likely: rejection-laden contexts where one could be deemed unworthy of acceptance, performance-based contexts where one is required to display a valuable trait or skill, and uncontrollable contexts where unfavorable characteristics may be brought to light (<xref rid="bibr23-1557988317723406" ref-type="bibr">Dickerson, Gruenewald et al., 2004</xref>). Further, a comprehensive meta-analysis framed within SSPT also identifies contextual factors that characterize situations likely to elicit a psychobiological responses consistent with SSPT (Dickerson &#x00026; Kemeny, 2008): the presence of an evaluative audience (at least one other person present besides the experimenter); a permanent recording of the performance (e.g., a videotape) for subsequent evaluation and the potential for negative social comparisons with others. Manipulations that included more than one element yielded larger cortisol responses than manipulations with only one evaluative element. The present study also served as a methodological starting point to design and test a threat that could be used in future psychobiological body image research specifically on men that is theoretically grounded.</p><p>The purpose of this study was to examine shame and cortisol responses to a social-evaluative body image threat in men. Given contentions of SSPT and research in the body image literature identifying psychobiological responses to a social-evaluative threat in women, it was hypothesized that men in a high social-evaluative body image threat would report higher post-threat body shame and would have higher post-threat cortisol compared to men in a low social-evaluative body image threat group.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="section1-1557988317723406"><title>Methods</title><sec id="section2-1557988317723406"><title>Participants</title><p>A total of 74 university men from southern Ontario were recruited for a study examining hormones, physical characteristics, and self-beliefs.

Participants were told the female confederate was a research assistant and the male confederate was another participant. The male confederate was 24 years of age and had a physique that was consistent with the male ideal; he had a muscular build, including broad shoulders, a narrow waist, well-defined abdominals, and muscular arms and chest (<xref rid="bibr10-1557988317723406" ref-type="bibr">Cafri &#x00026; Thompson, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bibr67-1557988317723406" ref-type="bibr">Pope et al., 2000</xref>).

Measurements were taken by the female confederate who read them aloud to the principal researcher who recorded all values. In all instances, the male confederate was chosen to undergo the physical measures first. Once all measures for the confederate were completed, the female confederate passed the clipboard with the recorded measures to the male research assistant who left the room. Participants were told he was going to the lab next door for a few minutes to enter the measured values into a computer program which would calculate body composition scores (percent body fat) and norms based on the male confederate&#x02019;s anthropometric and strength measures. When he returned he passed the &#x0201c;calculated values&#x0201d; to the female confederate who verbally reported them to the confederate so that everyone in the room could hear. Values indicated the male confederate tested in the healthiest range based on norms for men 18&#x02013;25 years for body mass index and that he had 8% body fat, comparable to an elite athlete. Further, his strength scores described him as stronger than 90% of men his age.</p><p>Next, the participant underwent the same anthropometric and strength tests using the same procedures. After all measures were completed, he was told that in the interest of time, while the male research assistant calculated strength and anthropometric measure values in the room next door, participants would complete the next set of questionnaires (post-threat) and then he would receive his results later. Completion of physical measures and the post-threat questionnaires took approximately 20 min. Participants then rested for approximately 10 min before providing the final saliva sample.

These responses are thought to serve as a warning that a potential loss of social status exists. The findings are also consistent with a large body of literature reporting that in non-body image-related social-evaluative threats, both shame and cortisol are higher in situations of social-evaluative threat than without it (<xref rid="bibr26-1557988317723406" ref-type="bibr">Dickerson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bibr39-1557988317723406" ref-type="bibr">Gruenewald et al., 2004</xref>; Roehleder et al., 2007).

Further, there has been inconsistency with respect to group differences being primarily driven by significant decreases in cortisol in control conditions, and not increases in cortisol in threat conditions (<xref rid="bibr17-1557988317723406" ref-type="bibr">Cloudt et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bibr49-1557988317723406" ref-type="bibr">Lamarche et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bibr56-1557988317723406" ref-type="bibr">Martin Ginis et al., 2012</xref>).

(2016)</xref>. It has been suggested that actually undergoing the threat (<xref rid="bibr48-1557988317723406" ref-type="bibr">Lamarche et al., 2016</xref>), compared to just imagining or anticipating that threat, elicits greater responses (<xref rid="bibr17-1557988317723406" ref-type="bibr">Cloudt et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bibr49-1557988317723406" ref-type="bibr">Lamarche et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bibr56-1557988317723406" ref-type="bibr">Martin Ginis et al., 2012</xref>). This contention is supported by research using other types of social-evaluative threats, which show that cortisol responses under imagined or anticipated threat are lower than those to actual threats (<xref rid="bibr25-1557988317723406" ref-type="bibr">Dickerson, Kemeny et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bibr26-1557988317723406" ref-type="bibr">Dickerson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bibr42-1557988317723406" ref-type="bibr">J&#x000f6;nsson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bibr43-1557988317723406" ref-type="bibr">Kelly, Matheson, Martinez, Merali, &#x00026; Anisman, 2007</xref>). The present findings would support the argument that actual exposure may be necessary for significant increases in cortisol in response to a threat.</p><p>This is not to downplay the importance of investigating responses to anticipated threats. Anticipated or imagined threats have consistently yielded significant increases in psychological responses (<xref rid="bibr2-1557988317723406" ref-type="bibr">Bailey, Lamarche, &#x00026; Gammage, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bibr17-1557988317723406" ref-type="bibr">Cloudt et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bibr34-1557988317723406" ref-type="bibr">Gammage et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bibr49-1557988317723406" ref-type="bibr">Lamarche et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bibr56-1557988317723406" ref-type="bibr">Martin Ginis et al., 2012</xref>). These increases could have significant behavioral implications; for example, people may choose to avoid situations in which they anticipate a social-evaluative threat, even without experiencing them. Exercise may be one such setting; individuals who believe they will be evaluated negatively by others in an exercise setting, leading to feelings of shame or social physique anxiety, may ultimately lead them to avoid this healthy activity (<xref rid="bibr34-1557988317723406" ref-type="bibr">Gammage et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>The present study extends the current research in several significant ways. Previous studies using SSPT to examine the impact of social-evaluative body image threats have investigated only female samples. The present study is the first to investigate these responses in men. Thus, the current study provides evidence of the robustness of SSPT applied to social-evaluative body image threats in more diverse samples and to different types of threats. It also provides further evidence that men experience negative body image, and that in response to a body image threat they experience potentially negative outcomes such as shame and cortisol, which have been linked to poor well-being and negative health outcomes (<xref rid="bibr36-1557988317723406" ref-type="bibr">Gilbert &#x00026; Trower, 1990</xref>; <xref rid="bibr52-1557988317723406" ref-type="bibr">Lewis, 1971</xref>; <xref rid="bibr61-1557988317723406" ref-type="bibr">McEwen, 1998</xref>).</p><p>A methodological strength of the present study was the construction of the threat, which was based on theory and robust empirical evidence and which can be used in future research. However, despite being a methodological strength, it should be noted that several contextual factors were used to maximize/minimize the evaluative nature of the condition and so knowing which factor or combination of factors were &#x0201c;effective&#x0201d; is impossible. It is likely a combination of factors working together that elicited the psychobiological responses (<xref rid="bibr24-1557988317723406" ref-type="bibr">Dickerson &#x00026; Kemeny, 2004</xref>). It should also be highlighted that characteristics that make a body image situation &#x0201c;threatening&#x0201d; are different for men than women. From a research perspective, it appears that the precise social-evaluative threats need to be specifically designed for the population being studied, particularly when investigating body-related threats. For example, in a series of two interview studies (<xref rid="bibr50-1557988317723406" ref-type="bibr">Lamarche et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bibr51-1557988317723406" ref-type="bibr">Lamarche et al., in progress</xref>) women and men were asked about specific situations they would find uncomfortable leading them to feeling anxious or ashamed of their bodies. While women reported that wearing a bathing suit, wearing unflattering clothes, being intimate and having others present were perceived as threatening elements, men reported that being in the presence of others who met the North American ideal (men and women) and when they were shirtless were factors that increased perceptions of the threat. Perhaps this means a direct comparison of psychobiological responses to social-evaluative body image situations between men and women cannot be made because the threats will be different; however, using a theory such as SSPT to construct the situations and measure responses can help the level of understanding of body image experiences from a psychobiological lens. This may be particularly true as the present findings support the use of SSPT in understanding psychobiological responses to social-evaluative body image threats in men.</p><sec id="section16-1557988317723406"><title>Limitations</title><p>Although this study makes numerous contributions to both the understanding of SSPT and to the body image literature, there are several limitations that should be acknowledged. The current sample consisted of college men, with the majority enrolled in physical education or kinesiology degree programs and thus the present results can be generalized only to this group. The majority of the men in the present sample were active and were considered to have a &#x0201c;healthy weight&#x0201d; based on BMI (BMI &#x0003c; 25), as men of different BMI values may not have felt comfortable volunteering for this study due to feeling embarrassed or uncomfortable in putting their bodies on display. Although the true purpose of the study was concealed, the institutional research ethics board where the present study took place required that the posters placed around campus informed men the study was body-related; it is likely those who volunteered for a study examining physical characteristic, self-beliefs, and cortisol responses were more comfortable with their bodies than individuals who struggle with weight or body image concerns.</p><p>As with any self-report measures, social desirability may an issue. This is particularly true given that men may be reluctant to disclose negative body image feelings (<xref rid="bibr38-1557988317723406" ref-type="bibr">Grogan &#x00026; Richards, 2002</xref>). However, this explanation is unlikely as the differences in psychological responses were consistent with differences in the cortisol responses, which are not subject to social desirability biases. Similarly, concerns that participants knew the true purpose of the study or did not believe the manipulations used in the current study (e.g., videotape, normative feedback) are unlikely. When queried following the final debrief, only one participant admitted being suspicious about the nature of the study manipulations.</p><p>Finally, participants were asked to follow specific directions on the day of study participation. Participants indicated that they followed instructions (i.e., they did not eat, drink, workout, or have anything stressful happen to them) but there is no way to know if they responded honestly. Given that baseline cortisol levels were consistent with previous studies (<xref rid="bibr45-1557988317723406" ref-type="bibr">Kirschbaum et al., 1993</xref>; <xref rid="bibr71-1557988317723406" ref-type="bibr">Rohleder et al., 2007</xref>), it is likely that these directions were followed correctly.</p></sec><sec id="section17-1557988317723406"><title>Future Directions</title><p>Given that this is the first study to investigate psychobiological responses to social-evaluative body image threats in men, replication is certainly warranted. It is important that researchers investigate the health effects of cumulative social-evaluative threats, rather than exposure to a single instance of these threats. In addition, the high threat condition utilized numerous manipulations, but it is unclear which aspect or aspects of the condition were most closely linked to the psychobiological changes. Factors moderating responses (e.g., self-esteem, internalization of the male ideal) would also be important to investigate (<xref rid="bibr53-1557988317723406" ref-type="bibr">Lupis, Sabik, &#x00026; Wolf, 2016</xref>). According to SSPT, responses are not inherently damaging, but uncoordinated responses may be such that prolonged exposure to shame or cortisol (slow return to baseline levels of shame and cortisol when the threat is no longer present) may be health damaging. Although the present study&#x02019;s aim was to examine responses to threats, measuring what occurs after the threat is no longer present would provide a better understanding of how such threats may be linked to negative health outcomes. Although cortisol and shame are salient outcomes with SSPT, extending body image research to examine other psychological and physiological outcomes is also important for theoretical and methodological development. Research within SSPT has examined variables such as indicators of immune function and guilt (i.e., <xref rid="bibr23-1557988317723406" ref-type="bibr">Dickerson et al., 2004</xref>). Within the body image literature other outcomes have been examined framed within SSPT (i.e., social physique anxiety, heart rate; <xref rid="bibr47-1557988317723406" ref-type="bibr">Lamarche et al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bibr48-1557988317723406" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), but this research is relatively limited. Finally, examining the response pattern in other subsamples of men (i.e., athletes, varying ethnic backgrounds and sexual orientations, older adult men) will be an important methodological and theoretical extension of SSPT.</p></sec><sec id="section18-1557988317723406"><title>Practical Applications</title><p>The present study suggests that shame and cortisol both increase in response to a social-evaluative body image threat in university men. According to SSPT, these responses should initiate several coping responses (e.g., appeasement, withdrawal, disengagement) to reduce the potential loss of social status. Many of these responses are consistent with the body image coping literature (<xref rid="bibr14-1557988317723406" ref-type="bibr">Cash, Santos, &#x00026; Williams, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bibr76-1557988317723406" ref-type="bibr">Smith-Jackson, Reel, Thackeray, 2011</xref>). Thus, it may be possible to help men identify situations that they may encounter in their lives (e.g., going to the gym) and potential coping strategies that they may engage in to reduce these potentially harmful responses.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="section19-1557988317723406"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The present study provided insight to the psychobiological responses to a social-evaluative body image threat in university men. Consistent with SSPT, significant differences were identified post-threat, with men in the high social-evaluative body image threat condition reporting higher body shame and having higher cortisol, than those in the low threat condition. This study contributes to the body image literature, in particular by identifying a social-evaluative body image threat that can be used in future research to test other contentions of SSPT in a body image setting. Further, these results emphasize that body image is not just a &#x0201c;women&#x02019;s concern&#x0201d;; men also experience negative body image. The results of the current study confirm the need to further explore men&#x02019;s body image concerns to gain a better understanding of the different psychobiological responses and negative health implications that may occur.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Declaration of Conflicting Interests:</bold> The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding:</bold> The author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bibr1-1557988317723406"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
