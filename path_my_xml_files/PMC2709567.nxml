Plant miRNA targets typically contain a single sequence motif with near-perfect complementarity to the miRNA. Here, we extended and applied the program RNAhybrid to identify novel miRNA targets in the complete annotated <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> transcriptome. RNAhybrid predicts the energetically most favorable miRNA:mRNA hybrids that are consistent with user-defined structural constraints. These were: (i) perfect base pairing of the duplex from nucleotide 8 to 12 counting from the 5&#x02032;-end of the miRNA; (ii) loops with a maximum length of one nucleotide in either strand; (iii) bulges with no more than one nucleotide in size; and (iv) unpaired end overhangs not longer than two nucleotides. G:U base pairs are not treated as mismatches, but contribute less favorable to the overall free energy. The resulting hybrids were filtered according to their minimum free energy, resulting in an overall prediction of more than 600 novel miRNA targets. The specificity and signal-to-noise ratio of the prediction was assessed with either randomized miRNAs or randomized target sequences as negative controls. Our results are in line with recent observations that the majority of miRNA targets are not transcription factors.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) constitute a class of small non-coding RNA molecules that regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Since the first reports from plants in 2002 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>), it has become evident that miRNAs are crucial regulators of very diverse signaling networks, including the development of leaves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>), flowers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6 B7 B8 B9">6&#x02013;9</xref>), shoots and roots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10 B11 B12">10&#x02013;12</xref>) and vascular tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>), also small RNA biogenesis and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>), sensing nutrient stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16 B17 B18 B19">16&#x02013;19</xref>), oxidative tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>) and responses to phytohormones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21 B22 B23 B24">21&#x02013;24</xref>). In contrast to animals, the preferred mechanism of action of miRNAs in plants is the cleavage of target mRNAs by the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), guided by the miRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). Plant miRNAs have also been reported to act by repressing translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>) or by inducing methylation of DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). The miRBase repository currently lists 187 miRNA genes for <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). A major issue in miRNA research is to establish their functions and the functions of their targets. Prediction and experimental validation of target mRNAs provide the first essential steps towards this task. In plants, miRNAs typically show high sequence complementarity to a single sequence motif within the open reading frame of their target mRNA, the miRNA binding site. This feature forms the basis for the prediction of miRNA targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28 B29 B30 B31 B32 B33">28&#x02013;33</xref>).</p><p>The first prediction of miRNA targets in Arabidopsis employed a pattern match algorithm that allowed a maximum of three mismatches between the miRNA and its complementary binding site on the target mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). No bulge was allowed, and G:U base pairs were considered as mismatches. Although this approach was very restrictive, several miRNA targets were identified. Many target mRNAs were members of the same gene family, and this characteristic was considered as supporting the prediction. In a refined prediction approach, a simple penalty scoring was employed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Each mismatch nucleotide in the miRNA:mRNA duplex was given the value 1.0, G:U base pairs and bulge nucleotides were given the value 0.5 and 2.0, respectively, and a maximum score of 3.5 was allowed. In addition, conservation of miRNA complementarity between Arabidopsis and rice mRNAs was used as an additional positive selection factor. By relaxing the restrictions of the previous approach concerning the number of bulges and mismatches, many novel miRNA targets could be discovered. However, the criterion of conservation between distantly related species potentially leads to a high number of false-negative predictions due to a lack of gene conservation between different species. A similar approach was applied by Wang <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>).</p><p>A microarray analysis of plants overexpressing specific miRNAs combined with structural analyses of validated miRNA:mRNA hybrids resulted in a set of rules that seem to be necessary for functional miRNA:mRNA interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). Generally, the pairing in the 5&#x02032; part of the miRNA appears to be most important for function, and only one mismatch was found in the regions corresponding to the nucleotides 2&#x02013;12 of the miRNA, which includes the presumptive mRNA cleavage site opposite positions 10 and 11. In the 3&#x02032;-end of the miRNA, a mismatch loop was shown to be tolerated if it contains no more than two nucleotides in either strand. On the other hand, a perfect match in this part can compensate for the presence of up to two mismatches in the 5&#x02032; part. The minimum free energy (mfe) of the duplex should be at least 72% of a perfect match calculated with the same miRNA, and the actual value should be &#x02212;30 kcal/mol or below.</p><p>An approach based on the comparison of mfe values of miRNA:mRNA hybrids was developed by Rusinov <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). In this implementation, the first six nucleotides of the miRNA were used for an initial sliding-window search in all Arabidopsis transcripts for six Watson&#x02013;Crick matches, or five Watson&#x02013;Crick matches plus one G:U base pair. When a hit was found, a sequence of 32 nt including the hit was extracted and a hybridization structure of the miRNA:mRNA duplex was calculated with an RNA folding program. Rusinov <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>) also implemented structural filters based on validated miRNA:mRNA hybrids.</p><p>Most Arabidopsis miRNAs known to date are not present in any other genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36 B37 B38">36&#x02013;38</xref>). As a consequence, target predictions for these miRNAs cannot make use of evolutionary conservation of target mRNAs. In order to predict miRNA targets independently of target mRNA conservation in other species, Xie <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>) analyzed a set of predicted and validated miRNA targets to define more specific parameters concerning the position of mismatches, the number of G:U base pairs, and the percentage of the mfe of the actual miRNA:mRNA hybrid compared with a perfect match hybrid. Using this approach, miRNA targets were predicted that are unique to Arabidopsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>).</p><p>As major difference of our prediction approach to previous ones, we extended and applied the miRNA target prediction tool RNAhybrid with respect to plant specificities and predicted novel miRNA targets in the complete transcriptome of <italic>A. thaliana</italic>. RNAhybrid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>) predicts the energetically most favorable miRNA:mRNA hybrids that are consistent with user-defined structural constraints. The formation of G:U base pairs is allowed, and predictions do not depend on evolutionary conservation of miRNA targets. Using mfe as an additional filter, we predicted more than 600 novel miRNA targets, in addition to already predicted/validated targets. As a test for our prediction parameters, 10 targets were subjected to experimental validation, five of which were confirmed. Comparison of the gene ontology (GO) molecular function classes of our predicted targets with those of previously predicted/validated targets shows that miRNA target genes are not strongly over-represented in any specific functional class such as transcription factors. Finally, we performed miRNA target predictions for 12 additional plant species.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Data acquisition</title><p>The dataset of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> candidate mRNAs used was the TAIR7_cdna_20070425 dataset, which includes all transcribed sequences according to the annotation release TAIR 7.0. These candidate mRNAs were obtained from the TAIR website (ftp://ftp.arabidopsis.org/Sequences/blast_datasets). The miRNA dataset was downloaded from miRBASE release 9.2 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://microrna.sanger.ac.uk">http://microrna.sanger.ac.uk</ext-link>). This release contains 184 Arabidopsis miRNA genes, classified into 106 gene families.</p></sec><sec><title>Prediction of miRNA targets</title><p>Predictions of miRNA targets were done with the program RNAhybrid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). Originally designed for the prediction of miRNA targets in animals and for general-purpose analyses of RNA hybridization, RNAhybrid had to be adapted to the specific requirements of plant miRNA target prediction. RNAhybrid performs <italic>in silico</italic> hybridizations between a miRNA and a possible target mRNA in a way that optimizes the free energy of the hybridization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). G:U base pairs are not treated as mismatches, since they contribute to the overall free energy of RNA:RNA hybrids, albeit less favorably than standard base pairs. In our search for plant miRNA:mRNA hybrids, the following setting was applied: (i) perfect base pairing of the duplex from nucleotide 8 to 12 counting from the 5&#x02032;-end of the miRNA, (ii) loops with a maximum length of 1 nt in either strand, (iii) bulges with no more than one nucleotide in size, and (iv) end overhangs not longer than two nucleotides. The &#x02018;seed&#x02019; region from nucleotide 8 to 12 of the duplex includes the presumptive cleavage site in the target sequence. Finally, the minimum mfe value of the miRNA:mRNA hybrid was required to be 70% of the mfe calculated for a perfect match, in accordance with (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). Predictions done with this initial mfe cut-off were later filtered for a minimum mfe of 75%.</p></sec><sec><title>Assessing specificity/signal-to-noise ratio</title><p>To estimate the specificity and signal-to-noise ratio of our prediction, two methods were employed. For the first method, 10 randomized sequences for each miRNA (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp272/DC1">Supplementary Table S1</ext-link>) were generated with the program SHUFFLE from the HMMER package (42; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmmer.janelia.org">http://hmmer.janelia.org</ext-link>), maintaining the dinucleotide frequencies of the original miRNAs. The number of predicted targets for these randomly generated miRNAs was compared with the number of predicted targets for the authentic miRNAs (references in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp272/DC1">Supplementary Tables S2 and S8</ext-link>). Specificities and signal-to-noise ratios were calculated for each miRNA, and the averages were defined as specificity and signal-to-noise ratio of the entire prediction. More specifically, if TP is the number of true positives and FP the number of false positives, specificity is defined as <italic>specificity = TP/(TP + FP)</italic> and signal-to-noise ratio as <italic>signal-to-noise = (TP + FP)/FP</italic>. These numbers are related by <italic>specificity = 1 &#x02013; 1/signal-to-noise</italic>. Note that (TP + FP) is merely the number of all positively predicted miRNA:target relationships on authentic data (original miRNAs versus original mRNAs), and FP is estimated from randomized data.</p><p>In the second approach, a non-redundant dataset was created (TAIR7_nr) out of the TAIR7_cdna_20070425 dataset by using only one gene model per gene, and 10 randomized datasets of the same size (i.e. number of sequences and size of each sequence) and the same dinucleotide frequency as the TAIR7_nr were generated. Taking a set of 84 authentic non-redundant mature miRNA sequences (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp272/DC1">Supplementary Table S1</ext-link>), searches for miRNA binding sites were done with the TAIR7_nr dataset and with the 10 shuffled cohorts, and specificities and signal-to-noise ratios were calculated as above.</p><p>In addition, predictions were sorted into groups according to the mfes of miRNA:mRNA duplexes relative to perfect-match mfes. Six cut-offs were applied: 70, 72, 75, 77, 80 and 85%. These values were chosen on the basis of the distribution of the percentage of mfe values compared to the mfe of perfect match hybrids of miRNA:mRNA hybrids of validated miRNA targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Specificity and signal-to-noise ratio was estimated for each group as described above. Sensitivities were calculated as the percentages of experimentally validated targets (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp272/DC1">Supplementary Table S2</ext-link>) that were identified within the target prediction for each mfe cut-off group.

The resulting DNA fragments were ligated into the XbaI and SacI restriction sites of the pUC19-derived vector p35S 3&#x02032;GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>), thereby replacing the cDNA encoding GFP. Each construct was used to transfect tobacco BY-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>) or Arabidopsis AT7 protoplasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>), or both. Total RNA from transfected protoplasts was extracted using Tri-Reagent (Molecular Research Center) followed by DNaseI treatement (DNA-free&#x02122;, Ambion). The expression of a given miRNA from the transgene was assayed by Northern blotting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>). A single-stranded RNA of 21 nucleotides in length (300 pMol/lane), separated along with the RNA samples, was used as a size marker. The choice of sequence allowed the detection with the same probe used to detect the U6snRNA (AT3G13855) for the gel loading control. In addition, for each miRNA, a DNA oligo with the same sequence of the miRNA was used as positive control for blot detection. The probes were prepared by labeling 20 &#x003bc;M of the specific DNA oligonucleotide with &#x003b3;-[<sup>32</sup>P]ATP (5000 Ci/mmol, 10 mCi/ml, Hartmann Analytic GmbH, Germany) using polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) and purified with Sephadex G25 spin columns (GE Biosciences).

The expression of each GFP fusion protein was verified by transient transfection of BY-2 protoplasts and analysis of the GFP fluorescence by confocal laser scanning microscopy using standard settings. To construct a 5&#x02032;RACE library for each target, total RNA was isolated from AT7 protoplasts co-transfected with plasmids that overexpress both the miRNA precursor and the target mRNA. Alternatively, for target validation <italic>in planta</italic>, total RNA was extracted from young inflorescences of Arabidopsis Col-0 plants grown on soil. An RNA adaptor (300 ng, FirstChoice RLM-RACE kit, Ambion) was ligated to 10 &#x003bc;g of DNAseI treated total RNA using T4 RNA ligase (New England Biolabs) at 37&#x000b0;C for 1 h. For reverse transcriptase reactions, Superscript reverse transcriptase II (Invitrogen) was used according to the manufacturer's protocol. Reactions were done in 20 &#x003bc;l final volume with 2 &#x003bc;g of adaptor-ligated RNA, 1 mM oligo(dT) primer (dN-18dT), 500 &#x003bc;M of each dNTP, 1&#x000d7; First Strand Buffer, 10 &#x003bc;M of dithiothreitol and 20 U of reverse transcriptase II. The RNA adaptor provides an anchoring sequence for PCR primers. A PCR with the outer 5&#x02032;RACE primer and a gene specific primer 1 (GSP1) was performed. A second nested PCR reaction was performed with the inner 5&#x02032;RACE primer and a GSP2 primer (primers used for 5&#x02032;RACE experiments are listed in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp272/DC1">Supplementary Table S6</ext-link>). PCR products were analyzed on a 1% agarose gel, and DNA fragments were directly ligated into TOPO-TA vector (TOPO-TA cloning kit, Invitrogen). Alternatively, PCR fragments were gel-purified using Qiaquick Gel Purification Kit (Qiagen) before ligation. Positive clones were screened by PCR using primers GSP3 and GSP1. For target mRNAs that contained the miRNA binding site at the very end of the open reading frame, gene specific primers for GFP were used. Between 5 and 10 positive clones were sequenced for each target.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Prediction of miRNA targets in Arabidopsis</title><p>The results of the calculations of specificities and sensitivities for six mfe cut-off groups are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>.

This analysis confirms that targets are overrepresented in a small number of GO classes in the group of previously predicted/validated targets, namely transcription factors and DNA/RNA binding proteins, whereas targets are underrepresented in other GO classes, including transporters, kinases and hydrolases. In contrast, the complete dataset of our prediction including previously predicted/validated targets in addition to novel predicted targets does not show this highly unequal distribution between different GO classes. Although the GO classes of transcription factors and DNA/RNA binding proteins still contain more miRNA targets as compared to the whole transcriptome categorization, GO classes like kinases and hydrolases which had been highly underrepresented before, are now close to equal representation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>).

In the protoplast co-transfection assay, the expression of the target-GFP fusion protein and thus the production of the target RNA could be easily verified by monitoring the fluorescence (data not shown; 44,46). To verify the production of the mature miRNA in our assay system, Northern blots were prepared to detect small RNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). Four out of six mature miRNAs assayed could be detected (miR156, miR159, miR161, miR395). For miR161 and miR395, a clearly higher expression level was detected in protoplasts transfected with the pre-miRNA than in protoplasts transfected with the empty vector. The miR395 was only detected in protoplasts transfected with the pre-miRNA. In contrast, although clearly detectable, there was no difference in the amount of miR156 and miR159 between pre-miRNA and mock transfections. Two miRNAs were not detected in Northern blot experiments, miR414 and miR172 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C and E, respectively). We restricted subsequent validation experiments to targets of miR156, miR159, miR161 and miR395, since the expression of these miRNAs could be demonstrated.

Naturally, most of the miRNA targets that show very high complementarity to their miRNAs were found first with rather stringent procedures that were based on very few parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). More targets were predicted then with algorithms that allowed bulges (gaps) and/or loops (mismatches) and that considered conservation of target mRNAs in other plant species as an additional positive selection criterion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Many novel putative miRNA targets were found with our approach. As major difference to previous predictions, our approach is based on the calculation of miRNA:mRNA hybrids that are optimal with respect to their free energy. The program RNAhybrid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>) also allows the occurrence of G:U base pairs and does not treat them as mismatches. Parameters were chosen to accommodate structural features that have been found to be of importance in validated plant miRNA:mRNA hybrids. Perfect base pairing of the duplex from nucleotide 8 to 12 of the miRNA defined a &#x02018;seed&#x02019; within the hybrid structure, reflecting the finding that mismatches are rare in the region around the target cleavage site. However, unpaired bases or mismatches are found frequently outside this seed in many miRNA:mRNA hydrids of validated plant targets. This was considered in our prediction, and loops and bulges were allowed with a maximum length of one nucleotide (on each strand for loops). Sequence parameters of plant and animal miRNA target recognition were reviewed and discussed very recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>). Furthermore, we did not rely on any comparative genomics approach, since the majority of miRNAs found in Arabidopsis lack homologues in other plant species, and therefore this criterion cannot be used for target predictions in these cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>). The fact that we nevertheless achieved high sensitivity and specificity values highlights the broad applicability of our approach. Altogether, these features resulted in the prediction of a large number of novel putative miRNA targets.</p><p>The results of our prediction are based on rather high stringency, since stretches of unpaired nucleotides (&#x02018;gaps&#x02019; or &#x02018;mismatches&#x02019;) in either miRNA or mRNA are restricted to one nucleotide in length. A relaxation of these parameters, and a change of the definition of the seed as well, results in a higher sensitivity but simultaneously also in a lower specificity. To further increase specificity we used an mfe cut-off, similar to (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). In estimating the specificity of our predictions, we defined six mfe cut-off groups and calculated signal-to-noise ratios and specificity values for each group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>) based on predictions with real miRNAs (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp272/DC1">Supplementary Table S1</ext-link>) against randomized target datasets and with randomized miRNAs against the TAIR7 CDS dataset. Sensitivities of predictions were determined on the basis of experimentally validated Arabidopsis miRNA targets (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp272/DC1">Supplementary Table S2</ext-link>) as the percentage of identified targets of this dataset in the predictions for each mfe cut-off group. As summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>, an mfe cutoff of 75% offered the best compromise with a high sensitivity of 94.1% and an acceptable signal-to-noise ratio between 4.5:1 and 5.2:1, corresponding to a specificity between 77% and 81%.</p></sec><sec><title>Novel predicted miRNA targets</title><p>Most of the previously predicted/validated miRNA targets are genes that encode transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>), and it was concluded that the high number of transcription factors among miRNA targets reflects the key role of miRNAs in gene regulatory networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Analysis of the GO molecular function classes of proteins encoded by the novel miRNA targets predicted in this work including the previously predicted/validated targets showed that no major GO category was strongly overrepresented any more (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Our work contributes to identifying novel putative targets among GO categories that were previously underrepresented, like transporter proteins, kinases and hydrolases. Thus, our data are in line with recent observations that the spectrum of miRNA-mediated regulation may be much broader than considered before. In plants, the number of targets per miRNA family is much smaller than in metazoa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>). Our work adds more than 600 novel predicted miRNA targets, and many of these shed new light on regulatory pathways that may be under miRNA control.

We successfully validated five targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>), <italic>MYB101</italic>, <italic>MYB125</italic>, <italic>MRG1, ACS8</italic> (all targets for miR159) and <italic>GAE1</italic>, a target of miR161. In sum, we validated two previously predicted and three novel targets; <italic>MYB101</italic>, <italic>MYB125</italic> and <italic>MRG1</italic> were also validated by others during progress of our work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>). <italic>ACS8</italic> was reported to be affected by the over-expression of miR159 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>).</p><p>Five additional transcripts were not confirmed as miRNA targets: <italic>MYB94</italic> (miR156), <italic>CKL6</italic> (miR159), <italic>MYB97</italic> (miR159), <italic>PRF2</italic> (miR161) and <italic>MYB58</italic> (miR395). None of these transcripts nor the confirmed targets <italic>GAE1</italic> and <italic>MYB125</italic> are listed in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp272/DC1">Supplementary Table S7 or S8</ext-link>, since the miRNA:mRNA hybrids do not match the stringent structural constraints and the mfe cutoff filter that we finally applied. The miR161:<italic>GAE1</italic> hybrid does not satisfy the 75% mfe cutoff constraint, the miR159:<italic>MYB125</italic> and the miR161:<italic>PRF2</italic> hybrid show a mismatch within the seed at position 12, very close to the prospective cleavage site, and the miR156:<italic>MYB94</italic> hybrid has a mismatch loop containing two nucleotides on either strand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). Nonetheless they were chosen for validation experiments because their hybrid structure showed less than five mismatches. The negative outcome of target validation experiments of the targets that did not match our stringent prediction parameters indicates that these parameters are effective to differentiate between true and false miRNA targets. However, the validation of <italic>GAE1</italic> as a miR161 target and <italic>MYB125</italic> as a target of miR159 confirms that some true miRNA targets may be among the candidates eliminated by these stringent criteria, as expected.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>In this work, we report the prediction of many novel miRNA targets, suggesting that the repertoire of miRNA based regulation in plants is much broader than previously assumed. Many of our novel predictions extend the spectrum of biological processes that are subject to miRNA regulation. Furthermore, by changing the prediction parameters that we applied here accordingly, the Arabidopsis transcriptome may also be searched for the presence of more mimicry targets like <italic>IPS1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">74</xref>) by allowing &#x02018;mismatches&#x02019; around the mRNA cleavage site. Our approach should be helpful in the prediction of more putative targets in other plant species, given the still increasing miRNA and transcriptome datasets.</p><p>Not all of these novel putative targets may be validated to be cleaved targets <italic>in planta</italic>. This may have several reasons. Some computationally predicted miRNAs that were not cloned or identified in deep sequencing studies may not be authentic miRNA genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36 B37 B38">36&#x02013;38</xref>). These include miR413, miR414, miR415 to miR420 and miR426 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). On the other hand, there are still open questions concerning the structural requirements of miRNA:mRNA hybrid structures with respect to target selection and mode of function in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>). In addition, there is a higher degree of miRNA-based translational repression in plants than anticipated before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">75</xref>). This may be a reason why only 43 of already known miRNA targets and 83 of our novel predicted targets were found to be up-regulated in plants carrying mutations in genes involved in miRNA biogenesis and function (29; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp272/DC1">Supplementary Table S9</ext-link>). Similarly, the expression levels of <italic>MYB33</italic> and <italic>MYB65</italic>, two known miR159 targets, were not reduced in plants overexpressing miR159 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>), which questions the suitability of microarray data as sole source to identify miRNA targets. A similar argument may hold true to explain the fact that only few of our predicted novel targets (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp272/DC1">Supplementary Table S10</ext-link>) were detected by very recent approaches to identify ligation-competent mRNA 5&#x02032;-ends/uncapped mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">76</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B77">77</xref>) or in mutants that are affected in RNA metabolism and silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B78">78</xref>). With these findings in mind, <italic>in silico</italic> prediction continues to be a valuable tool for identifying potential plant miRNA targets.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp272/DC1">Supplementary data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online and Bielefeld University (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bibiserv.techfak.uni-bielefeld.de/cgi-bin/rnahybrid_tdb_mirnas.cgi">http://bibiserv.techfak.uni-bielefeld.de/cgi-bin/rnahybrid_tdb_mirnas.cgi</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, Bioinformatics Initiative BIZ 7/1 to M.R., T.M.).
