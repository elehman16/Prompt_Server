However, the results of randomized controlled trials have been discouraging. We attempted to evaluate the influence of overweight, a frequent risk factor for coronary artery disease, on the lipid-modifying effects of HRT.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A total of 345 postmenopausal women were divided into 2 groups according to body mass index (BMI): the control group; BMI&#x0003c;25 Kg/m<sup>2</sup> (n=248) and the overweight group; BMI&#x02265;25 Kg/m<sup>2</sup> (n=97). All women received either 0.625 mg conjugated equine estrogen (CEE)(n=139), CEE plus 5 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA)(n=97) or CEE plus 10 mg MPA (n=109). Lipid profiles were measured before and 12 months after HRT.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In both the control and overweight groups, HRT reduced low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (<italic>p</italic>=0.000 and <italic>p</italic>=0.000 respectively) and lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)] levels (<italic>p</italic>=0.000 and <italic>p</italic>=0.000 respectively) and raised high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels (<italic>p</italic>=0.000 and <italic>p</italic>=0.002 respectively). However, the elevation of the HDL-C level was higher in the control group than in overweight group (17.5% vs. 10.4%, <italic>p</italic>=0.015), and this was significant after adjusting for changes in body weights (<italic>p</italic>=0.016).

A total of 345 postmenopausal women who had been amenorrheic for 1 year or longer without evidence of gynecological disorders and/or who had a follicle stimulating hormone level (FSH) greater than 20 mIU/L were enrolled. Subjects with diseases which influence lipid levels, such as diabetes mellitus, chronic liver diseases, infectious diseases or other endocrine diseases, were excluded. None had received hormonal preparations or medications which changed lipid levels before or during the study. The study subjects were divided into two groups according to body mass index (BMI): the control group; BMI &#x0003c; 25 Kg/m<sup>2</sup> (n=248) and the overweight group; BMI &#x02265; 25 Kg/m<sup>2</sup> (n=97).</p><p>All women received either 0.625 mg conjugated equine estrogen (CEE) (n=139), 0.625 mg CEE plus 5 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) (n=97) or 0.625 mg CEE plus 10 mg MPA (n=109). Medication was prescribed cyclically every 30 days. CEE was administered from the 1st to the 25th days, and no medication was given from the 26th to the 30th days. MPA was added from the 16th to the 25th days, when indicated.</p></sec><sec><title>Measurements</title><p>After overnight fasting, blood samples were obtained. Total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), very low density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C), triglyceride, and lipoprotein (a)[Lp(a)] levels were measured before and 12 months after medication.</p><p>Total cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations were determined by the enzymatic method, using an automatic analyzer (Model 7150, Hitachi, Naka, Japan). The concentrations of HDL-C, LDL-C and VLDL-C were determined by electrophoretic methods using the HDL Cholesterol Supply Kit (Helena Laboratory, Beaumont, TX). The lipoproteins were separated according to their electrophoretic mobility on cellulose acetate in a tris-barbital buffer, pH 8.8 and fractions were visualized with production of quinoneimine by the enzymatic method. The relative percentage of each fraction was obtained by scanning in a densitometer equipped with a 500 or 505 nm filter. The HDL-C, LDL-C and VLDL-C concentrations were calculated by multiplying each ratio by the total cholesterol concentration.</p><p>The concentration of Lp(a) was determined by 2-site immunoradiometric assay using a commercial radioimmunoassay kit (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) as previously described<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9)</xref>.

The data were stored on an IBM computer using dBASE III plus (Borland Co, Scotts Valley, CA). Statistical analysis was performed using the Social Package for Social Science (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). For the analysis of Lp(a), VLDL-C, and triglyceride levels, the Mann-Whitney U test was used to evaluate differences between groups, and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare the concentrations before and after medication. For other variables, the Student t-test was used to evaluate the differences between groups, and the paired t-test was used to compare the concentrations before and after medication. The distribution of different combinations of HRT was analyzed by the &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>-test.

To our knowledge, this is the first report that directly evaluated the influence of overweight on the lipid modifying effects of HRT.</p><p>In this study, HDL-C concentrations were measured by an electrophoretic method which results in higher values than are generated by precipitation methods. Therefore, HDL-C levels in this study were higher than the values reported in most studies. The validation of this method and the comparison with classic methods were reported previously<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9)</xref>.</p><p>A great many <italic>in vitro</italic> experimental and animal investigations have shown that estrogen may delay atherosclerosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22)</xref>. A lot of clinical observational studies have also reported that ERT reduces the incidence of coronary artery disease by about 30~50%<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4)</xref>. Proposed mechanisms for this cardioprotective effect of estrogen are 1) the modification of lipid profiles, such as the reduction of LDL-C and Lp(a) levels and the elevation of HDL-C levels 2) improvement of endothelium dependent vasoreactivity through NO related processes 3) antioxidant effects, such as the inhibition of LDL oxidation and 4) others, including antithrombotic and fibrinolytic effects, changes in the smooth muscle cells and matrix, and angiogenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8)</xref>. There is a controversy regarding to the effects of progesterone. Although several clinical studies have suggested that estrogen/progesterone therapy is at least as effective as estrogen alone<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13)</xref>, many reports have shown that progesterone may negate the effects of estrogen<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11)</xref>. In this study, the effects of HRT on lipid profiles were consistent with the findings of previous reports, as LDL-C and Lp(a) levels decreased and HDL-C level increased regardless of body mass index.</p><p>A few epidemiological studies have been conducted to observe the effect of estrogen on the secondary prevention of coronary artery diseases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25)</xref>. This effect seemed to be more effective than primary prevention effect. However, these studies had inadequate designs and small numbers of cases to have statistical power. Recently, the first large-scale randomized secondary prevention trial, the Heart and Estrogen/progestin Replacement Study (HERS), was reported<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14)</xref>. After an average of 4.1 years of follow-up, there were no differences in the incidence of nonfatal myocardial infarction and coronary heart disease death between estrogen/progesterone and placebo groups in postmenopausal women with coronary artery disease. Adverse events, such as venous thromboembolism and gallbladder disease, were more frequent in the HRT group than in the placebo group. Following randomized reports, such as the Estrogen Replacement and Atherosclerosis (ERA) study with angiographic end point<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26)</xref> and the study regarding the progression of carotid intima-media thickness<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27)</xref>, supported the results of the HERS study.</p><p>Several explanations have been proposed to explain a lack of secondary prevention effects of HRT. These include inadequate duration of follow-up, the adverse effects of progesterone, advanced age of the subject women and so on<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16)</xref>. In observational studies, the HRT group tended to be relatively healthier, more educated, and of higher economic class than non-user group<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29)</xref>. Although these differences have been statistically adjusted, selection bias may remain.</p><p>Recently, another randomized controlled study, the Women Health Initiative (WHI) study, reported that HRT might be harmful to the cardiovascular system of healthy postmenopausal women. Combined therapy of 0.625 mg of CEE and 2.5 mg of MPA increased incidences of cardiovascular disease and breast cancer, and the study was stopped early.</p><p>Progesterone administered with estrogen may abolish the cardioprotective effects of estrogen in these studies. In the WHI study, an attempt to evaluate the effects of estrogen in women who have had hysterectomy is being continued because the balance of overall risks and benefits remains uncertain at an average follow-up of 5.2 years<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17)</xref>. However, in the ERA study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26)</xref>, the estrogen-only group also did not affect the progression of coronary artery lesions. In this study, the subgroup receiving only estrogen had similar changes in lipid profiles with the total population according to obesity, although these were statistically insignificant due to the small number of cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>Obesity is strongly predictive of higher incidences of coronary artery disease, stroke, and mortality<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18)</xref>. Obese people may have other risk factors including high blood pressure, dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19)</xref>. Obesity itself without these risk factors is at an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. A large proportion of patients with coronary artery disease has overweight as one of risk factors. In this study, lipid profiles in overweight women were similar to those observed in previous reports, higher levels of total cholesterol, LDL-C, VLDL-C and triglyceride. In contrast to previous results, there were no differences in HDL-C levels between the control and overweight groups. This finding may be partially explained by the exclusion of patients with diabetes mellitus in subjects. Actually, fasting blood sugar levels were similar between the two groups.</p><p>Obese postmenopausal women have higher estrone levels than lean women, because estrone is produced by the aromatization from androgen in peripheral adipose tissue<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31)</xref>. The effects of endogenous estrogen on lipid profiles were controversial in men and women<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35)</xref>. However, endogenous estrogen was associated negatively with LDL-C levels and positively with HDL-C levels in postmenopausal women<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35)</xref>. Therefore, HDL-C levels in postmenopausal women may be determined by the complex interaction of endogenous estrogen levels and obesity itself. In one report, weight reduction in obese men increased HDL-C levels and, in contrast, lowered HDL-C levels in obese women<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36)</xref>. In this study, basal HDL-C levels were similar between the two groups. This finding might result from the combination of the HDL-C lowering effect of overweight itself<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19)</xref> and the HDL-C elevating effect of high estrone levels in overweight women<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31)</xref>.</p><p>There has been only one cross-sectional study to compared the effects of HRT on lipid profiles between postmenopausal women with and without obesity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37)</xref>. Obese users of HRT had HDL-C levels similar to those of obese never users and overweight former users. However, no case-controlled studies have, to our knowledge, ever been reported previously. In this study, the effects of HRT on HDL-C levels were different between the overweight and control groups. Although HDL-C levels increased in both groups, the degree of elevation was lower in the overweight women than in the women with normal weight (10.4% vs. 17.5%, <italic>p</italic>=0.015). This difference was significant, even after adjusting for body weight changes during the follow-up period (<italic>p</italic>=0.16). Changes in LDL-C levels were similar between the two groups.</p><p>The effects of exogenous female sex hormone on HDL-C levels might be attenuated in the overweight postmenopausal women by their higher endogenous estrone levels resulting in relatively higher basal HDL-C levels. With the administration of exogenous female sex hormones, the effects of endogenous estrogen might be eliminated and the effects of overweight might become dominant. In this study, the follow-up HDL-C levels were higher in the control group than in the overweight group. However, we could not reach this conclusion because we did not measure the levels of female sex hormones, and could not analyze the relationship between endogenous female sex hormones and lipid profiles. Further study will be needed to confirm this hypothesis.</p><p>In men, both LDL-C and HDL-C are strong and independent predictors of coronary artery disease. However, HDL-C plays a more important role in the development of coronary artery disease in women<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38)</xref>. HDL-C level was the most powerful predictor of cardiovascular death except for age in the Lipid Research Clinic Follow-up Study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38)</xref>. Total cholesterol significantly increases the risk only at very high levels. LDL-C was a less powerful predictor than HDL-C or even not a significant independent factor in women<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38)</xref>. Therefore, the less elevation of HDL-C level in overweight women may attenuate the cardioprotective effects of HRT compared with women with normal body weight. Considering the frequent association of overweight with patients at high risk to develop coronary artery disease, this phenomenon may be partially associated with a lack of cardioprotective effects of HRT in primary and secondary prevention trials.</p><p>In this study, total cholesterol level decreased only in the overweight women. However, this decrease was not due to the reduction of LDL-C levels but due to the less elevation of HDL-C levels and greater reduction of VLDL-C levels. Changes in VLDL-C and triglyceride levels were in opposite directions between the two groups, increasing in the control group and decreasing in the overweight group. This finding may be partially explained by the decrease of body weight in the overweight group. Estrogen replacement therapy in postmenopausal women increases VLDL levels resulting in elevations in VLDL-C and triglyceride levels. However, these increases are not due to atherogenic lipoprotein, small dense VLDL, but to large VLDL with low density. The clinical significance of increased VLDL and triglyceride levels with HRT has not yet been established<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8)</xref>. Therefore, we do not think that these differences may significantly influence the cardioprotective effects of HRT.</p><p>In contrast to other lipids and lipoproteins, Lp(a) levels revealed a trend to be lower in the overweight group than the control group with borderline significance (<italic>p</italic>=0.078). Lp(a) levels are determined mainly by genetic background, and are not influenced by obesity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39)</xref>. Only few drugs such as niacin and HRT can decrease Lp(a) levels<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39)</xref>. So low Lp(a) levels in overweight postmenopausal women might be explained by high estrone levels as described above.</p><p>There are several limitations of this study. We retrospectively reanalyzed the data of a previous case-controlled study. This study was performed with a selected population from a single center. Therefore a prospective study including the general population may be needed to confirm the results. We suggested the possibility that endogenous estrogen might explain the different effects of HRT on HDL-C level between the control and overweight groups. However, we did not measure the levels of female sex hormones. Further study will be needed to confirm our hypothesis.</p><p>In conclusion, HRT in overweight postmenopausal women is less effective in elevating HDL-C levels than in postmenopausal women with normal body weight. As patients with coronary artery disease are frequently overweight, the favorable effects of HRT on lipid profiles in overweight postmenopausal women may not be sufficient to overcome the adverse effects. This finding might partially explain no cardioprotective effects of HRT in randomized prevention studies.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Guetta</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name><name><surname>Cannon</surname><given-names>RO</given-names><suffix>3rd</suffix></name></person-group><article-title>Cardiovascular effects of estrogen and lipid-lowering therapies in postmenopausal women</article-title><source>Circulation</source><year>1996</year><volume>93</volume><fpage>1928</fpage><lpage>1937</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">8635273</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Gerhard</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Ganz</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>How do we explain the clinical benefits of estrogen?
