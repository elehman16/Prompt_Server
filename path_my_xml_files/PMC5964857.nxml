Patients were randomized 1:1 (fingolimod 0.5 mg/day; preselected iDMT) by interactive voice-and-web-response system without blinding, followed up quarterly, and allowed one study-approved treatment switch after 12 weeks, or earlier for efficacy or safety reasons. The primary outcome was patient retention on randomized treatment over 48 weeks.

Most AEs were mild or moderate in severity, with no severe AEs reported in over 2.8% of patients. Safety outcomes for all treatments were consistent with the respective prescribing information. Macular edema (ME) was confirmed by optical coherence tomography in seven patients while on fingolimod (1.1%) and one patient on GA (0.2%). There were pre-existing risk factors in four of the seven fingolimod cases (uveitis in both eyes with inactive macular thickening; retinitis pigmentosa with macular degeneration and a legally blind left eye; astigmatism with intermittent blurred vision; controlled diabetes), and ME was bilateral in five cases. All seven patients discontinued fingolimod, and all recovered. Two patients on fingolimod (0.3%) experienced mild symptomatic bradycardia (dizziness; headache; confused state), one during first-dose monitoring, and one on study who had a history of cardiac murmur. Neither patient required treatment or discontinued fingolimod. To account for differences in exposure, rates of AEs were calculated per patient year. Thus, the proportions of patients who experienced AEs during the randomized-treatment phase on fingolimod (91.0%) and on iDMTs (82.9%) equated to rates of 4.008 and 7.011 AEs per patient year, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1756286418774338">Table 2</xref>).

Moreover, treatment satisfaction was higher with fingolimod than with iDMTs. These data indicate a generally greater tolerance and acceptance of fingolimod than of injectable therapies. Other studies, including meta-analyses and registry publications, support these findings.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-1756286418774338" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bibr15-1756286418774338" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="bibr16-1756286418774338" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="bibr27-1756286418774338" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="bibr32-1756286418774338" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup></p><p>The proportion of screening failure in PREFER<italic>MS</italic> was relatively high at 27%, although this was lower than was seen in the phase III TRANSFORMS trial of fingolimod that used similar eligibility criteria.<sup><xref rid="bibr27-1756286418774338" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> This level of exclusion may hinder generalization of the findings to all clinical settings. Also, compared with routine clinical practice, an iDMT retention rate of 29.2% at 1 year is low. Owing to prescribing restrictions during the enrollment period (June 2012&#x02013;June 2014), it is likely that some patients would not have been able to start or switch to fingolimod in a routine practice setting. Moreover, patients were aware at enrollment that they could switch to fingolimod after 12 weeks when switching for any reason became permissible. This may have biased recruitment in terms of preferred treatments or routes of administration. To address this, a sensitivity analysis excluded patients who switched treatment between weeks 11 and 16, and found that the retention rate with iDMT increased to 41.4%, but the between-group difference in retention relative to fingolimod remained highly significant. A second sensitivity analysis comparing retention rates during weeks 16&#x02013;48 found similar highly significant results. Had we surveyed study participants regarding their preference for iDMT or fingolimod prior to randomization, such information could have been helpful in interpreting the decision to switch treatment. Nonetheless, we found that factors related to tolerability and convenience appeared to have the most influence on treatment retention. Injection-related issues dominated the reasons for discontinuing iDMTs in PREFER<italic>MS</italic>; thus, the preference for oral over injectable therapy might be expected. Nonetheless, the scale of this preference in PREFER<italic>MS</italic> was striking, and suggests that many patients receiving iDMTs would choose to switch to another therapy if given the opportunity.</p><p>There were trends towards better efficacy outcomes and treatment satisfaction when initiating and remaining on fingolimod than on iDMTs (numerically fewer brain lesions, reduced BVL and cortical gray-matter loss, and greater treatment satisfaction), and such treatment effects on cortical gray-matter volume and overall BVL are clinically relevant because they correlate with effects on disability progression and cognitive impairment.<sup><xref rid="bibr28-1756286418774338" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="bibr29-1756286418774338" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="bibr35-1756286418774338" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="bibr36-1756286418774338" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> It is unexpected that cognition showed signs of improvement with fingolimod while thalamic volume on average decreased, but data were missing from both analyses so the two effects may not relate to the same subgroup of patients. Comparisons of therapeutic efficacy must acknowledge the greater treatment exposure to fingolimod than to iDMTs, and, although this did not affect the primary outcome or the adjusted safety assessments, the secondary and exploratory efficacy variables were affected. Owing to the large number of patients switching treatment, the iDMT group lost statistical power as the study proceeded, and had a shorter disease duration than the fingolimod group at last assessment. When adjusted for differences in treatment exposure, all volumetric MRI measures (total brain, gray matter, and thalamic volume loss) had decreased less with fingolimod than with iDMTs at the last assessment.</p><p>The study was open label owing to the different routes of administration in the treatment arms, and high rates of injection-related reactions complicated direct comparison of AE frequencies between treatments. Nevertheless, this design is informative in the setting wherein physicians may consider a switch to oral therapy for patients who poorly tolerate or dislike injectable medication and where payer policy allows.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-1756286418774338" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bibr5-1756286418774338" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bibr37-1756286418774338" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> In patients at a relatively early stage of RRMS, PREFER<italic>MS</italic> showed that fingolimod is associated with a higher therapy retention rate than iDMTs, and revealed trends towards greater patient satisfaction and improved clinical and MRI outcomes with fingolimod.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="section24-1756286418774338"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our findings indicate that, given the choice, many patients receiving iDMTs would consider switching to fingolimod.
