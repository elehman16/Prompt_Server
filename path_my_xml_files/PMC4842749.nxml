To determine whether medical interfered-pelvic floor muscle training and behavioral therapy can enhance the treatment effects of tolterodine on female patients with primary overactive bladder (OAB).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A total of 107 women from one center with primary overactive bladder under the treatment with tolterodine extended release tablets (5 mg once daily) were randomly divided to an experiment (E) group (interfered with pelvic floor muscle training, PFMT, three sessions per day, 15&#x02013;20 times/session, n=54), and a control (C) group (interfered with general health education, n=53). The total intervention was 3 months. Followed up after 6 months. Treatment efficacy was measured by micturition diary, Oxford pelvic floor muscle force scores, OABSS scores and patients&#x02019; subjective KHQ quality of life scores respectively at baseline, 2 weeks, 1 month and 3 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>female OAB were related to age, marriage, delivery mode and times, body mass index and chronic disease (P&#x0003c;0.05). There were no significant correlation with education level, place of residence, abortion and food habits (P&#x0003e;0.05). At 1 and 3 months, both of the groups had a decreased OABSS and KHQ scores than before. At 3 months, the E group showed an enhanced pelvic muscle force than C group (P&#x0003c;0.05), but no significant difference on OABSS scores (P&#x0003e;0.05). In quality of life, E group showed significant decrease on micturition severity, role limitations, physical/social limitations and emotions domains (P&#x0003c;0.05). At 6 months Followed up, there was a statistically significant difference of OABSS scores and KHQ scores in all ten domains between two groups (P&#x0003c;0.05).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The risk factors of female primary OAB were related to age, marriage, delivery mode and times, body mass index and chronic disease .OAB seriously affect the quality of life of patients. PFMT can significantly improve pelvic floor muscle strength, and enhance the tolterodine treatment effect. Three months short term treatment is not enough to relieve the OAB symptoms and improve the quality of life completely. Long-term (6 months) treatment can be effectively.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><title>Keywords: </title><kwd>Overactive bladder (OAB)</kwd><kwd>pelvic floor muscle training</kwd><kwd>tolterodine</kwd><kwd>treatment</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front></article>
