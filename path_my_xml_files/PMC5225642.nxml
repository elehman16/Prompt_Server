The aim of the trial was to assess the effectiveness of a multi-strategic intervention to increase implementation of a state-wide healthy canteen policy. The impact of the intervention on the energy, total fat, and sodium of children&#x02019;s canteen purchases and on schools&#x02019; canteen revenue was also assessed.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Australian primary schools with a canteen were randomised to receive a 12&#x02013;14-month, multi-strategic intervention or to a no intervention control group. The intervention sought to increase implementation of a state-wide healthy canteen policy which required schools to remove unhealthy items (classified as &#x02018;red&#x02019; or &#x02018;banned&#x02019;) from regular sale and encouraged schools to &#x02018;fill the menu&#x02019; with healthy items (classified as &#x02018;green&#x02019;). The intervention strategies included allocation of a support officer to assist with policy implementation, engagement of school principals and parent committees, consensus processes with canteen managers, training, provision of tools and resources, academic detailing, performance feedback, recognition and marketing initiatives. Data were collected at baseline (April to September, 2013) and at completion of the implementation period (November, 2014 to April, 2015).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Seventy schools participated in the trial. Relative to control, at follow-up, intervention schools were significantly more likely to have menus without &#x02018;red&#x02019; or &#x02018;banned&#x02019; items (RR&#x02009;=&#x02009;21.11; 95% CI 3.30 to 147.28; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;0.01) and to have at least 50% of menu items classified as &#x02018;green&#x02019; (RR&#x02009;=&#x02009;3.06; 95% CI 1.64 to 5.68; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;0.01). At follow-up, student purchases from intervention school canteens were significantly lower in total fat (difference&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;1.51&#x000a0;g; 95% CI &#x02212;2.84 to &#x02212;0.18; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.028) compared to controls, but not in energy (difference&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;132.32&#x000a0;kJ; 95% CI &#x02212;280.99 to 16.34; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.080) or sodium (difference&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;46.81&#x000a0;mg; 95% CI &#x02212;96.97 to 3.35; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.067). Canteen revenue did not differ significantly between groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Poor implementation of evidence-based school nutrition policies is a problem experienced by governments internationally, and one with significant implications for public health. The study makes an important contribution to the limited experimental evidence regarding strategies to improve implementation of school nutrition policies and suggests that, with multi-strategic support, implementation of healthy canteen policies can be achieved in most schools.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.anzctr.org.au/Trial/Registration/TrialReview.aspx?ACTRN=12613000311752">ACTRN12613000311752</ext-link>)</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Healthy eating</kwd><kwd>Nutrition</kwd><kwd>Canteens</kwd><kwd>School</kwd><kwd>Policy</kwd><kwd>Children</kwd><kwd>Implementation</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000923</institution-id><institution>Australian Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Linking Project Scheme (LP130101008)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wolfenden</surname><given-names>Luke</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Nutrition policies governing the availability of foods in schools have been recommended by the World Health Organization to improve child nutrition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In schools, such policies offer an opportunity to ensure that the foods made available to students comply with dietary guidelines. Systematic reviews of trials of the effectiveness of policies restricting the availability of unhealthy foods have consistently reported beneficial effects on child diet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. As such, internationally, in jurisdictions where meals provided to children as part of school food services (e.g. UK), or where foods are available for sale to children at kiosks, tuckshops or canteens (e.g. Australia), countries have announced nutrition policies governing school food availability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>Despite their popularity, research suggests that school nutrition polices are poorly implemented, limiting their potential public health impact. For example, in the USA, the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-296) required all schools participating in the National School Lunch Program to adopt and implement nutrition guidelines for all foods and beverages available at school (including competitive foods sold outside the school lunch programme) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. However, only 61% of students attend schools in a district with guidelines on competitive foods and less than 10% of middle and high school students were in a district that banned sugar sweetened beverages other than soda [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Similarly, in Australia, just 5&#x02013;35% of schools in most states comply with government healthy canteen policies with marginal improvements in policy implementation occurring over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>To maximise the public health benefits of school nutrition policies strategies are needed to overcome barriers to their implementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Research investigating strategies to facilitate the implementation of health innovations in schools, however, is limited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. An updated Agency for Health Care Policy and Research systematic review identified just one randomised trial of a school-based strategy to improve the implementation of healthy eating policies or practices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The trial reported little improvement in the provision of healthier school lunches between intervention schools who received training, technical assistance, resources and coalition building support to implement school food service guidelines, compared to control schools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>In the context of this limited evidence base, the primary aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of a multi-strategic intervention to increase implementation of a state-wide healthy canteen policy (hereafter referred to as &#x0feff;the &#x02018;policy&#x02019;). We also assessed the impact of policy implementation on the energy, total fat and sodium of children&#x02019;s canteen purchases and on canteen revenue.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p>The study was approved and the procedures monitored by the University of Newcastle Human Research Ethics Committee (Approval Number H-2008-0343) and the Hunter New England Human Research Ethics Committee (06/07/26/4.04) and was prospectively registered with Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Register ACTRN12613000311752. Full details of the study methods are published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The project was also approved by the NSW Department of Education and Communities (DEC) (#2012277).</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Context</title><p>In 2005, the New South Wales (NSW) Government launched a Healthy School Canteen Strategy (also known as <italic>Fresh Tastes @ School</italic>) to help prevent childhood obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Consistent with the Australian Dietary Guidelines for Children and Adolescents, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] the strategy classified foods sold by schools as &#x02018;red&#x02019;, &#x02018;amber&#x02019; or &#x02018;green&#x02019; based on their nutritional content. The strategy was adopted as policy by the government education department, and all government schools were mandated to remove items classified as &#x02018;red&#x02019; from regular sale. Furthermore, schools were encouraged to &#x02018;fill the menu&#x02019; with items classified as &#x02018;green&#x02019; and ensure items classified as &#x02018;amber&#x02019; did not dominate the menu. In 2007, the strategy was also supported by a ban on the sale of sugar sweetened drinks.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Design and setting</title><p>The study employed a randomised trial design. Primary schools (those catering for children aged 5&#x02013;12&#x000a0;years) in the Hunter region of NSW, Australia, with a canteen were randomised to receive a 12&#x02013;14-month, multi-strategic implementation intervention or to a no intervention control group. To assess the primary trial outcome, data were collected at baseline (April to September, 2013) and at the completion of the implementation period (November, 2014 to April, 2015) (here after referred to as &#x02018;follow-up&#x02019;). Data to assess the nutritional quality of foods purchased at the school canteen were collected at follow-up only (March to April, 2015) on a nested sample of randomly selected schools.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Participants and recruitment</title><p>Schools from the study region were randomly selected and invited to participate. To be eligible, schools were required to have an operational canteen and have either (i) one or more items on their canteen menu that was restricted for sale (&#x02018;red&#x02019; or &#x02018;banned&#x02019;) or (ii) less than 50% of menu items classified as healthy (&#x02018;green&#x02019; items). Non-government schools, schools with both primary and secondary students (i.e. central schools) and schools catering exclusively for children requiring specialist care were excluded. Recruitment continued until 70 schools provided consent for study participation. A nested sample of 50 participating schools was randomly selected, and consent was requested to perform observations to assess nutritional quality of canteen purchases.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Random allocation and blinding</title><p>Following baseline data collection, schools were randomly allocated to the intervention or control using a permuted-block randomisation procedure of seven blocks to allow for equal numbers in each study arm. Schools were stratified for socioeconomic status of school locality using the Socio-Economic Index for Area (SEIFA 2006) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and randomised (1:1) using a random number function in Microsoft Excel. Data collectors were blind, but school staff (principals and canteen managers) were informed of their group allocation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Multi-strategic intervention group</title><p>The intervention sought to increase implementation of a healthy canteen policy. Specifically, the intervention assisted schools to remove &#x02018;red&#x02019; and &#x02018;banned&#x02019; canteen menu items from regular sale and increase the availability of &#x02018;green&#x02019; menu items to more than 50% of all canteen menu items.</p><sec id="Sec8"><title>Conceptual model</title><p>The intervention was developed to address known barriers to the implementation of healthy canteen policies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The selection of intervention components was guided by the Theoretical Domains Framework [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The scientific literature was reviewed, and workshops with canteen managers, teachers and health promotion practitioners with experience in working with school canteens were undertaken to identify barriers or facilitators to policy implementation. The research team then mapped potential behaviour change techniques (implementation strategies) to barriers identified in the literature reviews and through workshops [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] which were then refined based on considerations of feasibility, potential effectiveness and context. As a result, nine implementation strategies formed the intervention.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Implementation strategies</title><sec id="FPar1"><title>Policy implementation support</title><p>Schools were allocated a support officer with qualifications in nutrition and dietetics and experience in supporting schools to implement the policy.

An inventory of the nutrient profile (including energy, total fat and sodium) of each item sold by canteens was recorded based on information provided on product labels, or for unpackaged foods, based on estimates from nutrient databases (Foodworks, version 7, Xyris Software, Highgate Hill, Australia) using ingredient lists and recipe information. The total energy (kJ), total fat (g) and sodium (mg) for each student purchase (consisting of one or more items) were calculated by combining the purchasing data with the nutrient profile of each item.</p></sec><sec id="FPar11"><title>Canteen revenue</title><p>As a measure of potential adverse effects, canteen managers and/or principals were asked to provide a copy of the canteen&#x02019;s financial records, reporting their yearly income and expenditure to enable calculation of canteen profitability. Additionally, during completion of the baseline and follow-up CATI, canteen managers were asked to report the approximate canteen revenue and profit (or loss) for the year preceding baseline data collection and the year of the intervention.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Sample size and power</title><p>The sample was powered based on the primary trial outcomes. A sample of 70 schools (35 per group) was calculated to enable the study to detect as significant an absolute change in the primary trial outcomes of 35% with 80% power, assuming a control group prevalence of 15% at follow-up and an alpha of 0.05. Given a dose response relationships between fat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and sodium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] intake and important health outcomes including precursors for chronic disease (such as blood pressure), sample size estimates for the secondary outcome of nutritional quality of canteen purchases were based on changes in energy intake between groups. Assuming 125 student canteen purchases occur daily per school, that a standard student lunch order contains 2100&#x000a0;kJ (sd&#x02009;=&#x02009;1437) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] and based on an ICC of 0.01, the participation of 40 schools (20 each arm) would enable detection of a 170-kJ difference between groups at follow-up with 80% power at the 0.05 significance level. At a population level, a reduction of this magnitude would be sufficient to avert anticipated increases in child body mass index [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Analysis</title><p>All analyses were performed in SAS 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Analyses of study outcomes were performed under an intention to treat framework. Between groups, differences in the primary outcome at follow-up were assessed using Fisher&#x02019;s exact test and presented as relative risks (with approximate 95% confidence intervals). Analyses were first performed with all available data. Sensitivity analyses were then performed using multiple imputations to test the robustness of the findings to any bias introduced by missing data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Subgroup analyses were performed to describe the impact of the intervention on primary trial outcomes by school size (number of children enrolled), where small was less than 160 students and medium/large was 160 students or greater, and the socio-economic region (derived from the SEIFA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] indices assigned to the school postcode) in which the school is located by dichotomising these variables at the median. Linear regression models were used to assess between group differences in the mean energy, fat and sodium of student purchases at follow-up for all recess and lunch purchases, adjusting for potential clustering effect. Linear regression models were used to assess differential changes in mean canteen revenue between groups over time using all available data. In instances where canteen revenue could not be obtained from financial records (profit and loss statements), canteen manager self-report of revenue was used.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Results</title><p>Of the 124 schools randomly selected, 80 returned menus which were assessed for eligibility, eight were ineligible and two refused participation; 70 provided consent and were randomly allocated to the intervention or control group (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

To our knowledge, this is the first randomised trial designed specifically to test the impact of a strategy to improve implementation of a school nutrition policy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The findings of this trial suggest that with multi-strategic support, implementation of healthy canteen policies can be achieved in the vast majority of schools (&#x0003e;70%).</p><p>The size of the intervention effect, equivalent to an absolute improvement within the intervention group of 54&#x02013;67% on the primary trial outcomes, was larger than previous non-randomised trials of interventions which have sought to enhance implementation of nutrition policies or guidelines in school or childcare food service settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The effect size was also larger than reported for strategies to support implementation of school-based health promotion programmes more broadly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], which typically increase implementation by between 13 and 45%. Despite such encouraging findings, longer-term follow-up to examine whether improvements in policy implementation are sustained in the absence of intervention support is warranted.</p><p>The findings suggest that the intervention was successful in overcoming many of the barriers that reportedly hinder nutrition policy implementation in schools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. However, the mechanism by which the intervention support strategies yielded improvements is unclear. A lack of understanding of the mechanism leading to implementation improvements has been previously identified as hindering optimization and the design of more efficient and effective implementation strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. While the design of the implementation support was informed by considerable formative evaluation and utilised a comprehensive implementation theoretical framework, an examination of the impact of the strategy on hypothesised mediators was not conducted. The development and validation of tools to measure implementation constructs suitable for use in non-clinical settings would facilitate this research in the future [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].</p><p>Concerns regarding canteen profitability are frequently cited by canteen managers as an impediment to implementation of health canteen policies given the perceived higher costs, lower profit margin and greater labour required to prepare healthy foods for sale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Increases in the proportion of canteens making a loss have also been suggested in a study by Pettigrew and colleagues following the introduction of the Western Australian Healthy Food and Drink policy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. While statistical tests did not identify a significant reduction in profits of intervention canteens relative to control, the magnitude and direction of effect suggests that further investigation into the potential for such adverse effects is warranted.</p><p>The study findings should be considered in the context of the trial methods. The trial randomly sampled from the study region to maximise school representativeness and achieved relatively high participation rates. The generalisability of the findings to other jurisdictions or schools systems required to implement alternate school-based nutrition policies, however, is unknown. Risk of bias was reduced by central randomisation to groups, allocation concealment, blinded assessment and low trial attrition. Furthermore, project records suggest a high degree of intervention fidelity for a complex public health intervention with 94% of intervention schools receiving at least six of the nine intervention strategies. Student purchase data was included as a secondary trial outcome as additional resource became available to the researchers, in a subset of schools and at post-intervention only. Student level data were included in the trial register before any post-intervention data were collected but following initiation of the trial. While the inclusion of such data enables assessment of the impact of implementation of an evidence-based policy on the nutritional value of student purchases in the &#x02018;real world&#x02019; the findings of the trial on this outcome should be considered in the context of these limitations. Missing data for assessments of canteen revenue, however, was considerable at both baseline and follow-up. As such, assessments of the impact of the intervention on canteen profits are likely to be unreliable. Finally, the trial included a relatively narrow range of potential implementation outcomes. Proctor and colleagues suggest that the inclusion of a broader range of implementation outcomes including acceptability, adoption, appropriateness, feasibility, penetration and sustainability may offer a more in-depth assessment of implementation processes and impact [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Consideration of such measures in future trials&#x000a0;is therfore warranted.</p></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Without local level implementation support, government school nutrition policies are unlikely to yield improvements in public health nutrition. Notwithstanding the trial limitations, the study provides strong evidence supporting the effectiveness of one approach to support nutrition policy implementation in schools. While effective, providing multi-strategic implementation support to large numbers of schools may represent a considerable challenge for governments. Data regarding the perceived helpfulness of support strategies included in this trial, such as performance feedback, provide some suggestions as to which strategies may be most important. Nonetheless, future research to identify which intervention support strategies are the key drivers of improved policy implementation, and means of providing such support using lower cost delivery modalities (such as via telephone or the web) may be particularly beneficial.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would also like to acknowledge the principals and canteen managers who participated in the trial.</p><sec id="FPar12"><title>Funding</title><p>This work was supported by the Australian Research Council who provided funding for the trial [LP130101008].
