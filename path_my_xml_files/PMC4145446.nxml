In Part B (dose finding), 151 patients were randomised to sirukumab (100&#x02005;mg q2w, 100&#x02005;mg q4w, 50&#x02005;mg q4w, or 25&#x02005;mg q4w) through week 24, or placebo through week 10 with crossover to sirukumab 100&#x02005;mg q2w (weeks 12&#x02013;24). The proportion of patients with an American College of Rheumatology 50 (ACR50) response and the change from baseline in the 28-joint count disease activity score using C-reactive protein (DAS28-CRP) were determined.

Different cohorts of patients were enrolled into Parts A and B. In both parts, randomisation was performed using an interactive voice response system. In order to achieve the desired assignment proportions within each stratum, defined by investigational site and weight group, an adaptive randomisation procedure with the minimisation algorithm based on biased-coin assignment<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> was used in both parts.</p><p>In the proof-of-concept Part A, patients stratified by investigational site and weight group (&#x0003c; or &#x02265;75&#x02005;kg) were randomised (1:1) to subcutaneous (SC) placebo or sirukumab 100&#x02005;mg every 2&#x02005;weeks (q2w) through week 10, followed by crossover (placebo&#x02192;sirukumab or sirukumab&#x02192;placebo) during weeks 12&#x02013;22. An interim analysis of the change from baseline in 28-joint count disease activity score using CRP (DAS28-CRP) and safety findings was conducted at week 12, and these results supported the initiation of Part B. In the dose-finding Part B, a separate cohort of patients stratified by investigational site and weight group (&#x0003c;65, 65&#x02212;85, &#x0003e;85&#x02005;kg) were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1:1) to receive SC sirukumab 100&#x02005;mg q2w, 100&#x02005;mg q4w, 50&#x02005;mg q4w, or 25&#x02005;mg q4w through week 24, or SC placebo q2w with crossover at week 12 to sirukumab 100&#x02005;mg q2w through week 24. In both parts, patients were to continue their stable baseline dose of MTX through week 24, except when dosage adjustments were required due to MTX toxicity. Patients also received a stable dose of oral folic/folinic acid (&#x02265;5&#x02005;mg/week) to reduce MTX-related toxicity.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Study assessments</title><p>In Parts A and B, the last study agent administrations occurred at weeks 22 and 24, respectively, with the final efficacy evaluations occurring at weeks 24 and 38, respectively. The primary endpoint of the study was the proportion of patients with &#x02265;50% improvement in the American College of Rheumatology criteria (ACR50 response) at week 12 in Part B. Major secondary endpoints included ACR50 response at week 12 in Part A and changes from baseline in DAS28-CRP at week 12 in Parts A and B.

Serial serum samples were collected to evaluate serum sirukumab concentrations and the presence of antibodies to sirukumab. Pharmacokinetic parameters for sirukumab were calculated using a non-compartmental analysis method implemented in WinNonlin (V.5.2.1; Pharsight Corporation, Mountain View, California, USA). Additional samples were collected to evaluate levels of CRP and fasting lipids.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>All analyses were performed separately for Parts A and B. Efficacy data were analysed by randomised treatment group. All patients who received &#x02265;1 sirukumab administration were included in the safety analysis; safety data were reported using descriptive statistics by the treatment actually received. For efficacy analyses, patients who initiated prohibited medications, increased the dose of permitted medications, or discontinued study treatment due to unsatisfactory therapeutic effect prior to week 12 in both parts were considered treatment failures. Additionally, the last observation carried forward methodology was used to impute missing postbaseline data. Patients from one site in Part A (n=5; placebo, 2; sirukumab, 3) were excluded from all efficacy, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analyses due to concerns about data integrity; however, these patients were included in the safety analysis.</p><p>Differences between each sirukumab group and the respective placebo group in Parts A and B were assessed using a Cochran&#x02013;Mantel Haenszel &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test stratified by weight (Part A: &#x0003c;75, &#x02265;75&#x02005;kg; Part B: &#x0003c;65, 65&#x02013;85, &#x0003e;85&#x02005;kg) for discrete variables and an analysis of variance on the van der Waerden normal scores stratified by weight (Part A: &#x0003c;75, &#x02265;75&#x02005;kg; Part B: &#x0003c;65, 65&#x02013;85, &#x0003e;85&#x02005;kg) for continuous variables. No multiplicity adjustment was applied for Part A. A sequential analysis was used in Part B, in which each sirukumab dose group was compared with the placebo group in the following order: 100&#x02005;mg q2w, 100&#x02005;mg q4w, 50&#x02005;mg q4w, and 25&#x02005;mg q4w.

Other sirukumab groups showed numerically greater ACR50 response rates versus placebo, although they did not achieve statistical significance. The ACR50 results were confirmed by sensitivity and subgroup analyses, and no differences were observed between geographic regions (data not shown). All four sirukumab groups had a significantly greater mean improvement in DAS28-CRP at week 12 versus placebo. Additionally at week 12, ACR20 response rates were significantly higher in the two sirukumab 100 mg groups versus placebo. Mean per cent improvements in the individual ACR core set components were numerically greater in the sirukumab groups at week 12 compared with placebo; although most differences were not significant.</p><p>Also at week 12, a greater proportion of patients in the sirukumab 100&#x02005;mg q2w group achieved a good/moderate DAS28-CRP response versus the placebo group (36.7%/56.7% vs 10.0%/50.0%, p=0.003) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ANNRHEUMDIS2013205137TB2">table 2</xref>).

Improvement in disease activity occurred as early as 2&#x02005;weeks after initiation of sirukumab treatment. The primary endpoint (ACR50 at week 12 in Part B) was achieved with sirukumab 100&#x02005;mg q2w. The differences in ACR20 and ACR50 response rates between the sirukumab groups versus placebo at week 12 (27&#x02013;54% and 16&#x02013;23%, respectively) in this study were generally broadly consistent with those achieved with the anti-IL-6 receptor antibodies tocilizumab<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>
<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> (week 16: 22&#x02013;33% and 3&#x02013;24%, respectively; week 24: 22&#x02013;33% and 20&#x02013;33%, respectively) and sarilumab<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> (week 12: 3&#x02013;26% and 7&#x02013;25%, respectively), and the anti-IL-6 antibody clazakizumab<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> (week 16: 29&#x02013;46% and 26&#x02013;35%, respectively) in patients with an inadequate response to prior MTX therapy. This suggests that blocking the ligand IL-6 conveys similar efficacy as interfering with the receptor for IL-6. Moreover, because the overall efficacy of IL-6R inhibition appears to be similar to that of TNF-inhibition,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>
<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> given that IL-6 and IL-6R inhibition appear to have similar efficacy by indirect comparison of phase II study results, it consequently may be speculated that monoclonal antibodies to IL-6 may convey similar efficacy as TNF-blockers. However, this assumption is not based on any head-to-head comparisons, and it should be noted that all these trials differed in their populations, definitions of MTX inadequate response, and non-allowance of DMARDs other than MTX. Moreover, currently no inhibitors of TNF receptors are approved and, therefore, it is not possible to compare the relative efficacy and safety of IL-6R and IL-6 inhibition with that of TNF-R and TNF inhibition, respectively.</p><p>Sirukumab rapidly suppressed CRP irrespective of dose level and maintained this suppression through 24&#x02005;weeks. In turn, significantly greater improvements in DAS28-CRP score were observed at week 12 within all sirukumab groups when compared with placebo in Parts A and B. A few patients achieved remission at week 12; more patients achieved remission by various definitions after 24&#x02005;weeks of treatment. Remission rates were highest when using the DAS28-CRP definition, which is considered to be less stringent than the CDAI, SDAI, and Boolean-based definitions.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Importantly, the week 12 timepoint is not optimal for assessing a profound response like remission, which would be expected to occur rather at 5&#x02013;6&#x02005;months.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Consistent with this expectation, remission rates for the 100&#x02005;mg doses in Part B were numerically considerably higher at week 24 than at week 12.</p><p>Notably, among patients randomised to sirukumab in Part A, clinical response following crossover to placebo was maintained through week 24, despite a sirukumab mean half-life of 2.6&#x02005;weeks. Additionally, in Part B, clinical response was maintained through 6&#x02005;weeks after the last administration, which suggests a prolonged IL-6 inhibition.</p><p>The safety profile of sirukumab in this phase II trial was consistent with phase II&#x02013;III trials of tocilizumab, sarilumab, and clazakizumab<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16&#x02013;19</xref> in patients with RA, with infections being a common AE for these therapies. No sirukumab dose effect was observed for AEs. No opportunistic infections, cases of tuberculosis, or gastrointestinal perforations occurred during the study. One death occurred (brain aneurysm) in the sirukumab 100&#x02005;mg q2w group in Part B; whether IL-6 inhibition affects aneurysmal vessel walls is not known. Two patients (1.2%) tested positive for antibodies to sirukumab.</p><p>The effects of sirukumab on laboratory investigations were similar to those of other IL-6 pathway inhibitors.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16&#x02013;19</xref> No dose response was observed for the onset or magnitude of the laboratory parameter changes. The effects of sirukumab on neutrophil and platelet counts appeared to be sustained longer with the 100&#x02005;mg q2w regimen than with the other dosing regimens. This is consistent with the degree of CRP suppression over time in the various groups.</p><p>It is currently unknown if the inhibition of IL-6 rather than the IL-6R has any advantages or disadvantages. On the other hand, IL-6 can also bind to its soluble receptor and only subsequently engage the accessory molecule gp130 on the cell surface; however, IL-6R and IL-6 blockade should be able to block this soluble IL-6-sIL-6R complex and thus prevent trans-signalling from occurring. It may be for all these reasons that the indirect, rough comparisons show similar efficacy and safety of the IL-6 and the IL-6R antibodies. Nevertheless, in theory, blocking the ligand may still allow some residual activation of the receptor complex on a background or homeostatic level, while blocking the receptor completely might shut off all types of signalling mechanisms related to IL-6.</p><p>This study demonstrates proof-of-concept that IL-6 blockade by sirukumab provides a biologic therapy for RA. Improvements in the signs and symptoms of RA were observed with all sirukumab dose regimens in this trial of patients with active RA despite MTX therapy. Sirukumab rapidly suppressed CRP and maintained this suppression for at least 4&#x02005;weeks after a single dose of 25, 50, or 100&#x02005;mg. The results suggest that IL-6 inhibitors may have a safety profile similar to that of the IL-6R inhibitor tocilizumab in blocking the effects of IL-6. Thus, to obtain further safety insights, vigilant monitoring of the possible effects of these therapies on the cardiovascular system and hepatic, haematologic and lipid parameters is mandatory. As with any new agent, the risks of sirukumab to the individual patient should be carefully weighed against the potential treatment benefits. Furthermore, while efficacy and safety results are similar in the short term, additional data will be needed to evaluate any potential differences between therapies targeting IL-6 and those that target the IL-6 receptor among patients in RA. Phase III trials of sirukumab in RA are ongoing.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Web table 1</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="annrheumdis-2013-205137-s1.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e2314" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><caption><title>Web table 2</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="annrheumdis-2013-205137-s2.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e2319" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The following investigators participated in the conduct of this study: (Hungary) Regina Cseuz, Budapest; Bernadette Rojkovich, Budapest; Ferenc Szany&#x000f3;, Gy&#x00151;r; (Japan) Yukitomo Urata, Aomori; Yoshiki Shiohira, Okinawa; Yoshiya Tanaka, Kitakyushu; Koichi Amano, Saitama; Toshihiko Hidaka, Miyazaki; Yukitaka Ueki, Nagaskai; Shuji Ohta, Hitachi-City, Ibaraki; (Mexico) Fedra Irazoque, Mexico, DF; Javier Orozco, Guadalajara, Jalisco; Sergio Gutierrez, Guadalajara, Jalisco; Hilario Avila, Guadalajara, Jalisco; Ruben Burgos, Mexico, DF; (Poland) Piotr Leszczynski, Poznan; Jan Brzezicki, Elblag; Slawomir Jeka, Bydgoszcz; Artur Racewicz, Bialystok; Mariusz Korkosz, Krakow; Barbara Grabowicz, Gdynia; Anna Filipowicz-Sosnowska, Warszawa; Anna Dudek, Warszawa; Dariusz Chudzik, Lublin; (Russia) Alexander Orlov-Morozov, Moscow; Alexey Maslyanskiy, St Petersburg; Eugeny Nasonov, Moscow; Valery Shirinsky, Novosibirsk; Elena Ilivanova, St Petersburg; Tatyana Raskina, Kemerovo; (South Korea) Ho-Youn Kim, Seoul; Seung Cheol Shim, Daejeon; Young Mo Kang, Daegu; (USA) Thomas W Littlejohn, Winston Salem, NC; Amir Agha, Anderson, SC; Jane Box, Charlotte, NC; Frederick T Murphy, Duncansville, PA; Norman B Gaylis, Aventura, FL; Trial coordinators: Sheila Patil, Teresa Piperno, Patrick Gallagher (Janssen Research &#x00026; Development, LLC).
