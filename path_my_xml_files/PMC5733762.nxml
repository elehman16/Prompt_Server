Introduction</title><p>The clinical phenotype refers to disease characteristics associated with clinical manifestations such as symptoms, acute exacerbation, treatment response, disease progression, and death that can reflect the differences among COPD patients [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and has constituted a hot research topic for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in recent years. Phenotypic identification not only helps understand the differences between COPD types, but also more importantly has potential diagnostic and therapeutic significance; in addition, it can better reflect the heterogeneity of COPD, prompting a more comprehensive and in-depth research in COPD. According to the relationship between the clinical course of COPD and prognosis, as well as the different responses of currently available treatment methods, three phenotypes can be distinguished, including frequent exacerbator phenotype, COPD-asthma overlap, and emphysema-airway hyperresponsiveness [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The frequent exacerbator phenotype is the most frequently encountered in COPD patients; it occurs not only in the severe phase of COPD, but also in 22% of patients with GOLD grade 2 disease [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The frequent exacerbator phenotype in COPD refers to patients with more than two yearly disease episodes, with oral administration of glucocorticoids and/or antibiotics needed each time, or those requiring hospitalization [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The pathophysiology underlying the frequent exacerbator phenotype is complex, with increased airway and systemic inflammation, dynamic lung hyperinflation, changes in the bacterial colonization lower airways, and a possible increased susceptibility to viral infections. Patients with the frequent exacerbator phenotype are also at increased risk of comorbid extrapulmonary diseases, including cardiovascular disease, gastroesophageal reflux, depression, osteoporosis, and cognitive impairment. Overall, these patients have poorer health status, accelerated loss of forced expiratory volume over 1s (FEV1), worsened quality of life, and increased hospital admissions and mortality, contributing to increased exacerbation susceptibility and perpetuation of the frequent exacerbator phenotype [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Therefore, the frequent exacerbator phenotype in COPD is well worthy of special attention from clinicians and scientists.</p><p>A previous research demonstrated that [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Yi Qi Gu Biao pill can prolong the interval of acute exacerbation in COPD patients by 77.68 days, while reducing the number of acute exacerbations by 1.42/6 months. Moreover, its therapeutic effects are consistent with the main treatment purpose for the frequent exacerbator phenotype in COPD, that is, reduction of the number of acute exacerbations. Therefore, this randomized controlled study assessed the efficacy and safety of Yi Qi Gu Biao pill in treating the frequent exacerbator phenotype in COPD (lung and spleen qi deficiency syndrome) [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>2.

The CAT questionnaire comprises a total of eight questions, including cough, sputum, chest tightness, the feeling of climbing or climbing a staircase, housework, degree of confidence away from home, sleep, and energy. The score for each question from mild to severe disease was 0&#x02013;5 points; the total score was calculated after scoring each question by the patients, and CAT scores ranged between 0 and 40 points. Upon definite diagnosis, the same researcher explained the questionnaire contents and the scoring method to the patients. The patients filled the questionnaire independently without reminder.

Discussion</title><p>COPD prevalence is 8.2% in the subpopulation above 40 years old in the seven provinces in China [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and 13.4% in Korea [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. COPD is an important cause of disability and death worldwide, imposing huge and growing economic and social burden to mankind [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Therefore, how to effectively control COPD has become a major public health problem that needs urgent solution. COPD is a disorder of progressive airflow limitation caused by chronic inflammation of the airways and lung parenchyma; it is associated with symptoms such as cough, sputum production, and dyspnea [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, the risk of acute exacerbation in COPD patients with symptoms of chronic cough and sputum is increased by 4.15 times, with the risk of hospitalization due to acute exacerbation increasing by 4.08 times [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Meanwhile, increasing symptom burden is associated with higher health care resource utilization with a detrimental impact on work productivity [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Therefore, symptomatic treatment has a great clinical appeal for COPD patients. However, treatment according to syndrome difference based on the four diagnostic principles of &#x0201c;diagnosis through observation, diagnosis through auscultation and olfaction, diagnosis through inquiry, and diagnosis through pulse feeling&#x0201d; is the characteristic and one of the advantages of traditional Chinese medicine.</p><p>The Yi Qi Gu Biao pill, a compound preparation including Chinese herbs (<italic>Salvia miltiorrhiza </italic>Bunge, Blighted wheat,<italic> Atractylodes macrocephala </italic>Koidz,<italic> Pinellia ternate, Citrus reticulata </italic>Blanco,<italic> Perilla frutescens </italic>(L.)

Stapf,<italic> Tussilago farfara </italic>L.,<italic> Scutellaria baicalensis </italic>Georgi,<italic> Fritillaria cirrhosa </italic>D. Don, and<italic> Eriobotrya japonica </italic>(Thunb.) Lindl.) is used to treat COPD at a stable stage. We found that the Yi Qi Gu Biao pill improves the quality of life of COPD patients at a stable stage, reducing the number of annual acute exacerbation events [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. COPD is a publicly recognized heterogeneous disease, with therapeutic responses greatly differing even for patients with the same symptoms and drugs [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Based on a previous study, to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the Yi Qi Gu Biao pill for treating the frequent exacerbator phenotype in COPD (lung and spleen qi deficiency syndrome), we conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled superiority trial. This study only included the exacerbator phenotype in COPD (lung and spleen qi deficiency syndrome), as subjects to obtain a small sample size in order to standardize the group homogeneity of TCM syndrome differentiation and further clarify the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of the Yi Qi Gu Biao pill.</p><p>The Yi Qi Gu Biao pill had little impact on pulmonary function in patients with the exacerbator phenotype in COPD (lung and spleen qi deficiency syndrome), with equivalent efficacy with the Pb during the 3 months of treatment. However, FVC values after two and three months of treatment with Yi Qi Gu Biao pill were increased compared with pretreatment counterparts. Changes of pulmonary function parameters before and after the treatment were not significant. There were no statistically significant differences in the changes of pulmonary function parameters between the two groups after treatment with Yi Qi Gu Biao pill.</p><p>Research showed that wheezing correlated with a higher possibility of acute exacerbation. Even among those who were treated according to the GOLD 2011 guidelines, patients with wheezing still had worse symptom scores and more exacerbations. Our study showed that wheezing symptom scores one month after treatment with Yi Qi Gu Biao pill were improved compared with those of the Pb group. Meanwhile, cough, sputum, and wheezing scores after one month of treatment with the Yi Qi Gu Biao pill were improved compared to pretreatment values. However, in the Pb group the cough, sputum, and wheezing scores did not improve until the third month suggesting that Yi Qi Gu Biao pill can cooperate with Western medicine to shorten the duration of cough, sputum, and wheezing symptoms in frequent exacerbator phenotype in COPD.</p><p>COPD assessment test (CAT) is a new health-related scale evaluating the health status of COPD patients [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], mainly for COPD patients at a stable stage [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. After three months of treatment with the Yi Qi Gu Biao pill, CAT scores were reduced compared with the Pb group, indicating that prolonged and sustained administration of the drug is required for its effects of improving syndrome scores and the health status of patients (&#x02265;2 months). Interestingly, Yi Qi Gu Biao pill could improve CAT scores after one month, as demonstrated by comparing pretreatment values with those after treatment. However, the degree of improvement varied, as reflected in differences between the two groups before and after the treatment; this means three months of treatment with the Yi Qi Gu Biao pill results in a higher degree of improvement of CAT scores compared with Pb administration.</p><p>Improvement of TCM syndrome in the patients was better than Pb group at 1 and 3 months after treatment with the Yi Qi Gu Biao pill. Interestingly, TCM syndrome scores were improved compared with pretreatment values, after one month of treatment with the Yi Qi Gu Biao pill. However, such difference occurred in the Pb group only after two months of treatment.</p><p>Substantial placebo effect sizes have been documented for at least 50 years for various psychiatric symptoms [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Previous systematic reviews and meta-analyses have found placebo effect sizes that were inconsistent between studies and that have increased over time [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Findings [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] indicate that interactions between personality type and environmental cues may contribute to placebo responding. So, placebo effects, including patient's cognition, expectation, attention, preference, and communication with doctor as well as doctor's suggestion, expectation, and indirect regulation of diagnosis and treatment environment on patient's psychology, were essential factors for therapy efficacy. So, in this study, it showed improvements within the placebo groups.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>5.
