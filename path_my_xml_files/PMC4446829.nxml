Hypertension is influenced by maternal behavior, such as physical activity. Physical activity is associated with better outcomes for mother and fetus, besides healthier weight gains during pregnancy. Few women are physically active during pregnancy and few clinical trials have been carried out with pregnant women. The aim of this paper is to describe the protocol of a controlled trial evaluating whether regular exercise during pregnancy may result in improved maternal-child health and neonatal outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>The PAMELA (Physical Activity for Mothers Enrolled in Longitudinal Analysis) trial is a randomized controlled trial nested in a birth cohort study. Eligible women belonging to the birth cohort will be invited (between the 16th and 20th week of gestation) to enroll in the trial. Baseline data (blood and urine samples, anthropometry and pulmonary function) will be collected at enrollment. The same assessments will be repeated eight and 16&#x000a0;weeks after baseline. After randomization, women will be allocated into either one of these groups: control, 426 women who will be advised to keep their usual daily activities; and intervention, 213 women who will engage in an exercise program, three sessions a week. At least 70&#x000a0;% attendance over 16&#x000a0;weeks will be required to be considered compliant to the intervention. Exercise protocol will include aerobics, strength and flexibility training. Maternal and child outcomes will be measured at the 36th week of gestation, at birth and at three, 12, 24 and 48&#x000a0;months postpartum. An intention-to-treat analysis will be performed.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Few women are active during pregnancy and a vast majority decrease their activities or even quit exercising. We present a population-based regular exercise intervention focused on the prevention of hypertension, pre-eclampsia and preterm birth. Data on the underlying cohort will allow future analysis using different outcomes with low probability of recall bias or misclassification of exposure status. Results will potentially influence prenatal care counseling in regards to physical activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02148965">NCT02148965</ext-link>, registered on 22 May 2014.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Exercise</kwd><kwd>Motor activity</kwd><kwd>Randomized controlled trial</kwd><kwd>Pregnancy</kwd><kwd>Infant premature</kwd><kwd>Cohort studies</kwd><kwd>Newborn</kwd><kwd>Gestational diabetes</kwd><kwd>Pre-eclampsia</kwd><kwd>Postpartum depression</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>The World Health Organization estimates that over 10&#x000a0;% of births worldwide are preterm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Based on previous population studies in the city of Pelotas (Brazil), the preterm birth rate is increasing (from 6.3 to 14.7&#x000a0;% between 1982 and 2004) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Preterm birth is associated with most cases of neonatal deaths and negative consequences throughout childhood and adult life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>Among the strongest predictors of preterm birth are hypertensive disorders of pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Evidence suggests that preterm birth and gestational hypertension risk may be altered by regular leisure-time physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The potential hypothesis for such a mechanism is based on reduction in blood pressure, improvement in blood lipids profile, reduced oxidative stress and inflammation reduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Studies also have shown that leisure-time physical activity during pregnancy is associated with lower risk of excessive weight gain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and better psychological health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Although evidence supports the benefits of physical activity during pregnancy, few women in Brazil are active during gestation, and the level of leisure-time activity decreases as pregnancy advances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Further, the effect of physical activity on mother-child health outcomes is not fully understood.</p><p>With respect to different outcomes, such as diabetes, trials during pregnancy do not provide enough evidence that exercise is effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The main goal of conducting a trial in the Brazilian population is because physical activity among Brazilian women is highly associated with socioeconomic status and other characteristics not easily controlled statistically during analysis. This trial will allow for the balance of such potential confounders, as we are using a population-based sample and random allocation. Moreover, few experimental studies have been carried out to study such associations in large samples.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Rationale</title><p>Although early studies on the effects of leisure-time physical activity during pregnancy were concerned about potential harmful effects to the health of the mother and the fetus, these have not been proven over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Current guidelines suggest that pregnant women should engage in at least 30&#x000a0;min of moderate-intensity physical activity on most, if not all days of the week, in the absence of medical or obstetric complications, in agreement with the recommendations for healthy adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>Today, there is growing evidence supporting the association of safe physical activity during pregnancy with benefits to maternal and child health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. However, most of the scientific evidence derives from observational studies, and there is a need for well-designed experimental studies that enable a better understanding on the impact of exercise during pregnancy on various maternal and mother-child health outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Aim</title><p>The aim of this study is to present the experimental protocol of a trial aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of an exercise intervention, by comparing the intervention and control groups with infant outcomes assessed later in life. Data will be collected on: prematurity, gestational age, gestational weight gain, blood pressure, fasting blood glucose, postpartum weight retention, postpartum depression and birth weight.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Study design</title><p>A randomized controlled trial will be carried out and eligible women will be sampled from the 2015 Pelotas (Brazil) Birth Cohort Study. Currently three birth cohorts (1982, 1993 and 2004) are ongoing in the city of Pelotas (southern Brazil), each with more than 4,000 subjects that were enrolled soon after birth (at hospital). The 2015 Pelotas Birth Cohort Study recruits pregnant women from health services to begin gathering data prospectively during the prenatal period. More than 3,500 women are expected to be included in the study, providing information on several health-related aspects. All women with an expected delivery date from 1 January to 31 December 2015 are eligible to be included in the cohort.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Ethical considerations</title><p>The clinical trial protocol and the 2015 Pelotas Birth Cohort Study were submitted to the Physical Education School Ethics Committee and were approved under the numbers 649.244 and 522.064, respectively. Also, the following procedures will be followed: Participation in the study will only occur only after reading and signing the consent form; All women will be guaranteed the right to not participate in the study; We will ensure confidentiality of the collected data and document numbers (identifications, used to link databases); and Women presenting health problems during the study will be referred to appropriate health services.</p><p>The study is also registered on the Clinicaltrials.gov website under the registry number NCT02148965, entitled&#x02019;Effects of exercise during pregnancy on maternal and child health: a randomized clinical trial (PAMELA)&#x02019;.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Recruitment and participants</title><p>All locations where pregnant women would potentially seek assistance during pregnancy, such as medical laboratories, ultrasound clinics, polyclinics, public primary health units, hospitals, university clinics and private obstetric and/or gynecological clinics, are being visited daily since April 2014 to identify eligible women.

The randomization process will be done in blocks of nine women using random software sampling. Each block will therefore result in the allocation of three women for the intervention and six women for the control group, ensuring a recruitment balance of 1:2 throughout the study. This ratio was chosen as it would minimize costs and behavioral changes in women from the remaining cohort, whilst assuring that statistical power would be unaffected. As the cohort is an observational study, our option was to expose the lowest possible number of women to the intervention. After randomization, women will be allocated into either one of these groups: control, 426 women who will keep their usual daily activities; and intervention, 213 women who will engage in a physical activity program, three sessions a week.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Exclusion criteria</title><p>During the first contact, women will be interviewed about several aspects of their overall health, and those presenting any of the conditions described in the Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> will not be eligible for the trial.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Exclusion criteria of the randomized controlled trial</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Exclusion criteria</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Age</td><td>Below 18&#x000a0;years</td></tr><tr><td>Hypertension</td><td>Diagnosed before pregnancy/Self-reported</td></tr><tr><td>Diabetes</td><td>Diagnosed before pregnancy/Self-reported</td></tr><tr><td>Preterm birth</td><td>History of previous preterm birth</td></tr><tr><td>Miscarriage</td><td>History of previous miscarriage</td></tr><tr><td>Heart disease</td><td>Diagnosed before pregnancy/Self-reported</td></tr><tr><td>

As physical activity is considered a behavioral aspect of living, changes are not easily made, despite knowledge accumulation. During pregnancy, literature shows that even those women who were previously active decrease their activities, or even quit exercising [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. This is the first large exercise intervention during pregnancy in Brazil, especially using a population-based sample. If our hypothesis is confirmed, the results of the study will be potentially used routinely to counsel pregnant women during prenatal care about physical activity during pregnancy.</p><p>Among the strengths of our study, we highlight that several efforts will be made to improve attendance to the program, such as free transportation to and from the intervention setting and material incentives (athletic apparel from the study organization). Also, our intervention program includes three weekly sessions of exercise, with a large sample size, which is not commonly found in the literature. The main limitation of any behavioral controlled trial is with respect to the exposure, especially in the control group, because we cannot guarantee that these women will not be exposed in their daily lives to some level of physical activity. However, based on previous data from this population, we know that the prevalence of regular leisure-time physical activity during pregnancy is extremely low (below 15&#x000a0;%) and, as we excluded from the randomization women who were previously active, we believe that the number of active women in the control group will not bias the study or lead to any kind of misclassification.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Trial status</title><p>Participant recruitment for this trial is ongoing.
