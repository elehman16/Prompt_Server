More than 350 million people are chronically infected with HBV throughout the world.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup> Patients with HBV infection are at risk of progressing to long-term complications, including cirrhosis of the liver, decompensated liver disease, and/or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Approximately 93 million people are chronic HBV (CHB) carriers in China, and 300,000 individuals die from chronic disease every year.<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup></p><p>Interferon (IFN) and several nucleoside/nucleotide analogs (NAs) are currently approved for the treatment of CHB in several countries. Moreover, pegylated interferon (peg-IFN) alfa-2a (40&#x0200a;kD) and NAs are recommended by treatment guidelines as a first-line therapy for CHB. However, a 48-week course of peg-IFN alfa-2a treatment only results in sustained immune control in 36% of HBeAg-positive patients.<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> After the completion of peg-IFN treatment, the response rates among HBeAg-positive patients were 13%, 25%, 14%, 21%, and 21% at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years, respectively.<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> Thus, the HBeAg seroconversion rate and the HBsAg loss rate of peg-IFN remain low. In contrast, NAs have high rates of suppression of viral replication in HBeAg-positive CHB patients but rarely lead to sustained HBeAg or HBsAg loss or seroconversion.<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> Although ADV was not recommended as a first-line treatment, ADV is widely used in most Asian countries for nucleos (t)ide-na&#x000ef;ve Asian CHB patients owing to low cost and easy availability. Entecavir (ETV) is superior to adefovir (ADV) for decreasing serum HBV-DNA and normalizing the alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level but is similar to ADV for clearing HBeAgs and favoring HBeAg seroconversion for HBeAg-positive NA-na&#x000ef;ve Asian patients with CHB.<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup> Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) demonstrated superiority over ADV with respect to the primary endpoint of viral suppression in both HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative patients. However, the proportions of HBeAg loss and HBeAg seroconversion at week 48 were similar. In a word, combination therapy of PEG-INF-&#x003b1;2a and ADV may be a good plan for the CHB patients in the countries with limited health resources, which can improve overall response rates.</p><p>In our previous peg-IFN alfa-2a and ADV combination studies, the addition of ADV to PEG-INF-&#x003b1;2a at week 24 improved the inhibition of HBV DNA in CHB patients who were HBeAg-positive, and the level of HBsAg at l2 and 24 weeks was a predictor used to evaluate the efficacy of combination therapy. However, the rates of HBeAg loss and HBeAg seroconversion were not improved compared to PEG-INF-&#x003b1;2a monotherapy.<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup> Takkenberg et al<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup> reported the results of combination therapy with peg-IFN and ADV for 48 weeks and showed a high rate of HBeAg loss (41%) and HBsAg loss (11%) in HBeAg-positive patients after the end of treatment (EOT). However, in these studies, combination therapy was stared at week 0 and compared to peg-IFN&#x003b1;-2a monotherapy. To date, no reports have described the efficacy and safety of PEG-INF-&#x003b1;2a therapy with ADV started at different time points (week 0, 12, and 24).</p><p>To explore the optimal time to begin combination treatment with PEG-INF-&#x003b1;2a and ADV in HBeAg-positive, treatment-na&#x000ef;ve CHB patients, we compared the efficacy and safety of 48 weeks of treatment with PEG-INF-&#x003b1;2a monotherapy to treatment with PEG-INF-&#x003b1;2a combined with ADV therapy added at weeks 0, 12, and 24.</p></sec><sec><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec><label>2.1</label><title>Study population</title><p>This was an open-labeled pilot study performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.

Eligible patients were randomized into 4 treatment groups. Randomization was centralized, and a patient identification number assigned by the randomization system was used to allocate the patients to treatment groups. Patients in the PEG-INF-&#x003b1;2a monotherapy group received 135&#x0200a;&#x003bc;g of peg-IFN alfa-2a (Pegasys,F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd., Basel, Switzerland) by subcutaneous injection once weekly for 48 weeks (group A). Patients in the ADV add-on group received 135&#x0200a;&#x003bc;g of PEG-INF-&#x003b1;2a subcutaneously once weekly for 48 weeks and were divided into 3 groups according to the ADV add-on time (group B, ADV add-on at week 0; group C, ADV add-on at week 12; and group D, ADV add-on at week 24). These patients received 10&#x0200a;mg of ADV (GelanSushike [Tianjin] Co., Ltd, China) administered once daily (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). All patients were followed for 48 weeks. Routine blood tests were performed each month. HBV DNA, HBsAg, HBeAg, and hepatitis B e antibody levels were determined every 4 to 8 weeks. The efficacy parameters were the EOT viral and biochemical responses. Responses were determined at week 12 (ADV add-on), the EOT for PEG-INF-&#x003b1;2a (48 weeks) and ADV, and at the end of 96 weeks of follow-up (EOF). The biochemical response was defined as the normalization of ALT levels. Viral responses included the HBV DNA loss rate, HBeAg seroconversion rate, and HBsAg loss rate. Response definitions were previously described in detail.<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup></p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Study design.

Peg-IFN produces viral suppression and immunemodulatory activity simultaneously. The favorable meta-analysis outcomes of peg-IFN include the sustained suppression of viral replication and HBeAg seroconversion.<sup>[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup> However, the rate of HBeAg seroconversion remains low. Combining ADV and peg-IFN may be a logical approach because they activate different mechanisms to control HBeAg-positive CHB. A series of previous studies with thorough viral analyses showed that the combination of ADV and peg-IFN induced a higher viral response but with differences in the rate of HBeAg seroconversion and HBsAg loss.<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup> Interestingly, these studies selected the beginning of treatment as the time of combination of PEG-INF-&#x003b1;2a and ADV. Based on current knowledge and previous studies, this study compared the efficacy and safety of 48 weeks of combination treatment with PEG-INF-&#x003b1;2a and ADV (with ADV started at different time points) with PEG-INF-&#x003b1;2a monotherapy.</p><p>In our study, a greater proportion of patients in the combination therapy group than in the monotherapy group achieved HBV DNA loss at week 48, the EOT, and the EOF. Despite the more pronounced on-treatment suppression of HBV DNA in the combination therapy group compared to PEG-INF-&#x003b1;2a monotherapy, the rates of HBV DNA loss were similar in all 3 combination therapy groups at the different endpoints. This finding is consistent with previous reports of HBV DNA kinetics in combination studies of lamivudine, ADV, or ETV with PEG-INF-&#x003b1;2a monotherapy.<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup> Recently, Gu etal<sup>[<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup> observed that combination therapy of adefovir dipivoxil and PEG-INF-&#x003b1;2b also achieved higher HBV DNA uncertainty rate than the group treated with adefovir dipivoxil only at the 12<sup>th</sup>, 24<sup>th</sup>, 36<sup>th</sup>, and 48th week. Because these 2 drugs have different function mechanisms and combination of them can produce coordination or superimposed effect, the higher rate of HBV DNA loss in the combination therapy group is not difficult to understand. Interestingly, we found that patients treated with peg-IFN and ADV add-on at week 12 (group C) achieved a significantly higher rate of HBV DNA loss than the other combination treatment groups (ADV add-on at week 0 or 24). At the EOT and EOF, the HBV DNA loss rates were 87.5% and 71.9%, respectively, in the patients assigned to the group with ADV add-on at week 12. Our result suggests that ADV add-on at week 12 may lead to a higher proportion of HBV DNA loss than the other ADV add-on times. Zheng et al's<sup>[<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup> study observed that total intrahepatic HBV-DNA and cccDNA had significantly decreased after 12 weeks of ADV treatment; meanwhile, HBV-specific IFN-&#x003b3;-producing CD4+ T cells were greatly enhanced and reached the highest level at week 12 with viral load reduction and the level was further increased between week 36 and week 48. So, patients treated with peg-IFN and ADV add-on at week 12 achieved a significantly higher rate of HBV DNA loss because of strengthening and improving of immune response.</p><p>Previous study<sup>[<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup> confirmed that ADV was attributed not only to their direct effect on HBV suppression but also to their immune regulatory capabilities. ADV treatment can increase IFN-&#x003b3; production by CD4+T cells, which was related to the reduction of HBeAg,levels.<sup>[<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup> Some clinical studies also suggested that combination therapy with peg-IFN and ADV for 48 weeks led to a marked decrease in both serum HBV DNA and the rate of HBeAg seroconversion (53%) compared to treatment with peg-IFN alone. Moreover, after 96 weeks of ADV monotherapy, the HBeAg loss was 80%.<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</sup> However, the rates of HBeAg seroconversion and HBsAg loss at week 48, theEOT, and the EOF were not superior to the addition of ADV compared to PEG-INF-&#x003b1;2a monotherapy in the present study. These findings support previous data, which show that combining PEG-INF-&#x003b1;2a with lamivudine<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> or ETV<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup> does not increase the post-treatment efficacy of PEG-INF-&#x003b1;2a. In our study, 46.9% of patients in the ADV 12 week add-on combination therapy group and 28.1% of patients in the monotherapy group showed HBeAg seroconversion at the EOT. We found that patients with ADV add-on at week 12 (group C)achieved a higher rate of HBeAg seroconversion (50%), but no significant differences were found. This discrepancy may be related to the relatively small size of our studied population. In our study, the rates of HBsAg loss in the combination therapy group were 12.1%, 15.6%, and 9.4% for ADV add-on at weeks0, 12, and 24, respectively, whereas a rate of 6.3% was observed in the monotherapy group. This result is consistent with previous reports. However, we found a significant trend for the group that received ADV add-on at week 12 at the EOF.</p><p>In our study, compared to the monotherapy group, the ALT normalization rate was similar in the combination groups at 48 weeks of peg-IFN treatment and at the EOF. Some studies<sup>[<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup> have reported that the ALT normalization rate after treatment was higher in the combination group. A meta-analysis also indicated that peg-IFN and ADV combination therapy is superior to IFN-a monotherapy for normalizing the ALT level.<sup>[<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</sup> Our results only demonstrated a difference between the combination groups and the PEG-INF-&#x003b1;2a monotherapy group at the EOT. This discrepancy may be related to the relatively small size of our studied population or biochemical changes after the EOT.</p><p>Regarding safety, ADV add-on was generally well tolerated without unexpected adverse effects. The safety profiles of PEG-INF-&#x003b1;2a monotherapy and combination therapy with PEG-INF-&#x003b1;2a and ADV were similar to those reported previously in other PEG-INF-&#x003b1;2a and NA combination therapy studies. No unexpected adverse effects were reported.<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</sup></p><p>The limitations of this study are that the study period was only 96 weeks; a longer time could provide additional insights. In addition, the number of patients evaluated for treatment efficacy was relatively small. Furthermore, HBV genotype data were not collected. Previous studies suggest that HBsAg kinetics and rates of HBeAg seroconversion vary by HBV genotype.<sup>[<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</sup></p><p>In conclusion, PEG-INF-&#x003b1;2a and ADV combination therapy was safe and superior to PEG-INF-&#x003b1;2a monotherapy for decreasing serum HBV DNA and normalizing the ALT level. However, patients in all treatment groups had similar rates of HBeAg seroconversion and HBsAg loss at the EOF. The addition of ADV at week 12 produced a significantly better response and may be the optimal combination time.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors would like to thank Lubiao Chen, Xingfei Pan, Li Mai, Ying Yan, and Hong Deng for their contributions tothis work.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations: ADV = adefovir dipivoxil, ALT = alanineaminotransferase, CHB = chronic hepatitis B, EOF = the end of follow-up, EOT = the end of treatment, ETV = entecavir, HBeAg = hepatitis B virus e antigen, HBsAg = hepatitis B virus surface antigen, HBV = hepatitis B virus, HBV = hepatitis Bvirus, PEG-IFN = pegylated interferon, TDF = tenofovir disoproxil fumarate.</p></fn><fn fn-type="equal"><p>KZ and HC contributed equally to this work.</p></fn><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p>Financial Support: This work was supported by research grants from a project supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 81500462) and the Medical Research Fund of Guangdong Pharmaceutical Association (Grant Nos. 2012GRS01 and 2013GRS06).
