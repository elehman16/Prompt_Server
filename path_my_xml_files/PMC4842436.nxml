multiple sclerosis patients. [Subjects and Methods] Twenty multiple sclerosis patients
were enrolled in this study. The participants were divided into two groups as the clinical
Pilates and control groups. Cognition (Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite), balance
(Berg Balance Scale), physical performance (timed performance tests, Timed up and go
test), tiredness (Modified Fatigue Impact scale), depression (Beck Depression Inventory),
and quality of life (Multiple Sclerosis International Quality of Life Questionnaire) were
measured before and after treatment in all participants. [Results] There were
statistically significant differences in balance, timed performance, tiredness and
Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite tests between before and after treatment in the
clinical Pilates group. We also found significant differences in timed performance tests,
the Timed up and go test and the Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite between before
and after treatment in the control group. According to the difference analyses, there were
significant differences in Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite and Multiple Sclerosis
International Quality of Life Questionnaire scores between the two groups in favor of the
clinical Pilates group. There were statistically significant clinical differences in favor
of the clinical Pilates group in comparison of measurements between the groups. Clinical
Pilates improved cognitive functions and quality of life compared with traditional
exercise. [Conclusion] In Multiple Sclerosis treatment, clinical Pilates should be used as
a holistic approach by physical therapists.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Multiple sclerosis</kwd><kwd>Clinical Pilates</kwd><kwd>Cognition</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory, neurodegenerative disease of the central
nervous system that results in demyelination and transaction of axons in the brain, spinal
cord, and optic nerves<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Due to the
changing distribution throughout central nervous system demyelination in MS, many different
symptoms like fatigue, weakness, posture, and movement and cognitive disorders can be seen.
Exercise is used in the treatment of MS patients.</p><p>Effects of exercise on function and quality of life have been examined in MS, and previous
studies have recorded significant improvements in muscle strength, exercise tolerance and
mobility levels in MS patients performing exercise<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. The majority of studies in literature were conducted in the area of
strengthening and aerobic exercises.</p><p>Clinical Pilates is an exercise model that has become very popular in recent years and it
has beneficial effects on both ore stabilization and the whole body. Clinical Pilates is
different from other exercise programs, as it includes respiratory component. A
meta-analysis of clinical Pilates performed in healthy individuals revealed that clinical
Pilates appeared to be effective in improving flexibility (strong evidence), dynamic balance
(strong evidence), and muscular endurance (moderate evidence) in healthy people<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Core stabilization in terms of maintaining
functional independence is very important in MS. Clinical Pilates-based exercise
incorporates the principles of trunk stability, which is also referred to as core stability
or core control<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>There are only a few studies in the literature concerning clinical Pilates in MS. Clinical
studies in the literature have examined the impact of Pilates on physical parameters such as
balance, mobility, and strength in patients with MS<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, there are no studies in the literature that have
investigated the effects of clinical Pilates on cognitive function and quality of life as
well as physical parameters. In this respect, the present study carries the distinction of
being the first.</p><p>The aim of this study was to analyze the effects of clinical Pilates on body control,
balance, quality of life, fatigue, and cognition in MS patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>In the current study, 37 MS patients living in Izmir were recruited. There were no changes
in the medication regimes of the MS patients during the survey period.</p><p>The inclusion criteria were as follows: over 18&#x02005;years of age, diagnosed with MS, an
Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of six or lower, and able to act, or move

Thirty-seven MS patients originally agreed to participate in the study, but
17 dropped out of the study due to health, transportation, or other problems. Among the 20
MS patients who completed the study, 65% (n=13) were female and 34% (n=7) were male (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Flowchart of the study</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jpts-28-761-g001"/></fig>).</p><p>Participants were randomly assigned to two groups, the clinical Pilates (n=11) and the
control group (traditional exercise program; n=9). Randomization was performed by the card
method (red or blue card). Patients were given two days of exercise training per week for a
total of eight weeks. In order to understand the rate of benefit related to clinical Pilates
in terms of cognition, disability, balance, coordination, mobility, physical performance,
fatigue, depression, and quality of life, relevant measurements were conducted. All
measurements were repeated before and after eight weeks of treatment.</p><p>The study was approved by the Local Ethics Committee (date, 16.01.2014, protocol number,
1287-GOA and decision number, 2014/03-19). Written informed consent was obtained from all
patients who participated in the study.</p><p>The Pilates key elements were taught to the patients before the clinical Pilates exercise
lessons. These key elements were breathing, focus, and placement of the rib cage, shoulder,
head, and neck. All Pilates movements were checked, and necessary corrections were made by a
physical therapist during Pilates exercise sessions. The exercises were repeated 8&#x02013;10 times.
When the Pilates exercises could be done by the patients with maintaining the key elements,
the level of exercise was increased. Exercises were started with closed chain exercises, and
advanced to open chain exercises. On the other hand, exercises started at level 1 and
advanced to level 3. The exercises were studied as group exercises. Each exercise session
was planned to be 45&#x02013;60 minutes long. Each session was comprised of a 10&#x02005;min warm-up,
25&#x02013;45&#x02005;min of mat exercises, and 10&#x02005;min cool-down.</p><p>Pilates warm-up exercises consisted of Cleopatra, the Chest stretch, the Toy soldier, Upper
extremity proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation patterns, and Roll down. Pilates mat
exercises performed in 5 different positions. 1. The One leg stretch, Hundreds, the Double
leg stretch, Scissors, the Shoulder bridge, Oblique preparation, and the Hip twist were
performed in the supine position. 2. The Clare, the Side kick, Arm openings, the Lower lift,
Leg lifts, and the Side bend were performed in the side-lying position. 3. The Swan dive,
the One leg kick, Swimming, the Breast stroke preparations, the Breast stroke, and the Cobra
were performed in the prone position. 4. The Half roll back, Oblique roll up were performed
in the sitting position. 5. Swimming was performed in the kneeling position. The Pilates
cooldown exercises were the Spine stretch, Saw, Mermaid, Cleopatra, Chest stretch, Toy
soldier.</p><p>Traditional exercises including strength, balance and coordination exercises were, applied
to the control group.</p><p>EDSS is used by neurologists for assessment of disability in patients with MS. Grading by
this instrument was done on a scale of 0&#x02013;10, with the disability rate increasing as the
grade increased. Patients were classified into five stages of disability: Stage I (EDSS = 0,
the patient is not disabled but has been diagnosed of a chronic disease), Stage II (EDSS =
1&#x02013;3, minimally disabled), Stage III (EDSS = 3.5&#x02013;5.5, rather disabled), Stage IV (EDSS = 6&#x02013;7,
patient still capable of walking with aid), and Stage V (EDSS =&#x0003c; 7, patient is unable to
walk at all)<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The cognitive impairments of participants were evaluated using the Multiple Sclerosis
Functional Composite (MSFC). The MSFC is a three-part performance scale for evaluating the
degree of impairment in MS patients. It includes assessment of leg function by moving a
short walking distance (Timed 25-Foot Walk), assessment of arm function using the Nine-Hole
Peg Test (NHPT), and assessment of cognitive functions with an attention/concentration test
(Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test, PASAT)<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. The MSFC assesses upper-motor function with the NHPT, lower-motor
function with the Timed 25-Foot Walk Test, and cognitive functions with the PASAT.</p><p>The Berg Balance Scale (BBS) was used for evaluating static and dynamic balance. The BBS is
a clinical scale that evaluates balance in sitting and standing positions and rates
performance from 0 (cannot perform) to 4 (normal performance). The scale has fifteen items
that explore the ability to sit, stand, lean, turn, and maintain an upright position on one
leg. The BBS has been validated for use in patients with MS<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. The BBS includes 14 items, giving a maximum score of 56. It is a
valid and reliable tool for people with MS<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Timed performance tests were used to assess physical performance. Measurements were
recorded with a stopwatch in seconds. The tests were conducted three times, and maximum
values were recorded. The tests were as follows:</p><p>1. Time to roll from right to left: While lying in a supine position on a mat, the patient
was asked to roll to one side and return to the supine position as quickly as possible. The
patient repeated the roll to the opposite side.</p><p>2. Lie/sit test: Starting from a back-lying position, the patients were asked to move into
their usual sitting position by turning a side their swinging feet.</p><p>3. Sit/stand test: Patients were asked to sit on a bed set at a standard height from the
floor and stand up once.</p><p>4. Repeated sit/stand (on/from a chair): The patients were asked to sit on a chair set at a
standard height and stand up 3 times.</p><p>5. 50-foot walking test: The patients were timed while they walked 25 feet as fast as
possible, turned, and walked rapidly back to the starting point. The 50-foot walking test
was recorded in seconds<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The Timed Up and Go test (TUG) was used for assessing walking performance. The TUG test is
a commonly used instrument that measures the time taken to rise from a chair, walk 3 meters,
turn, walk back, and sit down again. It is a valid and reliable tool for patients with MS,
and one measurement is sufficient. In the present study, the participants were encouraged to
walk safely but as quickly as possible. One practice attempt was allowed before the actual
testing<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Test results were recorded for
left and right turning. Lower values were considered better scores.</p><p>The Trunk Impairment Scale (TIS) was used to assess static and dynamic sitting balance and
trunk coordination and control in a sitting position. The static subscale investigates the
ability of the subject to maintain the sitting position with the feet supported, while the
legs are passively crossed, and when the subject crosses the legs actively. Subjects with MS
crossed the strongest leg over the weakest leg<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Results were analyzed under three headings, namely static,
dynamic, and coordination<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS) was used for evaluation of fatigue. The MFIS is a
21-item scale used to evaluate the impact of fatigue with regard to psychosocial, cognitive,
and physical functioning. The self-reported ratings of each item range from 0 (never) to 4
(almost always), for a total possible score ranging from 0 to 84 points. Higher scores
indicate a stronger impact of fatigue on activities of daily living<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Higher scores indicate a stronger impact of fatigue.</p><p>The Multiple Sclerosis International Quality of Life Questionnaire (MusiQol) was used for
measurement of quality of life. The MusiQoL questionnaire comprises 31 questions in 9
dimensions (subscales): activities of daily living (8 items), psychological well-being (4
items), symptoms (4 items), relationships with friends (3 items), relationships with family
(3 items), sentimental and sexual life (2 items), coping (2 items), rejection (2 items), and
relationships with healthcare system (3 items). The index score is computed as the mean of
these subscale scores. All 9 dimensions and the index score are linearly transformed and
standardized on a 0 to 100 scale, where 0 indicates the worst possible level of quality of
life (QoL) and 100 indicates the best level. Differential item functioning analysis was
performed in an initial validation study showing satisfactory results across countries<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Each patient completed the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), which is a 4-point Likert-type
self-rating scale developed by Beck. The validity and reliability of the scale was assessed
by Hisli (1989), and the Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha coefficient of the scale was found to be 0.80.
Assesment of the validity and reliability study of the Turkish version of the scale revealed
that the cutoff point was 17. The total score ranges from 0&#x02013;63. Higher results indicate
depression.</p><p>The SPSS 16.0 software was used to analyze data. Descriptive statistics were calculated for
demographic characteristics, and the Wilcoxon test was used to evaluate scores obtained
before and after the intervention, while the Mann-Whitney U test was used for testing the
differences between groups.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Demographic and clinical characteristics of the participants are shown in <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. There were statistically significant
differences in the clinical Pilates group in terms of BBS, timed performance tests, MFIS and
PASAT step of the MFCS between before and after the intervention (p&#x0003c;0.05).</p><p>On the other hand, in the control group, we also found statistically significant
differences in timed performance tests (except time to left), the Timed Up and Go Test, and

balance, QoL, fatigue, and cognition were investigated in MS patients.</p><p>Physical performance tests have been studied in a geriatric group, and these tests
represent a measurement system commonly used in physiotherapy evaluations. Parameters such
as rotation and moving to a sitting position from a supine position, which are examined in
physical performance tests, evaluate activities of daily living. Activities such as
rotation, sitting up, and standing up from a sitting position require successful countering
of gravity and better use of the trunk muscles. These measurements are important for
determining failure of body muscle control. The target muscle groups of clinical Pilates
training are the trunk muscles. Clinical Pilates is an effective form of training for the
postural muscles. In this respect, making these measurements is thought to have a great
importance in terms of manifest clinical Pilates effects. Dorado et al. studied the effects
of Pilates on the volume of the rectus abdominis, obliques, and transversus abdominis, with
the last two considered conjointly with magnetic resonance imaging. Their study revealed the
existence of asymmetries in the muscles of the abdominal wall in nonactive healthy women.
Performance of Pilates exercises twice a week for nine months elicited hypertrophy of the
abdominal wall muscles, particularly of the rectus abdominis, and eliminated preexisting
asymmetries of the obliques and transversus abdominis. They concluded that Pilates can be
recommended as an effective method to reinforce the muscles of the abdominal wall and to
compensate for preexisting asymmetric developments<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. The effects of Pilates on limb movements are discussed in other
Pilates studies. However, we used physical performance tests requiring body control because
of the primarily major muscle groups are body muscles in the Activities of Daily Living
(ADL). According to the results of our study, clinical Pilates is an effective exercise
method in patients with MS for improving the ability to perform ADL.</p><p>Clinical Pilates is an exercise program basically affecting the trunk muscles, and it has
characteristics similar to daily activities and includes exercises in different positions
and with progressive features<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Clinical
Pilates primarily affects core stabilization, running posture, and muscles<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. In this regard, we believe that it is
important to evaluate different tests of the trunk muscles beyond the physical performance
tests and introduce changes. In previous studies, the clinical effects of Pilates on
parameters such as stability were generally investigated<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the present study, we used the TIS, which evaluated the control
of body muscles other than those mentioned in previous studies. The TIS is a scale that is
used in stroke patients, but it can also be used in patients with MS for assessing trunk
impairment<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Clinical Pilates is a
system focused on the correct use of four core muscles, the diaphragm, transverses
abdominis, multifidus, and pelvic floor muscles. However, there were no meaningful changes
in the TIS in the patients who participated in this study. It is thought that this may be
related to the training period. In previous studies on clinical Pilates, the training period
was between 12 to 16 weeks<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. The finding
can be explained by an insufficient number of cases in studies that had a training period of
8 weeks, as in our study. Future studies with more cases and longer training periods should
investigate this association.</p><p>Clinical Pilates, is an exercise program based on the trunk muscles that affects the level
of proficiency in ADL. Competency in ADL would also affect quality of life. In this respect,
a specific MS QoL questionnaire was used in assessing the effects of exercise therapy. The
MusiQol is a widely used scale. The results of our study revealed that clinical Pilates has
significantly positive effects on QoL based on comparison with our control group. In the
literature, there are no studies that have investigated the effect of clinical Pilates on
QoL in MS patients. The present study is noteworthy because it demonstrated the effect of
clinical Pilates on QoL in MS patients. The PASAT is a measure of cognition and is included
in the MSFC. In the present study, the possible association between cognition and exercise
was examined. In the literature, there are only a small number of studies that have
investigated the effects of exercise and particularly aerobic exercise, on cognition. There
are no studies examining the effects of Clinical Pilates on cognition. In this respect, the
current study is the first study to examine such an association.</p><p>In the literature, the effects of exercise on cognition were studied with different groups.
In a randomized study by Sun et al.; Tai chi exercises were shown to be effective in the
cognitive functions on elderly<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. On the
other hand, in a study on cerebral palsy it&#x02019;s shown that there are relationships between
physical and cogntitive functions<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. A
study by Laitman showed the effect of exercise on cognitive integrity in the aging brain.
Notably, the study further linked the protective effects of chronic exercise on cognition to
neurovascular integrity during aging<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Cognitive impairment may occur in up to 70% of all patients with MS. The prevalence of
cognitive impairment is about 40&#x02013;65% in patients with MS. Neuropsychological assessments are
important in MS to predict prognosis and cognitive outcome in treatment trials. In
particular, cognitive impairment may lead to a reduced QoL, loss of work, and problems with
the social environment. Today, there are three avenues for treatment: disease modifying
therapies, symptomatic treatments, and cognitive rehabilitation<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. Our results revealed that clinical Pilates leads to
positive changes in cognition within MS therapy; this effect of Clinical Pilates was
demonstrated for the first time in this study. We think that this is very important.</p><p>According to the results of this study, clinical Pilates can be used as an effective
treatment method in MS due to its positive effects on physical parameters, such as balance,
performance, and fatigue; cognitive problems; and QoL. The literature includes studies on
balance and fatigue. A study by G&#x000fc;&#x000e7;l&#x000fc;-G&#x000fc;nd&#x000fc;z et al. investigated the effects of clinical
Pilates training on balance, mobility, and strength in MS patients. The authors found that
clinical Pilates training may develop balance, mobility, and muscle strength in MS
Patients<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Freeman and his friends conducted a multicenter, double blind, block randomized, controlled
trial. Similar to our study, they used clinical Pilates based core stability training in one
group and standardized physiotherapy exercise in their other group<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. In a study by Marandi and co-researchers<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>, clinical Pilates exercises were performed
by MS patients. Pilates interventions can significantly increase the dynamic balance of the
examinees in the post-experiment stage<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>.
The results of our study seem to be consistent with these findings.</p><p>In a single blind randomized study by Tarak&#x000e7;&#x00131; et al., MS patients received group exercises.
In the results of their study, it was concluded that group exercise had positive effects on
balance, functional status, spasticity, fatigue, and QoL<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>. In our study, the exercise programs in the clinical Pilates and
control groups were applied in a group format. However, although both exercise programs were
applied as group exercise, different effects on balance, fatigue, and QoL were found. The
significant differences found in the clinical Pilates group were thought to derive from
clinical Pilates rather than group exercises. Clinical Pilates led to significant changes in
the PASAT, MusiQol, physical performance tests, and balance parameters, so it can be used
for MS patients reliably. Furthermore, the results obtained from our study were the results
of an 8-week exercise program. The effects of longer periods of clinical Pilates are of
interest, and we plan to investigate this in the future. The study is going on with more
subjects.</p><p>A strength of our study was that it was an interdisciplinary. It was also the first study
investigating the effects of exercise on cognitive functions in people with MS.</p><p>A limitation of our study is the low number of patients. We started the study with 35
people, but not all could complete the study.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>G&#x000fc;ner</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Haghar&#x00131;</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Inan&#x00131;c&#x00131;</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Knee muscle strength in multiple sclerosis: relationship
