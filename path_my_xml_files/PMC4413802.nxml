We investigated effectiveness of brief intervention (BI) for achieving drug withdrawal in primary care patients with MOH.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The study was double-blind, pragmatic and cluster-randomised controlled. A total of 25&#x02005;486 patients (age 18&#x02013;50) from 50 general practitioners (GPs) were screened for MOH. GPs defined clusters and were randomised to receive BI training (23 GPs) or to continue business as usual (BAU; 27 GPs). The Severity of Dependence Scale was applied as a part of the BI. BI involved feedback about individual risk of MOH and how to reduce overuse. Primary outcome measures were reduction in medication and headache days/month 3&#x02005;months after the intervention and were assessed by a blinded clinical investigator.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>42% responded to the postal screening questionnaire, and 2.4% screened positive for MOH. A random selection of up to three patients with MOH from each GP were invited (104 patients), 75 patients were randomised and 60 patients included into the study. BI was significantly better than BAU for the primary outcomes (p&#x0003c;0.001). Headache and medication days were reduced by 7.3 and 7.9 (95% CI 3.2 to 11.3 and 3.2 to 12.5) days/month in the BI compared with the BAU group. Chronic headache resolved in 50% of the BI and 6% of the BAU group.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The BI method provides GPs with a simple and effective instrument that reduces medication-overuse and headache frequency in patients with MOH.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number</title><p>NCT01314768.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>HEADACHE</kwd><kwd>MIGRAINE</kwd><kwd>PAIN</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>special-feature</meta-name><meta-value>unlocked</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Headache is among the top 10 causes of morbidity, measured as years of life lost to disability.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Chronic headache, that is, headache &#x02265;15&#x02005;days/month affects 2&#x02013;5% of the general population.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2&#x02013;5</xref> About half of those with chronic headache have medication-overuse headache (MOH).<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>

With a consultation in an empathic and collaborative manner, the BI aimed towards achieving a decision by the patient that he/she would cut down the offending medication, an agreement about how the GP could support and a concrete plan. Explicit recommendations were reduction in headache medication towards &#x02018;safe levels&#x02019;, and information about possible difficulties and gains including that MOH usually &#x02018;gets worse before it improves&#x02019; 1&#x02013;2&#x02005;weeks after withdrawal.

<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></p><p>All Norwegian citizens are listed with a GP, and the included 50 GPs were representative of Norwegian GPs. The patient population of almost 27&#x02005;000 was assumed to be population based, although the 42% screening questionnaire response rate might skew the sample. However, our data correspond well with a previous Norwegian epidemiological survey regarding patients&#x02019; gender, headache diagnoses and medication use, emphasising its representativeness.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Intervention studies require willingness to cooperate and may lead to selection bias of GPs and patients, but the prestudy invitation and information did not mention any intervention. In addition, participants in the two study arms were comparable. Thus, selection bias is probably of minor significance.</p><p>The sample of included patients may seem small, but met pre-required power calculations. Thus, our results are most likely representative and valid.</p><p>The 18&#x02013;50&#x02005;years age range of patients was chosen in order to target a high number of patients with chronic headache without comorbidity of other interfering non-headache medication and disorders.</p><p>We chose the BI scheme as a structured form of simple advice that is easy to implement in a busy general practice. The intervention was conducted during a single consultation and it took an average of 9&#x02005;min to complete.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> The BI was based on the individual SDS score which is different from other simple advice strategies. The SDS score was used to distinguish between chronic headache with and without medication overuse.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> This personal feedback on risk has been suggested to be one important factor which makes the BI more effective than only general advice in other types of overuse.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></p><p>Collecting data from baseline, using retrospective information at the 3&#x02005;months follow-up, might have led to recall bias. We attempted to counteract this by, in addition, having prospective headache diaries collected independently of the follow-up.</p><p>The gold standard for diagnosing headache is an interview and a clinical examination by a physician experienced in headache diagnostics. Similar proportions of the different headache diagnoses made by the three interviewers suggest that interobserver variation was small. The ICHD-II was recently revised to ICHD-III edition &#x003b2;, but this does not affect the MOH diagnosis.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></p><p>A limitation with the study was small clusters (few patients per GP), however, all results are adjusted for ICC. Furthermore, results on individual patient levels met power calculations.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Results discussion</title><p>The RCT literature on withdrawal strategies for MOH is scant. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first double-blind RCT of MOH treatment in primary care.</p><p>In the present study, BI was significantly better than BAU and only the BI group improved compared with baseline. We regard the size of the change as clinically significant, especially taken into consideration that these patients had received no other treatment than a single BI during an ordinary GP consultation.</p><p>Other studies have also indicated effects of simple advice for MOH. However, none of these studies were blinded or had a control group without active intervention. Two Italian observational studies from neurology departments reported 78&#x02013;92% of patients with simple MOH to be without chronic headache and medication overuse after 2&#x02005;months.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Our figures are not quite as impressive, and this may reflect the unselected diverse patients with MOH included in our study. In addition, patients referred to a specialist centre may be more motivated and the authority of headache specialists and the setting may play a role. However, our results are in accordance with reports regarding patients with complicated MOH in neurology outpatient setting.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> In our previous study, simple information on medication use led to similar improvement, albeit over 1&#x02013;2&#x02005;years, and the mean duration of MOH suggests that this was not a spurious finding. However, that study had no control group.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> The present controlled RCT confirms these findings. It is worth noting that simple advice and education was enough to detoxify most of the patients in these studies.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11&#x02013;13</xref>
<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p><p>Prophylactic medication was used by 16&#x02013;20% of participants and equally frequent in both groups, thus it cannot explain our results. Whether or not initially to detoxify patients with MOH and whether prophylactic headache medication should be initiated immediately at withdrawal or after completing withdrawal therapy is debated.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Our results support an initial withdrawal attempt, since it in itself has a clear and clinically significant effect. We suggest that prophylactic headache medication should be restricted to patients who do not benefit sufficiently from withdrawal or have other complicating conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Clinical implications</title><p>Focus on MOH in primary care is important for early diagnosis, treatment and prevention.</p><p>In most European countries, overuse of simple analgesics, triptans and codeine-containing combination medications dominates.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
