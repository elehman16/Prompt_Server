However, no suitable marker has yet been established to monitor the immediate rTMS effects on cortical areas in children.</p></sec><sec><title>Objective</title><p>TMS-evoked EEG potentials (TEPs) could present a well-suited marker for real-time monitoring. Monitoring is particularly important in children where only few data about rTMS effects and safety are currently available.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In a single-blind sham-controlled study, twenty-five school-aged children with ADHD received subthreshold 1 Hz-rTMS to the primary motor cortex.

N100 amplitude to supra-threshold single pulses post rTMS confirmed the amplitude reduction in comparison to the pre-rTMS level while sham stimulation had no influence. EEG source analysis indicated that the TMS-evoked N100 change reflected rTMS effects in the stimulated motor cortex. Amplitude changes in TMS-evoked N100 and MEPs (pre versus post 1 Hz-rTMS) correlated significantly, but this correlation was also found for pre versus post sham stimulation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The TMS-evoked N100 represents a promising candidate marker to monitor rTMS effects on cortical excitability in children with ADHD. TMS-evoked N100 can be employed to monitor real-time effects of TMS for subthreshold intensities. Though TMS-evoked N100 was a more sensitive parameter for rTMS-specific changes than MEPs in our sample, further studies are necessary to demonstrate whether clinical rTMS effects can be predicted from rTMS-induced changes in TMS-evoked N100 amplitude and to clarify the relationship between rTMS-induced changes in TMS-evoked N100 and MEP amplitudes. The TMS-evoked N100 amplitude reduction after 1 Hz-rTMS could either reflect a globally decreased cortical response to the TMS pulse or a specific decrease in inhibition.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The study was supported by the Medical Faculty at the Goethe University, Frankfurt/Main via a grant (Young Scientists Program) to SB as well as by the Interdisciplinary Center for Neurosciences Frankfurt; Plasticity via magnetic brain stimulation: cellular mechanism &#x02013; modeling &#x02013; modulation via a grant to JR.

A suitable imaging method is a mandatory safety issue in the process of making rTMS available for children with psychiatric disorders like ADHD as the neurophysiological and clinical effects of rTMS have not yet been established in children. A careful &#x02018;online&#x02019; monitoring of rTMS effects in pediatric patients would be very helpful in the further process of establishing rTMS as a therapeutic tool <xref rid="pone.0050073-Rossi2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.</p><p>In ADHD, hyperactivity is one of the cardinal clinical symptoms, with an imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory processes in the motor cortex contributing to its pathophysiology <xref rid="pone.0050073-Buchmann1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0050073-Moll1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, expressed by reduction of short and long interval intracortical inhibition (SICI, LICI) <xref rid="pone.0050073-Buchmann1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050073-Gilbert1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050073-Gilbert2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0050073-Schneider1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> as well as intracortical facilitation (ICF) <xref rid="pone.0050073-Buchmann1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Compared to healthy controls children with ADHD showed a reduced TMS-evoked N100 <xref rid="pone.0050073-Bruckmann1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> evaluated by single TMS pulses. Registered by multi-channel EEG, the N100 is a negative TMS-evoked potential (TEP) component with a latency of approximately 100 ms which decreased in amplitude during movement initiation and execution <xref rid="pone.0050073-Bender1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050073-Nikulin1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> and increased during response inhibition <xref rid="pone.0050073-Bonnard1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.

After five days of 1 Hz-rTMS, one adult female ADHD patient showed reduced motor hyperactivity for four weeks <xref rid="pone.0050073-Niederhofer1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. So far, one study reported positive cognitive effects after high frequency rTMS of the right prefrontal cortex in adult ADHD patients <xref rid="pone.0050073-Bloch1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Another pioneering study with healthy adults suggested that TEPs can be used to measure the effect of facilitatory high frequency rTMS on the primary motor cortex <xref rid="pone.0050073-Veniero1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. To date, no such data are available for the inhibitory 1 Hz-rTMS in children or adults.</p><p>This paper does not examine clinical changes in behavior after rTMS. Instead, it aimed at establishing how TEPs were influenced by subthreshold 1 Hz-rTMS and how these changes would correlate with changes in MEP amplitude, reflecting changes in motor corticospinal excitability. This investigation aimed to illustrate &#x02018;online&#x02019; as well as short-term effects of 1 Hz-rTMS in children with ADHD in order to proof whether the N100 is a suitable &#x02018;online&#x02019; marker of immediate rTMS effects on the cortex. To our knowledge this is the first study that monitors online rTMS effects in children with ADHD. The N100 was chosen as it is the most pronounced deflection of the TEP in children <xref rid="pone.0050073-Bender1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> and earlier components were difficult to separate from temporalis and facial muscle MEP artifacts. Previous studies reported that TEPs were not only induced by supra-threshold stimuli, but also by stimulation intensities below MEP threshold (resting motor threshold&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;RMT) <xref rid="pone.0050073-Khknen1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050073-Komssi1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref> like in the present study. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether the TMS-evoked N100 qualifies as a dynamic parameter that immediately reflects changes in cortical excitability throughout the course of rTMS.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title/><sec id="s2a1"><title>2.1.1.

Following this, an ocular correction according to the algorithm described by Gratton &#x00026; Coles was conducted (Brain Vision Analyzer).</p><p>The peak of the N100 was determined as the most negative potential during the interval of 80 ms to 140 ms in leads C3, CP3&#x02032; and CP5&#x02032;.

Thereby, the N100 amplitude decrease during the first half was more pronounced than during the second half of the 900 rTMS pulses, suggesting that the effect of rTMS protocols on cortical excitability may saturate when a certain number of pulses is exceeded. When N100 amplitudes were measured by suprathreshold single-pulse TMS before and after 1 Hz-rTMS, the N100 reduction was confirmed. The N100 reduction only occurred after 1 Hz-rTMS but not after sham stimulation. The N100 data obtained in this study illustrate that 1 Hz-rTMS modulated cortical excitability for at least 10 minutes after the end of the rTMS in ADHD children (time between rTMS and the assessment of the EEG responses to single pulse TMS). These are the first of such data about immediate cortical rTMS effects in children. The duration of rTMS effects can only be estimated and was clearly shorter than 45 minutes as measurements after sham stimulation (in the group with prior 1 Hz-rTMS) showed no persisting effects. Thus, the factor ORDER of rTMS and sham stimulation had no effect.</p><p>In our sample the MEP amplitude showed a non-significant descriptive reduction after both 1 Hz-rTMS and sham stimulation; although most (but not all) previous studies reported a significant MEP reduction after 1 Hz-rTMS <xref rid="pone.0050073-Wassermann1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050073-Fitzgerald1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050073-Fregni1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Maybe statistical power was not high enough to detect an MEP reduction in our study or TMS intensity was too weak to exert significant effects on the MEP. RTMS-related changes in N100 could be related to the same processes as rTMS-related MEP changes. However, in our sample, TMS-evoked N100 amplitude turned out to be a more sensitive marker for rTMS-induced changes than MEP amplitude.</p><p>The TMS-evoked N100 amplitude qualified as a successful &#x02018;online&#x02019; marker for monitoring changes in cortical excitability during 1 Hz-rTMS in ADHD children. Thus, this study contributes to establishing TEPs as a useful approach for such an objective monitoring, which is described here for the first time in a neuropsychiatric pediatric patient group. As the TMS-evoked N100 has been successfully elicited in healthy children and adults as well <xref rid="pone.0050073-Bruckmann1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050073-Niederhofer1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050073-Bloch1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, TEP monitoring of rTMS effects might also be employed in those groups and may not be limited to children with ADHD. The hypothesis that 1 Hz-rTMS changes the N100 amplitude in a similar way also in healthy children or adults seems plausible but remains yet to be proven in future studies. In any case, we would like to point out clearly that the current findings may not be specific for or limited to children with ADHD.</p><p>Other pioneering pilot studies are pointing towards a possible therapeutic application of rTMS in ADHD (1 Hz inhibitory primary motor cortex rTMS <xref rid="pone.0050073-Niederhofer1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>; excitatory high frequency rTMS to the DLPFC <xref rid="pone.0050073-Bloch1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>). Our approach to establish non-invasive online monitoring parameters of short-term effects of rTMS on the cortex may in the long run help to optimize rTMS protocols: If the TMS-evoked N100 reduction (to be more precise: a less negative potential) indicated a decrease in inhibition &#x02013; as previous studies reported reduced N100 amplitudes in experimental conditions of decreased cortical inhibition <xref rid="pone.0050073-Bender1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050073-Bonnard1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050073-Khknen2" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref> &#x02013;, it would have to be concluded that 1 Hz-rTMS reduced inhibition instead of strengthening it. If that was the case, low frequency 1 Hz-rTMS might not be the most appropriate therapeutic approach in ADHD. Instead, another stimulation protocol may be more useful for ADHD children. This line of interpretation assumes that 1 Hz-rTMS directly influenced the TMS-evoked N100 amplitude and thereby reduced cortical inhibition. It has been shown that 1 Hz-rTMS can decrease both excitatory and inhibitory processes in the cortex <xref rid="pone.0050073-Fierro1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0050073-Koch1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>.</p><p>Nevertheless, 1 Hz-rTMS might not have influenced the N100 amplitude directly, but rather altered the level of cortical excitability. Therefore, the cortical inhibition might be increased, e.g. due to membrane potential shifts, and subsequently a TMS pulse of the same intensity would lead to less excitation. Then the N100 amplitude reduction would be a result of a weaker cortical excitation by the TMS stimulus and would rather reflect reduced cortical excitability than decreased inhibition. Although a descriptively very slight decrease of MEP amplitudes would support this hypothesis, this reduction occurred after both 1 Hz-rTMS and sham stimulation. Further studies are needed to resolve the exact neurophysiological mechanisms behind the rTMS induced changes in TMS-evoked N100 amplitude.</p><p>Considering that changes (&#x0201c;after minus before&#x0201d;) in TMS-evoked N100 (as a putative measure of an inhibitory brain response to limit the TMS-related excitation <xref rid="pone.0050073-Bruckmann1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050073-Bender1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050073-Khknen2" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>) and MEP amplitude (as a measure of motor cortex excitability) correlated significantly for both 1 Hz-rTMS and for sham stimulation, this could indicate that 1 Hz-rTMS was able to affect inhibitory and excitatory systems in the same direction at the same time; although with varying effectiveness, maybe due to different independent thresholds. A parallel reduction in MEP amplitude as a measure of cortical excitability and measures of motor cortical inhibition (e.g. SICI) has also been reported in other studies <xref rid="pone.0050073-Fierro1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0050073-Koch1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>.</p><p>However, considering the data from our sample, no definite decision can be made whether TMS-evoked N100 and MEP modulations are mechanistically independent of each other or linked. Being linked TMS-evoked N100 changes could be a direct consequence of the same changes reflected by MEP amplitude. In this case, the decreased N100 after 1 Hz-rTMS would reflect that the post-rTMS excitation was relatively weaker (as reflected by MEP decreases after 1 Hz-rTMS in other studies), and &#x02013; as a result &#x02013; the reactive inhibition during N100 was less pronounced as well. As, on the other hand, MEP amplitudes were comparable after 1 Hz-rTMS and sham stimulation, this interpretation may be less likely. Correlations between TMS-evoked N100 and MEP changes were found also in the sham condition and could rather reflect changes in vigilance than rTMS-specific effects.</p><p>If rTMS effects on MEP and TEP were independent, as MEP and TMS-evoked N100 have been found to dissociate in several previous studies <xref rid="pone.0050073-Bruckmann1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050073-Bender1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050073-Khknen2" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, the TMS-evoked N100 could yield additional information apart from the MEP. However, the dissociations in previous studies were not related to rTMS effects. Because there <italic>was</italic> a correlation of TMS-evoked N100 and MEP amplitudes pre versus post 1 Hz-rTMS, further studies are needed to clarify in how far the rTMS-related modulation of TMS-evoked N100 and MEP amplitudes are related to each other.</p><p>Additionally, this study does not provide any evidence that 1 Hz-rTMS leads to epileptiform activity in the EEG in children with ADHD. Similar to previous studies, 1 Hz-rTMS was well tolerated <xref rid="pone.0050073-Garvey1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050073-Quintana1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. No severe adverse events were observed, particularly no seizure or syncope, as was also indicated in previous TMS studies in children <xref rid="pone.0050073-Rossi2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050073-Gilbert2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050073-Fregni1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050073-Quintana1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. For investigating new rTMS protocols and optimizing established ones it is imperative to maintain a distinct supervision of safety aspects, especially in children. Therefore, under careful monitoring, further data on rTMS in children should be acquired via controlled and monitored studies, in order to gain sufficient data to recommend specific rTMS protocols as safe for children. Together with clinical EEG, TEP monitoring can serve to assess the immediate online effects of rTMS on cortical excitability (N100 amplitude changed during 1 Hz stimulation) and thus also may serve as a safety measure. As the N100 reflects inhibitory processes, rapid changes in TMS-evoked N100 amplitude may provide additional information on the risk that a rTMS protocol might trigger epileptiform activity. For example, a strong N100 increase could indicate an increase in cortical excitability, as stronger TMS pulses lead to higher amplitudes in all TMS-evoked potential components, both excitatory as well as inhibitory. However, such speculations need to be tested in further studies. Under EEG and TEP monitoring, unexpected strong increases in cortical excitability can even be detected during subthreshold rTMS of the primary motor cortex. Therefore, the data presented in this study suggest that the N100 amplitude may be useful as an indicator to maximize the functional effects of rTMS on the cortex. As TMS-evoked N100 has also been described after prefrontal cortex stimulation <xref rid="pone.0050073-Khknen1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, this TEP-monitoring could also be extended for surveying non-motor target areas <xref rid="pone.0050073-Fitzgerald2" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref> in further studies, even though different cortical areas may vary in their susceptibility and reactivity to rTMS <xref rid="pone.0050073-Khknen1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050073-Komssi1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050073-Rosanova1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. Changes in TMS-evoked N100 amplitude could indicate if a certain rTMS protocol exerts effects on the (non-motor) cortex and their intensity could be estimated. TMS parameters could be varied to maximize rTMS effects on TMS-evoked potentials. During online monitoring, the TMS-evoked N100 amplitude provides immediate information about rTMS effects on the cortex even before conducting further tests.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Technical Considerations</title><p>The topography of the N100 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050073-g001">Figures 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050073-g002">2C</xref>) revealed a lateralized, negative maximum over the left central area overlying the stimulated motor cortex. This topography was not different when compared before and after rTMS. The central negativity is compatible with activation of the stimulated motor cortex despite a TMS intensity below the motor threshold.</p><p>Clearly, the N100 does not represent an auditory response elicited by the TMS click <xref rid="pone.0050073-Bender1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050073-Nikulin1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> as auditory evoked potentials have smaller amplitudes and are less lateralized. Source analysis showed that the equivalent dipole component was located near the motor hand area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050073-g003">Figures 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050073-g004">4C</xref>). Therefore, volume conduction from the temporal auditory cortex could be excluded as a major source of the centro-parietal N100. There was no deep temporal positivity which would have to be the case for potentials in the auditory cortex <xref rid="pone.0050073-Bender2" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0050073-Picton1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. That rTMS effects on N100 persisted for some time after 1 Hz-rTMS and occurred only after 1 Hz-rTMS but not auditory sham stimulation is also incompatible with the notion that the reduction in N100 amplitude was caused by auditory habituation.</p><p>Muscle tension is unlikely to account for a decrease in N100 amplitude. Increased muscle contraction towards the end of the 1 Hz-rTMS could have led to an N100 decrease <xref rid="pone.0050073-Nikulin1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, however, this would have presented in combination with increased MEP amplitudes. In addition, quantitative EMG analysis did not show significant changes in muscle pre-contraction throughout the experiment and no muscle contraction differences between 1 Hz-TMS and sham stimulation.</p><p>The decrease in N100 amplitude occurred during rTMS at subthreshold intensity.

Stimulation time and number of stimuli/sessions might have been too low to exert optimal clinically relevant behavioral effects.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The present study investigated the online effects of subthreshold 1 Hz-rTMS on electrophysiological parameters of cortical excitability and illustrates, for the first time, that 1 Hz-rTMS yields (short-term) effects on the N100 amplitude in children with ADHD that may be used to monitor rTMS effects on cortical excitability. This might be relevant not only for therapeutic approaches to ADHD but also for other diseases. Future studies will have to assess whether the TMS-evoked N100 amplitude reduction after 1 Hz-rTMS reflects a globally decreased cortical response to the TMS pulse or a specific decrease in inhibition. In the long term, it will be necessary to assess summation effects after repeated treatments with 1 Hz-rTMS and the relevance of changes in TEPs to behavioral or cognitive processes. The N100 as marker of rTMS online monitoring may contribute to assuring safety of rTMS applied in experimental protocols or when used for investigations in risk groups or new patient populations like children or adolescents. RTMS may prove to be useful in various conditions of child and adolescent psychiatry, however, the specific aspects of the developing brain must be carefully investigated.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank Professor A.
