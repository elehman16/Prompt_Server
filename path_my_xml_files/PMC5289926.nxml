This study compares IPV with tOPV week 39 boost in Indian infants.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Starting 28 March 2012, we enrolled 372 Indian infant-mother pairs from Kolkata, India in an open-label, block-randomized, controlled trial comparing a 39 week tOPV to an IPV boost among infants immunized with three doses of tOPV. The primary outcome was mucosal immunity to poliovirus as measured by fecal polio virus shedding after OPV challenge. The secondary outcome was humoral response as defined by &#x0003e;1:8 titers for neutralizing antibodies at week 40. Seroconversion was measured by change in level of antibody titers from week 18 to week 40. The analyses were performed by both intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) comparing the occurrences of outcomes between the arms of the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Findings</title><p>Both the study arms provided equivalent mucosal immunity at 52 weeks with a total shedding prevalence of 28%. Vaccination with IPV resulted in significantly higher seroconversion rates for Polio type 2 (p = 0.03) and Polio type 3 (p &#x0003c; 0.01).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study indicates that an IPV boost at week 39 is equivalent to tOPV in intestinal immunity, and provides higher seroconversion compared to tOPV. The major limitation of the study was the additional OPV doses receive by infants during pulse polio immunization resulted in additional mucosal boosting, diminishing the impact of IPV or tOPV boost at week 39. However, IPV for OPV boost should prove to be a step forward in the global polio eradication initiative to reduce the problem of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV).</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group id="kwd0005"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Health profession</kwd><kwd>Immunology</kwd><kwd>Pharmaceutical science</kwd><kwd>Pediatrics</kwd><kwd>Public health</kwd><kwd>Internal medicine</kwd><kwd>Pathology</kwd><kwd>Infectious disease</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec0005"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p>The global eradication of poliomyelitis is close at hand. The year 2015 marked the lowest incidence of paralytic polio since eradication effort were initiated. Only two countries, Afghanistan and Pakistan reported wild poliovirus disease <xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. In 2015, 74 wild poliovirus (WPV) cases were identified; 54 (73%) were detected in Pakistan, and 20 (27%) were detected in Afghanistan. In 2016 unfortunately three wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases have been reported from Borno State of Nigeria <xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. In addition to the WPV, about 32 circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV) cases were reported from polio-free countries. Outbreaks of cVDPV type 1 occurred in Laos, Madagascar, and Ukraine, whereas outbreaks of cVDPV type 2 reported from Guinea, Myanmar, Nigeria, and Pakistan <xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>.</p><p>One of the reasons for continued transmission in these 3 countries may be the lower immunity generated by oral polio vaccine (OPV) in children from resource poor settings [<xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. This poor protection following OPV vaccination is thought to be multi-factorial with contributions from chronic diarrhea from concurrent enteric infections and potentially maternal antibody interference with vaccine antigen uptake [<xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>The polio eradication and endgame strategic plan of 2013&#x02013;2018 had reached milestones with the second objective that includes switching from the trivalent OPV (tOPV) to bilavent OPV (bOPV, composed of serotype 1 and 3) to target the remaining circulating wild polio virus serotypes <xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. In 2016, 154 countries decided to switch from tOPV to bOPV in their routine and supplementary immunizations <xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. In addition to switching from tOPV to bOPV, introduction of one dose of inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) into the routine immunization programs has been recommended for maintaining type 2 poliovirus immunity <xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p><p>IPV has been used successfully in many polio-free countries to maintain humoral immunity in children [<xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. IPV has also been used in supplementary immunization activity (SIA) to control outbreaks and accelerate poliovirus eradication in endemic countries [<xref rid="bib0055" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="bib0060" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Vaccination with only IPV was apparently inferior as measured by fecal shedding after challenge, but reportedly had different outcome when administered subsequent to doses of OPV [<xref rid="bib0065" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="bib0070" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="bib0075" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Although many of these studies support the use of IPV after OPV, the timing of IPV and the effect of it on mucosal protection represented a knowledge gap.</p><p>We designed a randomized clinical trial to determine if an additional dose of IPV or tOPV administered at 39 weeks of infant age after receiving 3 doses of tOPV, would boost mucosal and humoral immune responses, as measured by fecal viral shedding for all the three poliovirus type at week 52 (day 0 to day 25) after OPV challenge, and by neutralizing antibodies at week 40. We hypothesized that infants receiving the IPV dose after OPV intestinal priming would enhance intestinal and humoral immunity with reduced viral shedding of poliovirus.</p></sec><sec id="sec0010"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec0015"><label>2.1</label><title>Study population and design</title><p>The study was approved by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), Health Ministry's Screening Committee (HMSC), Government of India; the Institutional Ethical Committee at National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Disease (NICED) and the Institutional Review Boards of International Vaccine Institute (IVI), South Korea; University of Virginia and University of Vermont USA. The study protocol was registered at clinical trial registry of India (CTRI/2012/03/002504) and at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov" id="intr0005">clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link> (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01571505). All participants received free primary care during the study. All mothers signed an informed consent form on behalf of their infants before enrollment into the study and were free to withdraw at any time.</p><p>Three-hundred seventy-two eligible neonatal infant-mother pairs were enrolled into the Performance of Rotavirus and Oral Poliovirus Vaccines in Developing Countries (PROVIDE) study in Kolkata, India. It was a randomized open-label clinical trial. Recruitment of the subjects was over one and half year starting on 28th March 2012 and ending in 30th October 2013. The subjects were followed-up for a period of 53&#x02013;54 weeks of infant age with the final follow-up visit completed on 30th November 2014.</p><p>The study design was a randomized open-label clinical trial with 2 arms. Infants enrolled received three doses of tOPV followed either by a fourth dose of tOPV or IPV followed by a challenge dose of tOPV (<xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). All participating infants received OPV and BCG at birth, and diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus (DPT) vaccine, Hepatitis B vaccine and OPV at 6, 10 and 14 weeks of age as part of expanded program of immunization (EPI). The study groups were: i) dose 4 IPV plus Rotavirus and ii) dose 4 tOPV plus Rotavirus. Subjects were randomized to receive either oral tOPV (BioPolio<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Bharat Biotech) or injectable IPV (IMOVAX<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Sanofi Pasteur) at 39 weeks of age. The reason for selection of 39 week boost was to harmonize with PROVIDE study arm of Bangladesh, where the EPI schedule for oral poliovirus vaccination (tOPV) at the time of the study design in 2010 was 6, 10, 14, and 38 weeks [<xref rid="bib0080" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="bib0085" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].

Another challenge dose of tOPV were given to all infants at week 52 age (<xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Additionally, all subjects were vaccinated with Rotarix<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (GlaxoSmithKline) as the part of the study (Supplementary Table 1).

Eligibility for enrollment required infants aged 0&#x02013;49 days, absence of congenital abnormalities, mother and child not immunologically compromised, no birth defects, no history of seizures and other apparent neurologic disorders, and proof of BCG and OPV vaccination in their immunization cards. All mothers signed an informed consent form on behalf of their infants before enrollment into the study and were free to withdraw anytime at their will. The study was conducted in compliance with the declaration of Helsinki and the Belmont Report <xref rid="bib0095" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Good Clinical Practices were followed throughout the progress of the study. Adverse events were monitored by an independent clinician who was not involved in the study. Severe adverse events were recorded for the full protocol period until the final fecal excretion sample collection at 53&#x02013;54 weeks of age; and adverse events within 48 h of vaccination linked to vaccine administration were recorded. All adverse events were reported to ethics review committee and institutional review board as per protocol.</p></sec><sec id="sec0020"><label>2.2</label><title>Randomization and masking</title><p>Infants were randomized to receive either tOPV or IPV at 39 weeks of age. All infants received tOPV at birth, 6, 10 and 14 weeks of age. Based on the randomization codes generated at the International Vaccine Institute (IVI), designated staff at National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases (NICED) had assembled and numbered envelopes with group assignment (i.e. Group A or Group B). These were sealed and signed by the study investigator, delivered to the PROVIDE study clinic at B C. Roy Hospital. We had prepared a randomization list with the envelopes containing randomization numbers, Group Code, Study ID (SID) number, and the date of recruitment. The randomization numbers began at &#x0201c;RN1001&#x0201d; and end at &#x0201c;RN1372&#x0201d;. SIDs were assigned sequentially to each infant/mother pair at the enrollment visit.

HEp-2 cells were inoculated and each specimen was run in triplicate in the same assay run and results were recorded. A titer of 1:8 or greater was considered seropositive while a titer of less than 1:8 was considered seronegative. As per WHO definition seroconversion was defined as a change from undetectable to detectable titer; or a four-fold increase in titer over the expected decrease in maternally derived antibodies (assuming a half-life of 28 days) <xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.

The number of additional doses and the mean doses were not significantly different (p &#x0003e; 0.5) between the arms (Table S5).</p><p>In ITT analysis, comparison of IPV boosting to tOPV at 39 weeks of age did not result in any difference in shedding for any of the poliovirus serotypes as measured from 5 fecal samples taken at different days after week 52 tOPV challenge (<xref rid="tbl0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The risk difference was 0.0% between two arms with an inferred equivalence margin of &#x02212;8.0%, +7.6% (95% CI). Total fecal shedding rate was 28% for both the arms.</p><p>Secondary analysis of individual serotype fecal shedding were done for PP and RPD to identify differences between IPV and tOPV (<xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). The results of the PP and RPD analyses for shedding by serotype were also consistent with the ITT analysis (<xref rid="tbl0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and Table S6). Estimated total shedding was 31.4% with risk difference of 1.6% (95% CI: &#x02212;7% to 12%). Repeating the same analyses using fecal RT-PCR-based detection yielded identical results. (<xref rid="tbl0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Infants poliovirus fecal shedding were predominant on day 4, 11 and 18 (<xref rid="fig0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). The peak shedding rate was 19% on day 4, 8% on days 11 and 18 for all three poliovirus types (<xref rid="tbl0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).</p><p>In ITT analysis, vaccination with IPV had resulted in no different seronegativity rates for all three serotypes compared to tOPV (<xref rid="fig0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). Seronegativity rates in both arms were 0% for type 1 and 0% (IPV) vs 0.6% (tOPV) for type 3 (p = 0.496). No difference in Type 2 seronegativity was observed with IPV and OPV seronegativity of 0% and 0.6% respectively for each arm (p = 0.496). Moderate seroconversion rate from week 18 to week 40 was observed for infants in the IPV arm with a 34.0&#x02013;60.0% seroconversion of all three antibody types. However for the tOPV arm the seroconversion rate ranged from 30.0&#x02013;35.0% for all the three serotypes (<xref rid="fig0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). Seroconversion rates in IPV compared to tOPV arm were significantly higher for polio type 2 (p = 0.03) and polio type 3 (p &#x0003c; 0.01). For polio type 1 type the seroconversion rates were not significantly different for IPV and tOPV arm (p = 0.72). High serum neutralizing antibody titers were observed over period from week 18 to week 53&#x02013;54 (<xref rid="fig0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). The analysis of week 40 SNAB titers, as predictor of week 52 shedding, showed that infants with seroconversion at week 40 from week 18 were similarly shed at week 52 than those who were not seroconverted at week 40 (<xref rid="tbl0015" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The shedding difference between those who were seroconverted and those who were not seroconverted was not statistically significant. Seropositivity for each polio type among those infants who shed at week 52 were similar between IPV and tOPV arm (<xref rid="tbl0015" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec0045"><label>4</label><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study we observed that substitution of IPV for tOPV with the 39 week booster resulted in improved serum neutralizing antibody without any change fecal excretion of sabin poliovirus strains (upon subsequent challenge with tOPV at 52 weeks). We concluded that introduction of an IPV boost into the EPI program in India would be equally beneficial to the existing OPV boost. The results of the PP and RPD analyses were also consistent with the ITT analysis suggesting the results of our analysis were robust.</p><p>Our study extended previous works which tested combinations of OPV and IPV. An IPV dose had been shown to boost seropositivity and seroconversion in children and infants receiving multiple OPV doses [<xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib0080" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="bib0120" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="bib0170" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="bib0175" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Moreover, the combination of IPV and OPV provided comparable intestinal immunity to OPV, but better than IPV alone [<xref rid="bib0075" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="bib0120" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. A recent study carried out in western and southern part of India demonstrated that the combination of OPV and IPV had superior immunogenicity for poliovirus type 3 over tOPV only <xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. This supports our finding of a significantly higher seroconversion rate for polio type 3 with the IPV boost. Another study carried out in the Moradabad district of northern India demonstrated that administering a single dose of IPV in OPV vaccinated children improved both humoral and intestinal immunity and helped to overcome waning of mucosal immunity in these children <xref rid="bib0170" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>.</p><p>Jafari and his colleague demonstrated IPV to be superior to bOPV in reducing any shedding in three cohorts of children aged 6&#x02013;11 months, 5 and 10 years <xref rid="bib0170" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Unlike our results, a significant reduction in polio type 1 and 3 excretion was observed in the 6&#x02013;11 month cohort of IPV recipients compared to non-vaccinated controls or bOPV recipients <xref rid="bib0170" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. One of the reasons could be geographic variations of immunogenicity to OPV. Further, all the subjects in our study received additional OPV doses during Pulse Polio immunization program <xref rid="bib0165" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> along with EPI vaccines resulting in high antibody titers and comparable excretion rate in tOPV and IPV arm. Moreover, an additional birth dose of OPV might have resulted in high SNAB antibody titers at week 18 and maintained it over time with additional OPV doses.</p><p>Our findings are consistent with the results of the larger site of the PROVIDE study in Dhaka, Bangladesh [<xref rid="bib0080" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="bib0085" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], which showed that the proportion of subjects who seroconverted were significantly higher in tOPV plus IPV group compared to only tOPV group while no difference in fecal excretion rates was observed.</p><p>Several potential limitations in our trial should be acknowledged. First, the recruitments were conducted in a hospital setting where mothers were, as shown by the high rate of participation, willing to participate. Moreover, the participants were with a better nutritional status and only 5&#x02013;10% of infants were moderately-to-severely undernourished as mentioned above. This could be a selection bias and limit the generalizability as there are reports of 45% undernutrition from different localities in Kolkata <xref rid="bib0180" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Second, about 15&#x02013;20% of the participants in each arm of the study did not provide all stool specimens as outlined in the study protocol. However, the primary ITT and secondary PP and RPD analyses did not showed any significant difference suggesting no effect of the missing stool samples in our study. Third all the participants received additional OPV doses during the Pulse Polio immunization program <xref rid="bib0165" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, although the mean number of doses received per subject was constant between the arms. This additional OPV doses may have resulted in additional mucosal boosting, diminishing the impact of additional IPV or tOPV boost. Fourth, this study was limited to measuring immune response only at 12 weeks after IPV vaccination, thus potential long-term changes or waning immunity over time were not addressed.</p><p>India EPI has introduced one dose of IPV at week 14 age in 17 high-risk states and four Union Territories from November 2015 and announced tOPV-bOPV switch from mid-2016. This study is timely in assessing the effects of IPV introduction on poliovirus shedding and subsequent intestinal immunity. Though IPV does not appear to be a superior regimen over OPV, the IPV switch is expected to prevent the poliomyelitis caused by cVDPV2, which contributes to 95% cVDPV worldwide. Further studies are warranted to measure the duration of memory response for the IPV plus OPV regimen.</p></sec><sec id="sec0050"><title>Declarations</title><sec id="sec0055"><title>Author contribution statement</title><p>Suman Kanungo: Conceived and designed the experiments; Performed the experiments; Analyzed and interpreted the data.</p><p>Deok Ryun Kim, Mohammad Ali, Ayan Dey: Conceived and designed the experiments; Analyzed and interpreted the data; Wrote the paper.</p><p>Bisakha Haldar: Performed the experiments.</p><p>Cynthia Snider: Wrote the paper.</p><p>Uma Nalavade, Jagadish M.
