This practice of elective ventilation is not based on any evidence. The primary objective of our study was to find out the difference in oxygenation and ventilation in patients extubated early compared to those extubated late after TOO and posterior fixation. The secondary objectives were to compare the length of Intensive Care Unit (ICU)/hospital stay and pulmonary complications between the two groups.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Material and Methods:</title><p>After TOO and posterior fixation, patients were either extubated in the operating room (Group E) or extubated next day (Group D). The oxygenation (PaO<sub>2</sub>:FiO<sub>2</sub> ratio) and ventilation (PaCO<sub>2</sub>) of the two groups before surgery, at 30 min and at 6/12/24 and 48 h after extubation were compared. Complications, durations of ICU and hospital stay were noted.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>The base-line PaO<sub>2</sub>:FiO<sub>2</sub> and PaCO<sub>2</sub> was comparable between the groups. No significant change in the PaO<sub>2</sub>:FiO<sub>2</sub> was noted in the postoperative period in either group as compared to the preoperative values. Except for at 12 h after surgery, there was no significant difference between the two groups at various time intervals. No significant change in the PaCO<sub>2</sub> level was seen during the study period in either group. PaCO<sub>2</sub> measured at 30 min after surgery was more in Group E (37.5 &#x000b1; 3.2 mmHg in Group E vs. 34.6 &#x000b1; 2.9 mmHg in Group D), otherwise there was no significant difference between the two groups at various time intervals. One patient in Group E (7.1%) and two patients in Group D (13%) developed postoperative respiratory complication, but the difference was not statistically significant.

Informed consent was obtained from each patient or the legal guardian. Patients with history of bronchial asthma, chronic obstructive airway disease, frequent chest infections, excessive snoring, morbid obesity, cardiac disease, preoperative respiratory symptom, lower cranial nerve deficit and American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Grade 3 or more were excluded from the study. All patients were premedicated with intramuscular 0.2 mg glycopyrrolate 1 h prior to induction of anesthesia. In the operating room, routine monitors were attached and arterial cannulation was done under local anesthesia. Arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis was done, while the patients were breathing room air. The PaO<sub>2</sub>:FiO<sub>2</sub> ratio (ratio between partial pressure of oxygen in patient's arterial blood [PaO<sub>2</sub> ] and fraction of inhaled oxygen by the patient [FiO<sub>2</sub> ]) was calculated. Fiberoptic laryngoscopy was done for endotracheal intubation either during awake state or under general anesthesia. Anesthesia was induced with fentanyl (2 &#x003bc;g/kg) and thiopental (3-5 mg/kg). To achieve muscle paralysis rocuronium (1 mg/kg) was given at the time of induction and repeated whenever deemed necessary. Anesthesia was maintained with isoflurane, fentanyl and 60% nitrous oxide. TOO was done in supine position, and then the patients were turned prone for posterior fixation. Continuous monitoring of SpO<sub>2</sub>, ETCO<sub>2</sub>, electrocardiogram (ECG), axillary temperature, anesthetic agent concentration, invasive blood pressure, spirometry, and neuromuscular activity was done during the intraoperative period. The duration of surgery, duration of anesthesia, amount of blood loss, volume of fluids, blood transfusion, hemodynamic fluctuations, and total dose of fentanyl as well as rocuronium were recorded. Careful laryngoscopy was done at the end of surgery to rule out any gross oropharyngeal swelling. Inhalational anesthetics were discontinued and neuromuscular paralysis was reversed after laryngoscopy. Patients were considered ready for extubation when the following criteria were met-fully awake patient responding well to command, train of four ratio &#x0003e;90%, regular with normal depth respiration, respiratory rate (RR) &#x0003c;25 breaths/min, adequate cough reflex, stable hemodynamics, and movement of all the limbs and SpO<sub>2</sub> &#x0003e;95%.When the patients were considered fit for extubation, they were randomized into two groups, early extubation group (Group E) and delayed extubation group (Group D). Randomization was done using a computer generated randomization chart. Patients in Group E were extubated in the operating room, while patients in Group D were given fentanyl and midazolam and transferred to ICU for elective ventilation. Patients who remained on mechanical ventilation were ventilated with tidal volume of 8 ml/kg, RR 12 breaths/min, FiO<sub>2</sub> 40%, positive end expiratory pressure of 5 cm of H<sub>2</sub> O and pressure support of 10 cm of H<sub>2</sub> O in synchronized mandatory ventilation mode. For postoperative analgesia ketorolac 30 mg was given intramuscularly at the time of wound closure and was repeated every 8 h. Those patients, who remained on ventilator, also received sedation in the form of midazolam (1-2 mg/h) and fentanyl (1 mcg/kg/h) to keep them comfortable. Patients were extubated next day after overnight ventilation. Sedation was stopped at least 4 h before extubation. Postoperative monitoring included SpO<sub>2</sub>, ETCO<sub>2</sub>, ECG, noninvasive blood pressure and RR. ABG was done at 30 min, 6, 12, 24 and 48 h after extubation and the PaO<sub>2</sub>:FiO<sub>2</sub> ratio was calculated. Chest X-ray was done on the 3<sup>rd</sup> postoperative day. Vital hemodynamic parameters were recorded at the time of shifting and after 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, 24 and 48 h of extubation. Patients were observed during their hospital stay for development of any respiratory complication. Postoperative pulmonary complication was defined as occurrence of hypoventilation, hypoxia, hypercarbia, tachypnea, dyspnea, bronchospasm, tracheo-bronchitis, purulent sputum, atelectasis, pneumonia, pneumothorax, emphysema, accidental extubation, endotracheal tube blockade, and the need for reintubation or tracheostomy. Intervention was planned for the possible occurrence of respiratory distress. The criteria for reintubation were: Desaturation (PaO<sub>2</sub> &#x0003c;60), hypoventilation (PaCO<sub>2</sub> &#x0003e;50), tachypnea (RR &#x0003e;35/min), impending respiratory failure, and retention of secretions.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data were analyzed with the help of STATA 9.0 (College Station TX) software and SPSS 10 (categorical variables).

We took PaO<sub>2</sub>:FiO<sub>2</sub> ratio and PaCO<sub>2</sub> levels as markers of oxygenation and ventilation respectively. It has been shown that PaO<sub>2</sub>:FiO<sub>2</sub> ratio and PaCO<sub>2</sub> levels represent the oxygenation and alveolar ventilation well.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] In the intragroup comparison, the PaO<sub>2</sub>; FiO2 ratio and PaCO<sub>2</sub> did not change significantly during the monitoring period in either group. In the between group comparison, though a significant difference of PaO<sub>2</sub>:FiO2 ratio was seen at 12 h after surgery, such difference was not found at 24 and 48 h after surgery. Similarly, though there was a significant difference of PaCO<sub>2</sub> measured 30 min after surgery between the two groups, it was not different in the subsequent period. The duration of ICU stay and hospital stay was less in patients who were extubated at the end of surgery.</p><p>We did not find any difference in the incidence of postoperative respiratory complications between the two groups. Only one patient in the early extubation group developed respiratory complication. The respiratory problem in the above patient surfaced only 48 h after extubation. There was no oropharyngeal swelling in this patient. The occurrence of respiratory distress and the need for reintubation in that patient would not have been influenced by the choice of early or late extubation. In the postoperative period, 2 patients in the delayed extubation group developed respiratory symptoms but neither of them required reintubation. Though the incidence of postoperative respiratory complications was low in our study, we attribute our statistically insignificant findings to the small sample size. Occurrence of significant postoperative respiratory compromise in any of the group would have resulted in a significant and sustained change in the PaO<sub>2</sub>; FiO2 ratio and PaCO<sub>2</sub> in both intragroup and intergroup comparison. But, since no such change was observed, we exclude any possibility of a significant compromise of respiratory function in either group.</p><p>Fear of a difficult airway due to oral surgery compounded with a fixed upper cervical spine is the major reason of delayed extubation after TOO and PF.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] The practice of keeping the endotracheal tube and overnight ventilation is not based on scientific evidence but rather due to the apprehension of a difficult intubation in the event of a respiratory failure.</p><p>Early extubation of patients following TOO and posterior fixation and early transfer to the general wards may have both medical as well as economic benefit. Complications related to endotracheal intubation like barotrauma, nosocomial infections and ventilator associated pneumonia can be reduced to a great extent. Patients can be mobilized early, which may reduce the occurrence of complications such as deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary thromboembolism. Early extubation also allows early initiation of nutrition, which may help in early mobilization and recovery. The adverse effects associated with the use of analgesia and sedation in ventilated patients can be reduced. Early extubation has also been shown to improve lung functions by reducing intrapulmonary shunts and atelectasis.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Early extubation also allows an early discharge from ICU, which can substantially reduce the nursing requirements and the associated cost. On the other hand prolonged intubation and mechanical ventilation has been reported to lead to several complications and prolonged ICU stay.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>The surgical technique as well as the airway management of TOO has evolved over the years. During earlier days, splitting of soft palate was a common practice.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] With further expertise and modification of the technique, the division of soft palate was replaced with its retraction into a nasopharyngeal space with a nasal catheter.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] TOO in recent times is done thorough a small incision on the upper part of the posterior pharyngeal wall under the microscope and does not involve any extensive tissue damage.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Previously, preoperative tracheostomy was the norm for TOO.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Tracheostomy was done to allow uninterrupted surgical field, faster operative wound healing and comfortable breathing for the patient. In recent times tracheostomy is no longer recommended.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] However, many surgeons and anesthesiologists prefer to keep the patient intubated in the postoperative period for few days to allow oropharyngeal swelling to subside.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>The results of our series suggest that selected patients, who are otherwise healthy and have no swelling of the oropharyngeal structures, can be extubated immediately after surgery. The sample size of our study is too small to establish the safety of early extubation in patients undergoing TOO and posterior fixation. These results cannot be applied ASA III &#x00026; IVpatients, patients with other airway difficulty or in difficult surgery involving extensive tissue damage where delayed extubation may be safer. Use of spirometry could have better reflected respiratory functions in the postoperative period. Since the PaO<sub>2</sub> FiO<sub>2</sub> ratio and PaCO<sub>2</sub> changes were not clinically significant, a clinically significant difference of the spiromteric data would have been a very unlike possibility.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Ventilation and oxygenation and the incidence of respiratory complications in patients undergoing TOO and posterior fixation were not different in the postoperative period but the duration of ICU and hospital stay was more in the delayed extubation group as compared to the early extubation group.
