The prevalence of hemorrhoids in India according to recent surveys is around 40 million.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] If left untreated, hemorrhoids can worsen and become complicated over time. The factors which aggravate the symptoms of hemorrhoids are chronic constipation and low fiber intake in diet. Some of the most commonly encountered symptoms associated with hemorrhoids are perianal pain, itching, tenesmus, bleeding, while defecation and mucous in stool.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Bleeding per rectum being the most common and troublesome symptom for the patients.</p><p>The management of hemorrhoids varies depending on the severity of the signs and symptoms with which the patient presents. The medical management includes symptomatic management of the local pain symptoms using local anesthetics, topical analgesics, and corticosteroid creams. It also includes oral supplementation with fibers and laxatives and certain dietary modifications. The surgical management includes nonoperative outpatient procedures such as sclerotherapy, cryotherapy, and rubber band ligation. While the surgical options include open, closed, or stapled hemorrhoidectomy.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>Thus medical management of hemorrhoids should include an integrated approach wherein drugs are needed to tackle the inflammation, pain, control bleeding, tighten the smooth muscle vasculature, and treat the aggravating factors. This integrated approach can be achieved by polyherbal formulations containing anti-inflammatory, styptics, analgesics, and laxative effect which reduce inflammation, pain, and bleeding, and increase gastrointestinal motility and soften stools.

It was a pilot study. Study was conducted at Surgery outpatient Department (OPD) in collaboration with Department of Pharmacology of our institute. Following Ethics Committee approval (EC/PH-35/2011), recruitment was done over a period of 16 months (10/09/2012-26/12/2013).</p><p>Patients of either gender, aged &#x02265;18 years, with hemorrhoids (Grades 1, 2 or 3) confirmed by proctoscopy, visiting the surgical OPD was enrolled in the study. Patients with Grade 4/prolapsed hemorrhoids, pregnant and lactating women, patients currently using other anti-hemorrhoidal drugs or having taken any herbal medications in the last 30 days or planning to undergo any surgical procedure for hemorrhoids were excluded from the study. Patients with major hepatic, renal, or cardiovascular ailments were also excluded from the study.</p><p>Patients who provided a written informed consent and satisfying the selection criteria were enrolled in the study. At the baseline visit (day 0 - screening and randomization visit) patients were evaluated and scored by an independent surgeon (evaluator blinded to the treatment patient will receive) for the following symptoms: Tenesmus (visual analog score) [VAS] of 0&#x02013;10 with 0 = No pain and 10 = severe pain, bleeding per rectum (with 0 = absent and 1 = present), pruritus (0= absent and 1 = present), mucous in stools (0 = absent and 1 = present), stool consistency (0&#x02013;2, with 0 = soft, 1= firm, 2 = hard), and stool frequency (0 = regular, 1= irregular). On day 0 proctoscopic examination the following signs were noted: Proctitis (0= absent and 1= present), anal sphincter spasm (0 = absent, 1= mild, 2= moderate, 3 = severe spasm), ease of reduction (0= easily reduced, 1 = reduced with difficulty, 2= irreducible), and the degree of hemorrhoids (0 = absent, 1 = first degree, 2 = second degree, 3 = third degree). A composite score was calculated for all patients which included the addition of scores for all the rectal symptoms and signs of hemorrhoids and it ranged from minimum score of 0 to maximum score of 25 (higher score indicative of severe disease). According to the computer-generated randomization code the patients were randomized to receive the test product or comparator therapy for 14 days.</p><p>Both the test product and comparator for the study were supplied by Solumiks Herbaceuticals Limited, Mumbai.

Various other Ayurvedic drugs are claimed to have a beneficial effect in patients of hemorrhoids, but such claims are not validated through systematic randomized clinical trials. Arshkeyt&#x02122; though a proprietary formulation did contain multiple ingredients which collectively possessed hemostyptic, anti-inflammatory, analgesic, wound healing properties as Ayurveda textbooks. In addition, it also had Isabgul to relieve constipation the most common contributing factor for hemorrhoids.</p><p>In the current study, the number of patients achieving composite score 0 in Arshkeyt&#x02122; group on day 14 was 15 which was significantly more in contrast to 6 patients from standard treatment group who achieved composite score as 0. This statistical difference could be attributed to all the additional ingredients present in Arshkeyt&#x02122; like <italic>Arshoghni vati</italic>, <italic>Triphala guggul</italic>,[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] <italic>A. campanulatus</italic>,[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] <italic>M. azedarach</italic>,[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] <italic>C. dactylon</italic>, <italic>M. pudica</italic>,[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] <italic>M. ferrea</italic>, <italic>B. variegate</italic>, and <italic>P. pinnata</italic>[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] which conferred hemostyptic, anti-inflammatory, analgesic, wound healing properties which lacked in the standard treatment.</p><p>In addition, the effect of Arshkeyt&#x02122; product on improving individual symptoms was also statistically significant. The number of patients presenting with near absence of tenesmus (reduction of VAS &#x0003c;3 on day 14), was significantly higher in Arshkeyt&#x02122; treated group as compared to Standard treatment (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). The benefit can be attributed especially to Arshkeyt&#x02122; Tablets containing <italic>Triphala guggul</italic>,[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] <italic>A. campanulatus</italic>,[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and <italic>M. azedarach</italic>,[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] which possess anti-inflammatory and analgesic effect.</p><p>Similarly, the number of patients showing improvement in grade of anal sphincter spasm was significantly higher in Arshkeyt&#x02122; treatment group as compared to standard treatment (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). This can be attributed to Arshkeyt&#x02122; Cream containing oil of <italic>P. pinnata</italic> (<italic>Karanja Tel</italic>)[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and oil of <italic>A. indica</italic> (<italic>Nimba Tel</italic>)[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] have potential to relax the smooth muscles, reduce pruritus, and has a soothing effect.</p><p>When patients were evaluated for a presence of at least Grade 1 hemorrhoids on day 14, significantly more number of patients were (16/40) in standard treatment in contrast to 6/41 patients on Arshkeyt&#x02122; treatment had presence of Grade 1 hemorrhoids (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). This can be explained as &#x0201c;Arshkeyt&#x02122; Tablets&#x0201d; contains ingredients like <italic>Arshoghni vati</italic>[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and <italic>Triphala guggul</italic>[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] which have potential to shrink the hemorrhoid mass. &#x0201c;Arshkeyt&#x02122; Powder&#x0201d; in addition to <italic>P. ovata</italic> (<italic>Isabgul</italic>) contains <italic>I. turpethum</italic>,[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] <italic>C. angustifolia</italic>,[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] <italic>G. glabra</italic>, and <italic>C. fistula</italic> to regulate smooth bowel movement, thus relieving the straining factor in hemorrhoids.</p><p>When the patients were evaluated on day 21 for recurrence of bleeding, significantly more number of patients showed recurrence when standard treatment was stopped at day 14, while none of the patients treated with Arshkeyt&#x02122; showed recurrence of bleeding (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). This could be explained due to presence of ingredients like <italic>M. pudica</italic>, used to arrest bleeding and promote wound healing;[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] <italic>M. ferrea</italic> used as anti-inflammatory, anti-ulcer, and anti-microbial agent;[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and <italic>P. pinnata</italic> used as antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory agents in hemorrhoids.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] It also appears from the results that Arshkeyt&#x02122; is more beneficial in case of bleeding hemorrhoids as compared to nonbleeding hemorrhoids (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05).
