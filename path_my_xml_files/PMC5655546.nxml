Clusters of households were randomly assigned (1:1), with a sequence computer-generated by a minimisation process, to intervention or usual practice (control) groups. Intervention households that had farmed or had used or stored pesticide in the preceding agricultural season were given a lockable storage container. Further promotion of use of the containers was restricted to community posters and 6-monthly reminders during routine community meetings. The primary outcome was incidence of pesticide self-poisoning in people aged 14 years or older during 3 years of follow-up. Identification of outcome events was done by staff who were unaware of group allocation. Analysis was by intention to treat.

In individuals aged 14 years or older, 611 cases of pesticide self-poisoning had occurred by 3 years in the intervention group compared with 641 cases in the control group; incidence of pesticide self-poisoning did not differ between groups (293&#x000b7;3 per 100&#x02008;000 person-years of follow-up in the intervention group <italic>vs</italic> 318&#x000b7;0 per 100&#x02008;000 in the control group; rate ratio [RR] 0&#x000b7;93, 95% CI 0&#x000b7;80&#x02013;1&#x000b7;08; p=0&#x000b7;33).

We recruited geographical clusters of households primarily from the Mahaweli H irrigation region, including the divisional secretariats of Thambuttegama, Thalawa, Galnewa, Rajanganaya, Ipolagama, and Nochchiyagama, because of the high use of pesticides in agriculture and high incidence of pesticide self-poisoning in this region.

We initially planned to collect case data from both village level public health midwives and small rural peripheral hospitals. However, early pilot work, before the distribution of lockable containers, showed the difficulties of midwives as sources of case data and additional resources were deployed at peripheral hospital units. The results of the end of study demographic survey showed this strategy to be highly effective (see discussion). Another change to the protocol was a reduction in the proportion of the study sample that received the end of study demographic survey from 100% to 26%, for logistical reasons.</p><p>Ethics approval was received from the research ethics committees of the University of Peradeniya and Rajarata University of Sri Lanka. The study was approved by the Provincial Department of Health Services, North Central Province, and the Sri Lankan Ministry of Health. A data monitoring committee was established for the trial and a charter written. No formal stopping rules or interim analyses were planned. The data monitoring committee was responsible for safeguarding the interests of trial participants and monitoring the quality of the research.</p></sec><sec id="cesec40"><title>Randomisation and masking</title><p>Clusters of households were the unit of randomisation for this study (median number of households per cluster 272 [IQR 207&#x02013;344]). For logistical reasons, clusters were grouped into ten bands. Clusters were delineated after completion of household surveys in each band. Cluster boundaries were not based on civil village boundaries alone because some villages were closely intertwined, increasing the risk of contamination. To increase geographical separation, and reduce the risk of contamination between clusters caused by, for example, the onward sale of unused storage containers, we actively identified natural and social boundaries between communities. This approach included identifying patterns of social interaction between communities, geographical features such as irrigation canals, roads, and forests, as well as means of and reasons for access such as transport to commercial areas, schools, and temples. Random allocation of clusters within each band to the intervention or control groups was done by a person not involved in recruitment, intervention, or monitoring, with a bespoke computer program written in Stata. Minimisation was used to reduce imbalance between groups in the number of clusters allocated to each group, number of individuals in households eligible for a pesticide storage container, and rate of previous pesticide self-poisoning in the cluster. A random aspect was maintained in the minimisation, which prevented allocations being anticipated.<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref></p><p>To maintain masking and minimise bias, we had separate study teams for recruitment, randomisation, intervention, outcome data collection, outcome linkage, and analysis, with limited interaction.<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> Identification of outcome events was done by staff who were unaware of group allocation.</p></sec><sec id="cesec50"><title>Procedures</title><p>After randomisation, the <italic>Grama Niladharis</italic> in intervention clusters were informed and arrangements made for the distribution of lockable pesticide storage containers to eligible households. Households were deemed eligible if they farmed or had used or stored pesticides in the preceding agricultural season. To encourage compliance and reduce the risks associated with bringing pesticides into the home, we took care to design a container acceptable to the community<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> that could be positioned outside the house. The design of the lockable storage container was informed by discussion with the local communities and 4 years of piloting.<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> The container was made from ultraviolet-resistant plastic (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>); we recommended that it be buried in the ground for security.<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> The container had two lids to protect the lock and the contents, respectively, against moisture. Each container had 20 cm anchors extending sideways from the bottom to prevent it being pulled up out of the ground. A small community demonstration was given to recipients to promote the correct installation and use of the container. Substantial efforts were made to ensure that containers were installed; farmers were given a choice as to their preferred location for the container&#x02014;ie, in their fields, home garden, or house. Researchers subsequently visited households to ensure installation in all eligible households. Further promotion of use of the containers after distribution was restricted to posters hung up in intervention communities and 6-monthly presentations at community farmer meetings. No contact was made with households for 3 years, apart from those in the five sub-villages (605 households, 2% of intervention households) randomly chosen from intervention clusters to study use of the lockable containers. Households in the control group received no intervention.</p><p>Data on cases of fatal and non-fatal pesticide self-poisoning, accidental poisoning, and all forms of non-fatal and fatal self-harm were prospectively collected from several sources. Most patients with poisoning or self-harm presented first to small peripheral hospitals (median number of beds 42 [range 12&#x02013;133]) spread across the district (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>). After triage and treatment, some patients were transferred to a secondary level hospital within the study area (Thambuttegama) or the main Anuradhapura District tertiary level hospital (Anuradhapura Teaching Hospital). Patients admitted for poisoning or self-harm to the two main hospitals were identified by research assistants attending the medical wards daily, and checking admissions to surgical, paediatric, and intensive care wards on a weekly basis, and the Anuradhapura Teaching Hospital morgue at the end of follow-up.</p><p>All remaining peripheral hospitals (n=9) within the study area were visited at least every other day by researchers to identify poisoning or self-harm admissions. Cases were identified by researchers who were not aware of the person's allocation. Field research officers also visited hospitals situated just outside the study area (n=2, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>) to identify cases that had bypassed the local hospital, through checks of the admission and transfer books and discussion with relevant staff. During the study, we built up close relationships with medical and nursing staff in the peripheral hospitals, resulting in researchers often being telephoned when cases presented to these hospitals. Private inpatient care is restricted in the district; our previous surveys of these hospitals suggested that patients who self-harm did not seek care in these facilities.<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref></p><p>Deaths that occurred before hospital presentation were identified by regular review of the records of local coroners and police. At the end of the study, we sought additional cases by examination of records belonging to local magistrates and district coroners.</p><p>After identification of a case, a researcher obtained demographic and address data from the medical records, the patient, or a relative. The researcher did not enquire about the presence of pesticide containers in the case's household to sustain masking to allocation. These data were shared by telephone with a case-matching researcher in a central office who searched for the person on the baseline survey database and allocated the case to a unique household or individual study identifier. If necessary, the researcher re-contacted the patient or relative in hospital, or rarely in their village if the patient had been discharged, to obtain further information to allow matching to baseline records. Again, no effort was made to identify whether the household had a pesticide storage container. The case-matching researcher had no role in randomisation, container distribution, case follow-up, or data collection.</p><p>Follow-up to identify study endpoints was started after the first round of container distribution in each band and continued until 3 years after the last round of distribution. After completion of 3 years of follow-up, a repeat household survey was done in 13&#x02008;999 (26%) households to estimate migration in and out of the area during the study, and to assess the use and locking of pesticide containers.</p><p>To assess adherence during the 3 years of follow-up, five sub-villages in five intervention clusters were selected at random from across the study area for annual review of use of the pesticide containers. Each village was visited twice during the study, use of containers recorded, and household opinions on their usefulness elicited through a survey and focus groups.</p></sec><sec id="cesec60"><title>Outcomes</title><p>The primary outcome was the incidence of pesticide self-poisoning, whether fatal or non-fatal, in individuals aged 14 years or older, during a 3-year follow-up period starting from completion of container distribution to each band (follow-up was staggered across bands). Secondary outcomes were the incidence of pesticide poisoning in children (aged &#x0003c;14 years), pesticide poisoning in general (deliberate and accidental, all ages), self-poisoning (all substances, fatal and non-fatal, age &#x02265;14 years), non-fatal self-harm (all methods, age &#x02265;14 years), fatal self-harm (all methods, age &#x02265;14 years), non-fatal non-pesticide self-poisoning (age &#x02265;14 years), and fatal non-pesticide self-poisoning (age &#x02265;14 years).</p></sec><sec id="cesec70"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>We have previously justified the sample size target in detail.<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> Assuming a primary outcome incidence of 175 per 100&#x02008;000 person-years in the control group, and an inflation factor of 1&#x000b7;75 to accommodate the clustered design, further accommodating contamination and non-use of safe storage containers, at least 217&#x02008;944 person-years of follow-up in each study group (approximately 24&#x02008;216 households; 81 clusters per group; 162 in total) would give 80% power to detect a 33% reduction to 117 events per 100&#x02008;000 person-years in the intervention group.</p><p>The main analysis was prespecified in a signed and dated (Aug 23, 2016) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://research-information.bristol.ac.uk/files/85090859/20160720_Safe_Storage_Stats_Plan_1_0_SIGNED.pdf" id="interrefs30">statistical analysis plan</ext-link> that was made publicly available before release of the data for analysis. The primary analysis followed the intention-to-treat principle, comparing the observed incidence of self-poisoning with pesticides between individuals in clusters allocated to the intervention group, and individuals in clusters allocated to the control group. A random effect Poisson regression model was used, accommodating variation between clusters in the primary outcome incidence as a gamma distribution. This analysis was adjusted for the minimisation variables&#x02014;ie, number of individuals in households eligible for a lockable storage container and rate of previous pesticide self-poisoning in the cluster, both included as a trend term across three tertiles. This approach was adapted to each of the secondary outcomes.</p><p>Prespecified subgroup analyses investigated whether the effectiveness of the intervention was modified by the cluster-level historical rate of self-poisoning, the cluster-level proportion of households reporting a member having problems with alcohol (both established in the baseline survey), the cluster-level proportion of households provided with a lockable box, and the year of follow-up. For each of these analyses in turn interaction terms were generated, distinguishing the subgroups in the intervention and control groups, and these were added to the statistical model to test the evidence that the intervention effect varied by subgroup. We did a sensitivity analysis excluding the five clusters in which container use was reviewed, because their participation in this assessment might have increased household compliance with safe storage. All analyses were done with Stata statistical software, version 14.2.

The location of 144 (1%) containers was unknown or they had been returned. At the end of 3 years of follow-up, surveys of 6937 (26%) of 27&#x02008;091 households in the intervention group showed that 4264 (61%) households were storing pesticides and 3698 (53%) were locking pesticides away sometimes or always. Surveys of 7062 (27%) of 26&#x02008;291 households in the control group showed that a similar number (3681 [52%]) were storing pesticides but only 351 (5%) households were locking pesticides away sometimes or always. Data from 605 households in the five villages in which container use was assessed (number of households eligible for container 52, 78, 104, 171, and 208, respectively) showed that self-reported use of the locked containers was 72% (367 of 507) after 1 year and 76% (339 of 448) after 2 years.</p><p>We recorded 1252 cases of pesticide self-poisoning in individuals aged 14 years or older from the study area during the 3 years of follow-up.

Of the cases matched to individuals, 516 cases occurred in 500 individuals in the intervention group (15 [3%] individuals had more than one episode), and 561 cases occurred in 547 individuals in the control group (12 [2%] individuals had more than one episode).</p><p>1931 records were collected for the 1252 cases of pesticide self-poisoning.

We observed no difference between study groups in the source of data collection for cases. 11 deaths that occurred before hospital presentation were identified by review of the records of local coroners and seven by review of police records. 11 deaths that occurred before hospital presentation were identified in routine monitoring during the surveillance period and an additional six cases at the end of the 3 year follow-up.</p><p>There were fewer cases of pesticide self-poisoning in the intervention group (611 cases) than in the control group (641 cases; <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>); the incidence of pesticide self-poisoning in individuals aged 14 years or older did not differ between groups (293&#x000b7;3 per 100&#x02008;000 person-years of follow-up in the intervention group <italic>vs</italic> 318&#x000b7;0 per 100&#x02008;000 in the control group; rate ratio 0&#x000b7;93, 95% CI 0&#x000b7;80&#x02013;1&#x000b7;08; p=0&#x000b7;33).

episodes of pesticide self-poisoning were reported by households. As a quality-control exercise, we attempted to match these cases to our prospective follow-up. Only six (4%, three in each group) of these cases could not be matched and were judged as being missed by the follow-up because of presentation to hospitals outside the study area and residents who maintained multiple addresses. Notably, our prospective follow-up identified 634 cases of pesticide self-poisoning in these four bands, about four times more than self-reported by households.</p><p>The design effect for the analysis of the primary outcome was estimated as the ratio of the squared standard errors for the intervention effect estimates from the random effect Poisson regression model and the standard Poisson regression model, both including covariates for the person-years of follow-up contributed by individuals in households eligible for a lockable container, and historical rate of pesticide self-poisoning in the cluster. This gave an estimate of the design effect of 1&#x000b7;75, identical to that allowed for in the sample size calculation.</p><p>We found no evidence that the intervention caused a switch from pesticide self-poisoning to other forms of self-harm.

However, results of this large pragmatic cluster-randomised controlled trial showed that improved household storage of pesticides did not reduce the incidence of pesticide self-poisoning during 3 years of follow-up.</p><p>Improved storage is a very active form of prevention, requiring persistent and lifelong effort by individuals and families to store pesticides away after purchase and use, to keep key(s) hidden, to replace locks when damaged or the key lost, and to replace damaged containers. Our analysis of five sentinel villages showed that self-reported use of locked containers was 72% by 1 year; by 3 years, surveys of households in the intervention group showed that 53% were still using the container and locking it. Repeated reminders to households might sustain effective use; this approach has been used in some previous pilot studies. However, this strategy will not be sustainable if expanded to generalised public health use. For this reason, other than the five sentinel villages, we did not access clusters after the installation check 2 weeks after distribution, relying on community posters and routine farming meetings to encourage use. However, a failure of reminders does not seem to have been pivotal because we found no evidence that the containers were more effective in the first year after distribution compared with the third year.</p><p>To reduce contamination across the study, we ensured that the containers were installed in the ground to reduce the risk of them being sold on to families in non-intervention clusters;<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> the low number of households in the control areas with pesticides locked away in non-study containers in the end of study demographic survey suggests that the idea of locking up pesticides did not effectively pass from intervention to control areas. We took account of possible contamination, and non-use of containers in intervention clusters, by substantially increasing the size of the study. The number of cases detected was higher than expected in our initial power calculations (crude population incidence 871 per 100&#x02008;000 over 3 years <italic>vs</italic> 525 per 100&#x02008;000 over 3 years estimated in our power calculations), further increasing the study power, thus ensuring that the study had sufficient power to detect an effect of magnitude important to public health.</p><p>Introduction of means restriction might result in method substitution, possibly to methods of suicide with higher case fatality (such as hanging). We found no evidence of increased rates of self-harm from other methods or non-pesticide forms of self-poisoning. The provision of the lockable container did not appear to increase the risk of self-harm because of farmers bringing pesticides into the home compound. There was a small, non-significant increase in the rate of fatal self-harm in the intervention clusters. It remains possible that provision of household storage containers might increase the incidence of higher lethality methods such as hanging, but the incidence of this method remained low in this study.</p><p>Our study has some limitations. We might have missed some non-fatal self-harm cases by using peripheral hospitals as the primary source of data. However, previous work in the North Central Province has suggested that nearly all cases of self-harm in rural areas are brought to small rural hospitals.<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> Furthermore, we have no evidence that there was differential hospital presentation between the two groups of the study and the cases substantially exceeded the predicted rate.</p><p>The research staff involved in outcome ascertainment were, as far as possible, kept masked to the trial allocation of each participant's village (cluster) of residence. However, this was not absolute because when presenting to hospital a few patients reported taking pesticides from a study container. To control this possible source of bias, we maintained multiple separate study teams with limited interactions.</p><p>This study only assessed the use of household-based storage containers, not community-based locker storage systems as proposed by some advocates.<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> However, it seems likely that compliance with a central community locker would be poorer in real life than compliance with household storage, since the former will require farmers to go away from their fields, towards the town centre to obtain pesticides.</p><p>Prevention of pesticide suicides is multi-layered, requiring work at individual, community, and population levels.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Means restriction is a key element of suicide prevention strategies, working at the community and regulatory levels.<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> Unfortunately, our findings show that improved household storage of pesticides is unlikely to be effective. Individual level interventions will be administrative and active, requiring active choices by individuals to lower their risk. Improving medical care will prevent some deaths.<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> However, this approach is difficult for the most commonly used pesticides because of the absence of new effective therapies, and the scarcity of human resources and hospital facilities in regions with many patients.<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Another strategy that has been assessed is the addition of anti-emetics to paraquat formulations; however, this intervention only had a modest effect.<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref> Commentary on the study suggested that this was the wrong approach and that restricting access through regulation was likely to be more effective.<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33</sup></xref></p><p>Other interventions at the regulatory level, including replacing highly hazardous pesticides in agricultural practice with integrated pest management and alternative less hazardous pesticides, has major beneficial effects on both pesticide suicides and total suicides.<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref> Such regulatory action in Sri Lanka, for example, has resulted in a 75% reduction in total suicides with an estimated 93&#x02008;000 lives saved over 20 years and little if any effect on agricultural yield.<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> Similar data have come from South Korea<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr"><sup>38</sup></xref> and Bangladesh.<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr"><sup>39</sup></xref> Some data from China have shown the important role of urbanisation in the reduced suicide rate reported in this country.<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr"><sup>40</sup></xref> Urbanisation is occurring worldwide, but its effect is likely to reduce the population at risk and enhance means restriction interventions.
