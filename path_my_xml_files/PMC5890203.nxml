elbows. It is generally due to chronic overload on the lateral epicondyle arising from
repetitive utilization of the carpal and the finger extensor tendons and, in particular, the
extensor carpi radialis brevis muscle<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Other etiologies of lateral epicondylitis include multicentric disruption at the origin of
extensor tendons, bursitis, calcification at the origin of extensors, degenerative changes
in the annular ligament, synovial hypertrophy, and compression of the radial nerve; diverse
surgical methods exist to mitigate these problems<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Lateral epiccondylitis pain is confined to the origin of the extensor at the epicondyle but
is characterized by point tenderness; this disease is commonly witnessed in the orthopedic
field. Diverse treatment methods have been designed and used to treat lateral epicondylitis,
such as resting, drug therapy, restriction of joint movements, physical therapy, local
injection of steroids, and surgical treatment. However, none of these have shown consistent
or predictable outcomes; the best treatment method has not yet been established<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Pain from lateral epicondylitis usually initiates after repetitive or excessive extension
of the wrists in supination. Lateral epicondyulitis is characterized by continuous slight
traumatic symptoms at the humeroradial joint and a gradual increase in such symptoms.
Missing early treatment leads to a decrease in muscular strength<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Pain is one of the problems experienced by patients and can
be potentially accompanied by physical, physiological, or psychological disability. For such
patients, rehabilitation treatment is an option. As the major symptom of lateral
epicondylitis is pain, a subjective decrease in pain should be the goal when selecting a
treatment for this condition<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is frequently used to reduce pain in
clinical settings and is simple to apply and non-invasive. TENS selectively activates
different nerve fiber groups. Nerve fibers with a large diameter, such as A&#x003b1; and A&#x003b2; fibers,
have a low threshold for activation by electrical stimulation compared to fibers with a
small diameter, such as A&#x003b4; and C fibers<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Methods to increase muscle strength include kinesitherapy utilizing isometric and isotonic
contractions. Isometric contraction triggers muscular contractions without changing joint
angles, thereby increasing muscle strength in a stable manner, but may result in elevated
blood pressure and decreased patient motivation. In contrast, isotonic contraction causes
muscular contractions through changes in joint angles, thereby increasing muscular strength,
and can provide patients with feedback via their joint and muscular proprioceptive senses
according to joint angles<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>TENS, which may reduce pain, and kinesitherapy, which may increase muscular strength, have
been separately applied in rehabilitation treatments, although no research has
simultaneously applied TENS and kinesitherapy. Accordingly, this study examined the effects
of TENS and concentric contraction of the muscles surrounding the elbow joints on pain and
muscular strength in the elbow joints of patients with lateral epicondylitis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects of this study were 30 patients who visited our hospital with the main
complaint of lateral pain in the elbow joint. All patients were diagnosed with lateral
epicondylitis of the elbow joint and tested positive during the extensor carpi radialis
brevis tension test. These patients had not undergone conservative treatments, including
resting, drug therapy, fixation, physical therapy, or local injection of steroids, for
longer than three months. This study excluded patients who had hemostatic disorder, were
pregnant, had tumors, or had neurological disease. All subjects were randomly and equally
assigned to an experimental group that conducted concentric contraction exercises in sync
with a TENS cycle and a control group that performed concentric contraction after the
application of TENS. All treatments and evaluations were carried out by one physical
therapist with more than 10&#x02005;years of clinical experience. Before the experiment, the
purpose, process, and side effects of the experiment were explained in detail to the
subjects. All provided written informed consent prior to participation according as the
ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinki.</p><p>A low frequency TENS stimulator, automatically set at a frequency of 3 to 20&#x02005;Hz, was used.
Two TENS pads were attached to the subjects: one to the flexor and one to extensor of the
elbow joints. Electrical stimulation was then applied to the pads attached to the extensor
and the flexor in a sequential and repetitive manner. The treatment intensity was heightened
to the extent that the patient felt the most comfortable within the range where visible
contractions were triggered. This treatment was applied for 15 minutes three times per week
for four weeks (a total of 12 times). The concentric contraction of the elbow joints was
performed with each patient sitting on a chair with his or her elbow joint flexed at 19
degrees and with his or her forearms and wrist joints in a neutral position. Concentric
contractions were carried out to the extent that the patient could perform them. Concentric
contractions were also applied for 15 minutes three times per week for four weeks (a total
of 12 times), either during or after the TENS treatment.</p><p>Patients used a 10-cm visual analogue scale (VAS), selecting an integer from 1 (no pain) to
10 (unbearable pain), to evaluate the level of pain in their elbow joints. To measure the
strength of muscles around the elbow joints, the subjects&#x02019; paretic grip strength was
measured using an electronic grip strength dynamometer. Each subject sat straight in an
armchair, placed his or her forearm on the armrests, flexed the elbow joint at 90 degrees
with the forearm and the elbow joint in a neutral position and the trunk and the arm
positioned at an angle of 15 degrees from one another, and pulled the grip with all of his
or her strength. The average value of three measurements was used as the measured value of
grip strength. A pre-test was conducted before the first intervention, and a post-test was
performed after the last intervention.</p><p>All statistical values were described as averages &#x000b1; standard deviations, and statistical
analyses were performed in the SPSS 18.0 software. Descriptive statistics were employed to
examine the mean and the standard deviation of the dependent variable, and a paired t-test
was used to assess changes in each group before and after the experiment. An independent
t-test was carried out to compare differences between the groups. The significance level was
set at &#x003b1;&#x0003c;0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>In this study, the VAS statistically significantly decreased in the post-test compared to

epicondylitis is unidentifiable in many cases. Lateral epicondylitis is characterized by
tenderness on the lateral epicondyle of the humerus and by pain occurring in the lateral
part of the elbow joints<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition,
lateral epicondylitis usually occurs during flexion of the elbow joints, extension of the
wrist joints, or the gripping of objects. It may be accompanied by severe anxiety and
depression, thereby complicating pain control as a result of lowered adhesion to treatment
due to severity and long-term duration of pain<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Non-surgical methods to treat lateral epicondylitis include resting, electrical
stimulation, restriction of joint movements, injection of drugs, extracorporeal shock wave
therapy, and kinesitherapy; surgical operations may also be needed<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Non-invasive electrical stimulation therapy or
kinesitherapy are several non-surgical methods with fewer side effects than invasive
injections or surgical treatment and are therefore commonly used for rehabilitation
treatment in the clinical setting<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Gripping is a delicate motion that occurs via the joint action of the flexors and the
extensors of the wrists, not merely the action of the flexors of the hands. As grip strength
increases, the extensor carpi ulnaris muscle is mobilized in addition to the already
activated extensor carpi radialis brevis<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. The extensor carpi radialis longus muscle and even the
brachioradialis muscle can also be mobilized according to the posture during gripping and
the degree of grip strength. Repetitive gripping leads to the excessive utilization of the
extensors of the wrist joints, decreasing overall extension strength of the wrists and also
triggering radiating pain from the arms to the wrists; such pain weakens grip strength<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Patients with lateral epicondylitis experience decreased grip strength as a result of pain.
Grip strength is associated with decrease in bone density in women and may be used to
predict early death rates, onset of a disability, post-operative complications, and
decreased cognitive ability in elderly people<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. This study examined the effects of active concentric contraction
of the wrist flexors and extensors according to the utilized stimulation frequency of TENS
on pain and grip strength in patients with lateral epicondylitis. In the results of this
study, pain and grip strength significantly differed in the post-test compared to the
pre-test in both the experimental group and the control group. Moreover, changes in grip
strength were more statistically significant in the experimental group that performed
concentric contractions in sync with a TENS cycle compared to the control group. In other
words, to more efficiently increase muscle strength, the concurrent application of exercise
methods and TENS of appropriate duration represents a better intervention than the separate
application of each treatment.</p><p>Improving strength is thought to be caused by passive contraction stimulation by electrical
stimulation and active contraction by concentric contraction at the same time. In other
words, we thought that the reflex contraction at the level of spinal cord stimulation by
TENS and the active contraction at the level of cerebral cortex stimulation by the
concentric contraction are superimposed to improve the muscle strength.</p><p>The limitations of this study are that the number of patients was small and that the
intervention period was short. In addition, only exercise methods employing concentric
contraction were used, and the evaluation was not continuous. Further quantitative research
on the simultaneous application of electrical stimulation therapy and kinesitherapy should
be carried out in patients with different diseases on a continuous basis.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Heales</surname><given-names>LJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Bergin</surname><given-names>MJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Vicenzino</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Forearm muscle activity in lateral epicondylalgia: a
