They had at least one parent with allergic disease and were randomised to receive a pHF-prebiotic formula (active; 432) or standard cow's milk formula (control; 431) for the first 26 weeks of life if parents decided to stop or supplement breastfeeding &#x0003c; 18 weeks. 324 infants were followed up for occurrence of AM until 3-5 years (ISRCTN65195597).</p><p>Primary outcome was cumulative incidence of atopic dermatitis (AD) up to 12 months in the key group of interest (KGI), which consisted of those infants that started formula &#x0003c; 28 days of age (active 375; control 383). Secondary and post-hoc outcomes are reported on all subjects randomised.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>In the KGI, AD developed in 93/324 (29%) infants randomised to control and 84/293 (29%) to active (OR 0.94 - [95%CI 0.65-1.36]). We found no difference in AM at 3-5 years. The active group had lower serum cow's milk (CM) IgG1 at 6 months than the control (p&#x0003c;0.0001) and this difference was still observed at 3 years (p=0.007). Higher CM-IgG1 levels at 6 months were significantly associated with development of specific IgE (CM, hen's egg) at 3 years (p&#x0003c;0.05). We found no difference between groups in adverse events.</p><p>Post-hoc analyses were performed on infants who had not introduced solids &#x0003c; 18 weeks (n=312). In this subgroup, active formula was associated with reduced AM at 3-5 years (n=144; p=0.0334) and lower levels of total-IgE and hen's egg IgE at 6 months (n=239, p=0.0092 and n=244, p=0.0061) compared with control group.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Early feeding with a pHF-prebiotic formula was not associated with a reduced risk of AD at 12 months or AM at 3-5 years. The pHF-prebiotic formula use did show a persistent immune-modulatory effect and possibly a reduced occurrence of AM in infants who introduced solids according to guidelines (&#x0003e; 18 weeks).</p></sec></body></article>
