Twenty-two well-trained cross-country skiers (31 &#x000b1; 4 years, 77 &#x000b1; 9 kg, 181 &#x000b1; 8 cm, VO<sub>2max</sub> running: 64 &#x000b1; 5 mL&#x000b7;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x000b7;min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) were counter-balanced to either a combined muscular endurance and running interval training group [MET; <italic>n</italic> = 11 (&#x02642; = 9, &#x02640; = 2)], or an endurance running interval training group [ET; <italic>n</italic> = 11 (&#x02642; = 9, &#x02640; = 2)]. Both groups continued their normal low-and moderate intensity training, but replaced 2 weekly high intensity-training sessions with two project-specific sessions for 6 weeks. In these sessions, MET combined upper-body muscular endurance training (4 &#x000d7; 30 repetitions, 90 s rest between sets) and running intervals (3 &#x000d7; 4 or 2 &#x000d7; 6 min, 3 min rest), while ET performed running intervals only (6 &#x000d7; 4 or 4 &#x000d7; 6 min, 3 min rest). The DP test-protocol consisted of 50 min submaximal poling for O<sub>2</sub>-cost measurement, followed by a self-paced 1,000-m performance test. In addition, subjects performed a VO<sub>2max</sub> test in running. MET increased muscular endurance (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) and 1RM in simulated DP (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01) more than ET. Further, MET reduced the 1,000-m time and O<sub>2</sub>-cost compared to baseline values (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05), and tended to improve the 1,000-m time more than ET (<italic>P</italic> = 0.06). There were no changes in VO<sub>2max</sub> running or VO<sub>2peak</sub> DP in either MET or ET. In conclusion, 6 weeks of muscular endurance training increased both muscular endurance and 1RM in simulated DP. Further, specific upper-body muscular endurance training improved DP performance and thus, seems as a promising training model to optimize performance in well-trained cross-country skiers.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>cross-country skiing</kwd><kwd>high-intensity training</kwd><kwd>maximal oxygen uptake</kwd><kwd>O<sub>2</sub>-cost</kwd><kwd>running</kwd><kwd>training intensity</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="7"/><table-count count="4"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="31"/><page-count count="10"/><word-count count="6410"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>In cross-country (XC) skiing, the classic style double poling (DP) technique has been considerably developed over the last decade and is today the main technique used in races. The DP technique is characterized by a symmetrical DP action, which transfers propulsive forces solely through the poles. This emphasizes the importance of well-developed upper-body power in employing DP successfully throughout an entire race (St&#x000f6;ggl et al., <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Losnegard et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Consequently, specific upper-body training, both in research and practical situations, has gained interest as a training model for improving such abilities (Nilsson et al., <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Terzis et al., <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Losnegard et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Skattebo et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>).</p><p>The introduction of new competition formats such as sprint and mass starts has also increased the importance of a high work-intensity during the closing part of races, which makes it vital to conserve power for the final sprint. This requirement could potentially be met by working at a lower relative intensity during the submaximal part of the competition, resulting in less fatigued muscles during the final sprint (Bassett and Howley, <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>). However, limited data are available on which type of training is most efficient in improving such abilities in XC skiing generally and DP more specifically.</p><p>In previous research, the main training model for developing upper-body power to improve DP performance has been heavy strength training (&#x02264;12 repetition maximum). However, these studies have yielded varying results, displaying both large (Hoff et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; &#x000d8;steras et al., <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>) and trivial effects (Losnegard et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Skattebo et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Furthermore, the metabolic response during DP seems to be different for the arms and legs, indicating that intense upper-body endurance training may increase the arms' ability to extract oxygen and thus enhance DP performance (Rud et al., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>).</p><p>The effect of muscular endurance training (20&#x02013;100 reps/set, Campos et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>) on endurance performance has been investigated in various sports including running (Mikkola et al., <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Sedano et al., <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) and rowing (Ebben et al., <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Gallagher et al., <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Such training seem to target different muscular and neurological adaptations compared to heavy strength training; e.g., mitochondria and capillary density, muscle fiber composition and cross-sectional area (Campos et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). Specifically for XC skiing, Nilsson et al. (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>) showed that 20-s or 180-s interval training in a DP ergometer increased both 30-s and 6-min power output in well-trained XC skiers, while Vandbakk et al. (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) demonstrated increased time to exhaustion after 8 weeks of 30-s DP intervals. This indicates that upper-body power training might have the potential to increase performance in XC skiing, although data on the effect on finishing abilities is limited.</p><p>In terms of training, three variables (intensity, duration, and frequency) together set the training load with the explicit goal of maximizing performance (Seiler, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). When investigating the effect of a specific training program for recreational athletes, often with limited time to execute training, it seems important to keep the three variables similar before and during interventions to determine the effect of the intervention itself. Otherwise, it could be unclear whether improved performance is a result of adaptations related to the added training, or changed training load in general. The aim of the present study was, therefore, to investigate the effect of replacing parts of high intensity interval training with muscular endurance training for 6 weeks on performance after completing 50 min of submaximal DP. The main hypotheses of the present study were; Upper body muscular endurance training would (I) improve performance following 50-min of double poling, and (II) reduce O<sub>2</sub>-cost during submaximal double poling.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>During the intervention, two men withdrew from the project due to unrelated reasons. In total, 22 well-trained XC skiers (18 males and 4 females) completed the study with the required number of completed project-specific training sessions (minimum adherence 85%; MET = 94 &#x000b1; 8% adherence; ET = 90 &#x000b1; 5% adherence). Inclusion criteria were completing the long-distance XC ski race <italic>Birkebeinerrennet</italic> the previous year with a finishing time &#x0003c;4 h and &#x0003c; 3 h 30 min for females and males respectively. None of the subjects performed specific upper-body muscular endurance training systematically prior to the start of the study, but all performed weekly aerobic high-intensive interval training. After completing the pre-test, participants were counter-balanced to either a muscular endurance training group (MET: 30 &#x000b1; 4 years, 76 &#x000b1; 8 kg, 180 &#x000b1; 7 cm) or an endurance training group (ET: 32 &#x000b1; 4 years, 78 &#x000b1; 11 kg, 182 &#x000b1; 10 cm) based on the following pre-test characteristics: DP 1,000-m time, VO<sub>2max</sub> running, 1 repetition maximum (1RM) and gender. All skiers gave their written informed consent before participating. The study was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki and Norwegian law.</p></sec><sec><title>Design</title><p>The investigation was conducted during the pre-competition period for XC skiers (August&#x02013;November), and contained a 6-week intervention period, enclosed by a pre- and post-test (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). The week before pre-tests, subjects performed one familiarization session on the rollerski treadmill which consisted of three different submaximal speeds, followed by a 1,000-m performance test (see <italic>Prolonged double poling protocol</italic>). Then, a familiarization session with the muscular endurance exercise in standing DP was performed, using the cable-pulley and consisted of a warm-up and 1RM test (2&#x02013;3 attempts). Pre- and post-tests were conducted in the week immediately before and after the training period and included 2 test days for each participant, separated by at least 48 h. Subjects were not allowed to perform any strength training the day before testing, and only a maximum of 90 min endurance training at low intensity. Day 1 included a running VO<sub>2max</sub> test followed by an upper-body 1RM and a muscular endurance test in a cable-pulling apparatus. Day 2 included a submaximal and maximal test in DP on a rollerski treadmill. During the intervention period, both groups replaced two of their weekly high-intensity interval training (HIT) sessions with a specific protocol based on their respective group. For MET, these sessions consisted of both running intervals and upper-body muscular endurance training, while for ET it involved two sessions with running intervals only. During the other weekly training sessions, the subjects were encouraged to maintain their normal training routines.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>The test-battery and time-line of the study.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Familiarization</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">x</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Test day 1:</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;&#x000a0;&#x000a0;VO<sub>2max</sub>running test</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">x</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">x</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;&#x000a0;&#x000a0;1RM- and muscular endurance test</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">x</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">x</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Test day 2:</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr style="border-bottom: thin solid #000000;"><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;&#x000a0;&#x000a0;Double poling protocol</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">x</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">x</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pre-test</td><td valign="top" align="center" colspan="6" rowspan="1">Intervention</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Post-test</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><inline-graphic xlink:href="fphys-08-00690-i0001.jpg"/></td><td valign="top" align="center" colspan="6" rowspan="1"><inline-graphic xlink:href="fphys-08-00690-i0002.jpg"/></td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><inline-graphic xlink:href="fphys-08-00690-i0001.jpg"/></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Week:</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;2</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;1</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><italic>VO<sub>2max</sub>, maximal oxygen uptake; RM, repetition maximum</italic>.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec><sec><title>Running VO<sub>2max</sub> (day 1)</title><p>Following a 20-min warm up (60&#x02013;85% of HR<sub>peak</sub>), subjects performed a VO<sub>2max</sub> running test at a 10.5% incline with stepwise increments of 1 km-h<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> every minute until volitional exhaustion.

Further, subjects performed three different submaximal speeds (50 min total), followed directly by a 1,000-m test (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). All DP tests were conducted at 2.5&#x000b0;. Submaximal speeds were based on the linear relationship between workload and O<sub>2</sub>-cost, with the aim of matching speed to 75% of VO<sub>2peak</sub> DP from 15 to 50 min and adjusted with the RPE (rate of perceived exertion, Borg, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">1982</xref>) with the aim of not exceeding 16 on the RPE-scale before the 1,000-m test. Thus, speeds were individually set, but were identical for each participant in the pre- and post-test. The average speed for all participants at submaximal speeds one, two and three was 2.3 &#x000b1; 0.3, 2.7 &#x000b1; 0.4 and 3.0 &#x000b1; 0.5 m&#x000b7;s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, respectively. The O<sub>2</sub>-cost was calculated from 8-10, 13-15, 18-20, 33-35 and 48-50 min during the prolonged submaximal test. Heart rate (HR) was registered after 10, 15, 20, 35, and 50 min and RPE after 20, 35, and 45 min. The 1,000-m test was a modified protocol from Losnegard et al. (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). In brief, a fixed individual speed, identical at pre- and post-test, was set for the initial 200 m to avoid over-pacing (avg. 3.41 &#x000b1; 0.5 m&#x000b7;s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>). Thereafter, the subjects were free to adjust their speed based on their position on the treadmill (0.25 m&#x000b7;s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> increase or decrease). VO<sub>2</sub> and HR were measured continuously, and the highest VO<sub>2</sub> and HR (avg. 30 s) were considered peak values. RPE was reported immediately after finishing the test.

The gas analysers and the flow turbine (Tripel V; Erick Jeager GmbH, Hoechberg, Germany) were calibrated before each test according to the instruction manual, as described previously (Losnegard et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). The same gas analyser was used during the running VO<sub>2max</sub> test and DP protocol. Heart rate was recorded using a Polar V800 (Polar Electro Oy, Kempele, Finland). A rollerski treadmill with belt dimension 3 &#x000d7; 4.5 m (Rodby, S&#x000f6;dertelje, Sweden), was used during the running VO<sub>2max</sub> test and the prolonged DP test. Two different pairs of rollerskis (Swenor Fiberglass, Tr&#x000f8;sken, Norway), with front wheel type 2 and rear wheel type 3, were used depending on which ski binding system the skiers used (SNS, Salomon, Annecy, France or NNN, Rottefella, Klokkarstua, Norway). The rollerski friction coefficient was 0.026 before, during and after the project, and tested as described in Hoffman et al. (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">1990</xref>).

The training sessions lasted approx. 50 min, including a 10 min warm-up. Running intervals lasted 4 or 6 min with 3 min rest periods in-between. During the muscular endurance training, there was a passive rest of 90 s between sets. Speed during running intervals was based on individual HR<sub>max</sub> measured during the VO<sub>2max</sub> running test, and adjusted to match the intended HR-zone within 90 s of trial-start (88&#x02013;92% of HR<sub>max</sub>) (Helgerud et al., <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). The intended intensity has previously been shown to be advantageous in increasing the maximal oxygen uptake in well-trained athletes (Seiler et al., <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). All subjects where individually supervised during the 1st, 5th, and 9th training session to ensure proper intensity during intervals. Additionally, MET was observed in simulated DP to ensure proper technique and the load was adjusted according to Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>. All training from the 4 weeks prior to the beginning of the intervention until the end of the intervention period were reported. The endurance training intensity was divided into three HR zones: low-intensity (LIT; 60&#x02013;81% of peak HR<sub>max</sub>), moderate-intensity (MIT; 82&#x02013;87%) and high-intensity training (HIT 88&#x02013;100%), based on intensity zones developed by the Norwegian Olympic Federation.</p><table-wrap id="T2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Training programs for the 2 weekly project sessions in MET (Combined endurance training and muscular endurance training) and ET (endurance training).</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Week</bold></th><th valign="top" align="center" colspan="5" style="border-bottom: thin solid #000000;" rowspan="1"><bold>MET</bold></th><th valign="top" align="center" colspan="2" style="border-bottom: thin solid #000000;" rowspan="1"><bold>ET</bold></th></tr><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th valign="top" align="center" colspan="2" style="border-bottom: thin solid #000000;" rowspan="1"><bold>Running interval</bold></th><th valign="top" align="center" colspan="3" style="border-bottom: thin solid #000000;" rowspan="1"><bold>Muscular endurance</bold></th><th valign="top" align="center" colspan="2" style="border-bottom: thin solid #000000;" rowspan="1"><bold>Running interval</bold></th></tr><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Duration (sets &#x000d7; min)</bold></th><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Intensity (% HR<sub>peak</sub>)</bold></th><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Sets</bold></th><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Rep</bold></th><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Workload (% 1 RM)</bold></th><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Duration (sets &#x000d7; min)</bold></th><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Intensity (% of HR<sub>peak</sub>)</bold></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1&#x02013;2</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3 &#x000d7; 4/2 &#x000d7; 6</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">88&#x02013;92</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">30</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">42.5</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6 &#x000d7; 4/4 &#x000d7; 6</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">88&#x02013;92</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3&#x02013;4</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3 &#x000d7; 4/2 &#x000d7; 6</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">88&#x02013;92</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">30</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">45</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6 &#x000d7; 4/4 &#x000d7; 6</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">88&#x02013;92</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5&#x02013;6</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3 &#x000d7; 4/2 &#x000d7; 6</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">88&#x02013;92</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">30</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">47.5</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6 &#x000d7; 4/4 &#x000d7; 6</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">88&#x02013;92</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><italic>During running intervals, a 3 min rest was applied</italic>.</p><p><italic>HR<sub>peak</sub>, peak heart rate; RM, repetition maximum</italic>.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All data are presented as mean &#x000b1; standard deviation (SD).

The principal findings were: (I) Six weeks of muscular endurance training increased muscular endurance and maximal strength in a simulated DP exercise. (II) MET tended to improve 1,000-m DP performance after 50 min of submaximal DP compared to ET. (III) MET reduced the O<sub>2</sub>-cost during submaximal DP, but it was not significant different from ET. (IV) No changes in VO<sub>2peak</sub> DP or VO<sub>2max</sub> running were found in either group.</p><p>A novel finding of the present study was that upper-body muscular endurance training improved 1,000-m poling time completed immediately after 50 min of submaximal DP. In a similar study, but with a slightly different training model, Nilsson et al. (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>) found a significant improvement in mean power output during a 6-min all-out test after 6 weeks of 20-s DP interval training. Moreover, Vandbakk et al. (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) showed that 30-s DP intervals over ~8 weeks resulted in improved time to exhaustion in the interval group, but not in the control group. Together, these studies indicate that short-term upper-body endurance training may be a promising training model and, thus, have direct applications for well-trained skiers aiming to improve their DP performance. However, whether these findings on an indoor treadmill are valid on snow needs to be examined.</p><p>The improved 1,000-m time should be a result of improved energy turnover and/or reduced O<sub>2</sub>-cost (Bassett and Howley, <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>). No significant changes were measured in aerobic energy turnover in either group while the anaerobic capacity was not estimated (due to methodology). However, the relative change in O<sub>2</sub>-cost during prolonged DP was in favor the group that had trained upper-body muscular endurance, possibly contributing to the enhanced performance due to a lower level of fatigue before the 1,000-m time. These findings are in accordance with R&#x000f8;nnestad et al. (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) who showed increased 5 min all-out performance following 185 min of cycling after a heavy strength training intervention. However, mechanisms for increase in work economy, when including heavy strength training or muscular endurance training, remain unclear. Furthermore, in both the present study and in R&#x000f8;nnestad et al. (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) the reduction in O<sub>2</sub>-cost should be taken with caution since the relative differences in O<sub>2</sub>-cost between groups was not significant.</p><p>The ratio VO<sub>2peak</sub> DP/VO<sub>2max</sub> running was ~90% at pre-test, which is similar to other studies (Rud et al., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Skattebo et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). However, no changes were observed in either group, a finding consistent with most studies on heavy strength training, short-term speed training or endurance training in XC skiing (Hoff et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>; &#x000d8;steras et al., <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Nilsson et al., <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; R&#x000f8;nnestad et al., <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Skattebo et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Thus, reducing this &#x0201c;gap&#x0201d; has been speculated to be one of the possible training benefits of increased upper-body training in XC skiers (Sandbakk and Holmberg, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). However, there is very little information on which type of training is most effective in stimulating these adaptations, and future studies should examine possible mechanisms more in detail. Interestingly, both groups displayed the same VO<sub>2max</sub> in running after the training intervention despite MET replaced half of the high-intensity interval sets with upper-body muscular endurance training. This may be important information regard tapering strategies where reduction in volume, while maintaining intensity and training frequency, have been proposed to induce an &#x0201c;optimal&#x0201d; strategy in the final weeks before competition (Bosquet et al., <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>).</p><p>The relative increase in muscular endurance per session (~1.8%) is larger than previous reported in comparable studies on specific upper-body training (0.7&#x02013;1.1%) (Stone and Coulter, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">1994</xref>; Schoenfeld et al., <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). However, Schoenfeld et al. (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) and Stone and Coulter (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">1994</xref>) included 24 and 27 training sessions respectively, compared to 12 in the current study. It is therefore possible that athletes could gain a relative large increase in muscular endurance within a few sessions. This notion is particularly interesting from a &#x0201c;block periodization&#x0201d; perspective, herein shorter training periods (1&#x02013;4 weeks) are utilized to focus on improving a few selected abilities (Issurin, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Moreover, even though the aim of the training was to increase muscular endurance, strength gain (1RM) per session in the current study was similar to studies in heavy strength training for XC skiers (0.6 vs. 0.5&#x02013;1.2% per session; Losnegard et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; R&#x000f8;nnestad et al., <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Skattebo et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). This implies that low resistance strength training could be an alternative training method to heavy strength training, at least for short-term adaptations prior to competitions or during short block periodization.</p><sec><title>Methodological considerations</title><p>We counter-balanced the two groups based on 1,000-m time, VO<sub>2max</sub> running, 1RM and gender at pre-test. No significant differences between groups were found in training volume in any of the training categories. However, since the subjects were well-trained and not elite athletes, the range between subjects was large in most categories, causing substantial variation in- and between groups. The absolute difference in total training volume of 132 min/week [485 min (MET) vs. 353 min (ET)] prior to the intervention period was mainly caused by a 107 min difference in weekly DP training on rollerski. This can indicate that MET had less potential for physiological adaptation than ET, which strengthens findings of the improved 1,000-m. On the other hand, MET reduced weekly DP training by 50 min (&#x02212;27%) from pre-intervention compared to the intervention period, and a reduction in training volume is related to tapering and potentially improved performance (Bosquet et al., <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Mujika, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Altogether, using recreational but well-trained skiers with large variations in training load may potentially be a limitation in the present study and should therefore be taken into consideration when interpreting the results. Another aspect is that HIT was replaced with muscular endurance, and not that training was added to their normal training, as done in most other studies. This was based on the fact that recreational athletes normally have limited time to execute training (e.g., full time work) and thereby relative low training volume compared to elite athletes. Hence, adding training in one group would lead to an increase in total volume, which could lead to a greater training stimuli it selves, and potentially enhanced performance. Finally, one strengthen of the present study is the applied perspective with direct practical application for coaches and athletes that aim on optimizing performance. However, one clear limitation of the study is the lacking methodology to analyse possible changes in intrinsic factors (such as muscle fiber types, mitochondria, capillary density and neuromuscular characteristics). Hence, since this was out of the scope of the present study, further studies should investigate the potential adaptations more in detail.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Six weeks of upper-body muscular endurance training increased muscular endurance and maximal strength in a simulated DP exercise and improved DP performance following 50 min submaximal trial.
