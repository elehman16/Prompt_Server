balance ability of soccer players with acute ankle sprain. [Subjects and Methods] This
study was conducted with 16 subjects who were diagnosed with ankle sprain. A cross-over
randomized design was used. Each subject performed three interventions in a random order.
Subjects were randomly assigned to an ankle balance taping, placebo taping, and no taping.
For dynamic and static balance, ability was measured using BIORescue (RM Ingenierie,
Rodes, France). Limit of stability, sway length and sway speed for one minute were
measured. [Results] The Limit of Stability, Sway length and Sway speed differed
significantly among the three different taping methods. [Conclusion] In this study, we
found that ankle balance taping was effective in terms of improving balance ability of
soccer players with an ankle sprain.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Ankle balance taping</kwd><kwd>Ankle sprain</kwd><kwd>Balance</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Ankle sprains are the most common musculoskeletal injuries<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>, and athletes with excessive movement and activities are the most
common victims. Soccer players perform many running, jumping, and turning movements, and
these movements cause excessive range of motion at the ankle joint. This excessive motion
range is the most likely cause of ankle sprain in soccer players<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>A person with an acute ankle sprain has functional limitations due to severe pain, a
limited range of motion, and increased instability of the ankle. Balance disorder is one of
the most common symptoms. Ankle sprain increases the instability of ankle, affecting dynamic
and static balance<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Many treatments are available for ankle sprain depending on the severity of the injury, but
the RICES method in the acute phase is the most representative one<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. RICES means rest, ice, compression, elevation, and support.
After such a treatment process is applied in the acute phase, the functional movement of the
ankle is improved through treatments including electrostimulation, ultrasound therapy, and
manual therapy<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. The taping method is
frequently used to prevent ankle sprain in athletes, and is widely used for therapeutic
purposes.</p><p>According to Lee et al.<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup> applied to young
soccer players with functionally instable ankle, kinesiology taping method increase dynamic
balance ability. Hong et al.<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup> reported
that application of kinesiology taping to a football player with injury is an effective
adjunct therapy.</p><p>This study evaluates the effect of ankle balance taping on dynamic and static balance of
soccer players with acute ankle sprain.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Sixteen subjects were recruited and all met the inclusion criteria for study procedure.
Subjects were recruited from a high school soccer team, after providing informed, written
consent. Written informed consent according to the ethical standards of the Declaration of
Helsinki was provided by all subjects prior to participation, and all agree to participate
in this study. The mean age of the participants was 17.6 &#x000b1; 0.7&#x02005;years, height was 175.1 &#x000b1;
5.2&#x02005;cm, weight was 77.2 &#x000b1; 9.1&#x02005;kg, BMI was 25.0 &#x000b1; 1.7, CAIT score was 10.8 &#x000b1; 4.1, and days
since onset 8.2 &#x000b1; 3.2 days. The enrollment criteria applied were as follows: (1) Suffered
ankle sprain within one month, (2) Cumberland Ankle Instability Tool (CAIT) score
&#x0003c;24<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>, (3) Not participating in any
ankle treatment program, (4) No muscular-skeletal disorder and other severe lower extremity
injury, (5) No history of ankle fracture and ankle surgery, (6) No ankle edema, (7) No
history of neurological disease, vestibular or visual disturbance, or any other pathology,
(8) No taping side effects such as skin redness.</p><p>A cross-over randomized design was used. Each subject performed three interventions in
random order. Subjects were randomly assigned to a taping, placebo taping, and no taping.
Subject characteristics and all outcome measures obtained before and after treatment were
assessed by Physician 1, who was blinded to treatment allocations. Intervention was
performed in a closed room by Physician 2, who was not involved in subject assessment. Both
physicians were instructed not to communicate with subjects about study goals or
treatments.</p><p>This study used Kinesiology tape (Kinematics Tex, SPOL Co., Ltd., Seoul, Korea) with
elasticity. The patient is seated in a comfortable position on a table that is high enough
to prevent the feet from touching the ground, while the therapist applies the tape on the
damaged ankle stretched with a tension of 30&#x02013;40%<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Ankle Balance Taping (ABT) consists of four stages<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. The first stage is posterior talar gliding taping to increase the
dorsiflexion of the ankle. The second stage is inversion taping for the inversion of ankle.
The third stage is eversion taping for the eversion of ankle. This stage applies the
Kinesiology tape twice, with approximately 50% overlapping. Since the patients have a
disability in the inversion of feet due to lateral ankle sprain, taping is done twice to
reinforce the inversion of ankle through eversion taping application. The fourth stage
applies the posterior talar gliding taping conducted in the first stage twice.</p><p>Placebo taping can be classified into two stages<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. The first stage begins from the inner malleolus, and it is applied
up to the inner middle point of the pelvic limb. The second stage begins from the outer
malleolus up to the outer middle point of the pelvic limb.</p><p>For postural adjustment ability, center of pressure (COP) was measured using BIORescue (RM
Ingenierie, Rodes, France). The elements measured included the sway length and sway speed to
evaluate the static balance ability; low value indicated good balance ability. Also, the
element measured included the Limit of stability (LOS) to evaluate the dynamic balance
ability; high value indicated good balance ability. Limit of stability (LOS), sway length,
and sway speed were measured for one minute.</p><p>Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS (SPSS Inc., Released 2009. PASW Statistics
for Windows, Version 18.0. SPSS Inc., Chicago IL, USA). General characteristics were
analyzed using descriptive statistics and results are reported as means and standard
deviations. One-way repeated ANOVA was used for the group analysis, and the post-hoc Tukey
test was used to correct for multiple comparisons. Null hypotheses of no difference were
rejected if p-values were less than 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>ABT showed significantly difference of Limit of Stability, Sway length, and Sway speed than

ability of soccer players with acute ankle sprains. After applying ankle balance taping,
sway length and sway speed (measures of static balance), and limits of stability (LOS) (a
measure of dynamic balance), improved significantly compared to the other two interventions
(placebo taping and no taping).</p><p>This study proposes that there are several taping mechanisms. First, kinesiology tape is
effective in relieving pain. Nicole et al.<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that kinesiology taping reduced chronic low back pain
(CLBP). Lee et al.<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that the
kinesiology taping badminton players with Achilles tendon pain reduced Achilles tendon pain.
Second, kinesiology taping increases the stability of the ankle. Fouladi et al.<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup> proposed that dynamic posture stability is
improved if kinesiology taping is applied to the foot.</p><p>The current study has several limitations. First, the small sample size may have influenced
certain variables and influenced the results. Therefore, these results cannot be generalized
to all subjects who have ankle instability. Second, the current experiment is a crossover
design, which makes it difficult to observe the learning effect of taping.</p><p>Further studies, including a long-term follow-up assessment, are needed to evaluate the
long-term benefits of balance taping. In conclusion, the application of Ankle Balance Taping
that uses kinesiology tape instantly increased the dynamic and static balance ability of
soccer player with an ankle sprain. Therefore ABT can be a useful alternative to prevent and
treat ankle sprain of soccer players.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was supported by a Daegu University Research Grant (2016).</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Bilgic</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Durusu</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Aliyev</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><etal>et
