This block affects thoracic intercostal nerves 7&#x02013;12, the ilioinguinal nerve, the iliohypogastric nerve and lumbar nerves 1&#x02013;3 in the lateral cutaneous branches.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-0300060516682883" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup></p><p>Although it is known that laparoscopic cholecystectomies are less painful, many patients complain of pain after the operation.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-0300060516682883" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Several methods have been used to control the postoperative pain after laparoscopic cholecystectomies, such as intravenous patient-controlled analgesia, patient-controlled thoracic epidural analgesia, and the intraperitoneal injection of local anaesthetics.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-0300060516682883" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> In addition, the intraoperative use of low-pressure pneumoperitoneum technics and a warmed air supply can reduce postoperative pain scores.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-0300060516682883" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup></p><p>Peripheral nerve block can be used as a reliable method to reduce postoperative pain and provide sufficient analgesic management.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-0300060516682883" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> When compared with the conventional TAP block technique, ultrasound-guided TAP (US-TAP) block, which provides direct ultrasonographic visualization of the anatomy during the spreading of the local anaesthetic, could serve as an alternative technique for performing a TAP block. Complications should be minimized by performing the US-TAP block because the precise location of the needle and diffusion of local anaesthetics can be observed directly using this technique.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-0300060516682883" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p><p>This present study evaluated the effects of US-TAP on pain relief by comparing two different volumes and concentrations of the local anaesthetic bupivacaine in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subjects" id="sec2-0300060516682883"><title>Patients and methods</title><sec id="sec3-0300060516682883" sec-type="subjects"><title>Patient population</title><p>This randomized study prospectively enrolled patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I&#x02013;III,<sup><xref rid="bibr7-0300060516682883" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> aged 18&#x02013;65 years, undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomies at the Department of General Surgery, Istanbul Kanuni Sultan S&#x000fc;leyman Research and Training Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey between March 2015 and April 2015. Those patients with cardiac, endocrinological or neurological diseases, those with coagulation disorders, and those with allergies to local anaesthetics, were excluded from the study. Operations that began using the laparoscopic method but were converted to open surgery for a surgical problem were also excluded. The patients were randomly allocated into two groups at study entry using the sealed envelope method: group A was treated with a 20&#x02009;ml US-TAP block (50&#x02009;mg bupivacaine&#x02009;+&#x02009;10&#x02009;ml saline solution) and group B with a 30&#x02009;ml US-TAP block (50&#x02009;mg bupivacaine&#x02009;+&#x02009;20&#x02009;ml saline solution). Demographic characteristics were recorded including age, sex and body mass index.</p><p>This study was approved by the Istanbul Kanuni Sultan S&#x000fc;leyman Education and Training Hospital Ethics Committee (no. 2015.3.10-7616). Written informed consent was obtained from each patient.</p></sec><sec id="sec4-0300060516682883"><title>Surgical and anaesthetic procedures</title><p>A saline infusion was initiated at 5&#x02013;7&#x02009;ml/kg/h for all patients. The induction of general anaesthesia was performed by using 0.05&#x02009;mg/kg midazolam intravenous (i.v.), 2&#x02013;3&#x02009;mg/kg propofol i.v., 2&#x02009;&#x000b5;g/kg fentanyl i.v. and 0.6&#x02009;mg/kg rocuronium i.v. Anaesthesia was maintained with remifentanil i.v., which was diluted to 50&#x02009;&#x000b5;g/ml, started at 0.01&#x02013;0.02&#x02009;&#x000b5;g/kg/min and 2&#x02013;3% sevoflurane and 50/50% O<sub>2</sub>-N<sub>2</sub>O mixture (2&#x02009;ml/min fresh gas flow). Remifentanil doses were increased or decreased according to the patient&#x02019;s haemodynamic response. During anaesthesia, all patients were ventilated with 6&#x02013;8&#x02009;ml/kg tidal volume. The blood pressure was regulated within 20% of the range of the blood pressure measured when entering the operation room by regulating the concentration of remifentanil. In addition, the end tidal carbon dioxide partial pressure was kept within the range of 35 to 40&#x02009;mmHg. During laparoscopic procedures, pressurized gas insuflation was used for surgical assistance. The pressure of the gas insuflation was within 10&#x02013;12&#x02009;mmHg in all patients. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was undertaken using multiple ports and all patients received laparoscopic cholecystectomy with the same technique and incision size.</p><p>When the vital signs were stabilized after endotracheal intubation, the TAP block was performed through the ultrasound-guided method, using a linear high frequency 6&#x02013;18 MHz ultrasound probe (MyLab&#x02122;Five; Esaote, Genoa, Italy). The blocks were performed by anaesthesiologists experienced with the technique. First, the external oblique, internal oblique and transverse abdominis muscles were displayed at the plane of the anterior axillary line, between the 12th rib and the iliac crest. A unilateral right-sided TAP block was performed using the in-plane technique, prior to skin incision, with a 21-gauge, 50-mm Stimuplex&#x000ae; A needle (B. Braun, Melsungen, Germany). When the tip of the needle was located in the space between the internal oblique and transverse abdominis muscles, 20&#x02009;ml (50&#x02009;mg 0.5% bupivacaine&#x02009;+&#x02009;10&#x02009;ml saline solution) or 30&#x02009;ml (50&#x02009;mg 0.5% bupivacaine&#x02009;+&#x02009;20&#x02009;ml saline solution) was injected gradually, after negative aspiration, under direct ultrasonographic visualization. Performing unilateral block would both save time and could reduce consumption of local anaesthetics.</p><p>Surgery was allowed to begin after the TAP block procedure was completed. The total consumption of remifentanil injected during the operation was recorded as the primary outcome. The anaesthesiologist who was an expert in the technique also knew the volume of local anaesthetic solution, but another anaesthesiologist who was blinded to the group allocations managed the patients. As a secondary outcome, the pain score was assessed by a physician who was blinded to the group allocations using a visual analogue scale (VAS: 0&#x02009;=&#x02009;no pain, 10&#x02009;=&#x02009;the most severe pain imaginable). At the end of the operation, the first assessment of pain was undertaken at 20&#x02009;min. After 20&#x02009;min, the patients were moved from the recovery room to the clinic and the other measurements were performed at 12&#x02009;h and 24&#x02009;h after the end of the operation. When the VAS was &#x0003e;7, 25&#x02009;mg diclofenac sodium i.v. was used as a rescue analgesic. If a patient had a VAS score &#x0003e;7, they were identified as requiring more postoperative analgesic than other patients and the TAP block was considered to have been ineffective.</p><p>The patients were visited 24&#x02009;h after the operation and asked about sensory disturbances due to pain arising from the operation site. They were also asked to rate their satisfaction for pain relief, nausea and vomiting or any disturbances about the operation (0: bad, 1: good, 2: very good). Any occurrence of complications, such as intestinal puncture, bleeding or infection, was also recorded.</p></sec><sec id="sec5-0300060516682883"><title>Measurement of haemodynamic parameters</title><p>Median heart rate, non-invasive mean arterial blood pressure and oxygen saturation were recorded at 0, 5, 15, 30, 45, 60&#x02009;min after time 0 and then every 30&#x02009;min thereafter using a CARESCAPE Monitor B450 (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA).</p></sec><sec id="sec6-0300060516682883"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>All statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS&#x000ae; statistical package, version 17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for Windows&#x000ae;.

A previous study reported that morphine consumption for the first 24&#x02009;h after the operation in patients who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomies was significantly reduced by the administration of a US-TAP block using 30&#x02009;ml of 0.5% bupivacaine (15&#x02009;ml injected in each side).<sup><xref rid="bibr6-0300060516682883" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p><p>A previous study suggested that TAP block probably only had a small effect on reducing postoperative pain in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-0300060516682883" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> In their study, the authors used ultrasound-guided tap blocks with 20&#x02009;ml 0.5% ropivacaine and they found some beneficial effect in reducing pain with TAP block after laparoscopic cholecystectomy.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-0300060516682883" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> However, very few studies have investigated the effects of a TAP block using different volumes and concentrations of anaesthetic solution. A previous study evaluated the effects of the US-TAP block by comparing the efficacy according to the concentration of levobupivacaine in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomies.<sup><xref rid="bibr11-0300060516682883" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> In this previous study, the patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomies were randomized into three groups: (i) a control group; (ii) a US-TAP block group that was administered 30&#x02009;ml of 0.25% levobupivacaine; and (iii) a US-TAP block group that was 30&#x02009;ml of 0.5% levobupivacaine.<sup><xref rid="bibr11-0300060516682883" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> After the induction of general anaesthesia, a bilateral US-TAP block was performed using an in-plane technique, with 15&#x02009;ml levobupivacaine injected on each side.<sup><xref rid="bibr11-0300060516682883" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Their results showed that the US-TAP block with either 30&#x02009;ml of 0.25% or 30&#x02009;ml of 0.5% levobupivacaine significantly reduced postoperative pain compared with the control treatment in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomies.<sup><xref rid="bibr11-0300060516682883" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Importantly, the study found that the lower concentration could be effective.<sup><xref rid="bibr11-0300060516682883" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> The present study, in which group A received 20&#x02009;ml of local anaesthetic for US-TAP block and group B received 30&#x02009;ml of local anaesthetic (i.e. administered at a lower concentration), the intraoperative consumption of remifentanil, postoperative VAS scores (20&#x02009;min, 12&#x02009;h and 24&#x02009;h) and the requirement for postoperative analgesics were all significantly lower in group B compared with group A (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05 for all comparisons). These current findings suggest that a TAP block performed using US-guided visualization of the spread of the local anaesthetic to the upper part of the abdomen can be an effective treatment for postoperative pain in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomies. The spread of the local anaesthetic into the fascia that was enabled by using 30&#x02009;ml of solution was associated with good pain relief in this present study. In our opinion, an anaesthetic solution volume of 20&#x02009;ml cannot produce effective postoperative pain relief because of its low diffusion capacity.</p><p>In the present study, duration of surgery was significantly longer in group B compared with group A. Group B also experienced less postoperative pain and required less postoperative rescue analgesics compared with group A. However, a search of the published literature did not identify any studies that found an association between with the duration of surgery and postoperative pain relief following a TAP block, so in our opinion this was a valuable result. Similar to the present study, previous research found that the total intraoperative consumption of sufentanil was significantly reduced by a TAP block performed with 30&#x02009;ml of 0.5% bupivacaine compared with no TAP block.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-0300060516682883" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Similarly, another study showed that a TAP block with 20&#x02009;ml ropivacaine reduced the amount of remifentanil required during surgery compared with saline.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-0300060516682883" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup></p><p>In many previous studies of the use of a TAP block in patients undergoing laproscopic cholecystectomy, there were no differences in terms of the haemodynamic parameters and the duration of anaesthesia between the study groups; and no complications were observed.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-0300060516682883" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bibr11-0300060516682883" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="bibr13-0300060516682883" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Similarly, there were no differences between the two groups in the present study in terms of demographic characteristics, duration of anaesthesia, haemodynamic parameters and the patient satisfaction scores.</p><p>In conclusion, a US-TAP block can form part of a balanced postoperative analgesic regimen following laparoscopic cholecystectomy. A US-TAP block can reduce the amount of opioids used during the operation. Further research is required to investigate the optimal local anaesthetic concentration and volume required to maintain postoperative pain relief.</p></sec></body><back><sec id="sec13-0300060516682883"><title>Declaration of conflicting interests</title><p>The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest.</p></sec><sec id="sec14-0300060516682883"><title>Funding</title><p>This research received no specific grant from any funding agency in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.</p></sec><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bibr1-0300060516682883"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Rafi</surname><given-names>AN</given-names></name></person-group>
