The duration of study was 20 weeks and it was done on 37 patients who were hospitalized in either Ibn-e-Sina or Hejazi Psychiatric Hospital (Mashhad, Iran) with a definitive diagnosis of schizophrenia between December 2008 and June 2010. Our Institutional Ethics Committee approved the research project, and informed consent was obtained from patients or their surrogates (research project number: 2214). Potential candidates for the study were interviewed by two psychiatrists and if the diagnosis of schizophrenia was confirmed using diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, 4<sup>th</sup> edition, text revision (DSM-IV-TR) criteria for schizophrenia and they met our inclusion criteria, the patients would receive clozapine combined by either placebo or metformin by a nurse who was unaware of the study groups.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</p><p>The sample size was calculated with considering a confidence interval level of 95%, &#x003b1; = 0.05 and a sample power of 95%. 60 patients were initially included in this study and they were randomly assigned into a group of metformin and a group of placebo, but later in the study, 11 patients in the group of metformin and 12 patients in the group of placebo were dropped out of the study because of serious drug side effects and ultimately 19 cases in the group of metformin and 18 cases in the group of placebo continued the study to the end [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>].</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Consort diagram of participant flow</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JRMS-20-364-g001"/></fig><p>The inclusion criteria for the study were as follows:</p><p>

</p><p>A clinical interview was done by a psychiatrist to confirm the diagnosis, to determine if the patient meets our inclusion criteria and to ascertain the dose and the duration of clozapine and the quantity of cigarette smoke used by the patient. A baseline brief psychiatric rating scale (BPRS) score was determined for all patients by a psychiatrist. Metabolic profiles, including: FBS, triglyceride, cholesterol, thyroid function tests, BUN, and Cr were measured by central lab of the mentioned hospitals that are using automated laboratory instruments Body weight, BMI and waist circumference were measured by a trained health staff. Demographic parameters were obtained from patients&#x02019; medical records. Patients who were qualified for the study were randomly assigned into a group of metformin 500 mg (Aria, Iran) and a group of placebo. Since previous studies have shown that metformin with a low dose of 500 mg/day is well effective for metabolic syndrome.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Randomization was done using Balanced block randomization method. Within 1-week after the onset of the study, the dose of metformin was increased to 1000 mg, one tablet in the morning and one tablet in the afternoon. The patients in the group of placebo were also treated the same way. Potential drug side effects were evaluated at baseline and at weeks 2, 8, 16, and 20 after the onset of the study by a psychiatrist using checklist.</p><p>Since there is little evidence to suggest that the weight gain and metabolic syndrome related to clozapine is dose dependent,[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] metformin was added to the patient's previous clozapine regimen.

Five patients in the group of metformin and eight patients in the group of placebo were smokers. The Chi-square test demonstrated no statistical differences between two groups. Evaluation of educational level between two groups was done using a Fisher exact test that showed no statistical difference between two groups.

This statistical analysis supports the idea that the randomization was successful [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>].</p><p>The BPRS scores were calculated at the end of the study (week 20). Mean BPRS score for the group of metformin was 43.5 &#x000b1; 7.4 and in the group of placebo it was 41.4 &#x000b1; 7.2. Comparison of mean BPRS scores using the <italic>t</italic>-test showed no statistical significant differences between two groups.

Comparison of mean waist circumferences between two groups using ANOVA with repeated measures test demonstrated a statistically significant differences between two groups at 2, 8, 16, 20 weeks, but the difference in mean waist circumference between the onset of the study and waist circumference at the end of the study was significantly higher for the group of metformin compared with placebo (<italic>P</italic> = 0.000) demonstrating that the metformin is effective in decreasing the waist circumference in patients treated with clozapine [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>]. Comparison of mean SBP and DBP between two groups was done at the baseline and at 2, 8, 16, and 20 weeks after the onset of the study using the ANOVA with repeated measures test that showed no statistical differences between two groups. Comparison of mean difference in SBP and DBP at baseline and at the end of the study between the two groups also demonstrated no significant difference between two groups. Comparison of serum level of FBS between two groups using ANOVA with repeated measures demonstrated no statistical difference over time. The same test was used for evaluation of serum level of high-density lipoprotein that demonstrated a statistically significant difference between two groups (<italic>P</italic> = 0.048).

In a review of literature, we found very limited studies, including a case that was reported by Ozenoglu <italic>et al</italic>. in 2007[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and two studies that were conducted by Wu <italic>et al</italic>. and Shin <italic>et al</italic>. in 2008,[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] that specifically evaluated the effect of metformin on side effects induced by clozapine in patients with schizophrenia. For this reason, we had some limitations in comparison of our results with findings in previous studies.</p><p>In Wu <italic>et al</italic>.'s study, 128 patients were participated. 40 cases were treated with a combination of clozapine and metformin and all other patients were treated by either olanzapine, risperidone or sulpiride. In the group of metformin, a decrease of 2.10 cm in mean waist circumference was observed while in the group of placebo, an increase of 2.2 cm in mean waist circumference was reported. Shin <italic>et al</italic>., have reported a decrease of 2 cm in mean waist circumference. These findings are compatible with our findings. In our study, we showed a decrease of 2.21 cm in mean waist circumference in patients in the group of metformin.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] In our study, metformin had no effect on SBP or DBP, which is compatible with some previous studies.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] In our study, there was a statistically significant decrease in serum levels of triglyceride in the group of metformin compared with placebo. Similar results have been reported by Carrizo <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] while in the study that was conducted by Ozenoglu <italic>et al</italic>., the serum level of TG was not significantly different between the two study groups.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] In the context of thyroid function tests, we did not find any statistically significant difference between two groups. Our findings are compatible with those reported by Ozenoglu <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] In our study, we reported a statistically significant difference in serum HDL between two groups but no statistically significant difference in serum cholesterol, triglyceride or LDL. Carrizo <italic>et al</italic>., reported an increase in serum HDL and a decrease in serum LDL but Wu <italic>et al</italic>. and Ozenoglu <italic>et al</italic>., did not report any changes in serum levels of HDL.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] Shin <italic>et al</italic>. conducted a study on patients aged between 10 and 18 and they reported a decrease in serum levels of triglyceride with no changes in HDL or LDL which is similar to our findings.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] In this study, we observed an increase in serum levels of LDL in both groups, but this increase was not statistically significant. This finding is compatible with Ozenoglu <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] Similar results were also reported by Baptista <italic>et al</italic>. in metformin as an adjunctive treatment with Olanzapine.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] In our study, a statistically significant decrease in BMI was observed in the group of metformin compared with placebo. This decrease was not significant in studies conducted by Shin <italic>et al</italic>. and Carrrizo <italic>et al</italic>. but it was significant in studies conducted by Wu <italic>et al</italic>. and Ozeroglu <italic>et al</italic>. We also showed a weight loss between 1 and 8 kg in the group of metformin compared with placebo which is compatible with those reported by Ozeroglu <italic>et al</italic>. in which they reported a weight loss of 27 kg in a schizophrenic patient who was treated with metformin and clozapine. Shin <italic>et al</italic>. and Wu <italic>et al</italic>. also reported similar results in their studies. In a double-blind clinical trial that was conducted by Carrizo <italic>et al</italic>. on 61 patients, similar to our study, metformin was perfectly tolerated and a weight loss has been reported in both metformin and placebo.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] Incompatible findings in previous studies could be attributable to the fact that the number of studies published in the literature in this context was very limited and some, different psychiatric disorders other than schizophrenia that were considered in these studies, differences in duration of studies, the dose of metformin or the type of antipsychotic that was used in these studies. Furthermore, the limitations of our study, including short duration of study, small sample size, and a large number of dropouts from the study and use of a fixed dose of 1000 mg metformin might also have influenced our results.</p><p>Collectively, our study confirmed the effect of metformin on waist circumference, body weight and BMI, and the serum level of triglyceride. Since this study was done on Iranian population, in order to clarify the role of metformin as an adjunctive therapy with clozapine, more studies in other populations with different doses of metformin is mandatory.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-5"><title>AUTHOR'S CONTRIBUTIONS</title><p>PH contributed in the conception of the work, conducting the study, revising the draft, approval of the final version of the manuscript, and agreed for all aspects of the work.</p><p>AAM contributed in the conception of the work, drafting and revising the draft, approval of the final version of the manuscript, and agreed for all aspects of the work.</p><p>FB contributed in the conception of the work, conducting the study, revising the draft, approval of the final version of the manuscript, and agreed for all aspects of the work.</p><p>MNM contributed in the conception of the work, revising the draft, approval of the final version of the manuscript, and agreed for all aspects of the work.</p><p>KAR contributed in the conception of the work, conducting the study, revising the draft, approval of the final version of the manuscript, and agreed for all aspects of the work.</p><p>EH contributed in the conception of the work, revising the draft, approval of the final version of the manuscript, and agreed for all aspects of the work.</p><p>AAR contributed in the conception of the work, revising the draft, approval of the final version of the manuscript, and agreed for all aspects of the work.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>The authors would like to thank Research Council of the Mashhad University of Medical Sciences for providing the fund of this study.
