A recent quantitative review has suggested that TFAs from PHVOs and rTFAs may have similar effects on plasma lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>), but this conclusion remains uncertain because it is based on only 5 studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>). Data in particular subgroups of the population are also utterly lacking. Specifically, women are greatly underrepresented in the 5 rTFA clinical studies on blood lipids published to date, representing only 11% of subjects. Interestingly, in the one study that did include both sexes, the increase in the LDL-/HDL-cholesterol ratio in women after consumption of rTFAs (5% of energy) was 2.4 times the change seen in men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>). In contrast, results from epidemiologic studies suggest that women may respond more favorably to dietary rTFA exposure than men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>). These differences emphasize the need for further research documenting the effect of rTFAs in various subgroups of the population, particularly among women.</p><p>In a previous controlled feeding study in men, we showed that a moderately elevated intake of rTFAs (1.5% of daily energy) had no effect on CVD risk factors, which suggests that, even at the upper limit of human consumption, rTFAs may have little effect on CVD risk factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>). This is consistent with previous epidemiologic studies in men, which have generally reported no effect of rTFAs on CVD risk across usual dietary intakes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). The extent to which a moderate increase in dietary intake of rTFAs has an effect (positive or negative) on plasma lipid concentrations in women has not been studied yet. Hence, this study was designed to investigate the effect of a high but yet achievable intake of rTFAs on plasma lipid concentrations among healthy women of various ages and with a broad range of plasma LDL-cholesterol concentrations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Population</title><p>Seventy-two women were recruited in the Qu&#x000e9;bec City metropolitan area through the media and electronic newsletter to participate in the study. Recruitment took place at the Institute of Nutraceuticals and Functional Foods between September 2009 and April 2010. Subjects were initially screened on the basis of a complete physical examination and medical history. The subjects recruited for the study had to be 18&#x02013;70 y of age, to have a BMI (in kg/m<sup>2</sup>) between 18 and 30, and to have a plasma LDL-cholesterol concentration within 2.0&#x02013;4.2 mmol/L. Exclusion criteria were the presence of a previous history of CVD, type 2 diabetes, monogenic dyslipidemia, or any diagnosed endocrine disorders; the use of medications for hyperlipidemia or hypertension; and a significant weight change within the 6 mo before the experiment. Among premenopausal women, only those with a regular menstrual cycle (25&#x02013;35 d) for the past 3 mo were included. This combined with the fact that measurements were performed at the end of each 4-wk diet maximized the chance of having women being tested within the same phase of their menstrual cycle. All postmenopausal women were eligible, irrespective of their hormone supplementation status. Women with nutritional habits such as vegetarianism, with food allergies or aversion to foods included in the experimental diets, with alcohol consumption of &#x0003e;2 drinks/d, and elite athletes were excluded. Smokers and women who use contraceptive agents were not excluded from the study. FSH measurements were performed to confirm the premenopausal or postmenopausal status (FSH &#x0003c;20 IU/L or FSH &#x0003e;25 IU/L). The study protocol was fully explained to all participants, who gave written informed consent at the beginning of the study. The protocol was approved by the Clinical Research Ethics Committee of Laval University.</p></sec><sec><title>Production of the TFA-enriched milk fat</title><p>The butter enriched with rTFAs was obtained by altering the cows&#x02019; diets as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>), with slight modification. Briefly, a group of 31 cows were fed a mixed diet composed of concentrates + alfalfa and corn silages with the addition of 3.6% corn oil. Milk samples were taken after 4 wk, and the 13 cows with the highest concentration of <italic>trans</italic>-18:1 continued consuming the diet for the purpose of milk collection and the manufacturing of the rTFA-enriched butter. The control low-rTFA butter was obtained from the Canadian Dairy Commission (March&#x02013;April 2009 production). The characterization of the fatty acid composition of experimental butterfat was carried out by gas chromatography (HP 5890; Hewlett-Packard Co) with a 100-m CP Sil 88 capillary column (Chrompack; Middelburg) and a flame ionization detector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>). Feeding corn oil to dairy cows increased the total TFA content of milk fat without significantly modifying its isomeric distribution. The absolute amount of vaccenic acid (18:1<italic>t</italic>-11), the predominant TFA in the TFA-enriched butter, was 3.7 times that in the control butter and accounted for 37.1% and 47.5% of total rTFAs in the control butter and the rTFA-enriched butter, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>).

Randomized treatment sequences were computer-generated by one of the investigators (BL) and then passed on to the research team without any knowledge of participant's status and eligibility. Each diet was separated by a 3-d period (weekend). The 2 experimental diets used in the current study were the rTFA diet (3.7 g/d) and the control diet low in rTFAs (0.9 g/d, control diet), with a difference between the 2 diets of 2.8 g rTFA. Sources of rTFAs, such as ruminant meat (lamb, veal, or beef) and nonskim dairy products, were not used in the formulation of the diets so that differences in the rTFA content between diets came exclusively from the experimental butters. Inclusion of any other foods with a high SFA content was also minimized to achieve the prescribed 10% SFA content. Specific vegetable and animal oils and fat were incorporated into each diet to attenuate differences in the amounts of SFAs and unsaturated fatty acids between treatments (<italic>see</italic> Supplemental Table 1 under &#x0201c;Supplemental data&#x0201d; in the online issue). As a result, the 2 experimental fats used to formulate the predetermined diets contained relatively comparable amounts of every major type of SFA and PUFA, whereas rTFAs were mainly substituted by 18:1<italic>c</italic> fatty acids. Both diets were identical in terms of menus, calories, and macronutrient composition, with the exception of rTFAs and 18:1<italic>c</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2"><bold>Table 2</bold></xref>). On average, the 2 experimental diets were formulated to provide 54% of daily energy from carbohydrate, 15% from protein, and 33% from fat. The rTFA diet provided 1.5% (exact value: 1.474%) of daily energy intake as rTFAs, and the control diet provided 0.3% (exact value: 0.342%) of daily energy intake as rTFAs. Because some of the foods used in the diets did contain traces of TFAs from PHVO, there was a residual 0.7 g TFA from PHVO foods accounted for in each of the 2 diets. These TFAs from PHVO specifically were obtained by calculation and not chemical analysis based on the food database and food analysis software used for the study (Nutrition Data System, version 4.03_31; Nutrition Coordinating Center). Estimates of usual energy intake were ascertained at baseline by using a validated food-frequency questionnaire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>). Each participant was assigned to a value of energy intake that was revised when required to minimize body weight fluctuation during the study. Body weight was recorded on all weekdays just before lunch. All meals were provided to participants so that control for energy and macronutrient intakes was optimized. On weekdays, subjects came to the Clinical Investigation Unit at the Institute of Nutraceuticals and Functional Foods at Laval University to consume their lunch under the supervision of at least one member of the research team, who was blinded to subject's treatment. At that time, they were also provided with their dinner and the next day's packaged breakfast to take home. Weekend meals were prepared, packaged, and provided at the Clinical Investigation Unit on the Friday lunchtime visits. The breakfast meal represented 26% of the daily energy intake, whereas the lunch and dinner meals each provided 37% of daily energy intake. Subjects were instructed to consume their entire meals. Subjects had free access to water and to caffeine-free diet beverages. Consumption of tea and coffee was allowed within a limit of 2 cups/d (500 mL/d). Supplementation with vitamins and natural health products, as well as alcohol consumption, was strictly forbidden during all treatment phases. Throughout the study, participants were asked to maintain their usual level of physical activity, which was evaluated by a weekly questionnaire completed by the subjects. The subjects were asked to remain sedentary on the 3 d preceding blood sampling at the various stages of the study.</p><table-wrap id="tbl2" position="float"><label>TABLE 2</label><caption><p>Mean

The mean of the 2 postdiet values were used for all variables in these subjects. In the remaining 33% of subjects, blood samples were taken only once on the last day (day 26) of each diet. Assessment of the plasma lipid profile was performed according to methods described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>).

The pooled SD of the change in plasma LDL-cholesterol concentrations in our previous study of rTFAs in men (similar design and similar diets) was 0.39 mmol/L (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>), and we assumed similar numbers in women. On the basis of these numbers and on a baseline LDL-cholesterol concentration estimated a priori at 3.0 mmol/L, 55 participants completing the study were required to be able to detect a &#x02265;5% change in LDL cholesterol with the rTFA compared with the control diet. Secondary outcomes were changes in HDL cholesterol and in the total/HDL cholesterol ratio. On the basis of the pooled SD for the change in HDL cholesterol in our previous study in men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>), 55 participants were sufficient to detect a significant increase or decrease in HDL cholesterol that would be as small as 0.055 mmol/L (ie, 3.9%, 2-tailed &#x003b1; = 0.05 and &#x003b2; = 0.2). A &#x000b1;5% change in the total/HDL cholesterol ratio was calculated to be significant (2-tailed <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) with a power of 1.0. The study design allowed us to detect a 5-mm Hg difference in systolic and a 3.6-mm Hg difference in diastolic blood pressure between treatments (80% power at <italic>P</italic> = 0.05). Finally, we were able to detect with a power of 80% a correlation of <italic>r</italic> &#x0003e; 0.37 within a sample of <italic>n</italic> = 55 subjects (<italic>P</italic> &#x02264; 0.05). On the basis of an anticipated 15% dropout rate, we had initially planned to recruit 64 women. However, recruitment was very successful, so that 72 women were finally randomly assigned to treatment sequences.</p><p>Data are reported as means &#x000b1; SDs and the percentage of changes from the control diet in the tables, unless stated otherwise. The main analysis compared values of each outcome measured at the end of the 2 isocaloric diets, ie, values after the rTFA diet compared with values after the control diet. Data were analyzed by using the PROC MIXED procedure for repeated measures in SAS (v9.2; SAS Institute Inc). Menopausal status, weight, treatment sequence, and baseline values were included as covariates in all models. Their interaction with the main treatment effect was also tested, but none were significant; therefore, they were removed from final models. Variables with a skewed distribution were log-10 transformed before statistical analysis.

Of the remaining 64 subjects who completed the intervention, 2 were excluded because their menopausal status changed during the course of the study (assessed on the basis of FSH values) and 1 was excluded because of missing data for several outcomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>).

No such BMI &#x000d7; diet interaction was seen with LDL cholesterol or apo B.

There was also no significant correlation between diet-induced changes in plasma HDL cholesterol or apo A-I concentrations and concurrent variations in plasma EL, HL, and CETP concentrations (data not shown).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The study investigated how an increase of 1.2% of energy as rTFAs (difference between the rTFA diet and the control diet: 2.8 g rTFA/d) affects plasma lipid concentrations in healthy women. In Canada, the average total TFA intake from any source has declined from 8.4 g/d (3.7% of energy) in the mid-1990s to 4.8 g/d (2.0% of energy) in 2004 and to 3.4 g/d (1.4% of energy) in 2008 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>). A report from 2006 has estimated the specific intake of TFA from ruminant sources in Canada to be &#x0223c;1 g/d (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>), and this value is very unlikely to have changed since then. Thus, our study investigated the effect of a 3-fold increase in dietary rTFAs compared with current estimates of intake in Canada. It can therefore be considered to be relatively high, but theoretically achievable and of nutritional relevance.</p><p>A large epidemiologic study among women has shown that, unlike TFAs from PHVO, an increased intake of rTFAs tended to be associated with a lower risk of CVD in women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>). Other data from epidemiologic studies have reported no significant effect of rTFA intake on CVD risk in various populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>). Data from clinical trials do not entirely support these observations. On the basis of a comprehensive analysis of published clinical trials, Brouwer et al (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>) have suggested that rTFAs and TFAs from PHVO may have similar elevating effects on the LDL/HDL cholesterol ratio. We stress that this compounded analyses of the effects of TFAs from PHVO on plasma lipids is based on 23 studies to date, whereas rTFAs have been investigated in only 5 studies so far (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>), excluding the current study. We also stress that only 21 women have been included so far in previous clinical studies of rTFAs, representing only 11% of all participants. This is a key point because it has been suggested that men and women may respond differently to nutritional changes. In particular, Chardigny et al (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>) have shown that the increase in the LDL/HDL cholesterol ratio with an increased rTFA intake (5% of energy) was in fact 2.4-fold greater in women than was the change seen in men. This emphasizes the importance of having additional adequately powered and optimally controlled studies to draw firm conclusion on the effects of rTFAs on blood lipids, particularly among women.</p><p>We showed that substituting 1.2% of energy as rTFAs in place of <italic>cis</italic>-MUFAs had no effect on LDL cholesterol (estimated change: 0.01 mmol/L; NS) but reduced plasma HDL-cholesterol concentrations in healthy women (estimated change: 0.05 mmol/L; significant). These effects are not entirely consistent with data from the quantitative review by Brouwer et al (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>), which would have predicted an increase of 0.045 mmol/L for LDL cholesterol and a reduction of only 0.009 mmol/L for HDL cholesterol. These discrepancies can be explained by several factors. First, sex may be a factor and women are greatly underrepresented in the literature on rTFA, because most studies have been conducted in men exclusively, as indicated above. The status of participants at baseline may have also influenced the outcome. In the current study, participants were healthy and nonobese as a group. Although age, risk factor profile at baseline, and menopausal status did not modulate the effects of rTFAs on blood lipids, a significant BMI &#x000d7; diet interaction was found for HDL cholesterol, with the reduction in plasma HDL cholesterol being significantly more pronounced among overweight women than among normal-weight women. This finding is consistent with the concept that adiposity may significantly modulate the effect of nutritional changes on plasma lipid and nonlipid risk factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>). Consumption of rTFAs led to a small yet significant reduction in body weight. Because there was no concurrent change in waist circumference, we believe that this small change in body weight was most likely coincidental and of little importance in this study.</p><p>Previous studies have suggested that the reduction in plasma HDL-cholesterol concentrations with TFA intake (mainly from PHVO) compared with <italic>cis</italic>-MUFAs may be imputed to increased CETP activities. Exploratory analyses suggested that the HDL-lowering effect seen with rTFAs in the current study was apparently not mediated by changes in plasma CETP, HL, and EL concentrations, which is consistent with data from Aro et al (23), who reported no significant effect of TFA on CETP activity compared with diets high in SFAs, despite a significant change in HDL-cholesterol concentrations between diets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>). Whether information on enzyme activities rather than plasma concentrations would have yielded similar results is uncertain. Kinetic studies have shown that the reduction in plasma HDL-cholesterol concentrations with dietary TFAs from PHVO was largely attributable to an enhanced clearance of apo A-I, rather than to a reduced production rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>). We hypothesize that similar mechanisms may be at play with regard to rTFA. The large variation in the response of apo A-I to treatments may have blunted a significant effect in our study.</p><p>The total/HDL cholesterol ratio was nontrivially increased by &#x0223c;10% after both dietary regimens (control and rTFA diets) compared with values at screening. We analyzed the usual food intake of the participants before undertaking the study in an attempt to identify factors underlying these changes. Their estimated usual intake in saturated fat was 10.1%, whereas their intake in fibers averaged 27.4 g/d. These values are not different from the values achieved during both the control and the rTFA diets (10% of energy for SAT and 25.7 g/d for fibers). Alcohol intake on the other hand was different (screening: 5.1 g/d; study: 0.1 g/d), which may explain at least the slight reduction in plasma HDL cholesterol between screening and the diets and hence in the total/HDL cholesterol ratio as well.</p><p>In a recently published double-blind, randomized trial conducted in healthy men and women, a limited increase in the rTFA/SFA ratio (4%/63% compared with 2.8%/72%) in dairy products was associated with improvements in LDL cholesterol and the LDL/HDL cholesterol ratio but not in HDL-cholesterol concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>). A further increase in the rTFA/SFA ratio showed no additional benefit and had similar effects in both sexes. This study was obviously very different from ours, because several changes in many fatty acids were being compared, other than just those between TFAs and <italic>cis</italic>-MUFAs. Tricon et al (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>) have shown in men that consumption of a CLA-rich diet in which the rTFA content was close to that attained in our study (4.7 g/d, predominantly vaccenic acid) had no effect on plasma triglycerides, total cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol, but led to a significant increase in the LDL/HDL cholesterol ratio compared with the control diet. A trend toward an increase in the total/HDL cholesterol ratio was also observed with the CLA-rich diet. These effects could not be ascribed to rTFAs or CLAs because both were given concurrently in that study.</p><p>The current study had strengths as well as limitations. Unlike in previous studies of rTFAs specifically, the large sample size, the controlled feeding nature of the study design, and the repeated measurements at the end of each diet made it powerful to detect very small changes in risk factors. This was also one of the first studies to have investigated the effect of a butter enriched in rTFAs in women specifically. Although the sample size allowed us to detect a &#x02265;5% change in LDL cholesterol, it is possible that smaller increases may still affect long-term CVD risk. Unlike in many previous studies of rTFAs, the dietary intake of rTFAs in this study, although still high, was theoretically achievable and therefore of clinical relevance. Although vaccenic acid is the predominant <italic>trans</italic> isomer of rTFAs, it represented &#x0003c;50% of all rTFAs in the rTFA-enriched butter. Because other rTFA isomers were increased in the rTFA-enriched butter (eg, 18:2<italic>t</italic> increased by 56% compared with the control butter), it was therefore not possible to ascribe the change (or lack thereof) in plasma lipids in our study to vaccenic acid alone. Plasma concentrations of <italic>trans</italic>-palmitoleate (16:1<italic>t-</italic>7), also found in dairy fat, was found to be associated with lower insulin resistance, the presence of atherogenic dyslipidemia, and incident diabetes in the large Cardiovascular Health Study cohort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>). The specific 16:1<italic>t</italic>-7 and other 16:1<italic>t</italic> isomer contents of the experimental butters in the current study were not measured and their effect on the study outcomes cannot be commented on. These usually represent &#x0003c;1% of all fatty acids in dairy fat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>). Finally, the study was conducted over a short-term period, and longer-term effects&#x02014;particularly on other nonlipid CVD risk factors&#x02014;cannot be ruled out and need further investigation.</p><p>In summary, we showed in healthy women that an increase in the dietary intake of rTFAs corresponding to 1.2% of daily energy had no significant effect on plasma LDL-cholesterol concentrations but had a small HDL-lowering effect, particularly in overweight women. The long-term effect of these changes on CVD risk is unknown. Whether these observations extend to patients with cardiometabolic abnormalities, such as the metabolic syndrome and diabetes, will also need to be addressed in the future.</p></sec>
