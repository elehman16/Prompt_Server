Very little formal research is reported in the literature about creating and evaluating supportive school breakfast environments. Environment and policy-level interventions that address complex behaviors like dietary patterns need to draw from multiple perspectives to guide intervention development and evaluation. The breakFAST study conceptual model in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref> draws from the Social Ecologic Model (SEM) <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>and Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. The SEM describes the interplay between individual, social and environmental factors. The TPB posits that individual and normative beliefs influence intentions and are mediated by the amount of control of behavior within an environment. TPB allows the development of a framework for identifying key behavioral and normative beliefs affecting intentions that drive behavior <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>.

The intervention aimed to improve student SBP participation by ameliorating the following environmental factors in the high school setting that potentially moderate student intention to eat school breakfast:1) increasing availability and easy access to the SBP through school-wide policy changes 2) addressing normative and attitudinal beliefs through a school-wide SBP marketing campaign 3) providing opportunities for positive interactions that encourage eating school breakfast with social support and role modeling from peers and teachers.</p><p id="p0040">Increased SBP availability and accessibility was to be accomplished by implementing a grab and go style cart or breakfast line located outside the cafeteria in a high traffic hallway, atrium or commons area. New grab and go SBPs were to be developed individually at each intervention school to meet unique needs of each school.</p><p id="p0045">School-wide marketing campaigns were developed by a community partner, Community BluePrint, a marketing and design firm experienced in public health campaigns in educational settings and targeted at youth. Community BluePrint worked with a group of students to design the marketing campaign at each intervention school. A student lead campaign may provide a more relevant and attractive message to the student body than one developed by others.</p><p id="p0050">Positive interactions and social support were to be created by developing school policies, if not already in place, to allow students to eat breakfast in the hallway. Schools were also encouraged to allow eating breakfast in some classrooms when appropriate. Additionally, teachers and school staff were asked to encourage the breakfast program.</p><p id="p0055">As informed by best practices <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, the development of a School Breakfast Expansion Team (SBET) was encouraged at each intervention school. These teams were to consist of a variety of contributors including, but not limited to the principal, food service director, nurse, students, wellness coordinator, and teachers. Team members were expected to meet at least five times. Three times in the year before implementing the SBP changes, and two times after the new program was initiated. The first 3 meetings were to cover the topics of, 1) assessment of the current SBP and goal setting; 2) creating an action plan and 3) discussing communication strategies. The 2 meetings in the year during the new SBP were designed to cover the topics, 4) monitoring your new program and 5) evaluating progress and success.</p><p id="p0060">A key component to the intervention was the partnership with University of Minnesota, Extension. University Extension organizations were developed through federal, state and county funding to &#x0201c;extend&#x0201d; research, knowledge and expertise to the public. Extension's education and research staff live and work across the state, creating a local approach to translating evidence based practices to communities across the state. Extension Coordinators, trained in school wellness programing, served as the intervention facilitators and were assigned to schools in their geographical area. Extension Coordinators were to provide support to schools in intervention development and implementation, communicated progress, successes, and also to assist in the logistics (e.g., reserve measurement rooms) for data collection. Study staff were to meet bi-weekly with the Extension team to troubleshoot issues with interventions as well as discuss upcoming research activities and provide training on protocols.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><label>2.3</label><title>Study design overview</title><p id="p0065">A convenience sample of 16 rural high schools agreed to study participation and were randomized to treatment or delayed treatment groups in equal allocation. The delayed treatment group served as a non-interventional control for the first year of follow-up for the primary comparison with the treatment group at the end of the first year of follow-up, but implemented a modified form of the intervention in the second year of follow-up. The primary reason for this approach was to provide comparison schools with an equitable incentive and benefit to participating in the research study. Comparison schools received the same monetary incentive as intervention schools, as well as research study staff support in implementing the delayed intervention. The main difference was the marketing package offered to intervention schools, but not to comparison schools. Investigators were also interested to see results of the implementation of the intervention without a professional marketing package, to investigate a slightly more &#x0201c;real-world&#x0201d; approach to the intervention. Additionally, because of budget and staff limitations, the study was conducted across 2 waves of eight schools where each wave was implemented in successive school (calendar) years. Thus, in year one, four schools implemented the intervention, in year two eight schools (four intervention, four delayed intervention) implemented the intervention and in year three four delayed intervention schools implemented the intervention. Throughout, the schools in the delayed intervention group will be described as the &#x02018;control condition&#x02019; during the first year of follow-up, and the &#x02018;delayed intervention condition&#x02019; in the second year of follow-up.</p><p id="p0070">The process of randomization of schools to treatment assignment was blocked so that 4 schools were assigned to intervention and 4 to control in each wave. As of the start of wave 1, only 13 schools had been recruited (see 4. Limitations), so a simple random subsample of 8 was assigned to wave 1. Within this subsample of 8, schools were randomly assigned to treatment or control by selection of a random permutation of the 8 labels (4 intervention, 4 control). For wave 2, three additional schools had been recruited prior to the randomization for wave 2, for a total of 8 schools. The wave 2 schools were then randomized similarly to wave 1. Importantly, all wave 2 schools were recruited prior to randomization to treatment or control for wave 2.</p><p id="p0075">Study schools received $5000 each to use toward implementing their interventions. Delayed intervention schools did not receive these funds until after they had completed their control phase. Schools were allowed to use funds for equipment purchases, construction or technology needs (e.g., hardwiring areas where carts were located), additional staff time needed for implementation, promotion and anything else identified by the school and used for the intervention only. As a requirement of receiving this funding, schools were expected to install a new grab and go breakfast cart outside of the cafeteria, and change or update policy to allow eating in the hallways. During the first year of follow-up for each wave, four fidelity observations of both the intervention and delayed intervention groups were conducted to evaluate adherence to the requirement of either making these necessary changes to the SBP (intervention) or not making any changes to regular breakfast service (control).</p><p id="p0080">The primary outcome for the randomized comparison was change in mean school breakfast participation from baseline (academic year prior to implementation of intervention) to school year follow-up 1 (academic year during which the intervention was being implemented).</p><p id="p0085">For secondary outcomes (change in knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs; body mass index; and nutritional quality of the diet), a cohort of students identified as &#x0201c;breakfast skippers&#x0201d; were randomly selected to participate in survey, objectively measured height, weight, and percent body fat, and 24-h dietary recalls. The survey and dietary measures were collected at baseline and 1 school year follow-up (time point 1). The anthropometric measures were collected at baseline, 1 school year follow up (time point 1) and 2 school years follow-up (time point 2).</p></sec><sec id="sec2.4"><label>2.4</label><title>School recruitment</title><p id="p0090">To recruit the study schools an open invitation was posted on the Minnesota School Nutritional Association (MNSA) website and listserv. The MSNA is used by many Minnesota food service directors as a resource to locate funding and support for school food programs. Several informational webinars were conducted for interested school personnel (mainly the principal and food service director). The webinar recordings are available on the study website: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://z.umn.edu/projectbreakfast" id="intref0010">z.umn.edu/projectbreakfast</ext-link>. Schools were generally evaluated for study inclusion based upon being located outside of the 7-county Twin Cities metropolitan area; not having a grab and go reimbursable school breakfast option; and low SBP (under 20%) participation. Sufficient student enrollment (e.g., over 500) size) and student minority enrollment (at 10%) were also considered.</p><p id="p0095">At each participating school the Principal (Superintendent at one school) and Food Service Director both signed a detailed Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), developed by University of Minnesota study staff and approved by the University of Minnesota Office of the General Council. The MOU outlined the expectations of the study schools to provide support for data collection and to carry out the intervention, or control followed by delayed intervention condition as assigned. The MOU also outlined the expectations of the University of Minnesota study staff to provide support to the intervention, grant dollars to study schools for intervention development, and safe and respectful data collection practices. The MOU was signed during in-person meetings at each study school.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.5"><label>2.5</label><title>Student recruitment and enrollment</title><sec id="sec2.5.1"><label>2.5.1</label><title>Initial classroom screening for the cohort of &#x0201c;breakfast skippers&#x0201d;</title><p id="p0100">The initial identification of &#x0201c;breakfast skippers&#x0201d; (eat breakfast &#x02264;3 days in a school week) was important in assessing influence of the intervention on most at risk students. All 9th and 10th grade students attending study schools and who were present on the day of screening were invited to complete an initial 7-item screening paper/pencil questionnaire to assess the frequency of eating breakfast during a normal school week (Monday through Friday). Forty-four percent of screened students were eligible to be randomly selected for invitation into the BreakFAST study because they were in 9th or 10th grade, had access to a phone and internet at home, at school or at the library, and ate breakfast 3 or fewer days per school week (44%, n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;2512). Primary reasons for initial student ineligibility were due to already eating breakfast from any source at least 4 days in a usual school week (53%, n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;3075), no access to the internet (0.03%, n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;172) or phone (0.03%, n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;151).

To meet a minority enrollment goal of 30%, we oversampled for nonwhite/minority students at each study school. A passive parental consent process was used, with a signed letter from the school principal and the study principal investigator (PI) mailed to the parent(s) or guardian(s) of the invited students describing the study. The mailing also included a consent page, an example of survey items, and instructions on how to withdraw consent for participation of their student. Parents were given 10 days to withdraw consent by contacting the school or project manager by phone, email, or mail with all contact information provided.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.5.3"><label>2.5.3</label><title>Invite to student to determine enrollment eligibility for the &#x0201c;breakfast skipper&#x0201d; cohort</title><p id="p0110">After the 10 day waiting period, contact information (address and phone number) was requested from the schools for all initially eligible and consented students. Students were then mailed a letter inviting them to be screened for a second time to determine eligibility to participate in the study. Multiple modalities (e.g., internet, phone, at school) were necessary to maximize recruitment rates. Students were eligible based on affirmative survey responses to not planning to transfer schools, planning to be present in the mornings the next school year, not being pregnant (if female) and ability to understand written and spoken English at least &#x0201c;sort of well&#x0201d;. Eligible students were provided a study packet that described the study including, a hard copy consent page, a unique username, password and directions for completing an online baseline survey assessing breakfast attitudes and perceived barriers, and a Food Amounts Booklet for completing the dietary recalls.</p><p id="p0115">A final &#x02018;stop and check&#x02019; step was added to enrollment procedures asking students to think about the time requested to complete the study measures (completing height and weight at school, a 10-minute online survey and three 20-minute 24-hour dietary recalls collected over the phone), and decide if they are sure they want to participate and can complete all study measures. Accordingly, refusal rates went up after implementation of this important final step. This process was continued for the duration of enrollment.</p><p id="p0120">Only 17 students were unable to be reached during the recruitment phase. Study staff enrolled 533 (59%) students through telephone recruitment. The remaining 371 students were either enrolled online or in-person at the school. A total of 47 (&#x0003c;1%) parents and 211 (17%) students declined participation. Participating students received a maximum of $75 incentive for each data collection point.

Fifty-three percent of the 9th and 10th graders screened were ineligible for the study because they ate breakfast regularly from any source defined as 4 or more days in a normal school week. The total student enrollment goal was exceeded (904/880) and minority enrollment goal was met (30%). Overall refusal rates were 22% with parent refusal rate low (4%) and a student refusal rate of 18%. Baseline measurement protocol were successfully implemented where 98% of student enrolled in the breakFAST study completed heights, weights and percent body fat, 92% completed the survey, 82% completed at least 1 dietary recall. Seventy-nine percent of enrolled students completed height, weight, body fat, survey, and at least 1 dietary recall.</p></sec><sec id="sec4"><label>4</label><title>Discussion</title><p id="p0275">The primary goal of the BreakFAST study is to evaluate an intervention designed to improve participation in the SBP among high school students. This study design represents a unique rural community clinical trial. The strengths of the community-based approach are translation of best practices in a real world setting, interventions based on local school context and assessment of outcomes relevant to multiple stakeholders. The community setting also allowed for many lessons learned.</p><p id="p0280">First, due to the rural focus of the study, over 18,000 miles were covered by research staff, primarily related to measurement activities. Adaptation of planned protocols, such as conducting unannounced 24-h recall data collection on site, to accommodate completion of some study measures at the school site was necessary. While the onsite strategy was successful, the logistics added costs. An estimated <italic>additional</italic> $10,000 due to mileage costs to achieve higher measurement success rates was incurred.</p><p id="p0285">Second, mid study, the University of Minnesota Extension program, which was the primary school intervention team liaison, was required to restructure its programs due to federal funding cuts imposed by the American Taxpayer Relief Act (2014) and an ongoing delay in passage of the Farm Bill during the 2014 legislative session. The restructure resulted in a 40% staffing downsize to a more regional model. Due to this interruption, new Extension staff was assigned to work on the breakFAST project, requiring additional training by UMN staff as well as increased mileage expenses for Extension because some were no longer serving schools in their local areas <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>.</p><p id="p0290">Third, schools utilize third party software companies to manage their massive amounts of data. Obtainment of student-level objective data from schools (e.g., attendance, SBP participation) required extra charges from software vendors for standardized filter development and data queries. Five unique software vendors provided services to the 16 study schools. Charges varied among vendors and $23,000 in unplanned costs for access to these data were incurred.</p><p id="p0295">Finally, baseline data provided by the subsample identified that 57% of students were not eating breakfast because they were not hungry in the morning. Early in Wave 1 this data was provided to each intervention school along with the suggestion of considering a later grab and go breakfast, often called second chance or after the bell breakfast in the best practice literature. In addition, a summary of the scientific literature that described a biological change in sleep pattern preferences for staying up later (and waking up later) among adolescents as normal child development was presented. As a result of this data, each intervention school offered a second chance grab and go breakfast to improve accessibility of the SBP to their high school students. All Wave 2 schools initiated a second chance breakfast at the beginning of their intervention school year, including delayed intervention schools.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><label>5</label><title>Limitations</title><p id="p0300">The original randomization plan called for randomization to be fully stratified by wave: schools would be simultaneously assigned to wave and intervention/control in a manner that preserved balance between intervention and control within each wave and reduce the possible confounding of treatment difference by wave. However, randomization to waves was not fully implemented due to the withdrawal of 3 schools prior to randomization of Wave 1. Of the 16 schools originally agreeing to participate, these three schools underwent drastic administrative turn-over (superintendent or principal resignations) and so were no longer comfortable participating in the intervention. As described in the study design overview (2.3 above) three new schools were recruited to participate in Wave 2 prior to randomization for Wave 2. Because the selection of Wave 1 participants from the 13 available schools was determined by simple random sampling, and treatment condition was blocked within wave, the withdrawal of these three schools did not affect the validity of the randomization to intervention or control conditions. However, while balance between intervention and control conditions is balanced by the randomization within wave, the scheme as implemented lacks perfect random assignment of schools to wave as the three schools recruited after Wave 1 had started were not eligible to participate in Wave 1.</p><p id="p0305">As a result, the analysis plan for the primary endpoint will be based on a permutation test where permutations will be randomly selected from among the admissible permutations for the randomization scheme as implemented. Likewise, a permutation test will be used to assess the significance of wave as a possible predictor of treatment outcome.</p><p id="p0310">Collection of administrative data from schools required substantial quality control checks due to a lack of standard data reporting practices across study schools.</p><p id="p0315">Additionally, the schools participating were intentionally recruited from rural high schools in Minnesota and results may not generalize to other settings, including schools in urban settings.</p></sec><sec id="sec6"><label>6</label><title>Summary</title><p id="p0320">The breakFAST study successfully recruited 16 rural high schools and exceeded enrolling and measuring a cohort of students at baseline, including 30% minority students, into a randomized clinical trial. At the conclusion of the breakFAST study, we will be positioned to address a significant critique of the current breakfast literature <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref> by engaging a study design with the ability to evaluate whether an intervention designed to increase school breakfast program participation is effective in changing behavior and nutrition outcomes (nutritional quality of diet, BMI, and percent body fat) among students. In addition, the focus on rural school food environments will provide a unique addition to the health disparities literature. Finally, the breakFAST study addresses concerns by three stakeholder groups: school food service directors and feasibility of improving participation in the SBP in high schools, school principals and other administrators (e.g., school boards) and the relationships among SBP and academic-related outcomes (e.g., grades, attendance, disciplinary events), and hunger advocates as they identify ways to successfully address students at risk for hunger.</p></sec><sec id="sec7"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p id="p0325">The Authors have no conflicts of interest to report.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="cebib0010"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Siega-Riz</surname><given-names>A.M.</given-names></name><name><surname>Popkin</surname><given-names>B.M.</given-names></name><name><surname>Carson</surname><given-names>T.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Trends in breakfast consumption for children in the United States from 1965 to 1991</article-title><source>Am.
