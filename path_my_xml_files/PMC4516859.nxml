This added complexity also heightens the risk of insulin-induced hypoglycaemia associated with higher morbidity and mortality, especially in elderly subjects at advanced stages of the disease and those receiving multiple medications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>Insulin degludec (IDeg) is a new-generation, long-acting basal insulin analogue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The long-acting pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of IDeg observed in younger adults with type 1 diabetes (T1DM) also have been shown in elderly subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Because of a unique mechanism of protraction, IDeg can be combined with the rapid-acting prandial insulin analogue, insulin aspart (IAsp) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], in insulin degludec/insulin aspart (IDegAsp), resulting in a soluble co-formulation with 70&#x000a0;% IDeg and 30&#x000a0;% IAsp [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. IDegAsp is the first combination product to include a long-acting basal insulin analogue, providing both basal insulin coverage and a prandial insulin bolus in a single injection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>IDegAsp is recommended for the treatment of diabetes in adults and can be administered once or twice daily (BID) with the main meal(s) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. When taken once daily (OD), the patient can change the time of IDegAsp administration as needed, provided it is dosed with the largest meal of the day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>The distinct basal and prandial characteristics of the IDeg and IAsp components of IDegAsp, which are preserved at steady state (SS) in subjects with T1DM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], help to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia compared with standard premix insulins such as biphasic insulin apart 30 (BIAsp 30) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, the need remains to determine the pharmacodynamic profile of IDegAsp in patients of different ages, and, similar to the study with IDeg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], such data are valuable for clinical practice, as well as required by the regulatory bodies. Thus, the primary objective of this study was to investigate the pharmacodynamic profiles of IDegAsp and BIAsp 30 in elderly subjects (aged &#x02265;65&#x000a0;years) and younger adult subjects (aged 18&#x02013;35&#x000a0;years) with T1DM.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study Design</title><p>This was a randomised, single-centre (Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Endocrinology and Nuclear Medicine, University of Graz, Auenbruggerplatz 15, Graz, Austria), double-blind, single-dose, two-period, crossover trial in subjects with T1DM (Clinical trials.gov number: NCT01174303). Before initiation of the trial, the protocol, consent form and subject information sheet were reviewed and approved by appropriate authorities and the Independent Ethics Committee of the Medical University of Graz (Ethikkommission der Medizinischen Universit&#x000e4;t Graz) according to local regulations. The trial was performed according to the Declaration of Helsinki [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and its amendments and Good Clinical Practice as defined by the International Conference on Harmonisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Subjects were informed of the risks and benefits of the trial and that they could withdraw from the trial at any time for any reason. Consent was obtained in writing before any trial-related activities, and the investigator retained the consent forms.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study Population</title><p>Subjects were men and women aged &#x02265;65&#x000a0;years (elderly group) or aged 18&#x02013;35&#x000a0;years (younger adult group) with T1DM for &#x02265;12&#x000a0;months and a fasting C-peptide level &#x0003c;0.3&#x000a0;nmol/L. Other key inclusion criteria included subjects who had been treated with insulin (&#x0003c;1.2&#x000a0;IU/kg/day) for &#x02265;12&#x000a0;months, body mass index (BMI) of 18.0&#x02013;28.0&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup> (inclusive) and glycosylated haemoglobin of &#x02264;10.0&#x000a0;%. Key exclusion criteria were the same as in a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and included smoking, recurrent severe hypoglycaemia (more than one severe hypoglycaemic event during the last 12&#x000a0;months), hypoglycaemic unawareness and hospitalisation for diabetic ketoacidosis during the previous 6&#x000a0;months.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Study Procedures</title><p>Subjects were randomly assigned to two single-dose administrations of 0.5&#x000a0;U/kg IDegAsp or BIAsp 30 at two separate visits (BIAsp 30 was included primarily as a control for differentiation between drug- and population-related differences in pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, in case differences between age groups were observed for IDegAsp). The trial consisted of 10 visits: a screening visit (Visit 1), two treatment periods (Visits 2&#x02013;5 and Visits 6&#x02013;9) and a follow-up visit (Visit 10). At each of the two dosing visits, subjects remained hospitalised for 48&#x000a0;h following product administration.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Euglycaemic Glucose Clamp Procedure</title><p>The pharmacodynamic effects of IDegAsp were evaluated using a 26-h euglycaemic clamp procedure (target blood glucose 5.5&#x000a0;mmol/L, [100&#x000a0;mg/dL]), beginning after dosing during Visit 2 (treatment period 1) and Visit 6 (treatment period 2), similar to the approach described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] (see Supporting information for details). The clamp procedure was terminated early if plasma glucose levels consistently exceeded 11.1&#x000a0;mmol/L (200&#x000a0;mg/dL) without any glucose infusion in the previous 30&#x000a0;min.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Pharmacokinetic Sampling</title><p>Following IDegAsp administration, serum concentrations of IAsp and IDeg were analysed separately. Blood samples were collected at the times specified in Table S1. Serum IAsp concentrations after IDegAsp and BIAsp 30 administration were analysed at the same time points until 12&#x000a0;h and 24&#x000a0;h after dosing, respectively. IDeg concentrations were analysed until 120&#x000a0;h post-dosing. Serum IDeg and serum IAsp concentrations were measured using a validated, specific, sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Safety Assessments</title><p>Safety endpoints comprised adverse events, including local injection-site reactions, laboratory safety variables, physical examination, vital signs, electrocardiogram and hypoglycaemic episodes (defined as &#x02018;confirmed&#x02019; when they were either &#x02018;severe&#x02019; as defined by the American Diabetes Association [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] or verified by a plasma glucose level of &#x0003c;3.1&#x000a0;mmol/L [56&#x000a0;mg/dL]).</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Data and Statistical Analysis</title><p>No formal sample size calculations for this trial were performed. The pharmacodynamic response of IDegAsp was determined by calculating the area under the curve (AUC)<sub>GIR,0&#x02013;24,SD</sub> using the linear trapezoidal technique on interpolated data points. The log-transformed AUC<sub>GIR,0&#x02013;24,SD</sub> for the IDegAsp treatment was analysed using a linear model with age group (elderly/young adult) and treatment period (period 1/2) as fixed effects. Glucose infusion rate (GIR) data were smoothed using the Loess smoothing technique using a fixed smoothing parameter of 0.1 for the bolus (the first 6&#x000a0;h) and 0.25 for the basal (from 6&#x000a0;h onwards) part of the curve with combined smoothing. GIR data were smoothed to show the mean GIR profiles, excluding fluctuations caused by the clamp method. Smoothed data may not always start at 0 as each point in the smoothed plot is computed as a weighted average of the values before and after the data point, giving most weight to the closest neighbouring data points. Only data after the injection time point are included (non-zero positive values) and therefore the plot does not start at 0 (see &#x0201c;<xref rid="Sec11" ref-type="sec">Results</xref>&#x0201d;). All pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic endpoints and safety endpoints were analysed based on the full analysis set and the safety analysis set, respectively. Safety endpoints were summarised using descriptive statistics.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Pharmacodynamic Modelling</title><p>To simulate SS pharmacodynamic profiles from this single-dose study, a population pharmacodynamic model was used to describe the GIR response for IDegAsp.

The pharmacodynamic profiles of IDegAsp as assessed by AUC<sub>GIR,0&#x02013;24h,SD</sub> were similar for elderly and younger adult subjects and IDegAsp was well tolerated in the study population. The mean GIR profiles of IDegAsp reflected the different and distinct actions of its bolus and basal insulin components, as shown by a rapid increase after dosing until GIR<sub>max,SD</sub> followed by a rapid decline, after which the GIR stabilised for the remainder of the clamp period. This was also previously demonstrated during a euglycaemic clamp procedure with increasing IDegAsp doses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. It is noteworthy that in the present study the variability in the AUC<sub>GIR,0&#x02013;24,SD</sub> between subjects seemed greater in the elderly subjects than in the younger adults based on the standard deviation (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). This may be because of the heterogeneity of insulin resistance among the elderly, as insulin resistance can increase with age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>The maximum GIR was lower after single doses of IDegAsp compared with BIAsp 30 in elderly or younger adult subjects. However, for BIAsp 30, GIR returned to baseline values 18&#x02013;22&#x000a0;h after injection, namely before the next dose in a OD regimen. By comparison, a greater glucose-lowering effect has been demonstrated with IDegAsp at SS compared with a single dose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] owing to the long-acting nature of IDeg, which persists beyond a 24-h dosing interval. At SS, the total and maximum glucose-lowering effects for IDegAsp were comparable to BIAsp 30 in both populations (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). As a basal insulin analogue with a half-life extending beyond 24&#x000a0;h, IDeg achieves SS in 2&#x02013;3&#x000a0;days (defined as a serum concentration reaching 90&#x000a0;% of the final plateau concentration and an intake of a drug in dynamic equilibrium with its elimination) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The longer duration of action provided by the IDeg component in IDegAsp, compared with the protaminated form of IAsp in BIAsp 30, shows that the long-acting, flat and sustained basal insulin properties of IDeg observed at SS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] are preserved in IDegAsp. SS therefore represents a more clinically relevant context in which to investigate the pharmacodynamic profile of IDegAsp when comparing this formulation with other insulins.</p><p>Modelling of simulated SS pharmacodynamic profiles in this study showed a parallel upshift in GIR profiles under simulated SS conditions compared with single-dose GIR profiles. The GIR (including GIR<sub>max</sub>) and the duration of action of IDegAsp are higher and longer, respectively, under simulated SS conditions compared with single-dose profiles. The findings at simulated SS conditions are in alignment with the results recently published for IDeg at SS in patients with T1DM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In the study by Korsatko et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] the long-acting properties of IDeg were comparable in elderly subjects and in younger adults.</p><p>Because IDegAsp can be administered OD or BID, pharmacodynamic profiles for both age groups were also simulated at SS using an IDegAsp BID model, by dividing the IDegAsp dose by two (0.25 U/kg BID). The basal glucose-lowering effect (owing to the IDeg component) was the same with OD or BID dosing because this is dependent on total dose rather than on the dosing frequency of IDegAsp. In contrast, as expected, the IAsp (bolus component) peak was approximately half the size with IDegAsp BID compared with IDegAsp OD. Similar results were also observed in a previous study with IDegAsp in adult subjects with T1DM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>In this study, the total exposure of both insulin components of IDegAsp was found to be similar between elderly subjects and younger adults (one subject with implausibly high exposure concentrations was removed). The mean concentration&#x02013;time profiles were also similar between both age groups, indicating that the absorption properties of IDeg and IAsp observed in younger adults are preserved in the elderly. Similar findings have also been reported by Korsatko et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] regarding the properties of IDeg in elderly subjects vs. younger adults at SS.</p><p>This study is the first of its type to report the properties of IDegAsp in the elderly population where the management of diabetes is further complicated by existing co-morbidities. A strength of this study is the use of a euglycaemic glucose clamp, which is considered as the &#x02018;gold standard&#x02019; in determining pharmacodynamic properties of insulin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The investigation of these properties in only patients with T1DM enabled the assessment of pharmacodynamic response under clamp conditions without interference from endogenous insulin, a potential complication and challenge when studying subjects with type 2 diabetes. The main limitation of this study is that the results are based on single-dose administrations rather than performed at SS conditions. While the simulated SS models are a valuable indicator of IDegAsp in this setting, it is important to verify these properties under clinical SS settings. In addition, the study included a relatively small number of subjects and larger-scale clinical trials with more patients and a narrower range of age groups with IDegAsp are therefore warranted.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study showed the distinct prandial and basal pharmacodynamic properties of IDegAsp previously reported in adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and for treatment with IDeg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] are preserved in elderly subjects. The glucose-lowering profile of IDegAsp over 24&#x000a0;h is preserved in elderly subjects with T1DM, consisting of a distinct peak action owing to the prandial IAsp component, in addition to the sustained long-acting effect of IDeg. The single-dose GIR profile observed for younger adults in this study was similar to those observed previously and modelling of OD IDegAsp effects at SS showed a slight upshift to a flatter profile owing to the IDeg component. The basal glucose-lowering effect of IDegAsp was retained under simulated SS conditions with BID dosing of IDegAsp.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec18"><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1"><media xlink:href="40266_2015_272_MOESM1_ESM.docx"><caption><p>Supplementary material 1 (DOCX 159 kb)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was supported financially by Novo Nordisk A/S, Denmark, which was also responsible for the design, analysis and reporting of the study, with input from the authors.
