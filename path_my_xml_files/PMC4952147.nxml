Traditional curative treatment of localized esophageal adenocarcinoma consisted of esophagectomy, achieving 3- and 5-year survival rates of 40&#x000a0;%/39&#x000a0;% (thoraco-abdominal esophagectomy) and 34&#x000a0;%/27&#x000a0;% (transhiatal esophagectomy) <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.12) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p>In addition to surgical resection, different neoadjuvant/perioperative strategies have been successfully developed to improve survival. Neoadjuvant chemoradiation is increasingly being applied and has also been introduced into different national and international guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The randomized Neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by surgery versus surgery alone for patients with adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus (CROSS) trial (366 patients, recruitment 2004&#x02013;2008) showed an improvement of overall survival after neoadjuvant chemoradiation with 41.4 Grey (Gy) and concomitant weekly carboplatin area under the curve (AUC) 2&#x000a0;mg/ml/min and paclitaxel 50&#x000a0;mg/m<sup>2</sup> and subsequent surgical resection compared to surgery alone (esophageal adenocarcinoma: 3-year survival 55&#x000a0;% vs. 46&#x000a0;% <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.049) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. A significant overall survival benefit with neoadjuvant chemoradiation and surgery compared to surgery alone for patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma was also confirmed by two systematic reviews [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>Beyond that, different protocols of perioperative chemotherapy (neoadjuvant&#x02009;+&#x02009;adjuvant) have been applied as an alternative to neoadjuvant chemoradiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. However, proofs of a clear survival benefit for patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma are missing because successfully completed randomized controlled trials (RCT) comparing perioperative chemotherapy with neoadjuvant chemoradiation are missing thus far and indirect comparisons are based on pooled and more or less heterogeneous patient cohorts including esophageal adenocarcinoma and gastric cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. With regard to perioperative chemotherapy, specifically two multicenter trials (MAGIC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and ACCORD-07 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]) found a significant increase in overall survival with cisplatin-fluoropyrimidine-based perioperative chemotherapy plus surgery compared to surgery alone. These two RCTs were carried out between 1994 and 2003 and recruited 26&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and 75&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], respectively of the patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma or junctional adenocarcinoma.</p><p>Besides the cisplatin-based protocols, oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy protocols (FLO/FLOT: 5-FU, leucovorin, oxaliplatin, +/&#x02212; docetaxel) have been developed and have been shown to be safe and efficacious for the perioperative treatment of esophageal adenocarcinoma and gastric cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Encouraging results have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] for perioperative chemotherapy in patients with esophagogastric adenocarcinoma with 3-year survival rates of up to 72&#x000a0;% using the FLOT regimen. The FLOT4 RCT (NCT01216644) which is currently running with the epirubricine-cisplatin-5FU or capecitabine (ECF/ECX) regimen as a comparator, will give conclusive data on safety and efficacy of the FLOT regimen.</p><p>The findings of the mentioned publications on perioperative chemotherapy and neoadjuvant chemoradiation were confirmed in our own patients (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;47) treated with perioperative chemotherapy with ECF (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;17) or FLOT (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;29) (3y/5y survival 68/63&#x000a0;%) or with neoadjuvant chemoradiation (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;58) (36 or 45&#x000a0;Gy, cisplatin and 5-FU) (3y/5y survival 52/45&#x000a0;%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Apart from a single RCT which compared neoadjuvant chemoradiation with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (carried out between 2000&#x02013;2005 and terminated prematurely due to poor accrual without showing significant differences concerning survival), this is the only comparative analysis on neoadjuvant chemoradiation versus perioperative chemotherapy in patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Rationale for the trial</title><p>According to the given evidence, a survival benefit of perioperative chemotherapy over neoadjuvant chemoradiation for patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma has not been proven in any RCT. Data supporting the value of perioperative chemotherapy have all been obtained in studies of mixed patient cohorts with esophageal adenocarcinoma and gastric cancer. Due to relevant differences of histologic and molecular subtype distribution, different response rates to perioperative chemotherapy and survival rates according to anatomic location, there is a clear need to obtain evidence concerning the value of perioperative chemotherapy for esophageal adenocarcinoma and compare its effectiveness with neoadjuvant chemoradiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. As nowadays perioperative chemotherapy is extensively and successfully applied in clinical practice in patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma, there is an obvious need to obtain evidence from a multicenter RCT.</p><p>Secondly, confirmation of the survival outcomes reported in the recently published CROSS study assessing neoadjuvant chemoradiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] merit validation in a separate RCT conducted exclusively in esophageal adenocarcinoma.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Design</title><p>The ESOPEC trial is a two-arm randomized phase III study in which patients are randomized to either perioperative chemotherapy according to the FLOT regimen (4 preoperative and 4 postoperative cycles of FLOT) or to neoadjuvant chemoradiation according to the CROSS regimen (41.1Gy plus carboplatin/paclitaxel) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The primary objective of this phase III trial is to investigate whether perioperative chemotherapy improves overall survival compared to neoadjuvant chemoradiation. To achieve this objective, 438 patients will be recruited for the trial. Randomization is performed in blocks concealed from the investigator in a ratio of 1:1 with N stage (cN0/cN+) and recruitment site as stratification factors. Written informed consent is obtained from all patients prior to participation in the trial. Patient recruitment is taking place at 16 trial centers in Germany.

The sample size calculation is based on the primary endpoint overall survival. It is assumed that the overall survival rate for esophageal adenocarcinoma patients treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiation according to the CROSS regimen is 55&#x000a0;% at 3&#x000a0;years after randomization, as observed in a comparable setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. For patients with perioperative (neoadjuvant and adjuvant) chemotherapy according to the FLOT regimen, a conservative assumption of an overall survival rate of 68&#x000a0;% is made. This assumption is based on survival rates of about 72&#x000a0;% reported for the treatment based on FLOT (i.e. FLOT&#x02009;+&#x02009;surgery&#x02009;+&#x02009;FLOT) in a different patient population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] as well as our own experience of 68&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and 70&#x000a0;% 3-year overall survival (retrospective analysis; esophageal adenocarcinoma; all patients treated with FLOT&#x02009;+&#x02009;surgery&#x02009;+&#x02009;FLOT; unpublished data). This corresponds to a hazard ratio of 0.645 of treatment arm A compared to treatment arm B. The treatment effect will be assessed by estimation of the hazard ratio with corresponding asymptotic two-sided 95&#x000a0;% confidence interval. To test superiority of arm A (based on FLOT) over arm B (based on CROSS) at one-sided significance level of 2.5&#x000a0;%, the null hypothesis is rejected if the asymptotic two-sided 95&#x000a0;% confidence interval lies completely below one. Under the above assumptions, the study is planned to detect superiority of arm A over arm B with a power of 80&#x000a0;%, which requires a total number of 163 events (deaths) to be observed. Yet, only 88-97&#x000a0;% of randomized patients are expected to be resectable at the time of surgery due to deterioration of tumor staging or the patient&#x02019;s overall condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. To account for a possibly diminished observed hazard ratio, the sample size is calculated to achieve a power of 90&#x000a0;%. Therefore, 218 events (deaths) have to be observed. The required number of patients to be randomized to observe this number of events depends on the length of follow-up. With a recruitment period of 3&#x000a0;years and an additional follow-up period after the end of recruitment of 3&#x000a0;years, it can safely be assumed that a sufficient number of events will have been observed by the end of the trial if a total of 438 patients are available for analysis.</p><p>The effect of treatment with respect to the primary endpoint overall survival will be estimated and tested by Cox regression. The regression model will include treatment (Arm A: FLOT vs. ArmB: CROSS), N stage (N0, N+), age and trial center as independent variables. As estimate of the effect size, the hazard ratio between the two treatment arms will be given with the corresponding asymptotic two-sided 95&#x000a0;% confidence interval. The two-sided test on the difference between the two treatment arms at two-sided significance level 5&#x000a0;% will be based on the corresponding asymptotic two-sided 95&#x000a0;% confidence interval from the Cox regression model. Overall survival rates in the two treatment arms will be estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Translational substudies</title><p>In the setting of the ESOPEC trial, correlative substudies are included addressing the value of circulating tumor cells, circulating tumor DNA, circulating miRNA, adipokines, inflammatory markers and possible proteomic determinants of malignancy as biomarkers for prognosis and treatment outcomes. Therefore, patient blood samples are drawn and analyzed pretherapeutically and during the course of treatment. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor specimens are centrally biobanked and analyzed. Tumor specimens include material from pre-treatment biopsies and operative specimens. A tissue bank of esophageal adenocarcinoma treated in well- standardized protocols with highly-controlled prospective clinical follow-up data will be created. The biological substudies of the trial are designed for validation of existing hypotheses and for discovery and generation of new hypotheses addressing important questions in chemotherapeutic and radiotherapeutic research of esophageal adenocarcinoma. Specifically, focus is on questions concerning biological determinants of chemotherapeutic and radiotherapeutic response and resistance. Comparison of pretherapeutic and intra- and posttherapeutic samples and specimens by the methods mentioned above may disclose biological differences in the tumors which could be used as criteria for choice of a specific therapeutic protocol in the future.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Discussion</title><p>The prognosis of surgically-treated esophageal adenocarcinoma has progressively improved over the past 20&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Besides improvement of patient selection, preoperative staging, perioperative critical care and surgical technique, this improved outcome is attributed to the incremental inclusion of patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma in multimodal treatment protocols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Since the publication of the MAGIC, ACCORD-07 and CROSS trials in the years 2006 &#x02013; 2012, these protocols have broadly entered clinical practice in Europe and have been integrated in national and international guidelines for the treatment of locally-advanced esophageal adenocarcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Although different studies have been carried out comparing either neoadjuvant chemoradiation or perioperative chemotherapy plus surgery versus surgery alone for esophageal and/or gastric adenocarcinoma, no prospective data comparing the contemporary regimens of neoadjuvant chemoradiation and perioperative chemotherapy in patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma are available. The present trial was started to obtain valid information whether neoadjuvant chemoradiation or perioperative chemotherapy yields superior benefits for the curative treatment of esophageal adenocarcinoma.</p><p>The ESOPEC trial compares perioperative chemotherapy plus surgery with neoadjuvant chemoradiation plus surgery, which serves as the control. Neoadjuvant chemoradiation plus surgery is the most widely-established treatment modality for esophageal cancer in Germany and some other Western countries and has been practiced for more than two decades. As neoadjuvant chemoradiation plus surgery has already been proven by an RCT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] to be superior to surgery alone, it serves as the control group and no surgery alone group is added. The neoadjuvant chemoradiation protocol with 41.4Gy plus carboplatin/paclitaxel (CROSS protocol) was chosen as the control intervention in the proposed trial, as it is the protocol with the highest evidence for prolongation of survival since the publication of the CROSS trial in 2012 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Moreover, the CROSS protocol offers the benefit of moderate toxicity compared to previously-used regimens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. For these reasons, the CROSS protocol has become widely distributed not only in the recruiting centers of this trial but also internationally in Western Europe and North America.</p><p>Perioperative chemotherapy plus surgery has been used frequently in specialized German cancer centers. The FLOT regimen has been chosen for the experimental arm because there are indications of superior response compared to previously-used taxane-free chemotherapy protocols, especially in patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], offering the chance for achieving higher R0 resection rates and better control of occult distant metastases. Although no results from RCTs and/or phase III studies have been published for perioperative chemotherapy with FLOT thus far, the promising results from phase II have made FLOT the protocol of choice for perioperative treatment of esophageal adenocarcinoma and gastric cancer in many specialized German cancer centers.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The ESOPEC trial is a multicenter prospectively-randomized controlled trial, comparing neoadjuvant chemoradiation according to the CROSS regimen followed by surgery versus perioperative chemotherapy according to the FLOT regimen and surgery for the curative treatment of esophageal adenocarcinoma. It is hypothesized that perioperative chemotherapy will result in increased overall survival due to a comparable local effect and a better control of micrometastatic distant disease.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Abbreviations</title><p>AEG, esophagogastric adenocarcinoma; ALT, alanine transaminase; ARDS, acute respiratory distress syndrome; AST, aspartate transaminase; AUC, area under the curve; CDC, center of disease control; CROSS protocol, &#x0201c;Chemoradiation followed by surgery versus surgery alone for patients with adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus&#x0201d;; CT, computed tomography; ECF, epirubricine-cisplatin-5FU; ECOG, Eastern cooperative oncology group; ECX, epirubricine-cisplatin-capecitabine; EORTC, European Organization of research and treatment of cancer; FEV1, forced expiratory volume in one second; FFPE, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded; FLOT protocol, 5-FU/leucovorin/oxaliplatin/docetaxel; Gy, Grey; MCDC, modified clavien-dindo classification; PFS, progression-free survival; RCT, randomized controlled trial; RFS, recurrence-free survival; UICC, Union internationale contre le cancer; ULN, upper level of normal</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec27"><title>Additional files</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="12885_2016_2564_MOESM1_ESM.docx" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1: Table S1.</label><caption><p>Visit schedule Arm A (FLOT).
