quadriceps femoris on functions of elderly women. [Subjects and Methods] The subjects of
this study were 22 elderly women with osteoarthritis, who were divided into two groups of
a general exercise group 12 elderly and a kinesiology taping group 12 elderly. Two groups
underwent a 30-min exercise for strengthening the lower limb muscles three times per week
for four weeks. After the exercise, the kinesiology taping group was treated by the
kinesio taping. Kinesio tapes were attached to the quadriceps femoris, three times per
week for four weeks. The Korean Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis
Index, sit to standing, and Time up &#x00026; Go test were used for assessment before and
after the intervention. [Results] As a result, the kinesiology taping group showed
significant differences in the Korean Western Ontario and McMaster Universities
Osteoarthritis Index, sit to standing, and Time up &#x00026; Go test between pre- and
post-intervention, while the general exercise group showed no significant differences in
pre- and post-intervention. There was a significant difference in between-group
comparison. [Conclusion] The kinesio taping for the quadriceps femoris was effective on
improving functions of elderly women with osteoarthritis.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Kinesio taping</kwd><kwd>Osteoarthritis</kwd><kwd>Elderly women</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Osteoarthritis is a type of disease that the articular cartilage is gradually degraded due
to aging, excessive use, and trauma to induce problems with the body function.
Osteoarthritis causes joint pain, stiffness, and limited range of joint motion to restrict
functional daily life activities such as walking and going up and down stairs<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Restriction in functional daily life
activities directly affects quality of life and is associated with emotional symptoms such
as depression<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. When gender and lower
extremity muscle strength were analyzed for osteoarthritis patients, more women had
osteoarthritis than men, and knee joint extensor and flexor muscle defects were found among
the lower extremity muscles<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. In
particular, weakening of the quadriceps femoris increases weight bearing on the knee joints
in walking and moving to induce pain and affects the proprioceptive information of the
muscles and the joints to reduce capacity of balancing<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Patients with
osteoarthritis perform various exercises to control pain and maintain range of joint motion,
and exercises for strengthening quadriceps femoris are important to improve functional
activities. Kinesio taping is usually applied to those patients, as well as muscle
strengthening exercises. The Kinesio taping to the quadriceps femoris can strengthen the
muscle, positively affecting daily life activities<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The kinesio taping has recently been applied to a variety of physical therapies. Elastic
tapes attached to the muscles can inhibit or promote muscle tension to reduce pain, increase
range of joint motion, and improve muscular strength<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. The taping normalizes abnormal movements of the knee joints and
increases the muscular activity of the quadriceps femoris<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>, while its tactile stimulation excites Ia afferents to increase
activity of afferent sensory nerve. The kinesio taping consequently enables strengthening
weakened muscles, and stimulates the gamma motor neurons of the quadriceps femoris weakened
by pathological changes of the knee joints to display muscular enhancement<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Osteoarthritis is more common in females than males, inducing pain and dysfunction due to
pathologic changes in the knees. The kinesio taping is widely used in clinical practices to
control pain and improve functions. In this context, we in this study investigated effects
of kinesio taping to the quadriceps femoris on functions of elderly women, presenting a
basis of clinical care.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects of this study were 22 elderly women visiting a welfare center in Seongnam
City; they were diagnosed with osteoarthritis, able to do daily life activities, and had the
MMSE score of 24 or more. Those who had a fracture of the lower extremities or damage in the
central nervous system or the peripheral nervous system were excluded from this study. The
subjects voluntarily consented to participate in this study. This study was approved by the
Research Ethics Committee of Kyungdong University.</p><p>The subjects were divided into two groups, a general exercise group (GEG, n=12) and a
kinesio taping group (KTG, n=12). The GEG was 76.7 &#x000b1; 4.9&#x02005;years old, 154.2 &#x000b1; 5&#x02005;cm, and 57.3 &#x000b1;
8.6&#x02005;kg, while the KTG was 75.6 &#x000b1; 3.2&#x02005;years old, 155.1 &#x000b1; 4.5&#x02005;cm, and 59.2 &#x000b1; 4.2&#x02005;kg.</p><p>The GEG and the KTG underwent a 30-min exercise consisting of open and close kinetic chain
for strengthening the lower limb muscles three times per week for four weeks. After the
exercise, the KTG was treated by the kinesio taping. KTG&#x02019;s Miracle Tape (Miracle Tape, Tera
Medical, Republic of Korea) was applied three times per week for four weeks. When a patient
sat on a bed, a 5-cm wide kinesio tape was cut into a Y shape and attached from the tibial
tubercle as the null point of the quadriceps femoris through the side of the kneepan to the
anterior inferior iliac spine as the origin site.</p><p>We used the Korean Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (K-WOMAC)
for measuring the lower limb functions. The K-WOMAC was a self-administered questionnaire to
assess pain and functional performance of patients with osteoarthritis. It had a total of 24
items including pain (five items), joint stiffness (2 items), and physical function (17
items); the pain consisted of conditions during activity or rest. The sit to standing (STS)
measured the time (in seconds) during five sets of sitting and standing in a chair without
armrests and backrests; the average time (in seconds) was recorded by repeating the
measurement three times in total. For the time up &#x00026; go test (TUG), the investigator
measured the time (in seconds) from sitting with one&#x02019;s back against a 46-cm high armrest
chair to sitting on a chair again after passing the halfway point of 3 meters from the
chair. The average time (in seconds) was recorded by repeating the measurement three times
in total.</p><p>The data was statistically processed using the SPSS version 18. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov was
used to verify normal distribution, the Wilcoxon test was used to compare the changes in the
measured variables between the pre- and the post- intervention, and the Mann-Whitney U test
was conducted to compare the differences of the measurements in each group. For all the
tests, statistical significance was set as &#x003b1;=0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>According to the results of this study, the KTG showed significant differences in the
K-WOMAC, the TUG, and the STS between pre- and post-intervention, while the GEG showed no
significant differences in the K-WOMAC, the TUG, and the STS. Meanwhile, a significant
difference was observed between the KTG and the GEG in between-group comparison (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Comparison of K-WOMAC, TUG and STS between groups</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Group</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pre</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Post</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="2" colspan="1">K-WOMAC (points)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">KTG<sup>*</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">44.09 &#x000b1; 11.64</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">30.27 &#x000b1; 9.64<sup>&#x02020;</sup></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">GEG</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">43.00 &#x000b1; 10.53</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">41.72 &#x000b1; 9.50</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4" rowspan="1"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="2" colspan="1">TUG (seconds)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">KTG<sup>*</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">9.67 &#x000b1; 1.34</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8.88 &#x000b1; 1.36<sup>&#x02020;</sup></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">GEG</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10.46 &#x000b1; 1.14</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10.38 &#x000b1; 1.36</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4" rowspan="1"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="2" colspan="1">STS (seconds)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">KTG<sup>*</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">11.51 &#x000b1; 2.58</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">9.53 &#x000b1; 1.76<sup>&#x02020;</sup></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">GEG</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">11.53 &#x000b1; 1.80</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">11.27 &#x000b1; 1.69</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>K-WOMAC: Korean Western Ontario and McMaster Universities; TUG: Time up &#x00026; Go

between the muscle and the skin to increase circulation of blood and lymph. These
physiological changes improve the motor skills of the muscle to increase the range of joint
motion. The kinesio taping provides proper sensory feedback, engaging in controlling pain of
patients with osteoarthritis<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>; the
tailor-made kinesio taping within the guidelines of non-pharmacologic treatment can be
effective on the management of osteoarthritis; and the taping methods is a type of
intervention reducing stress in the knee joints and alleviating symptoms due to pathological
changes to be effective on reducing pain and dysfunction<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>When the kinesio taping was applied to the quadriceps femoris of osteoarthritis patients,
the pain was reduced and functions were recovered<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>; the KTG showed significant differences in the WOMAC score when
compared to the GEG and their quadriceps femoris were strengthened<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>; and the KTG showed significant differences in pain
reduction, increase in range of joint motion, and the WOMAC score, when compared to a group
of general physical therapy modalities. Thus, the kinesio taping is a type of nonsurgical
intervention effective on pain reduction, amicable daily life activities, and increase in
range of joint motion of patient with osteoarthritis<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In this study, when the GEG and the KTG were compared, the KTG showed significant
differences in the K-WOMAC, the TUG, and the STS between the pre- and the post-intervention,
while the GEG showed no significant differences in the K-WOMAC, the TUG, and the STS. There
was a significant difference between the KTG and the GEG in between-group comparison. The
results of this study are consistent with those of other studies, in which the kinesio
taping intervention to the quadriceps femoris was effective on improving the functions of
osteoarthritis patients. We did not assess the VAS and the ROM, but the kinesio taping
intervention might be effective on reducing pain and increasing the range of joint motion to
improve functions of the patient with osteoarthritis.</p><p>When the kinesio taping was applied to healthy adults, the ability of moving the body
center of gravity to the left and right side was improved<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. The kinesio taping applied to the quadriceps femoris of athletes
improved dynamic balancing. These results were caused by the proprioceptive stimulus of the
kinesio taping, indicating that the taping methods was effective on prevention of the knee
joint damage and appropriate as a intervention of treatment<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. The proprioceptive stimulus by the kinesio taping may be markedly
appropriate as a type of intervention for prevention of falls by improving balancing of the
elderly. In conclusion, the kinesio taping for the quadriceps femoris was effective on
improving functions of elderly women with osteoarthritis, and it may be an appropriate
method of rehabilitation for pain control, muscular strengthening, and balance enhancement.
This study is limited in that the number of the subject was small. Further studies may be
needed to investigate a correlation between functional improvement and balancing when
kinesio taping is applied.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Fitzgerald</surname><given-names>GK</given-names></name><name><surname>Hinman</surname><given-names>RS</given-names></name><name><surname>Zeni</surname><given-names>J</given-names><suffix>Jr</suffix></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>OARSI Clinical Trials Recommendations: design and conduct
