In 1926, Norberg introduced the coronally repositioned periosteal flap operation,[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and in 1993 Prato <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] devised the term coronally advanced flap (CAF). CAF is frequently combined with various regenerative materials and biologic factors aiming to attain both regeneration of functional attachment apparatus and root coverage.</p><p>Recently, platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) has gained prominence status for obtaining periodontal regeneration predictably.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] PRF obtained using Chaoukran's protocol, is a second-generation platelet concentrate.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] It is considered as an autologous leukocyte and PRF biomaterial,[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] that consists of an intimate assemblage of cytokines, structural glycoproteins, and glycanic chains, enmeshed within a slowly polymerized network of fibrin. As an adjunct to CAF, the beneficial effects of PRF in gingival recession defect coverage has been elucidated with promising results.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>Within few days after fertilization, the human placenta starts developing. It is crucial to the survival and development of the fetus during the gestation. It is approximately 10&#x02013;15 &#x000b5;m in thickness and consists of two fetal sheaths; the outer chorion and the inner amnion membrane (AM).[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Amniotic fluid and fetus are enclosed in AM. Because of its high flexibility, it is easily separated from the chorion. AM has the unique feature in that it lacks antigenicity with potent antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties. Allograft AM, obtained from fetal tissue encompasses growth factors that support the formation of granulation tissues by stimulating neo-vascularization and fibroblast growth and forms an initial physiologic seal with host tissue impeding microbial adulteration. Furthermore, it contains cells within the tissue that exhibit stem cells physiognomies for enhancing the clinical consequences. Besides providing a matrix for cellular migration and proliferation it also enhances the wound healing process. AM is now under the research for the management of gingival recession and revealed promising results for the same.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Gurinsky,[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] in a case series, reported promising results with processed dehydrated allograft amnion membrane in the management of gingival recession.</p><p>In addition to acceptable results of root coverage, the current objective of periodontal plastic surgery is to cultivate less or minimally invasive surgical techniques that favors prompt wound healing, fewer postoperative discomfort, and greater satisfaction of patient. The surgical operating microscope has been used to attain these objectives because it offers good illumination and magnification of the operative field, along with more precise and minimal trauma to involved tissue, thus permitting accurate co-adaptation of wound edges and healing by primary intention.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] More recently, use of ophthalmic knives allow the periodontist to make precise, minimally invasive incisions while leaving a sharp wound edge. Published data reported enhanced clinical outcome in the management of gingival recessions with the use of the microsurgical approach;[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] however, clinical and laboratory training is required for effective application of surgical operating microscope with less surgical trauma and postoperative pain.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>The term &#x0201c;gingival biotype&#x0201d; has been used to designate the gingival thickness (GT) in the faciopalatal dimension,[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and correct diagnosis of the type of &#x0201c;gingival biotype&#x0201d; is of the paramount importance for concocting an appropriate treatment plan and achieving esthetic expectable result.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Methods employed in evaluating GT are invasive methods, e.g., using injection needle, probe, histologic sections, or cephalometric radiographs and noninvasive methods, e.g., ultrasonic devices.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>Thus, the present study was conducted to compare the baseline, 3-month and 6-month follow-up outcomes following CAF procedures under the microsurgical approach in the management of Miller's Class I and II gingival recession defects with the use of either PRF or amnion membrane (AM) in comparison to CAF alone.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>The present controlled clinical study was conducted in Department of Periodontology, from December 2012 to November 2014.

The secondary objectives were to evaluate the patient satisfaction with both the experimental groups and control alone; and to evaluate the change in GT measurements both experimental and control groups. Both TGP and USG were compared for gingival biotype assessment before and after different treatment modalities.</p><p>All 23 patients completed the study uneventfully, therefore representing the nonimmunogenic nature of both the experimental materials (PRF and AM) and aptness of the surgical technique.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] All the patients were maintaining their oral hygiene as per instructions given throughout the study. Compliance with initial phase and continuous reinforcement of the importance of meticulous oral hygiene resulted in minimal plaque scores. This resulted in the reduction of gingival inflammation and absence of bleeding on probing at all surgical sites.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>At the follow-up of 3-month, there was the nonsignificant increase in PPD values for the Group I (CAF with PRF) followed by nonsignificant reduction to baseline values in PPD values at 6 months as compared to baseline. Similar to our study, Eren and Atilla,[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] Aroca <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and Jankovic <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] also reported nonsignificant changes in PPD values at 6 months in PRF treated sites. For Group II (CAF with AM) and Group III (CAF alone), there was the nonsignificant reduction in PPD values at 3 months and at 6 months follow-up, as compared to baseline. Wallace,[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] reported PPD reduction 0.8 mm at 4 months using placental derived membrane. Paolantonio,[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] corroborated nonsignificant change after root coverage procedure to the compatible condition of gingival health after initial therapy and patient selection, thus reported the expectation of nonsignificant improvement in PPD values.</p><p>Our results of CAL gain with CAF with PRF were comparative to results observed by Jankovic <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Uraz <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and Padma <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] whereas, Aleksic <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] reported no statistically significant changes in PPD and CAL in CAF with PRF group. Wallace[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] in a case report observed CAL gain of 2.4 mm at 4 months using placental derived membrane.

Improvement in CAL is because of recession coverage that results from the coronal shift of attachment apparatus during CAF procedures.[<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] Although, this is not substantiated in the histological study, however, based on clinical examinations, improvement in CAL can be explained.</p><p>Our result showed statistically more significant recession coverage (VGR) with average values of 1.47 &#x000b1; 0.92 mm (56%) in Group I (CAF with PRF); followed by Group II (CAF with AM) with mean value of 0.67 &#x000b1; 1.23 mm (36%) which were higher than Group III (CAF alone) where mean value of 0.60 &#x000b1; 1.06 mm (33%) was observed after 6 months postintervention.

Although, every care was taken while recording GT-TGP measurements, however, probe angulations, the precision of manual probe markings and reproducibility of the sites may be the source of error in TGP. USG method was found to be unswerving and noninvasive method of GT measurement, as the incongruity between the measurements was nominal at the mid-buccal site, when the GT fluctuated between 0 and 0.5 mm.[<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] It has been reported that as compared to TGP, GT measurement using USG seems to be more accurate, rapid and atraumatic;[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] and in contrast to invasive TGP, with USG, every minuscule part of precious soft tissue may be preserved even better.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</p><p>To evaluate patient response and acceptance for surgical treatment modality of gingival recession, patients were analyzed using PCS, PES and HS based on VAS as explained in material and method. At baseline PCS values were highest for Group II (CAF with AM), followed by Group III (CAF alone) and Group I (CAF with PRF). At the end of 6 months follow-up, there was significant increase in PCS for all the groups, but it was highest for Group II (CAF with AM) representing more patient comfort in terms of postsurgical pain and inflammation in AM treated sites. At the end of 6 months follow-up, there was significant increase in PES for all the groups, but it was highest for Group I (CAF with PRF) as compared to, almost similar PES for Group II (CAF with AM) and Group III (CAF alone). Although there is no comparative analysis, many studies have reported better healing parameters and significant recession coverage that improves patient esthetic appearance in PRF treated gingival defects that were similar to the results of the present study.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]</p><p>At baseline, HS values were highest for the Group I (CAF with PRF), followed by Group III (CAF alone) and Group II (CAF with AM). In a systematic review by Douglas de Oliveira <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] reported that there is insufficient evidence to conclude that surgical root coverage procedure predictably reduces cervical dentinal hypersensitivity, however, present study observed nonsignificant decrease in HS values in all the groups.</p><p>In the present study, none of the treatment modalities achieved complete root coverage in more than 50% of sites. The present study observed enhancement in root coverage when PRF or AM are used in conjunction with CAF as compared to CAF alone. However, results obtained are not as prominent as reported in the already published literature. These results may be attributed to lower mean values of GT (&#x0003c;1 mm) in all the groups at baseline. Gingival biotype that is thick has a tendency toward maintaining a more stable soft tissue in various periodontal surgical procedures.[<xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref><xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] Low sample size, short-term study with fair oral hygiene instead of meticulous plaque control amongst subjects and lack of histological evaluation were the other limitations. These results are based on single-centered small sample size study; henceforth long-term, multi-centered randomized, controlled clinical trials are further required.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>From the results of the present study, it may be inferred, that PRF should be considered as better material for root coverage and increasing GT as compared to amnion membrane (AM) and CAF alone. However, for patient acceptance in terms of healing, AM was observed to be better as compared to PRF and CAF alone. Further, PRF is autologous, simple to procure, cost effective, nonimmunogenic biomaterial with excellent handling properties, whereas amnion membrane (AM), besides being allograft material, cannot be prepared or procured in routine clinical setup. Although microsurgical technique results in better postoperative outcome however, training and extra space in clinical set up for surgical operating microscope may preclude its use in routine practice.</p><sec id="sec2-18"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-19"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>The authors thank Saraswati Dental College, Lucknow, India for providing infrastructural support for the conduct of the study.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Avinash</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Selvan</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Coronally advanced flap in the treatment of recession coverage</article-title><source>Int J Dent Case Rep</source><year>2014</year><volume>4</volume><fpage>1</fpage><lpage>10</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Prato</surname><given-names>GP</given-names></name><name><surname>Clauser</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Cortellini</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Guided tissue regeneration and a free gingival graft for the management of buccal recession: A case report</article-title><source>Int J Periodontics Restorative Dent</source><year>1993</year><volume>13</volume><fpage>486</fpage><lpage>93</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">8181909</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Padma</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Shilpa</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Kumar</surname><given-names>PA</given-names></name><name><surname>Nagasri</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Kumar</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Sreedhar</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>A split mouth randomized controlled study to evaluate the adjunctive effect of platelet-rich fibrin to coronally advanced flap in Miller's class-I and II recession defects</article-title><source>J Indian Soc Periodontol</source><year>2013</year><volume>17</volume><fpage>631</fpage><lpage>6</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">24174758</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Choukroun</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Diss</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Simonpieri</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Girard</surname><given-names>MO</given-names></name><name><surname>Schoeffler</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Dohan</surname><given-names>SL</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Platelet-rich fibrin (PRF): a second-generation platelet concentrate.
