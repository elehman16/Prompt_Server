Sepsis is considered to be a microcirculation-mitochondrial distress syndrome. Azurocidin (AZU), a protein with strong heparin-binding potential that induces inflammatory responses and apoptosis, has been shown to increase the permeability of endothelial cells and induce the prognosis of sepsis. However, the function of AZU in mitochondrial oxygen metabolism has yet to be reported. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether heparin exhibits an antagonistic effect on AZU-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and to further investigate the possible underlying mechanisms. HUVECs were randomly assigned into blank control, AZU, heparin plus AZU and heparin groups. The blank control group were incubated with phosphate-buffered saline for 12 h, while the AZU group were incubated with 1 &#x003bc;g/ml AZU for 12 h. The heparin plus AZU group were incubated with 100 &#x003bc;g/ml heparin for 2 h, followed by the addition of 1 &#x003bc;g/ml AZU and incubation for 12 h. The heparin group were incubated with 100 &#x003bc;g/ml heparin for 12 h. Flow cytometry was used to determine the mitochondrial membrane potential, while electron microscopy was used to determine the mitochondrial morphology. Western blotting and quantitative polymerase chain reaction were used to determine the protein and mRNA expression levels of Cox II in the mitochondria, respectively. Western blotting was also used to evaluate the concentration of AZU in cytoplasm, along with immunofluorescence analysis. AZU was revealed to decrease the mitochondrial membrane potential, reduce cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidase subunit II expression and destroy the morphology of the mitochondria. Heparin exhibited an antagonistic function on these processes and inhibited the endocytosis of AZU by HUVECs. In conclusion, the results indicated that AZU inhibited the oxygen metabolic function in mitochondria, and this function was effectively antagonized by heparin via the inhibition of AZU endocytosis by HUVECs. Therefore, heparin may be a potential therapeutic agent for treating mitochondrial dysfunction in the future.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>sepsis</kwd><kwd>heparin</kwd><kwd>azurocidin</kwd><kwd>mitochondrial oxygen metabolism function</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Heparin is a potent blood anticoagulant, and previous studies have demonstrated that it can attenuate inflammatory responses and organ function injury in sepsis (<xref rid="b1-etm-08-05-1473" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b4-etm-08-05-1473" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Sepsis is the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) secondary to bacterial infection (<xref rid="b5-etm-08-05-1473" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). SIRS is characterized by the activation of the inflammatory and coagulation systems, which can lead to generalized hypoperfusion, multiple organ failure and mortality. Previous studies have shown that septic plasma reduces the oxygen consumption of healthy mitochondria. In addition, sepsis severity has been shown to significantly correlate with mitochondrial function inhibition (<xref rid="b6-etm-08-05-1473" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Thus, sepsis is considered to be a microcirculation-mitochondrial distress syndrome (<xref rid="b7-etm-08-05-1473" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).</p><p>Azurocidin (AZU), a protein with strong heparin-binding potential, is stored in neutrophil granules and is released following the stimulation of cells in proximity to endothelial cells. AZU is known to be a multifunctional inflammatory mediator with the ability to induce vascular leakage (<xref rid="b8-etm-08-05-1473" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). In addition, AZU has been hypothesized to promote the release of inflammatory factors and inhibit apoptosis (<xref rid="b9-etm-08-05-1473" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b11-etm-08-05-1473" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). A previous study demonstrated that plasma AZU levels were significantly higher in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock when compared with patients with a non-septic illness in the intensive care unit (<xref rid="b12-etm-08-05-1473" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Furthermore, AZU has been found to be associated with the severity of disease, and elevated AZU levels at admission were shown to correlate with an increased risk of mortality (<xref rid="b13-etm-08-05-1473" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="b14-etm-08-05-1473" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Endothelial cells are able to uptake AZU, and the internalized protein is targeted to perinuclear compartments of the endothelial cells, where AZU colocalizes with the mitochondria (<xref rid="b10-etm-08-05-1473" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).</p><p>Although increased AZU levels and the inhibition of mitochondrial function are associated with the severity of sepsis, the function of AZU in mitochondrial oxygen metabolism has yet to be reported. Therefore, the present study investigated mitochondrial oxygen metabolism function by analyzing the mitochondrial membrane potential (&#x00394;&#x003a8;), mitochondrial morphology and the expression of cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidase subunit II (Cox II). In addition, the present study investigated the inhibitory effect of heparin on the endocytosis of AZU by human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>HUVECs were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA).

The HUVECs were homogenized 50 times and centrifuged at 600 &#x000d7; g at 4&#x000b0;C for 10 min.

The specimens were embedded in SPI-Pon 812 (Structure Probe, Inc./SPI Supplies, West Chester, PA, USA), and 600&#x02013;800-nm sections were prepared.

The proteins were quantified using the Bradford method. Samples of 50 &#x003bc;g protein were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). The membranes were incubated overnight at 4&#x000b0;C with antibodies against Cox II (ab79393; 1:100) and Cox IV (ab110272; 1:100; Abcam, Shanghai, China), AZU (sc-33129; 1:100) and &#x003b2;-actin (sc-130301; 1:500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.

The conditions were as follows: 95&#x000b0;C for 30 sec, followed by 40 cycles at 95&#x000b0;C for 5 sec and 60&#x000b0;C for 30 sec. A dissociation step was performed to generate a melting curve to confirm the specificity of the amplification. Cox IV was used as the reference gene.

The HUVECs were incubated with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody (F4512,Sigma-Aldrich) for 60 min at room temperature in the dark. The nuclei were dyed with DAPI (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Boston, MA, USA) for cellular localization, and the system was sealed by half a drop of anti-fluorescent quencher (Solarbio Science &#x00026; Technology Co., Ltd., Beijing, China). The samples were viewed using a laser scanning confocal microscope (FV1000S-SIM/IX81; Olympus Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) at a magnification of &#x000d7;600, from which the green fluorescence intensity was calculated.

All the P-values were based on a two-sided statistical analysis and P&#x0003c;0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Mitochondrial membrane potential (&#x00394;&#x003a8;) changes in each group</title><p>Flow cytometry was employed to evaluate the &#x00394;&#x003a8; in each group of HUVECs, and was measured as the red fluorescence intensity ratio. Compared with the blank control group (90.59&#x000b1;0.05, n=4), the &#x00394;&#x003a8; was found to decrease in the AZU group (81.07&#x000b1;0.07; n=4; P&#x0003c;0.01). In the heparin plus AZU group (87.69&#x000b1;0.23, n=4), the &#x00394;&#x003a8; was higher compared with that in the AZU group (81.07&#x000b1;0.07; n=4; P&#x0003c;0.01; <xref rid="f1-etm-08-05-1473" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). These observations demonstrated that the &#x00394;&#x003a8; was inhibited by AZU, and this function was antagonized by heparin.</p></sec><sec><title>Changes to mitochondrial morphology in each group</title><p>Transmission electron microscopy was employed to evaluate the morphology of the mitochondria. The morphology of mitochondria in the blank control group was almost normal, with electron microscopy revealing that the matrix particles rarely disappeared and the crest was complete with the inside and outside membrane structures legible (<xref rid="f1-etm-08-05-1473" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). The majority of the mitochondrial matrix density in the AZU group was severely reduced and exhibited vacuolation. The crest had parted or disappeared, and sections of the inside and outside membrane structures had vanished (<xref rid="f1-etm-08-05-1473" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). The mitochondrial matrix density in the heparin plus AZU group was reduced and the crest was complete. In addition, the integrity of the inside and outside membranes was reserved, and few mitochondria showed vacuolation (<xref rid="f1-etm-08-05-1473" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). The majority of the mitochondrial matrix density in the heparin group was almost normal. The crest was complete, with the inside and outside membrane structures legible (<xref rid="f1-etm-08-05-1473" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). These observations demonstrated that AZU destroyed the structure of the mitochondria, but this function was antagonized by heparin.</p></sec><sec><title>Expression levels of Cox II in the mitochondria</title><p>Protein expression levels of Cox II were analyzed by western blotting. Cox II expression levels were found to be lower in the AZU group compared with those in the blank control group. In addition, higher Cox II expression levels were observed in the heparin plus AZU group than in the AZU group (<xref rid="f2-etm-08-05-1473" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Quantitative PCR was employed to evaluate the mRNA expression levels of Cox II, and the results indicated that Cox II expression was lower in the AZU group (0.60&#x000b1;0.02; n=4) compared with the blank control group (1.00&#x000b1;0.01; n=4; P&#x0003c;0.01). Compared with the AZU group (0.60&#x000b1;0.02; n=4), Cox II expression in the heparin plus AZU group (0.70&#x000b1;0.01; n=4) was higher (P&#x0003c;0.01; <xref rid="f2-etm-08-05-1473" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). These observations demonstrated that Cox II expression was inhibited by AZU, and this function was antagonized by heparin.</p></sec><sec><title>Uptake and internalization of AZU by HUVECs</title><p>Immunofluorescence analysis was used to evaluate the concentration of AZU. The intensity of green fluorescence was deemed to be the concentration of AZU. HUVECs exhibited the lowest green fluorescence intensity in the cytoplasm of the blank control and heparin groups (<xref rid="f3-etm-08-05-1473" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A and D</xref>). By contrast, the AZU group has the highest intensity of green fluorescence (<xref rid="f3-etm-08-05-1473" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). Compared with the AZU group, the intensity of green fluorescence was significantly reduced in the heparin plus AZU group (<xref rid="f3-etm-08-05-1473" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). In order to evaluate the relative cytoplasmic concentration of AZU, quantitative fluorescence was used to detect the green fluorescence intensity in the cytoplasm. The cytoplasmic green fluorescence intensity in the AZU group was significantly higher (157.4&#x000b1;4.36; n=4) compared with the blank control group (22.3&#x000b1;3.12; n=4; P&#x0003c;0.01). In addition, the cytoplasmic green fluorescence intensity in the heparin plus AZU group (52.7&#x000b1;4.75; n=4) was significantly decreased compared with that in the AZU group (157.4&#x000b1;4.36; n=4; P&#x0003c;0.01; <xref rid="f3-etm-08-05-1473" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>).</p><p>Western blotting was also employed to evaluate the concentration of AZU. Since the expression of AZU in the cytoplasm is low, western blotting was used to determine the degree of AZU endocytosis. The protein expression levels of AZU in the AZU group were significantly increased, while the levels in the heparin plus AZU group were significantly decreased compared with those in the AZU group (<xref rid="f2-etm-08-05-1473" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). These results demonstrated that the HUVECs were able to uptake and internalize AZU, with heparin exhibiting an antagonistic function in this process.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>AZU is a multifunctional, inactive serine-protease homolog (<xref rid="b15-etm-08-05-1473" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Since the protein has a strong heparin binding potential, AZU is also known as heparin-binding protein. A previous study demonstrated that AZU has a high basic amino acid content and contains consensus sequences (-X-B-B-X-B-X and -X-B-B-B-X-X-B-X) that are known as glycosaminoglycan recognition sites (<xref rid="b16-etm-08-05-1473" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). However, the mode of interaction between AZU and heparin remains unclear. The slightly different distribution of basic residues in AZU and the heterogeneity of heparin indicates that non-specific electrostatic forces form the main basis of the interactions (<xref rid="b16-etm-08-05-1473" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). In the present study, HUVECs were shown to uptake AZU analogously. The expression of AZU is low in HUVECs, but the results revealed that the content was significantly increased following the addition of exogenous AZU, as demonstrated by western blotting and immunofluorescence analysis. In addition, heparin was shown to reduce the content of exogenous AZU in the cytoplasm.</p><p>Glycocalyx, considered to be an analog of heparin, is negatively charged with a mesh-like structure (<xref rid="b17-etm-08-05-1473" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). AZU is hypothesized to bind to the glycoprotein, which allows for the uptake by endothelial cells. Subsequently, AZU causes the rearrangement of the endothelial cell cytoskeleton via the Rho-Rho-kinase pathway and increases the vascular permeability. In addition, AZU promotes the migration of neutrophils across the vascular wall, functioning as an inflammatory mediator (<xref rid="b8-etm-08-05-1473" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b18-etm-08-05-1473" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="b19-etm-08-05-1473" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Glycocalyx plays a role as the binding site for AZU on the surface of endothelial cells (<xref rid="b20-etm-08-05-1473" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). In the present study, heparin was considered to be an antagonist of glycocalyx by binding to AZU. AZU was shown to inhibit the function of mitochondrial oxygen metabolism, while heparin effectively reduced the uptake of AZU by endothelial cells. Heparin and glycocalyx were hypothesized to exhibit a competitive inhibition function against AZU binding to endothelial cells, since heparin and glycocalyx have a similar structure and charge characteristics.</p><p>Mitochondria are the respiratory and energetic centers of cells. Sepsis is considered as cytopathic hypoxia (<xref rid="b21-etm-08-05-1473" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), and different experimental models support an underlying role of cytopathic hypoxia in mitochondrial dysfunction. Mitochondrial complex IV (cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidase) is responsible for the final oxygen reduction into water. The mitochondrial membrane potential (&#x00394;&#x003a8;) is also considered as the function of mitochondrial oxygen metabolism. The results of the present study indicated that AZU reduced the expression of Cox II, which is a subunit of Cox that is mitochondrial encoded only. AZU was also shown to reduce the &#x00394;&#x003a8; and destroy the morphology of the mitochondria. Thus, AZU was hypothesized to destroy mitochondrial function and morphology, and inhibit the oxygen metabolic function of mitochondria by reducing the synthesis of key enzymes involved in mitochondrial oxygen metabolism.</p><p>The import of proteins into the mitochondria is controlled by several membrane-associated translocation complexes, including the translocase of the outer membrane (TOM)complex, the translocase of the inner membrane (TIM) complex, the sorting and assembly machinery complex for the insertion of &#x003b2;-barrel proteins into the outer membrane and the presequence translocase-associated motor complex that drives preprotein translocation into the matrix. These mitochondrial protein translocases, as well as specific cytosolic chaperones, recognize targeting information in proteins requiring importation, such as the N-terminal presequence and molecular charge, and assist with unfolding, membrane insertion or translocation and refolding/assembly in the mitochondria (<xref rid="b22-etm-08-05-1473" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). In the present study, AZU was shown to inhibit the expression of Cox II, which exists only in the matrix of mitochondria. Cox II has a positive molecular charge and a &#x003b2;-barrel structure; thus, AZU has the structure foundation for translocation into the mitochondria via the TOM/TIM pathway, after which AZU was shown to affect protein function in the mitochondrial matrix. However, further experiments are required to confirm this hypothesis.</p><p>In conclusion, the present study has demonstrated that AZU inhibits the oxygen metabolic function in mitochondria. This function was effectively antagonized by heparin via the inhibition of AZU endocytosis by HUVECs. Therefore, heparin may be a potential therapeutic agent for treating sepsis-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in the future.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref
