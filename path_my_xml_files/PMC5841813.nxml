Twenty-one participants aged 20&#x02013;26 years (22.2 &#x000b1; 1.76) performed a PVT in four experimental conditions: one in which their own full name was pronounced every 20 s in the stimuli epochs, one in which their full name was pronounced in inverted form, one in which beeps were played, and a control condition with no stimuli. Listening to personal names reduced attentional lapses during the PVT (i.e., the number of reaction times no less than 500 ms). The results are a first step in applying the name effect to technologies and devices aimed at maintaining arousal levels and preventing accidents during a monotonous task, such as driving.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>JSPS KAKENHI</institution></funding-source><award-id>16K13511.</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8975-4794</contrib-id><name><surname>Kaida</surname><given-names>Kosuke</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by a grant from JSPS KAKENHI, Grant Number 16K13511 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jsps.go.jp/english/">http://www.jsps.go.jp/english/</ext-link>) to KK.

A variety of countermeasures have been tested to reduce sleepiness and prevent accidents; these have included listening to music [<xref rid="pone.0194065.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], chewing gum [<xref rid="pone.0194065.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], and exposure to cool air [<xref rid="pone.0194065.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]and light [<xref rid="pone.0194065.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0194065.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Most researchers agree that there are only a few practical ways to reduce sleepiness, such as taking a nap [<xref rid="pone.0194065.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0194065.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and ingesting caffeine [<xref rid="pone.0194065.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0194065.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. While naps and caffeine are effective in reducing sleepiness and improving cognitive performance, drivers often report that conversation can also help them resist dropping off at the wheel [<xref rid="pone.0194065.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0194065.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Previous studies have indeed reported that conversation can be effective in reducing sleepiness [<xref rid="pone.0194065.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0194065.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>In the present study, we focused on the arousal factor of self-relevant information during a conversation. Self-relevant information, such as the names of family members, close friends, and oneself, as well as sounds involving personal concerns, has been known to be a strong attractor of human attention [<xref rid="pone.0194065.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In nature, humans automatically focus their attention on self-relevant information to maximize benefits and prevent loss of opportunities, a phenomenon captured in the so-called cocktail party effect [<xref rid="pone.0194065.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0194065.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. A person&#x02019;s own name particularly draws automatic attention, probably because it is the first lexical item that humans learn [<xref rid="pone.0194065.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. This is likely an effect of classical conditioning, in which humans learn their own names because they always occur during events related to the self. As a result of experiencing countless references to one&#x02019;s name in self-relevant events throughout life, one&#x02019;s own name comes to have a special value as a conditioned stimulus. Such a spontaneous relationship should also automatically induce a conditioned response, such as an increase in arousal level.</p><p>The occurrence of one&#x02019;s name has indeed been shown to increase arousal level, as measured by event-related potential (ERP; [<xref rid="pone.0194065.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0194065.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]). This suggests that paying attention to a salient stimulus automatically should increase arousal. Because arousal is known to activate broad areas of the brain [<xref rid="pone.0194065.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0194065.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], vigilant attention should also improve when the occurrence of a person&#x02019;s own name (i.e., self-relevant information) increases arousal. Thus, an increase in arousal triggered by one&#x02019;s own name could be a fundamental contributor to improved performance on a vigilance task.</p><p>We used the psychomotor vigilance test (PVT) to measure performance. In the PVT, reaction times and lapses are known to be sensitive indices of sleep deprivation [<xref rid="pone.0194065.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Moreover, performance in the PVT is well correlated with subjective sleepiness and alpha (8.0&#x02013;12.0 Hz) and theta (4.0&#x02013;7.9 Hz) band spectral power density of the electroencephalogram (EEG) [<xref rid="pone.0194065.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Estimating the arousal level using EEG has advantages such as the real-time estimation of subjective sleepiness during task performance, which cannot be assessed using verbal responses because verbal rating affects sleepiness [<xref rid="pone.0194065.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>The goal of the present study was to examine the effect of self-relevant auditory information (i.e., one&#x02019;s own name) on arousal level and performance. We hypothesized that hearing one&#x02019;s own name would increase arousal compared to listening to stimuli that are irrelevant to the self. These self-relevant stimuli should contribute to maintaining performance in a monotonous task, such as a psychomotor vigilance test [<xref rid="pone.0194065.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], in which performance is usually impaired when participants are bored.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Participants and design</title><p>Participants were 21 healthy, native Japanese speakers aged 20&#x02013;26 years (22.2 &#x000b1; 1.76, 6 female).

During the first 0&#x02013;5 min of the PVT session, a no stimuli epoch, participants carried out the task in silence. In the next 5&#x02013;10 min, a stimuli epoch, participants were exposed to an auditory stimulus every 20 s or remained in a silent condition. The following 10&#x02013;15 min was another no stimuli epoch, and the final 15&#x02013;20 min was a stimuli epoch of the same type as the first stimuli epoch. Participants carried out four test sessions to complete all the experimental conditions, which took them around 80 minutes in total. Participants were allowed to take a short break after each 20 min session if needed.</p><p>Participants took part in all of the following four experimental conditions (within-subject experimental design), with the order of conditions counterbalanced among participants: (1) a name condition (NAME), (2) an inverted name condition (Inv-NAME), (3) a beep condition (BEEP), and (4) a no stimuli control condition (Cont). In the NAME condition, the participant&#x02019;s own full name was played every 20 s in the stimuli epochs. In the Inv-NAME condition, participants heard the sounds of their full name played in inverted form every 20 s in the stimuli epochs. In the Japanese language, it is always possible to invert and pronounce the syllables of a name, because any word in the language can be decomposed into a sequence of vowels alone or combinations of consonant(s) and vowel(s), which can then be inverted and read aloud. For example, the sequence of consonants and vowels in the name <italic>Akira Kurosawa</italic> (A-KI-RA-KU-RO-SA-WA) can be inverted and read as Wasaroku Rakia (WA-SA-RO-KU-RA-KI-A). To a native Japanese speaker, the inverted name sounds very different from the original name and thus is not associated with the self. Thus, the inverted presentation of personal names as stimuli in the Inv-NAME condition maintained the identical combination of vowels and consonants as that in the NAME condition, but in a different order. Using this inversion technique, we were able to create an Inv-NAME stimulus for each participant that was unique but consistently designed in terms of self-relevance. In the BEEP condition, a 1000 Hz pure tone was used as the stimuli. In the Cont condition, no stimuli were presented during the 20-min task. The stimuli in both NAME and Inv-NAME conditions were created using artificial text reading software (Textalk, ver. 1.0.0.1, Wity Co., Ltd., Japan) with a female voice tone. Each stimulus lasted around 2 s (depending on the length of the full name).

Hearing one&#x02019;s own name affected performance and arousal level during a vigilance task by reducing attentional lapses and alpha power density in the EEG. While effects of personal names on arousal (i.e., the &#x0201c;name effect&#x0201d;; [<xref rid="pone.0194065.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] have been previously reported [<xref rid="pone.0194065.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0194065.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], to the best of our knowledge, the present study provides the first evidence of such effects on attentional lapses.</p><p>The present results indicate that the auditory presentation of a personal name has a special impact on attentional lapses in a monotonous task. This finding regarding the name effect on attentional lapses is straightforward but is potentially meaningful for future applications. For example, a sleepiness detection device would be more effective in alerting (i.e., giving feedback) and in keeping drivers awake by calling their own names upon detecting their drowsiness, compared to merely emitting a beeping sound. Although the effect may last only for a short period, it might be sufficient for drivers to safely reach a rest area to take a break for caffeine or to take a nap for attentional recovery.</p><p>Previous studies have reported that greater amounts of self-relevant information elicit larger event-related potentials (ERP), such as P3, both during awake periods [<xref rid="pone.0194065.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0194065.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and sleep periods [<xref rid="pone.0194065.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. It is also known that EEG alpha density is well correlated with subjective sleepiness [<xref rid="pone.0194065.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0194065.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] and attentional lapses in PVT [<xref rid="pone.0194065.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. One advantage of using EEG alpha density is that it is easier to measure and calculate than ERP. The utility of EEG alpha in relation to attentional lapses was confirmed here.</p><p>Given the present results, we believe that a personal name is a good stimulant to maintain arousal and prevent attentional lapses during a monotonous task. However, the name effect was not detected in subjective sleepiness. There are two possible reasons for this. First, the name effect may have been too marginal to remain after the task was finished. The participants evaluated not their sleepiness during the task but their <italic>current</italic> sleepiness, that is, after the stimuli epoch. This procedure may have produced a null effect for subjective sleepiness while confirming the effect on task performance. Second, the accuracy of self-evaluations of sleepiness may have been inadequate. It is known that behavioral, physiological, and subjective indices of sleepiness are sometimes disassociated from each other, especially under stimulus conditions [<xref rid="pone.0194065.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0194065.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Because subjective sleepiness data can be sensitively affected by the rating environment, it should be collected in carefully designed experimental conditions.</p><p>The functional mechanism of the name effect is not yet fully understood. The name effect could be caused by stimulating the neuromodulatory brain systems that produce general excitability of cortical neurons. Stimulation of these systems modulates vigilant attention and constitutes a precondition to respond to stimuli [<xref rid="pone.0194065.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0194065.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0194065.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. This precondition should increase arousal and decrease mind wandering that often occurs when we carry out a monotonous and boring task.</p><p>Mind wandering is known to be a cause of attentional lapses [<xref rid="pone.0194065.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. It has been reported that listening to self-related information concerning worry and anxiety induces mind wandering because it plays the role of priming thoughts about negative issues [<xref rid="pone.0194065.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Therefore, such self-related stimuli might increase attentional lapses instead of reducing them. To avoid the mind wandering aspect of self-relevance, more neutral stimuli such as a person&#x02019;s name, the inverted name, and a pure tone, which are not related to worry and anxiety and was not expected to induce mind wandering were used in this study. As a result, it was expected that any observed attentional lapses would be unrelated to the potential influence of negative valance and demonstrate the self-relevancy effect.</p><p>Lapses are not only caused by attentional dysfunctions, but also by behavioral &#x0201c;microsleep&#x0201d;, which is a short period of disengagement from a task lasting approximately 3 s [<xref rid="pone.0194065.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] that can occur even in non-sleep-deprived individuals [<xref rid="pone.0194065.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Hearing one&#x02019;s name might reduce microsleep. Moreover, the reduction of microsleep could be reflected in a reduction of lapses in the PVT. The causal mechanism of the name effect remains an interesting topic for future studies.</p><p>Further investigations of name effect, or self-relevant effects, in other sensory modalities, such as smell, touch, taste, and sight, are also warranted. Effects of the sense of sight have been reported, with visually presented personal names eliciting larger ERPs than no self-relevant stimuli [<xref rid="pone.0194065.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. As far as we know, similar effects for smell, touch, and taste have not been reported. Presentation in multi-dimensional modalities may produce stronger and more preferable effects on arousal and attentional lapses.</p><p>In the present study, we confirmed that both vigilance task performance and subjective self-relevance were significantly greater in the NAME condition compared to the other three conditions. However, for the vigilance task, we did not find any significant differences between the Inv-NAME condition and the other two less self-relevant conditions of BEEP and Cont, although subjective self-relevance was significantly higher in the Inv-NAME condition than in the latter two. Thus, we could not clarify the strength of the relevance effect according to the degree of self-relevance. We assumed that the objective (i.e., measured by task performance) name effect would reflect the degree of self-relevance of the stimuli as recognized by individuals. Clarifying this point remains for future investigation.</p><p>In conclusion, the present study demonstrated the effectiveness of using personal names as self-relevant information on increasing arousal levels and preventing attentional lapses during a monotonous task. The findings provide a first step in applying the name effect to technologies and devices intended to maintain arousal and prevent accidents during monotonous tasks such as driving.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We want to thank Chisa Emura, Ken Kihara, Sunao Iwaki and Naoko Kaida for useful comments on the manuscript.
