We trained community health workers (CHWs) as home visitors to address maternal/infant risks.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In a cluster randomised controlled trial in Cape Town townships, neighbourhoods were randomised within matched pairs to 1) the control, healthcare at clinics (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;12 neighbourhoods; n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;594 women), or 2) a home visiting intervention by CBW trained in cognitive-behavioural strategies to address health risks (by the Philani Maternal, Child Health and Nutrition Programme), in addition to clinic care (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;12 neighbourhoods; n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;644 women). Participants were assessed during pregnancy (2% refusal) and 92% were reassessed at two weeks post-birth, 88% at six months and 84% at 18 months later. We analysed 32 measures of maternal/infant well-being over the 18 month follow-up period using longitudinal random effects regressions. A binomial test for correlated outcomes evaluated overall effectiveness over time. The 18 month post-birth assessment outcomes also were examined alone and as a function of the number of home visits received.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Benefits were found on 7 of 32 measures of outcomes, resulting in significant overall benefits for the intervention compared to the control when using the binomial test (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.008); nevertheless, no effects were observed when only the 18 month outcomes were analyzed. Benefits on individual outcomes were related to the number of home visits received. Among women living with HIV, intervention mothers were more likely to implement the PMTCT regimens, use condoms during all sexual episodes (OR&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1.25; p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.014), have infants with healthy weight-for-age measurements (OR&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1.42; p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.045), height-for-age measurements (OR&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1.13, p&#x0003c;0.001), breastfeed exclusively for six months (OR&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;3.59; p&#x0003c;0.001), and breastfeed longer (OR&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;3.08; p&#x0003c;0.001). Number of visits was positively associated with infant birth weight &#x02265;2500 grams (OR&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1.07; p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.012), healthy head-circumference-for-age measurements at 6 months (OR&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1.09, p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.017), and improved cognitive development at 18 months (OR&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1.02, p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.048).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Home visits to neighbourhood mothers by CHWs may be a feasible strategy for enhancing maternal/child outcomes.

When community health workers (CHWs) visit at-risk mothers in the US <xref rid="pone.0105934-Olds3" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, the outcomes appear to be less robust, compared to nurses. Low and middle-income countries (LMIC) such as South Africa, however, cannot afford nurses, and will not be able to train the personnel necessary to mount such support until at least 2050 <xref rid="pone.0105934-Singh1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0105934-World1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. CHWs have been employed to bridge this gap in LMIC; however, their efforts are almost always focused on improving a single outcome. For example, there have been several perinatal intervention trials aimed at reducing maternal depression; yet the challenges are far broader than mothers' depression <xref rid="pone.0105934-Tomlinson1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0105934-Kirkwood1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.</p><p>The effects of poverty on children are pervasive and long-lasting <xref rid="pone.0105934-GranthamMcGreggor1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Mothers in LMIC frequently lack the resources necessary for maintaining consistent and high quality nutrition, shelter, and health care; the relationships to buffer the stresses of childbearing and rearing; and the ability to create opportunities for their children to optimize their health and well-being. Given the range of challenges, especially in countries affected by epidemics of HIV, alcohol abuse, and malnutrition, CHW who aim to improve health outcomes must be trained as generalists who can support mothers to address multiple health challenges <xref rid="pone.0105934-Tomlinson2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. This study evaluates the effectiveness of CHW trained as generalists to improve maternal and child outcomes over the first 18 months of life.</p><p>We implemented a cluster randomised controlled trial in Cape Town townships to examine maternal and child outcomes when trained CHWs implement home visits to all women in a neighbourhood.

Evaluations of the home visits' impact over the first six months of life have found benefits in multiple areas <xref rid="pone.0105934-leRoux1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.

UCLA randomised 26 neighbourhoods within matched pairs to either the intervention or the control arm using simple randomisation. One matched pair was eliminated after six months of recruitment due to low numbers of pregnant women (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;13 combining both neighbourhoods, compared to n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;38&#x02013;44 on average), leaving 24 study neighbourhoods <xref rid="pone.0105934-RotheramBorus2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0105934-leRoux1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Because we were training CHW as generalists, we identified an analytic strategy that included multiple indices as the primary outcome, considering the base rate of each composite measure in each measure. Sample size calculations were conducted to determine the minimum number of pregnant women that would need to be recruited per clinic to achieve 80% power to detect a standardized effect size of 0.40 between women from the 12 intervention and 12 control neighborhoods on one overall summary measure, considering the anticipated base rate on each measure included in the index.</p><p>Pregnant women were identified by recruiters conducting house-to-house visits every other month to all households in one intervention and one control neighbourhood. Potential participants were pregnant women at least 18 years old living in the neighbourhood from May 2009 to September 2010. Recruiters obtained consent-to-contact and then scheduled transport to a research site for interviewers to obtain informed consent and a baseline assessment. Transportation was also provided for the post birth interviews at 2 weeks post-birth, 6 months and 18 months. Pregnant women were recruited at an average 26 weeks of pregnancy (range, 3&#x02013;40 weeks). Only 2% of pregnant women refused participation.</p><p>

All assessments were completed by 83% of mothers; 7% completed no follow-up reassessments; and 10% completed one or two reassessments. Although 84% of mothers completed the 18-month assessment, fewer infants were reassessed at 18 months, as mothers did not consistently bring their children to assessment interviews.</p><fig id="pone-0105934-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0105934.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Movement of participants through the trial at each assessment point for mothers in the control and the intervention arms.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0105934.g001"/></fig><p>As described in an earlier publication <xref rid="pone.0105934-leRoux1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, the neighbourhoods and pregnant women were highly similar across conditions.

<underline>HIV-related prevention</underline> included maternal HIV status (both self-reported and indicated on the infant Road to Health card) and disclosure of serostatus to partners; asking partners to test for HIV; and consistent condom use (on 10 of the last 10 sexual encounters). Among women living with HIV (WLH), managing one's health and stopping transmission to others requires knowing one's CD4 cell count (or not), adherence to antiretroviral medications (ARV) over the last week, and complete regimens to Prevent Mother-to-Child Transmission (PMTCT). To PMTCT, mothers must adhere to ARV starting from week 28 of pregnancy; take ARV during labour; provide ARV to infants post-birth; test infants for HIV and retrieve results at 6 weeks post-birth; use one feeding method (either breastfeeding or formula) for the first 6 months; and exclusively breastfeed.</p><p>
<underline>Child health status</underline> was assessed by LBW (&#x0003c;2500 grams) and by converting infant anthropometric data (collected from birth records and growth monitoring) to z-scores based on the World Health Organisation's (WHO) age-adjusted norms. A z-score below -2 standard deviations was considered a serious health deficit <xref rid="pone.0105934-Cogill1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.

CHWs were women with 10<sup>th</sup>&#x02013;12<sup>th</sup> grade education around 40 years old (range 34&#x02013;59) who were trained for one month in cognitive-behavioural change strategies and roleplaying. They also watched videotapes of common situations that CHWs might face. CHWs were women selected to have good social and problem solving skills, having raised healthy children through their own coping skills, and were trained to provide and apply health information about general maternal and child health, HIV, alcohol use, and nutrition to township women. CHWs were certified and supervised biweekly with random observations of home visits.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Procedures</title><p>CBW from Philani implemented the intervention. Eight health messages were delivered regarding a healthy pregnancy, HIV/TB testing and PMTCT, reducing alcohol use and malnutrition, and encouraging breastfeeding, with the aim to deliver these messages in at least four antenatal visits and four post-natal visits within the first two months of life <xref rid="pone.0105934-RotheramBorus2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. The intervention dose delivered (i.e., the number of home visits, the visit duration, and content) by CHWs was monitored by CHWs' entries on mobile phones that included a time stamp and summary visit reports. On average, CHWs made six antenatal visits (SD&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;3.8), five postnatal visits between birth and two months post-birth (SD&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1.9), and afterwards about 1.4 visits/month (range: 0.1&#x02013;6.4 visits/month). Sessions lasted on average 31 minutes each.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Analyses</title><p>We first looked for significant differences in baseline demographics between conditions at baseline and among those re-assessed (or not) at post-birth, six and 18 months. To control for multiple comparisons and measure the intervention's overall effect on well-being, our primary analysis of the intervention's impact was conducted using one overall test which compared 32 different outcomes simultaneously. On many of the outcomes, almost all mothers would have accomplished the task, without an intervention (e.g., immunize their children). The potential benefits of an intervention are relatively small for such outcomes. Comparing 32 outcomes, chance would lead one to observe up to three significantly different outcomes between the control and the intervention conditions. The binomial test evaluates the number of significant differences between the control and intervention conditions to determine if there is a significant overall difference between conditions. Thus, a binomial test evaluated the number of significant effects favouring the intervention among 32 correlated binary outcomes tested at a one-sided, upper-tail alpha&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.025 (performed in R, version 2.11.1; please see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0105934.s001">Appendix S1</xref> for analysis details).</p><p>Exploratory analyses compared individual measures between intervention and control at a two-sided alpha&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.05 using logistic random effects regression models adjusting for neighbourhood clustering in SAS PROC GENMOD (version 9.2; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina, USA). As the binomial test was the primary analysis, we considered our analyses of individual outcomes to be exploratory and retained the model p-values in lieu of further multiple-testing adjustments.</p><p>To examine if early intervention impact was sustained for the 12 outcomes that were created by combining data from multiple time points (ex: &#x0201c;Discussed HIV status with sexual partner at six and 18 months&#x0201d;), a second exploratory analysis compared these measures between intervention and control using 18-month data only, using the regressions described above.</p><p>An exploratory analysis examined the <underline>as-treated</underline> outcomes, investigating the association between each outcome and the number of CHW visits received (using the regressions described above). We included the number of visits between each assessment point <italic>as a covariate</italic> in order to systematically control for the number of home visits. Thus, post-birth outcomes were a function of the number of antenatal visits; six month outcomes were a function of postnatal visits between birth and the six month assessment; and 18-month outcomes were a function of the number of home visits between six and 18 months post-birth. By definition, women in the control arm had zero visits. Intervention mothers who received zero CHW visits were excluded from the <underline>as treated</underline> analysis (3%, n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;18).</p><p>Late-entry participants' data were included in all analyses. Based on their age at the late-entry assessment, data from infants of late-entry mothers were split between post-birth (0&#x02013;4 months old, n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;19) and 6-month (&#x0003e;4 months old, n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;75) outcomes. Overall, results were similar whether or not late-entry participants' data were included; results are available upon request.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Sample description</title><p>As previously reported <xref rid="pone.0105934-Tomlinson2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0105934-RotheramBorus2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> and summarised in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0105934-t001">Table 1</xref>, mothers in the two arms did not differ significantly at baseline on outcome-related measures, neighbourhood matching criteria, demographic characteristics, risk history, or general health.

The baseline measures of mothers who were successfully reassessed at each assessment, compared to those not interviewed at each assessment, were not significantly different with one exception: mothers reassessed at 18 months were about a year older at the baseline assessment than mothers not reassessed.

Perhaps the most important outcome is the reduction in the rate of LBW infants. Low birth weight carries lifelong consequences <xref rid="pone.0105934-Gross1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, especially in LMIC <xref rid="pone.0105934-Stein1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Prematurity and poor intrauterine growth are the primary reasons for having a LBW infant <xref rid="pone.0105934-Langer1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. The CBW from Philani are trained to encourage pregnant women's health in multiple ways that would result in fewer LBW infants: they know risk indices for prematurity and encourage pregnant women to go immediately to antenatal care when the risk factors emerge; they check that mothers are taking folic acid and iron pills routinely; they encouraged antenatal care; they provide psychosocial support; and they encourage all mothers to test for HIV/TB. An earlier publication <xref rid="pone.0105934-leRoux1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> documented that intervention mothers were significantly less likely to use alcohol during pregnancy; alcohol use is directly related to having LBW infants. Each of these behaviours by a CBW is likely to reduce the risks of having a LBW infant. These strategies are similar to those used in high income countries <xref rid="pone.0105934-Gross1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Rather than having CBW trained to deliver one specific health message, CBW trained as generalists who address a cluster of issues related to pregnancy promote an important benefit for infants, namely a normal birth weight.</p><p>Mothers also increased breastfeeding and HIV-related protective actions with adult partners. Infant outcomes in weight-for-age improved as well. The size of the effect was significant, but leaves substantial room for improvement. Similar to other RCT of breastfeeding interventions <xref rid="pone.0105934-Tylleskar1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, consistent breastfeeding for the first six months of life was only 10.3% in the intervention group; however, this represents a three-fold increase over the control arm. A randomized controlled trial encouraging exclusive breastfeeding in six African countries reported similar results <xref rid="pone.0105934-Tylleskar1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Although condom use was still too low for a clinical impact on HIV transmission, consistent condom use was 6% greater (OR&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1.25) with the intervention. Overall the intervention significantly improved maternal caretaking in multiple domains.</p><p>Each of the significant outcomes in our intention-to-treat analysis also was significant in the as-treated analysis. If the program were to be scaled up, the results likely would mirror the results in the intention-to-treat analyses. Notably, the number of home visits also was significantly related to children's cognitive development on the Bayley Scale at 18 months, having fewer LBW infants, higher birth weights overall, and larger head circumferences at six months. The finding of better cognitive development on the Bayley scales is particularly important, whereas benefits to measures of infant physical health were not sustained until 18 months. This RCT was designed to evaluate the intervention's impact over the first 18 months of life. Our primary analysis found significant benefits over the entire 18 month follow-up period. However, when the outcomes at only the 18 month assessment were examined, the benefits were not significantly different between the RCT's two arms, except in the as-treated analyses. To sustain efficacy, it may be necessary to continue home visits beyond the postpartum period.</p><p>Recruitment of pregnant women by canvassing household-to-household proved to be a limitation. Although the samples were highly similar across matched pairs of neighbourhoods, 16% (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;94) of mothers in the control arm were recruited late in pregnancy or in the first months following childbirth. With or without these women in the analyses, the result of the RCT is the same. However, external validity is higher when they are included; therefore, we added the late-entry women. Fortunately, 93% of women completed at least one follow-up assessment and 83% of the sample completed all assessments. In addition, there was one selection effect across the four assessments: mothers not reassessed at 18-months were a year older at recruitment. It is also possible that self-reports for behaviours may have resulted in socially desirable answers for some outcomes. We believe, however, that the significant effects are unlikely to be attributable to reporting bias. Growth measures, health visits, immunisations, and HIV-related health behaviours are recorded on the infants' Road to Health card, similar to the documentation of the child grant.</p><p>We expected that there would be ceiling effects on many outcomes, and indeed more than 90% of participants in both arms reported positive outcomes for 8 of the 32 measures. This reflects partly the good clinical services available in Cape Town, which would be unusual in most of Africa and even South Africa. At baseline, 91% of pregnant Cape Town women were tested for HIV and received their results; this contrasts to 61% in Eastern/Southern Africa typically <xref rid="pone.0105934-Suri1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Among the PMTCT measures for which there was room for improvement (i.e., fewer than 90% of mothers completed the task), our intervention was better than the control in 3 of 4 outcomes, and had twice the odds of completing all behaviours needed to PMTCT <xref rid="pone.0105934-leRoux1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.</p><p>Home visiting long has been demonstrated efficacious when mounted by professionals <xref rid="pone.0105934-Olds2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0105934-Sweet1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. However, the next phase of research must identify sustainable and scalable models utilizing CHWs. We did not closely collect cost data at each phase of the implementation. Philani has been operating since the 1990s. The salaries paid by Philani and the CHWs' experience (typically elementary education, no previous jobs) are similar to the South African government's guidelines for paraprofessional CHW <xref rid="pone.0105934-South1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>.</p><p>The mean of 11 CHW visits in this trial is substantially more intensive than most vertical, single-disease-targeted interventions. Regular visits were typically stopped by about 6 months post-birth, with check-ins only once every six months after that. This appears to be too small a dose for this intervention. The failure to find additional benefits from 6&#x02013;18 months post-birth, when only analysing the 18 month outcomes, suggests that to sustain significant benefits, home visiting must be sustained for several years. We anticipate that home visiting must be routine through the first five years of life, for the parenting challenges shift dramatically as the children age and families have received little preparation for readjusting their parenting behaviours, beliefs, and expectations.</p><p>This intervention features a number of innovations. Typically, home visiting interventions focus on training CHWs in manualised interventions (e.g., National Registry of Evidence-based Prevention Programs [NREPP]) that must be replicated with fidelity to a set of activities and scripts, and may not fit a specific situation <xref rid="pone.0105934-Flay1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. We selected CHWs who were positive peer deviants <xref rid="pone.0105934-Berggren1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, models of pragmatic problem solving, and had good social skills. We then trained the CHWs in basic cognitive-behavioural approaches, not solely a manualised delivery. CHWs delivered specific health messages, but focused on applying the information to the mothers' daily routines. CHWs had flexibility in the sequence and duration of delivery. Implementation was routinely monitored and supervised both in person and remotely, with mobile phones <xref rid="pone.0105934-Tomlinson3" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0105934-RotheramBorus3" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. These innovations are atypical in programs attempting to scale evidence-based interventions, but offer a model for how prevention scientists may utilise the existing evidence-based interventions (NREPP) in a novel fashion, by training foundational skills and focusing on applying the foundational skills to a limited number of topics <xref rid="pone.0105934-RotheramBorus1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.</p><p>In addition, home visits offer a viable strategy to circumvent challenges typically associated with obtaining healthcare from clinics. Clinic appointments are difficult to schedule; waiting lines are long; transport is expensive; and mothers must coordinate their own and infants' care across multiple clinics <xref rid="pone.0105934-Sprague1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. An approach grounded in cognitive-behavioural skills, with locale-tailored content addressing local health risks, may be a strategy to explore, especially in rural communities <xref rid="pone.0105934-RotheramBorus4" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>.</p><p>As the South African government begins to implement a model that targets multiple domains, we have demonstrated a strategy to implement and to evaluate such an intervention.
