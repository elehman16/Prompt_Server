exercise capacity and changes in coronary risk factors (CRFs) of patients with acute
myocardial infarction (AMI). [Subjects] Thirty male subjects with AMI were divided into an
experimental group (EG) and a control group (CG). Another 30 age-matched subjects with
patent coronary arteries served as a normal-control group (NCG). [Methods] Subjects in EG
(n=20) trained using a stationary bicycle for 30&#x02005;min at their target heart rate twice a
week for 8 weeks. Exercise capacity was defined as the maximal metabolic equivalents
(METs) that subjects reached during the symptom-limited maximal exercise test. HR, BP and
RPP were recorded. Subjects in EG and CG received exercise tests and screening for CRFs at
the beginning of, end of, and 3 months after Phase II CET, while subjects in NCG
participated only in the 1st test. [Results] METs of CG did not improve until the 3rd
test, while RPP at the 2nd test showed a significant increase. However, EG showed
increased METs at the 2nd test without increase of RPP, and increased their high density
lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) during the follow-up period between the 2nd and 3rd tests.
[Conclusion] Phase II CET shortens the recovery time of exercise capacity, helps to
maintain the gained exercise capacity and increases HDL-C in phase III.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Patent coronary artery</kwd><kwd>Exercise capacity</kwd><kwd>Phase II CET</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Following acute myocardial infarction (AMI), recovery of exercise capacity and control of
coronary risk factors (CRFs) are highly critical for prognosis post AMI<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Long-term follow-up research has shown that the improvement
of exercise capacity is negatively related to future cardiac events<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>, and that the improvement of CRFs is beneficial for
preventing the development of atherosclerosis.</p><p>Supervised, hospital-based Phase II cardiac exercise therapy (CET) allows patients to
exercise safely following personalized exercise prescriptions and monitoring of CRFs.
Home-based Phase III CET following hospital-based Phase II continues to prepare patients
with the ability and confidence to go back to the society as soon as possible. Furthermore,
CET prevents the recurrent infarction and improves quality of life<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Does supervised, hospital-based Phase II CET help patients to achieve levels of exercise
capacity equal to those of age-matched normal subjects with patent coronary arteries?
Research results are inconsistent about the long-term changes in CRFs. This study used
age-matched subjects with patent coronary arteries as a normal-control group (NCG). It was
designed to investigate the effects of Phase II and III CET on exercise capacity, and on the
long-term changes in CRFs of patients with AMI in comparison with age-matched normal
subjects.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects were patients with AMI who had been admitted to Tzu-Chi Medical Center, and
had undergone coronary angiography (CAG) for evaluation and treatment of coronary artery
lesions. Subjects in the experimental group (EG) were defined as those who were admitted to
hospital after AMI, who had participated in the Phase II hospital-based CET and continued to
do the Phase III home-based exercise program. Subjects in the control group (CG) were
defined as those who were admitted to hospital after AMI but did not participate in the
hospital-based Phase II CET because of inconvenience of travel or for personal reasons. Both
groups of subjects received education about exercise when they were discharged. After
discharge from hospital, EG patients participated in an 8-week CET program designed
specifically for each patient by the same experienced physical therapist. There was no
Coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) given to EG or CG, and no stroke during the period
when the study was conducted.</p><p>Another group, the normal control group (NCG), took part in this study. Subjects in NCG
were whose who had received CAG and had proven patent coronary arteries. The reason for CAG
was either suspicion of coronary artery lesions or pre-examination for possible congenital
heart disease. Subjects in NCG were age-matched with the subjects with AMI in EG and CG. The
criterion for age matching was an age within 3&#x02005;years of the target subject.</p><p>In order to carefully understand how the home-based exercise was performed, we used a
questionnaire to specifically ask subjects the mode, the frequency and duration of exercise.
Subjects who performed the exercise at least 3 times a week, 30 minutes a time and reached
their target heart rate were defined as regular exercise performers.</p><p>This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Tzu Chi Medical Center, and
written informed consent to participation in the study was obtained from each subject.</p><p>Data for duration of hospital stay, medication, cigarette smoking, hypertension (HTN),
diabetes mellitus (DM), body mass index (BMI), and fasting plasma serum levels of total
cholesterol (T-Chol), triglyceride (TG), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and
low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) were collected during hospitalization. Severity
of disease, such as numbers of stenotic vessels, with or without Q wave, and infarcted wall

the second (the 2nd test) and third examinations (the 3rd test). The 2nd and 3rd tests were
done at two and five months after discharge from hospital, respectively. Patient medication
was re-evaluated at the third examination. Coronary stenosis was defined as greater than 50%
according to CAG.</p><p>All three groups performed the symptom-limited maximal exercise test. Subjects&#x02019; blood was
collected to measure serum lipids, and anthropometric measurements were taken to calculate
BMI. The maximal exercise test was performed by both EG and CG at the beginning of Phase II
CET (the 1st test), at the end of Phase II CET (the 2nd test) and at 3 months after the end
of Phase II CET (the 3rd test). NCG only performed the maximal exercise test at the time of
the 1<sup>st</sup> test.</p><p>EG and CG patients performed an exercise test on a treadmill (Marquette MAX1, Milwaukee WI,
USA). The symptom-limited maximal exercise capacity, expressed in metabolic equivalent
(METs), was obtained at the end of the exercise test<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. The ECG was monitored continuously, with HR, BP and rate-pressure
product (RPP) measured every three minutes during the exercise test, and throughout the
five-minute recovery period. The Borg scale of rating of perceived exertion (RPE), which is
reported to be highly related to maximal oxygen consumption and metabolic demand, were
quantified at the same time.</p><p>All subjects followed the required medication advice before taking the maximal exercise
test. We requested the patients to abstain from food, coffee, and cigarettes for a minimum
of two hours before each test. They watched a real test to learn how the maximal exercise
test is conducted before they performed the test. Before the maximal exercise test started,
subjects were asked to lie supine for 3 minute so that we could collect measurements of
their resting state.</p><p>The Bruce protocol starts at an intensity of 4.6 METs, and increases by 2&#x02013;3 METs every 3
minutes, and it is considered unsuitable for patients with AMI<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, the Modified Naughton protocol was adopted as the 1st
test for its lower beginning intensity (3 METs) and smaller increment (1 MET every 3
minutes).</p><p>Criteria for terminating the 1st exercise test included ischemic signs and/or symptoms,
inability to continue the exercise due to fatigue, HR reaching 140 bpm for subjects under
40&#x02005;years old, or HR reaching 130 bpm for subjects over 40&#x02005;years old. For the 2nd and 3rd
exercise tests, criteria for terminating the exercise test included ventricular arrhythmia
(such as ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation), ST segment depression (&#x02265; 2&#x02005;mm) or
elevation (&#x02265; 1&#x02005;mm), target HR exceeded (90% of the predicted age-adjusted maximal HR), or BP
over 220 <sup>mm</sup>/<sub>Hg</sub> or lower than that determined at the beginning of the
test.</p><p>Venous blood samples were collected after a 12-hour fast and used for the determination of
lipids (serum T Chol, TG, HDL-C, and LDL-C). Serum T Chol was measured using the enzymatic
method and automatic multi-channel chemical analyzer (747 Automatic Analyzer, Hitachi,
Tokyo, Japan), with the AU500/550 T-Chol reagent Kit (Katayama, Osaka, Japan). Serum HDL-C
levels were determined using the precipitation method with phosphotungstic acid and
magnesium chloride<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Serum TG was measured
using the kinase reaction and an auto-analyzer<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Serum LDL-C was calculated using the values of T-Chol, TG and HDL-C
in the following formula:<disp-formula>LDL-C= T-Chol &#x02212; ((1/5TG)+ HDL-C)</disp-formula></p><p>Phase II CET began 19(9) (range 6&#x02013;39) days after AMI, and continued for eight weeks at a
frequency of two times per week. Phase II CET consisted of three stages. A warm-up was
performed of 10&#x02013;15 minutes of calisthenics (gentle stretching). The main exercise was
performed on a treadmill, at an exercise intensity individually prescribed on the basis of
baseline data, and the graded treadmill exercise test results. The exercise intensity was
gradually increased to a goal of 60 to 79% of the predicted age-adjusted maximum heart rate
(HR), and the exercise continued for 20 minutes at an intensity below that which would cause
symptomatic or silent ischemia. A cool-down, consisting of ten minutes of calisthenics was
also performed. During the period of CET, patient safety was always the primary
consideration. Subjects were often given real-time feedback of HR as exercise proceeded, and
learned to monitor their own HR. After Phase II CET finished, Phase III CET programs were
designed specifically for each individual, and data were collected for 3 months.</p><p>During Phase III CET, patients were asked to continue leisure-time physical activities
chosen by themselves, with an exercise formula prescribed according to the results of the
second of the exercise tests performed at the end of Phase II CET. Based on the over-riding
emphasis on safety, an exercise type familiar to each individual was chosen for Phase III
CET.</p><p>All EG patients were telephoned by the same investigator each month to provide relevant
information and personal support.</p><p>Subjects in CG performed the 1st and 2nd maximal exercise test and were given an exercise
prescription based on the results of the tests. Subjects were telephoned by the same
investigator each month to provide relevant information and personal support, and if needed,
to change the exercise intensity to ensure its effectiveness and safety.</p><p>Subjects in CG were advised to exercise regularly after discharge, and were followed for
the status of home-based exercise during Phase II and Phase III by questionnaire.</p><p>SPSS for Windows, release10.0, (SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL, USA) was used to statistically
analyze the data. One-way ANOVA was used to compare differences among the three groups.
Scheffe&#x02019;s test was used for post hoc comparisons. Two-way repeated measures ANOVA was used
to compare the differences in CRFs for group effect (two levels: EG vs. CG) and training
effect (three levels: 1st test, 2nd test and 3rd test) with repeated measures of the second
factor. Significant interaction effects were analyzed using univariate repeated measures and
mean comparisons with the LSD method. Statistical significance was accepted for values of
p&#x0003c; 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Sixty subjects completed the study, 20 AMI patients in EG (age: 55.3&#x000b1;10.6&#x02005;years), 10 AMI

CET not only increases the confidence of patients to proceed to Phase III, but also
increases compliance and safety during Phase III.</p><p>METs were the index chosen to represent exercise capacity in the present study. METs are
calculated from oxygen consumption during exercise and they are easy to convert to the
energy consumption for activities. The values of METs are related to genetics, fitness,
disease level, age, and gender, and it is one of the best indexes for measuring exercise
capacity and cardiovascular function<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.
METs and HR/SBP at the point of maximal exercise are highly correlated with left ventrical
perfusion and abnormal left ventrical function, which have been proven to be highly
important in predicting the prognosis after AMI<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. The hemodynamic parameter, RPP, the product of HR and SBP, can be
used to evaluate both dynamic and static exercise, and is not influenced by the use of
&#x003b2;blockers. It is agreed that HR and SBP are increased by the increase of exercise intensity;
however, the degree of increase can be reduced by proper exercise therapy<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>As shown in <xref rid="tbl_002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, the average maximal METs
for NCG was 9.4 (SD 2.1). Early intervention of Phase II CET increases maximal METs. Phase
II CET also stabilizes the autonomic nervous system and this is reflected in hemodynamic
parameters<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the present study,
both EG and CG showed similar conditions at the onset. In the 1st test, there was no
significant difference in maximal METs, medication or the successful rate of percutaneous
coronary intervention. However, between the 1st and the 2nd test, METs increased only in EG
and without any change in RPE or RPP. METs continued to increase up to the 3rd test. CG did
not show an improvement in METs until the 3rd test, while RPP increased in the 2nd test.
Without the intervention of Phase II CET, the hemodynamic parameters at the maximal METs in
CG were poorer than those of EG, especially SBP at the point of maximal exercise. This shows
that sustainable regular exercise is helpful for the improvement of METs, and for the same
reason, that Phase II CET successfully shortens the natural recovery time of exercise
capacity.</p><p>Oxygen consumption is the most direct measurement of exercise intensity. HR is linearly
related to oxygen consumption and is very easy to measure. Besides, HR is representative of
the physical load exacted on the heart<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.
In the present study, 60&#x02013;79% of maximal HR was used as the target HR intensity in Phase II
CET. Target HR is the training intensity needed to get the best training effect. Target HR
was determined based on the results of ECG, hemodynamic parameters, exercise capacity and
RPE obtained in the symptom-limited maximal exercise test. EG completed 8 weeks of
supervised, hospital-based CET. This helped to ensure the Phase III home exercise program
was feasible and safe. CET, based on exercise training, has changed the emphasis from
long-term prognosis to short-term effects. However, long-term prognosis is highly correlated
to lifelong regular exercise and control of CRFs<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. EG chose an exercise activity they were familiar with, and trained
at 60&#x02013;79% of their maximal HR in the Phase III home CET. One of the authors called all the
subjects every month to ask if they had any difficulty in continuing their exercise program.
Holmback et al. found that the benefits of a 12-week Phase II CET were not maintained after
6 months<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the present study,
subjects in EG continued to show improvements in their maximal METs until 3 months after the
end of Phase II CET. It would have been better to have performed a longer follow-up, but it
is difficult to control subjects in long-term clinical studies. The authors wish to further
investigate Phase III CET in the future, and hopefully as time proceeds, there will be more
subjects and longer periods of follow-up providing data which will allow a better
understanding of the mechanism behind the outcomes. We found that maximal METs in CG
increased during the Phase III CET and eventually reached the same level as the shown by NCG
in the 1st test.</p><p>Using an exercise that subjects are already familiar with can provide fitness and
wellbeing. It has been reported to be of physiological benefit<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. According to the questionnaire regarding exercise status,
67% of subjects in EG chose to do walking-related activities, such as walking (6 subjects),
and brisk walking/ jogging (6 subjects). All the subjects in CG chose to walk as their home
exercise program (walking: 7, brisk walk: 1, jogging: 1, and treadmill walking: 1). We found
that moderate intensity of home exercise, 3 times a week with a duration of at least 30
minutes, was safe, flexible and did not discourage the subjects so it would be well accepted
by most people. Previous research has shown that walking can prevent recurrence of heart
attack and has been used as a secondary prevention method for patients with AMI<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>There were no reinfarction or cardiac events in either EG or CG during Phases II and III
CET, and maximal METs were improved and maintained,</p><p>The effects of exercise therapy on total cholesterol (T-Cho) and low density lipoprotein
(LDL-C) are controversial<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>, but it is
agreed that exercise is mostly beneficial for controlling triglyceride no matter how long
the training period is. Possible mechanisms for this include lowering the synthesis of very
low density lipoprotein (VLDL), speeding up catabolism, and greater metabolism of free fatty
acids to provide energy source for skeletal muscles<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. We note that neither EG nor CG had high triglyceride to begin
with, and this is likely why there was not much exercise effect on triglyceride. Possible
reasons why sustainable walking training increased high density lipoprotein cholesterol
(HDL-C) by 20&#x02013;30% are overactive lipoprotein lipase and lecithin-cholesterol-acyltransferase
induce greater catabolism of VLDL, and lower the activity of hepatic lipase. In the present
study, there was no significant change in HDL-C although it did increase in EG.</p><p>In Taiwan, the impact of CRFs on CAD is similar to that reported for the United States and
Japan<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. Especially, HDL-C has been
shown to be highly correlated with CAD<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>.
HDL-C is influenced by gender, age, medication, smoking, obesity, and the parameters of the
exercise prescription<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. We found that
HDL-C changed only in EG.</p><p>Smoking changes the function of platelets and may cause embolism. Nicotine increases
epinephrine and norepinephrine in the circulation speeding up the development of
atherosclerosis. Compared to non-smokers, smokers have 5.7% lower HDL-C and quitting smoking
can make HDL-C more normal<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. Aerobic
exercise increases HDL-C. Our results show that the cessation of smoking rate increased at
the 2nd test, and continued to increase at the 3rd test. However, a significant increase in
HDL-C was only seen in the 3rd test. This shows that quitting smoking alone is not enough to
explain the increase in HDL-C. HDL-C is inversely related to BMI<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. Our results show that the maximal METs increased in EG
during the Phase II CET, but BMI did not change. This could explain why HDL-C did not
increase during the Phase II CET.</p><p>In addition to smoking and BMI, the intensity, duration, and frequency of exercise during
CET also affect HDL-C<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. Mendoza et al. showed that 3&#x02013;12 months of exercise are
needed to elicit an increase in HDL-C<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Berg et al. Showed that at least 3 months is required to improve HDL-C. Therefore, the
reason that HDL-C did not improve during the Phase II CET might be because exercise, 2 times
a week for a total of 8 weeks is insufficient. In contrast, exercise, 2 times a week
elicited a difference in exercise capacity in the present study. After Phase II and Phase
III CET, HDL-C showed an increase at the end of Phase III CET. Possible reasons for this
could be that exercise capacity continued to improve and the cessation of smoking rate was
maintained, with no change in BMI. It is also possible that the combination of Phase II and
III CET was beneficial for maintaining cessation of smoking and BMI, creating an environment
in which an increase of HDL-C could occur. HDL-C in CG did not change with improvement of
exercise capacity, despite the fact that BMI was maintained and there was a stop in the
smoking cessation rate. The small sample size could be another reason why no change in HDL-C
was observed. The authors hope to enroll more subjects in the future to better investigate
the temporal change of HDL-C during Phase III CET.</p><p>One limitation of our research was the relatively large number of days before exercise was
initiated after myocardial infarction. We recognize that this makes the interpretation of
the training effect more difficult. However, considering the substantial area and rugged
travel conditions of Hualien County and the difficulty of making transportation arrangements
for some patients, this was perhaps the best result achievable. It is our hope that this
limitation is offset by the fact that this research presents a contribution to clinical
medicine from an under-represented corner of Taiwan and of the world.</p><p>This study pioneered the enrolment of subjects with patent coronary arteries as a normal
control group, and we believe it will provide valuable insights for clinical medicine.</p><p>In conclusion, a supervised, hospital-based Phase II CET performed twice a week for 8 weeks
shortened the recovery time of exercise capacity in patients with AMI. Successful and
regular exercise during Phase III home-based CET maintained the exercise capacity gains of
Phase II, improved HDL-C, and also continued to increase exercise capacity in the control
group.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Hamm</surname><given-names>LF</given-names></name><name><surname>Stull</surname><given-names>GA</given-names></name><name><surname>Ainsworth</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Short- and long-term prognostic value of graded exercise
