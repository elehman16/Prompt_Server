Because subtle differences may exist among protein products manufactured in living cells that can result in different immune responses and clinical effects in patients, evaluating safety and efficacy of LY IGlar compared with IGlar included two phase III, prospective, global, parallel, randomized, clinical trials in patients with type 1 (T1DM) or type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). ELEMENT&#x02010;1 was an open&#x02010;label study in patients with T1DM that included a 24&#x02010;week treatment period for the primary efficacy outcome, and then a 28&#x02010;week extension period designed to generate primary data for evaluating immunogenicity after 52&#x02009;weeks of therapy in patients with T1DM <xref rid="dom12584-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref>.

The trials were registered at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link>: NCT01421147 and NCT01421459.</p><p id="dom12584-para-0009">Samples for antibody determination were collected before randomization (baseline) and prespecified visits during treatment. Insulin antibody testing was conducted by Millipore (St. Charles, MO, USA). LY IGlar antibodies were quantified as percent binding using a radioimmunoassay where percent binding is the percent of the total amount of radiolabelled tracer (LY IGlar) that coprecipitates with the antibodies. Specificity was determined using excess unlabelled LY IGlar. Cross&#x02010;reactivity to human insulin was determined using excess unlabelled insulin. Because of shared epitopes between LY IGlar, IGlar, human insulin and insulin analogues, this anti&#x02010;LY IGlar antibody assay also detects antibodies to IGlar, insulin and other insulin analogues. Non&#x02010;specific binding ranged from 0 to 0.26% bound/total (or percent binding) using a population of healthy volunteers. The assay's sensitivity was 25&#x02009;ng/ml using polyclonal affinity&#x02010;purified anti&#x02010;insulin antibody, satisfying the FDA's recommendation that screening assays be sensitive enough to detect clinically relevant antibody concentrations of 250&#x02013;500&#x02009;ng/ml <xref rid="dom12584-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref>. A concentration of 250&#x02009;ng/ml equated to &#x0223c;5% binding in the anti&#x02010;LY IGlar antibody assay; therefore, this assay is capable of detecting anti&#x02010;LY IGlar and anti&#x02010;IGlar antibody levels well below clinically relevant levels.</p><p id="dom12584-para-0010">The proportion of patients with detectable antibodies over time was determined as well as antibody levels as measured by percent binding over time. Analyses of insulin antibody levels (percent binding) included any patient in the full analysis set (FAS), defined as all randomized patients who took &#x02265; one dose of study medication, with valid antibody testing at baseline and &#x02265; one postbaseline visit. Further analyses of cross&#x02010;reactive insulin antibodies (i.e. anti&#x02010;IGlar and anti&#x02010;insulin) were conducted to confirm that the immune response to LY IGlar and IGlar were similar with respect to antibodies formed against human insulin. The threshold for the cross&#x02010;reactive insulin antibody assay was a 1.06% binding value.</p><p id="dom12584-para-0011">TEAR is a measure of incidence that converts percent binding, a continuous measure, to a dichotomous measure of antibody response at any given timepoint relative to baseline antibody status (non&#x02010;detected/detected) and percent binding level. In these studies, TEAR was defined as: (i) for patients who were positive for detectable antibodies at baseline, an absolute increase of at least 1% in percent insulin antibody binding and at least a 30% relative increase in insulin antibody binding from baseline; and (ii) for patients who were negative for insulin antibodies at baseline, a change to a detected insulin antibody binding level of at least 1.26% postbaseline (i.e. 1.26%&#x02009;=&#x02009;1%&#x02009;+&#x02009;the assay threshold of 0.26%).</p><p id="dom12584-para-0012">The definition noted above of an absolute increase of &#x02265;1% ensures that an absolute meaningful increase must occur near the assay threshold, whereas a &#x02265;30% relative increase from baseline ensures that relative increases at the higher ends of the range are meaningful. Additionally, a 30% relative increase assures identification of a potentially relevant treatment&#x02010;emergent change. For patients with non&#x02010;detectable antibodies at baseline (i.e. &#x0003c;0.26%), an absolute increase of 1% in insulin antibody level equates to an approximately fourfold increase from baseline, which is a scientifically reasonable margin to account for assay variability <xref rid="dom12584-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">10</xref>.</p><p id="dom12584-para-0013">The proportion of patients with detectable antibodies and the proportion of patients with TEAR were compared between treatment groups using Fisher's exact test. Insulin antibody levels were compared between treatments using the Wilcoxon rank sum test.</p><p id="dom12584-para-0014">The potential impact of antibody formation on clinical response was analysed as follows. Relationships between insulin antibody levels and selected efficacy and safety measures [e.g. glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c, %), basal insulin dose (U/kg/day) and total hypoglycaemia rate (events/patients/30&#x02009;days; blood glucose &#x02264;3.9&#x02009;mmol/l or &#x02264;70&#x02009;mg/dl)] were evaluated using scatterplots and analysed using analysis of covariance for the FAS at endpoint [last&#x02010;observation&#x02010;carried&#x02010;forward (LOCF)] and by partial correlations [after adjustment for baseline HbA1c, country, time of basal insulin injection (AM, PM), and sulphonylurea use (ELEMENT&#x02010;2 only)]. A significant treatment&#x02010;by&#x02010;insulin antibody interaction (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) indicates a potential differential treatment effect. Relationships between TEAR and selected efficacy and safety measures (e.g. HbA1c, total hypoglycaemia rate, insulin dose and immune&#x02010;related adverse events) were also analysed in a similar manner.</p></sec><sec id="dom12584-sec-0007"><title>Results</title><sec id="dom12584-sec-0008"><title>Patients</title><p id="dom12584-para-0015">Of the 535 patients in the FAS population (ELEMENT&#x02010;1), 532 had a valid antibody testing at baseline and postbaseline, of which 212 (39.8%) had detectable antibodies at any point during the 52&#x02010;week treatment period <xref rid="dom12584-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref>.

Previous insulin studies used assays ranging from &#x0223c;5% to at least 20% binding as a clinically relevant level of antibody response <xref rid="dom12584-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">11</xref>, <xref rid="dom12584-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref>, <xref rid="dom12584-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">13</xref>.

In both studies, LY IGlar and IGlar both exhibited low levels of insulin antibodies (i.e. &#x0003c;5% binding).</p><p id="dom12584-para-0028">In addition to measuring antibody levels, determining whether significant increases have occurred over time compared with baseline levels is important. TEAR, a measure of immune response indicating a patient's antibody status has changed during the study (postbaseline), was intended to identify a relatively increased level of binding higher than that expected from analytical and biological variability alone (i.e. reflects a real treatment&#x02010;related change). The TEAR threshold in patients without detectable antibodies at baseline (&#x02265;1.26% binding) was stringent enough to capture potential treatment&#x02010;emergent changes in percent binding levels that may be associated with clinical events (&#x0003c;5% binding). In patients with T1DM or T2DM (including insulin&#x02010;na&#x000ef;ve and prior IGlar subgroups), the proportion of patients with TEAR was similar between both treatment groups.</p><p id="dom12584-para-0029">Because the development of antibody responses can differ in patients with T1DM versus those with T2DM, immunogenicity was studied separately and results are presented separately. As expected, a greater proportion of patients with T1DM (ELEMENT&#x02010;1) had detectable antibodies to insulin glargine at baseline and throughout the study relative to patients with T2DM (ELEMENT&#x02010;2). This finding is consistent with reports that patients with T1DM, a disease characterized by an autoimmune condition <xref rid="dom12584-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">14</xref>, are more likely to have pre&#x02010;existing anti&#x02010;insulin antibodies <xref rid="dom12584-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref> and exhibit different immune responses from those with T2DM <xref rid="dom12584-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">16</xref>. Within each study, antibody levels (percent binding) were similar between the treatment groups with no statistically significant differences at any visit or at the 52&#x02010;week (ELEMENT&#x02010;1) or 24&#x02010;week (ELEMENT&#x02010;2) endpoints in the total study population. The majority of patients [ELEMENT&#x02010;1: 320 patients (60.2%); ELEMENT&#x02010;2: 634 patients (86.8%)] had no detectable antibodies throughout the studies or changes in total insulin antibody level that ranged from antibody&#x02010;negative at baseline to a maximum percent binding value within 0.26&#x02013;1.26% during the study.</p><p id="dom12584-para-0030">For patients with T1DM, the difference in the proportion of patients with overall detectable antibodies through 52&#x02009;weeks, but not through 24&#x02009;weeks, included patients with first on&#x02010;treatment detectable antibodies at 52&#x02009;weeks. Although more LY IGlar&#x02010;treated patients had first on&#x02010;treatment detectable antibodies than IGlar&#x02010;treated patients at 52&#x02009;weeks, overall percent binding and TEAR for both treatment groups were similar for 0&#x02013;24 and 24&#x02013;52&#x02009;weeks. Moreover, both treatment groups had low (i.e. &#x0003c;5%) and similar median percent insulin binding levels; therefore, the apparent increase in the incidence of detectable antibodies in LY IGlar&#x02010;treated patients was not considered to be clinically significant.</p><p id="dom12584-para-0031">Results of subgroup analyses of patients with T2DM based on basal insulin at study entry provide additional details about the similarity of LY IGlar to IGlar. Patients in the insulin&#x02010;na&#x000ef;ve subgroup, where stronger immune responses to newly administered insulin were expected and not confounded by previous insulin exposure, showed no significant treatment differences in the proportion of patients with detectable antibodies, levels of antibodies, or proportion of patients with TEAR. Findings in the prior IGlar subgroup of patients with T2DM were not as straightforward to interpret as the insulin&#x02010;na&#x000ef;ve subgroup because of an imbalance in the incidence of detectable antibodies at baseline where more patients allocated to LY IGlar had detectable antibodies at baseline. Although statistically significant treatment differences in the proportion of patients with detectable antibodies were observed at weeks 4 and 24 and overall, actual antibody levels (Figure <xref rid="dom12584-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>E) at the respective timepoints and the incidence of TEAR were similar between the treatment groups, suggesting the significant differences were probably attributable to chance. Moreover, this finding was not corroborated in patients with T1DM (ELEMENT&#x02010;1), a more sensitive population where more patients had prior treatment with IGlar or other insulins and a higher incidence of detectable antibodies.</p><p id="dom12584-para-0032">Because LY IGlar and IGlar have the same primary amino acid sequence, the adaptive immune response should be to the same epitope. Although factors such as glycosylation and impurities in the final preparation may affect the magnitude of the response, antibodies directed against the same epitope on either synthetic insulin will recognize the same epitope on endogenous insulin <xref rid="dom12584-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref>. Analyses of cross&#x02010;reactive antibodies in both studies further confirmed the immune response to LY IGlar and IGlar was similar with respect to antibodies formed against human insulin. Clinical evidence from both studies showed similar immune responses in patients with T1DM or T2DM treated with either LY IGlar or IGlar, despite distinct manufacturing processes for these insulin glargine products.</p><p id="dom12584-para-0033">No significant differential treatment effect or relationship was seen between TEAR status or antibody levels and HbA1c, insulin dose, or hypoglycaemia rate in either study, indicating no clinically relevant effect of the observed immune responses on these clinical outcomes. Few and similar incidences of injection site reactions and allergic reactions were noted with LY IGlar and IGlar in both studies, consistent with what has been observed with more recently purified insulin formulations <xref rid="dom12584-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref>. Although our studies did not assess insulin&#x02010;neutralizing antibodies, the lack of an association between antibody levels (or incidence of TEAR) and clinical outcomes does not suggest neutralizing effects of anti&#x02010;insulin glargine antibodies. The incidence of SAEs and deaths were also similar between LY IGlar and IGlar in both studies <xref rid="dom12584-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref>, <xref rid="dom12584-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref>. The frequency of TEAEs among LY IGlar&#x02010; or IGlar&#x02010;treated patients with TEAR in both studies was similar, except for a single preferred term (nasopharyngitis) in patients with T1DM; however, this involved few events, and no temporal association existed between TEAR and the adverse event. Because incidence of nasopharyngitis in the LY IGlar subgroup with TEAR (ELEMENT&#x02010;1) was similar to that of LY IGlar&#x02010; or IGlar&#x02010;treated patients without TEAR, reported events for IGlar appear to be unusually low in the small subset of TEAR patients. Moreover, the incidence of nasopharyngitis was similar between treatment groups in the double&#x02010;blind ELEMENT&#x02010;2 study, which suggests the possibility of reporting bias contributing to this isolated finding in the open&#x02010;label ELEMENT&#x02010;1 study.</p><p id="dom12584-para-0034">In conclusion, the incidence of detectable anti&#x02010;insulin glargine antibodies, antibody levels and incidence of TEAR were similar in patients with T1DM or T2DM who received LY IGlar or IGlar. Moreover, levels of antibodies and the incidence of TEAR were low in both treatment groups, and no observed association was seen between clinical outcomes and insulin antibody levels or the incidence of TEAR. Our results add to the evidence supporting similar safety and immunogenicity profiles of LY IGlar and IGlar in patients with T1DM or T2DM and add to the totality of preclinical and clinical data demonstrating similarity of LY IGlar to IGlar.</p></sec><sec id="dom12584-sec-0016"><title>Conflict of Interest</title><p id="dom12584-para-0036">T.
