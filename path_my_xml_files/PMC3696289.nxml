Patients were followed-up for 3-6 months, and assessed every 30 days or every chemotherapy cycle. Patients were asked to maintain a normal diet. Safety assessment was carried out by a standardized questionnaire.</p><p>Adverse event was defined as the development of any sign or symptoms that did not exist before, or became more serious following the commencement of the treatment.

Patients with six chemotherapy cycles had a mean weight of 66.60 &#x000b1; 9.44 kg and BMI 27.21 &#x000b1; 3.68 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. BMI is the nutritional parameter most used for classification of nutritional profile. Nevertheless, this is a fact that isolated does not report the actual nutritional status of patients. Friedenreich connected obesity, uncontrolled weight gain, high BMI and W/HR to the risk of BC and mainly to a poor prognosis of the disease, with greater chances of recurrence for such patients.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] Kim in a study with 833 women found a strong association between high BMI and diagnosis of BC in stadium equal or greater than II of disease.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>]</p><p>Epidemiological studies utilize the relation W/HR and waist circumference (WC) for assessing body fat distribution.

However, Pereira <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>] in a population-based study conducted in Rio de Janeiro, showed that using the cut-off point of 0.80 for women had a better association with prediction of diseases linked to obesity.</p><p>Ronco found women diagnosed with BC having high skin folds values and WC (93.12 &#x000b1; 14.12).
