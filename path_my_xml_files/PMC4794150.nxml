The major etiologies of ALF are hepatitis viral infection (HBV, HAV, HEV), auto-immune hepatitis, drug-induced including suicides by acetaminophen overdose. Minor etiologies include neoplastic infiltration, acute Budd&#x02014;Chiari syndrome, heatstroke, mushroom ingestion, metabolic diseases such as Wilson&#x02019;s disease and pregnancy; however in about 15% the ALF cause remains unknown [<xref rid="pone.0150733.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. ALF can occur on a healthy liver or be superimposed on a chronic liver disease, i.e a liver already injured. This latter situation often occurs in HBV-related chronic hepatitis during a reactivation phase seen in 15&#x02013;30% of HBeAg negative [<xref rid="pone.0150733.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Due to the high HBV prevalence in Africa and Asia, viral hepatitis is the leading cause of ALF in these areas [<xref rid="pone.0150733.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Another model of acute on chronic liver disease is auto-immune chronic hepatitis (AIH), which was the third cause of ALF in the USA after exclusion of acetaminophen overdose [<xref rid="pone.0150733.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and accounted for 26% of the cases in a recent Argentina series [<xref rid="pone.0150733.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>The exact mechanism of ALF is still not well-known and might vary according the etiology and the underlying liver status. Nevertheless, ALF is characterized by a strong oxidative stress which leads to a massive tissue injury and suppresses liver cell proliferation. Liver oxidative stress results from a strong increase in the production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, generated by the causal agents. Several pathways are activated in excess including tumor necrosis factor, TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand, CD95 (APO-1/Fas) [<xref rid="pone.0150733.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and finally the complement system which leads to an over production of the proinflammatory anaphylatoxin C5a [<xref rid="pone.0150733.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Owing to the progressive nature of the liver failure, the main preoccupation of clinicians is to avoid the progression from SAH to ALF and the worsening of encephalopathy when it is already present at time of admission. The general idea is to save time in order to allow the liver to regenerate. In this regard, several treatments have been proposed.</p><p>N acetyl cysteine (NAC) administration is an efficient therapy in acetaminophen-induced ALF [<xref rid="pone.0150733.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], subjected it is administered early after ALF development. NAC has been reported to be efficient in non-acetaminophen ALF with low grade encephalopathy [<xref rid="pone.0150733.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] but there is no complete agreement between authors in this regard [<xref rid="pone.0150733.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0150733.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Specific medical treatment according to the ALF etiology have also been tested, such as nucleoside analog therapy in HBV related ALF but the majority of studies did not show any significant improvement in survival [<xref rid="pone.0150733.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], or such as corticotherapy in severe AIH related ALF but this did not improve the prognostic [<xref rid="pone.0150733.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Extracorporeal liver-assist devices and bioartificial devices are also potential ALF therapy; some of them are in evaluation [<xref rid="pone.0150733.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] but even they are shown to be efficient they will require a specific and sophisticated environment. Finally, liver transplantation is the ultimate option of ALF treatment when no process has been able to control or to stop the liver failure, ALF now accounting for around 8% of liver transplant activity in Europe and the US [<xref rid="pone.0150733.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Together, a convenient and efficient treatment exists for acetaminophen induced ALF but there is an unmet therapeutic need for all the ALF non-related to acetaminophen intoxication.</p><p>The human secreted C-type lectin Reg3&#x003b1; (also called hepatocarcinoma- intestine-pancreas/pancreatitis-associated protein [HIP/PAP]) is a good candidate in this regard. Indeed <italic>in vitro</italic>, HIP/PAP conferred strong resistance against TNF&#x003b1;-induced apoptosis to pancreas and liver cells and protected against acetaminophen- and Fas-induced ALFs [<xref rid="pone.0150733.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0150733.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. These exciting properties led to consider the pharmacological use of HIP/PAP through the development of a recombinant (rc) full-length human HIP/PAP protein (rcHIP/PAP). This molecule, referred to as ALF-5755, was tested in an animal model of ALF, the Fas-intoxicated mice, and it improved significantly the survival in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner [<xref rid="pone.0150733.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]; moreover a phase 1 trial demonstrated a good tolerability and pharmacokinetic profile of rcHIP/PAP in healthy subjects [<xref rid="pone.0150733.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>We therefore designed a proof of concept (POC), phase IIa study to evaluate the efficacy of intravenous ALF-5755 to improve liver function as compared with placebo in patients with non-acetaminophen SAH or early stage of ALF.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec007"><title>Patients and Methods</title><sec id="sec008"><title>Patients</title><p>Patients eligible for the study were male and female adult patients with nonacetaminophen severe acute hepatitis and early stage acute liver failure.

Moreover, as patients with ALF are treated as early as possible, according to the AASLD recommendations published in 2005 [<xref rid="pone.0150733.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], using the usual criteria of efficacy in ALF treatment trials, that is the survival rate, would have requested to include a very high number of patients to reach a confident statistical power.</p><p>Therefore we look for a surrogate, biological, marker of efficacy. The King&#x02019;s College [<xref rid="pone.0150733.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and the Clichy [<xref rid="pone.0150733.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] criteria are currently used by physicians to decide the transfer to a liver unit with transplantation facilities; they are prognostic markers but they have not been evaluated sequentially as a marker of efficacy of a given treatment. Considering the biological ALF-5755 capacity to confer a resistance to the cellular necrosis as described above, we hypothesized that ALF-5755 might improve the coagulation protein synthesis, a widely used hallmark of liver function. Indeed, in patients with ALD factor VII level at admission and changes in factor V during hospitalization have been reported to be reliable prognostic factors [<xref rid="pone.0150733.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] as well as serial prothrombin time in paracetamol induced fulminant hepatic failure [<xref rid="pone.0150733.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Therefore we decided to assess the ALF-5755 efficacy using the change in prothrombin according to time, a prognostic marker that we evaluated recently in patients with severe ALD [<xref rid="pone.0150733.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]; then the primary endpoint was the change in Prothrombin (PR) during 72 hours, referred to as PR slope H0H72, following treatment initiation calculated as the difference between PR at H72 and PR at H0 pre-dose divided by the time elapsed between the two dosages, i.e 72h (<italic>mathematical formula</italic>: <italic>(PRH0-PRH72)/72</italic>). PR was measured every twelve hours. The secondary end-points were the transplant-free survival rate, defined as being alive and not transplanted, at Day 21, a variable proposed early by Lee et al [<xref rid="pone.0150733.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], the length of hospitalization, the safety and the rate of change in MELD [<xref rid="pone.0150733.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] during 72 hours following treatment initiation. MELD is a scoring system for assessing the severity of chronic liver disease based on the patient's values for serum bilirubin, serum creatinine, and the international normalized ratio for prothrombin time (INR). It usually ranges from less than 10 to more than 40; higher is the value, poorer is the survival prognosis. After the unblinding of the study data the time to reach a prothrombin value equal to 50%, a cut-off above which liver transplant is no more considered, was added as a secondary efficacy analyze. Patients were followed-up until day 21 after inclusion, even those who early discontinued.</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Subgroup analysis</title><p>When we analyzed our initial cohort of patients with ALF [<xref rid="pone.0150733.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], we noticed that patients with a HBV or a AIH-related ALF behaved differently from the others in terms of PR slope H0H72 (-0.02&#x000b1;0.07 vs 0.30&#x000b1;0.26, p&#x0003c;0.001) and mortality (76.9 vs 36.0%, p&#x0003c;0.001) (Bertrand Nalpas, personal communication), a result not reported in our publication [<xref rid="pone.0150733.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]; this result fitted well with reports showing that HBV ALF mortality was higher than that with hepatitis A or E infections [<xref rid="pone.0150733.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0150733.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and other showing that as AIH related ALF respond poorly to corticosteroids so patients should be systematically placed on the list for transplantation [<xref rid="pone.0150733.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Hypothesizing that it could be the same in the present prospective study we scheduled to perform a secondary analysis of ALF-5755 efficacy on the specific subgroup of patients with HBV-AIH related ALF, if possible since we could not anticipated the number of patients satisfying this condition who will be included.</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Sample size</title><p>The sample size was determined from a series of patients reported elsewhere [<xref rid="pone.0150733.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The mean and standard deviation of the PR slope H0H72 (0.22&#x000b1;0.27) from this series were assumed for the placebo group. We hypothesized that the PR slope H0H72 in the ALF-5755 would be twice that of the placebo. Based on these data, it was calculated that the required number of patients was 30 per group using a 2-sided 2-sample t-test with an alpha and beta level equal to 5% and 80% respectively.</p></sec><sec id="sec014"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Quantitative variables were described as mean&#x000b1;SD or median and qualitative values as frequency. PR slope between placebo and active groups on the whole sample and the HBV/HAI subgroup was compared by a non-parametric test (Wilcoxon). Mortality and liver transplantation frequencies were compared by a Chi<sup>2</sup> test and their time-to-event by a log-rank test. In addition, the comparison was adjusted for sub-groups based on initial PR and etiology (combination of HBV and AIH etiologies, see the study endpoint section) using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test. A complete description of the statistical analysis plan is provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0150733.s008">S6 Text</xref>. Adjustment on hepatic encephalopathy could not be done owing to the small number of patients displaying this complication (see the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec015">results</xref> section). In a post-hoc analysis we compare the time to event (Kaplan plot and log rank) for achieving a Prothrombin value of 50%. A p-value below 0.05 was considered as significant.

These two groups also differed on the transplant-free survival rate which was significantly lower in the HBV-HAI group (63.6% vs 91.4%, p = 0.013); moreover in the HBV-AIH subgroup the mean PR slope H0-H72 was flat or even negative while it was positive, about + 0.3 in the other etiologies (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0150733.t003">Table 3</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="pone.0150733.t003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0150733.t003</object-id><label>Table 3</label><caption><title>Values of PR slope from H0 to H72 according to the etiology of the acute liver failure.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone.0150733.t003g" xlink:href="pone.0150733.t003"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Etiology</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">N</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">PR slope H0-H72</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Survival rate(%)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">HAV</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.36&#x000b1;0.16</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">100</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Drug</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.30&#x000b1;0.36</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">87.5</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Other</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">9</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.31&#x000b1;0.25</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">87.5</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Unknown</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.47&#x000b1;0.41</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">88.9</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>All combined</italic></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>35</italic></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>0</italic>.<italic>36&#x000b1;0</italic>.<italic>29</italic></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>91</italic>.<italic>4</italic></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">HBV</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">13</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">-0.02&#x000b1;0.13</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">76.9</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">HAI</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">9</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">-0.0&#x000b1;0.05</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">44.4</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>All combined</italic></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>22</italic></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>-0</italic>.<italic>01&#x000b1;0</italic>.<italic>10</italic></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>63</italic>.<italic>6</italic></td></tr></tbody></table></alternatives></table-wrap><p>In the HBV-AIH group the mean PR slope H0-H72 was two times higher in the ALF-5755 arm (n = 13) as compared to placebo (n = 9) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0150733.t004">Table 4</xref>) and the difference was significant (0.048&#x000b1;0.066 vs -0.040&#x000b1;0.099, p = 0.04; mean difference = -0.088, CI 95% [-0.171&#x02013;0.004], effect size = 1.09) when analysis was done in the 18 patients having received the complete treatment (PP).</p><table-wrap id="pone.0150733.t004" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0150733.t004</object-id><label>Table 4</label><caption><title>ALF-5755 efficacy in HBV or AIH related severe acute hepatitis.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone.0150733.t004g" xlink:href="pone.0150733.t004"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Condition</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">ALF-5755</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Placebo</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">p</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>ITT</bold>

Although we found no significant differences between the ALF-5755 group and the placebo group with respect to the primary end point when the analysis was done on the whole sample, ALF-5755 might be of potential interest in a specific subgroup of patients with HBV-AIH related severe SAH.</p><p>The lack of global clinical efficacy that we observed could be due to a number of factors. Firstly, our series was characterized by a high rate of survival, 80.7%, while it was 52% in another of patients resembling to ours, i.e. with non-acetaminophen induced low grade ALF [<xref rid="pone.0150733.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]; therefore such a striking natural improvement hampered any demonstration of the potential efficacy of the treatment in evaluation. Such hypothesis is reinforced by the results obtained in the most severe sub-group of our series, that is the patients with HBV or AIH related SAH, although we agree that these results should be taken with caution due to the small size of this sub-group. Indeed, this sub-group was characterized by lower survival rate as compared to the remaining counterpart, in accordance with previous data [<xref rid="pone.0150733.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], and by a flat PR slope H0H72. The reasons explaining these differences in outcome according to the etiology are not well understood however one could suspect that in the HBV and AIH sub-group, the acute liver failure might well occur on a liver previously and chronically injured; since both HBV and AIH are known to lead chronic hepatitis, those patients could well have been diagnosed as having a non cirrhotic Acute on Chronic Liver Failure (ACLF), a syndrome recently revisited [<xref rid="pone.0150733.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In our protocol, a history of chronic hepatitis was indeed an exclusion criteria but histological evaluation of the 6 liver biopsies from HBV or AIH patients available at the time of transplantation showed features of chronic hepatitis and thus did confirm the diagnosis of ACLF. Therefore, in the specific sub-group of HBV-AIH related ACLF, the active drug ALF-5755 significantly improved the PR slope as compared to the placebo, although in the PP analysis only; this could well be due to the specific ALF-5755 pharmacological properties since the transition from a chronic liver disease to ACLF is associated with an increase in proinflammatory cytokine [<xref rid="pone.0150733.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] leading to necrosis of liver cells, as well as fibrosis and cholestasis. As a consequence, the time period to reach a prothrombin rate higher than 50%, a value above which the inscription on a waiting list for liver transplantation is not considered [<xref rid="pone.0150733.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], was significantly shortened. Finally the duration of hospital stay was decreased but there was no significant benefit on survival. Although obtained on a short series these results suggest that ALF-5755 could improve the ACLF outcome through boosting the liver regeneration process when it is slowed down or even stopped.</p><p>The second reason of the global lack of efficacy might come from a non-adapted therapeutic administration schedule. The chosen dose, 10mg per infusion, was based on data obtained in experimental models after verification it was safely tolerated in humans. The timing of infusion was based on pharmacokinetic data obtained in the phase I study [<xref rid="pone.0150733.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]; given a terminal plasma half-life around 4.5 hours, the administration was scheduled every 12 hours. However, pharmacokinetics studies performed in the present phase II study showed a residual accumulation all along the 6 infusions and a sharp increase in the T1/2 which was three times higher at the sixth infusion as compared to the first one. ALF 5755 is acting as both a survival factor and a mitogenic molecule. Also, this is a C-type lectin which binds the fibrin network of the extracellular matrix and targets to the matrix its strong and intrinsic antioxidant action. Thus, interestingly, binding to the extracellular matrix specifically occurs upon liver inflammation and has been shown to last for at least 24 hours upon a single infusion [<xref rid="pone.0150733.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. These modes of actions and the pharmacological pattern may indeed offer the possibility to optimize the administration schedule.</p><p>Although not devoted to evaluate the performance of biomarkers of survival, our prospective study confirms the performance of the PRslope from the admission to the third day of hospitalization as a prognostic marker in SAH [<xref rid="pone.0150733.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Indeed, in that series, the positive predictive value of a PR slope &#x0003e; = 0.1 was equal to 1, i.e the maximum probability, while the predictive negative value was 0.39. It is not however an &#x0201c;early&#x0201d; prognostic marker since it can be calculated only three days following admittance and therefore could not replace the scores assessing the severity on admission such as the Meld [<xref rid="pone.0150733.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] score. But from the third day, subjected the patients is still alive, using the PR slope appears to be convenient owing to its simplicity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec022"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, although ALF-5755 was not efficient on the whole sample our results identify a sub-group of ALF patients, i.e. those in whom the liver regeneration process is under arrest, specifically with HBV or AIH related ACLF in our series, for whom ALF-5755 administration led to a significant, although moderate, clinical benefit. These results obtained on small sample need to be confirmed in a larger series but as ALF-5755 is an original medical treatment with respect to its modes of action and pharmacological pattern and as HBV is the major cause of ACLF in Asia and Africa and AIH a growing cause, this study emphasizes the interest and the need to pursuit the evaluation of ALF-5755 in ACLF treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec023"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0150733.s001"><label>S1 CONSORT Checklist</label><caption><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0150733.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0150733.s002"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0150733.s002.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0150733.s003"><label>S1 Text</label><caption><title>Study Protocol.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0150733.s003.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0150733.s004"><label>S2 Text</label><caption><title>Administrative approval France.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0150733.s004.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0150733.s005"><label>S3 Text</label><caption><title>Administrative approval Germany.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0150733.s005.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0150733.s006"><label>S4 Text</label><caption><title>Ethical Approval France.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0150733.s006.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0150733.s007"><label>S5 Text</label><caption><title>Ethical Approval Germany.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0150733.s007.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0150733.s008"><label>S6 Text</label><caption><title>Statistical analysis plan.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0150733.s008.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0150733.s009"><label>S7 Text</label><caption><title>Clinical study report.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0150733.s009.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0150733.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Bernal</surname><given-names>W</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Wendon</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name>. <article-title>Acute Liver Failure</article-title>. <source>N Engl J Med</source>
