In the USA, as many as 100 million adults suffer from chronic pain with an estimated cost of around US$600 billion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In Europe, almost 20&#x000a0;% of the population report pain of moderate to severe intensity with at least a 6-month duration, with an estimated yearly cost of &#x020ac;3.4 billion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Musculoskeletal pain is by far the most frequent type of chronic pain, encompassing about 90&#x000a0;% of all chronic pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) is a musculoskeletal pain disorder that mainly affects women and is characterized by widespread pain and tenderness, stiffness, fatigue, sleep disturbances, and cognitive dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Exercise intolerance is regarded a key symptom in FMS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and even normal household chores often lead to worsening of symptoms. In healthy subjects, exercise usually increases pressure pain thresholds (PPTs) due to activation of endogenous analgesia, but in FMS patients muscle contractions reduce PPTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In spite of this, physical exercises of moderate intensity are included in the multimodal intervention programs for the management of FMS. Indeed, several studies have shown beneficial effects of regular exercises in FMS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Further, exercise of moderate intensity increased functional aerobic capacity and improved activities of daily living in FMS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and a recent systematic review reported positive results of diverse exercise interventions on pain, multidimensional function, and self-reported physical function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>Despite its large impact on society, the mechanisms behind FMS are not well known. A biopsychosocial model is mostly suggested, including both biological and psychological factors. With respect to biological factors, the common belief has for some time been that central alterations in pain processing are of greatest importance and that peripheral input plays a minor or no role [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However, it was recently suggested that peripheral mechanisms, such as temporal summation, due to normal muscle work may be important to drive pain hypersensibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. This may be enough to cause repeated release of nociceptive and inflammatory substances causing long-lasting peripheral and central sensitization. In support of this is increasing evidence over the past years that the interstitial levels of many algesic and metabolic substances are elevated in painful muscles of patients with local or regional chronic myalgia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. However, relatively few studies have investigated interstitial muscle levels of nociceptive substances in FMS. An early study showed that the release of serotonin in the masseter muscle was elevated in response to trauma in FMS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. More recently, Gerdle et al. showed that the interstitial levels of lactate and pyruvate in the trapezius muscle were elevated in patients with FMS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Patients with chronic widespread pain also seem to have difficulties in recruiting antinociceptive substances, such as endocannabinoids, in response to contractions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. An increased release of nociceptive substances in combination with reduced release of antinociceptive substances may therefore participate in pain amplification.</p><p>Cytokines are small proteins that are produced in many diverse cells of the immune system, such as monocytes, lymphocytes, and mast cells, but also in endothelial cells and fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. They are involved in cell signaling and play a critical role in the immune system. Many of the symptoms seen in inflammatory conditions that are generally attributed to central release of cytokines are similar to those seen in FMS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. For example, animal research suggests a role for interleukin (IL)-1&#x003b2; in fatigue and hyperalgesia, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) beta and IL-6 can trigger daytime sleepiness and pain but also elicit cognitive dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. This may imply that central release of cytokines may be involved in FMS. Indeed, central inflammation was proposed in its pathophysiology based on findings of increased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of IL-8 in FMS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p>It is well-known that short-term exercise increases some cytokine levels, especially IL-6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Some studies have investigated circulating cytokine levels in FMS and reported increased levels of IL-6, IL-8, and TNF, but a blunted response of IL-10 to short-term exercises [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. We have recently investigated the effect of dynamic muscle contractions on interstitial muscle release of pro-inflammatory cytokines in FMS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. We found that TNF was higher in pain-free controls than in FMS and increased in response to contractions only in controls, while IL-6 and IL-8 did not differ between groups and increased in both groups. However, muscle and plasma cytokine levels were not related.</p><p>Interestingly, while short-term exercise seems to increase cytokine levels, a few recent reports have shown reductions in pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in response to long-term exercise in FMS. A systematic review based on nine articles concluded that, despite minimal evidence, exercise interventions might act as an anti-inflammatory treatment in FMS patients by reducing circulating IL-6 and IL-8 levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Further, in FMS patients subjected to 15&#x000a0;weeks of Nordic walking, changes of insulin growth factor-1 (IGF-1) correlated positively to changes of pain threshold, indicating a possible beneficial role for IGF-1 during exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p>However, no previous study has investigated long-term effects on muscle levels of cytokines in response to physical exercise in FMS. Therefore, this study aimed at investigating the interstitial muscle release of pro-inflammatory cytokines in patients with FMS before and after a resistance exercise intervention. The hypothesis was that if muscle release of pro-inflammatory cytokines was elevated in FMS, they would be normalized after 15&#x000a0;weeks of resistance exercise.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Participants</title><p>Female patients with FMS and age-matched healthy women (CON) were included. The subjects participated in a randomized controlled multicenter trial regarding the effects of progressive resistance exercise or relaxation exercise on FMS symptoms (Clinicaltrials.gov NCTO1226784, 21 October 2010). The enrollment process for the patients has been described in detail previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p><p>Microdialysis was performed in a subgroup of patients and CON. The first 10 patients at each of the three participating centers (12 at one site) who were randomized to resistance exercise and volunteered to also participate in microdialysis before and after the exercise were included. For CON, healthy individuals in the multicenter center study who were willing to participate in microdialysis and resistance exercise were included (the same number as FMS). They were matched to the FMS patients according to age. In this study, data are reported for those subjects who participated in both microdialysis sessions and for whom complete microdialysis data were obtained at both sessions. Two FMS patients and two CON of the included 64 participants dropped out from the study and additionally six FMS patients and three CON were excluded due to technical failure during microdialysis (e.g., crashed catheters, so no fluid could be sampled). Thus, 24 FMS patients and 27 CON participated.</p><p>Inclusion criteria for the patients were: 1) a diagnosis of FMS according to the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 1990 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] classification criteria; and 2) to be of working age (20&#x02013;65 years).</p><p>Inclusion criteria for the healthy controls were: 1) good general health; 2) pain-free; and 3) age 20&#x02013;65 years.</p><p>Exclusion criteria for both groups were: 1) high blood pressure (&#x0003e;160/90&#x000a0;mmHg); 2) osteoarthritis in the hip or knee; 3) other severe somatic or psychiatric disorders; 4) primary causes of pain other than FMS; 5) high consumption of alcohol (audit &#x0003e;6); 6) participation in a rehabilitation program within the past year; 7) regular resistant exercise training or relaxation exercise training more than twice a week; 8) inability to understand or speak Swedish; and 9) not being able to refrain from non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for 1&#x000a0;week and paracetamol, opioids, or hypnotics for 48&#x000a0;h prior to microdialysis.</p><p>The participants were allowed to continue with their other regular medication. As such, eight in the FMS group used antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants (TCA), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRI)), one used gabapentin, and one used tramadol. Three CON used antidepressants (SSRI).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Procedure</title><p>The participants were examined clinically by a physician approximately 1&#x000a0;week before the first microdialysis session. The examination also included a functional test of physical capacity, the number of tender points, pressure algometry, and a battery of questionnaires. The questionnaires included registrations of psychological distress and quality of life. For all participants age (years), weight (kg), height (m) and blood pressures (mmHg) were registered and body mass index (BMI; kg/m<sup>2</sup>) was calculated.</p><p>Intramuscular microdialysis in the vastus lateralis muscle of the most painful leg was performed during 220&#x000a0;min before and after the resistance exercise. Before microdialysis, a venous blood sample (20&#x000a0;mL) was drawn from the decubital vein for analysis of plasma cytokine levels for comparison to interstitial levels, i.e., to see if interstitial levels indicate local release. Both sessions included 20&#x000a0;min of repetitive dynamic muscle contractions of the leg during microdialysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Assessment of anxiety, depression, and quality of life</title><p>All participants completed a battery of questionnaires; of these the validated Swedish versions of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) to assess anxiety and depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], and the Short-Form Health Survey (SF36) to assess quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] were included as background variables in this study.

Each site was assessed only once to avoid the risk of temporal summation and the same order (as described above) was used for all participants starting with the points on the right side. An electronic algometer (Somedic Sales AB, H&#x000f6;&#x000f6;r, Sweden) with a blunt rubber tip of 1&#x000a0;cm<sup>2</sup> and a pressure rate of approximately 50 kPa/s was used. Before the recordings, the subjects were given instructions and the procedure was tested over a site not included in the actual recordings. The algometer was held perpendicular to the skin at the site and subjects were instructed to press the button when the sensation of pressure changed to pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. If the subject did not press the button before 1500 kPa was reached, the application of pressure was interrupted.

If both legs had similar pain levels, the muscle on the dominant side was chosen. The same muscle was used at both sessions. The skin overlying the muscle was anesthetized with 0.5&#x000a0;mL lidocaine (Xyolocain 20&#x000a0;mg/mL). Two commercially available microdialysis catheters (CMA Microdialysis AB, Solna, Sweden), with 20&#x000a0;kDa (CMA 60) and 100&#x000a0;kDa (CMA 71) cut-off and membrane length 30&#x000a0;mm, were inserted into the muscle 3&#x000a0;cm apart in parallel to the muscle fibers in the mid-third part of the distance from the trochanter to the knee joint 5&#x000a0;min after skin surface anesthesia. The 100&#x000a0;kDa catheter was used for sampling cytokines in the present study and the 20&#x000a0;kDa for metabolites (data presented elsewhere). The catheters were perfused with an infusion pump (CMA 107) set at 5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L/h with a Ringer acetate solution (Fresenius Kabi AB, Uppsala, Sweden) containing 3&#x000a0;mM glucose, 0.5&#x000a0;mM lactate, 3.0&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M [<sup>14</sup>C]-lactate (specific activity: 5.81&#x000a0;GBq/mmol; GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK) as well as 0.3&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l/ml <sup>3</sup>H<sub>2</sub>O (specific activity: 37&#x000a0;MBq/g; PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, USA).</p><p>Microdialysates were sampled every 20&#x000a0;min. The first 120&#x000a0;min of microdialysis was regarded as the trauma phase and dialysates from this period were not analyzed. The dialysate sample obtained at 140&#x000a0;min was regarded as the baseline. The subjects then performed repetitive dynamic contractions of the quadriceps muscle (knee extension) for 20&#x000a0;min. The participants were seated with the legs outside the bed with the exercising leg slightly bent and the foot and calf placed on a 40&#x000a0;cm Pilatus ball. For participants with baseline pain level &#x02265;40&#x000a0;mm on the VAS in the exercising leg a knee angle of 15&#x000b0; was used and for those with pain levels &#x0003c;40&#x000a0;mm on the VAS an angle of 20&#x000b0; was used. The contralateral leg was bent 90&#x000b0; with the foot supported. During the exercise the participants performed continuous knee extensions by slowly lifting the leg until straight and then lowering it down on the Pilatus ball, and then immediately lifting it again without resting the leg on the ball. Each such cycle of dynamic contractions took 5&#x000a0;s and was repeated for 20&#x000a0;min. After the contractions the subjects were asked to lie down again on the bed and rest while the microdialysis continued for 60&#x000a0;min.</p><p>Pain intensity (VAS) was assessed before insertion of the microdialysis catheter and every 20&#x000a0;min (when changing microdialysate vials) throughout the microdialysis session, but every 5&#x000a0;min during the 20-min dynamic contractions. Fatigue (Borg&#x02019;s RPE) was assessed at baseline (140&#x000a0;min) and every 5&#x000a0;min during the dynamic contractions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Resistance exercise intervention</title><p>Previous studies have shown that low-intensity exercise, adjusted to individual limitations, is feasible for most FMS patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>].

Dunn&#x02019;s test for multiple comparisons against a control group (baseline) was used as a post-hoc test when the Friedman test was significant.

Although overall pain intensity had decreased and arm muscle force improved after exercise, there were no significant changes of pain intensity or muscle force in the exercising leg. Neither were there any significant changes in muscle or plasma cytokine levels. Thus, 15&#x000a0;weeks of resistance exercise twice per week did not influence the peripheral release of cytokines.</p><p>Several studies have shown that exercise may have an anti-inflammatory effect on various inflammatory conditions, for example osteoarthritis of the knee [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>], by reducing systemic cytokine levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Also, in FMS, some previous studies, mainly from the same group, indicate that an exercise intervention may reduce systemic cytokine levels. Ortega and co-workers in a pilot study of FMS patients reported that 4&#x000a0;months of aquatic exercise three times per week reduced elevated serum IL-8 levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. They later followed up on the study by showing that after 8&#x000a0;months of aquatic exercise twice per week there were no differences in the spontaneous and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated monocyte release of IL-1&#x003b2; or IL-6 in FMS compared to healthy controls, but a lower release of TNF and higher release of IL-10. At baseline, before exercise, the release of all these cytokines was higher in FMS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Another study from the group reported significantly reduced monocyte release of IL-8 and noradrenaline in FMS after 8&#x000a0;months of aquatic exercise compared to FMS patients that had not been exercising [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. Combined, these results indicate that an exercise intervention may reduce systemic IL-8, but increase IL-10. Available evidence from a systematic review (mainly based on the studies above) suggests that exercise interventions may reduce systemic IL-6 and IL-8 levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Thus, these results differ from the results of the present study regarding muscle levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The results cannot be directly compared as the previous studies investigated circulating cytokine levels. However, plasma cytokine levels did not change after the resistance exercise either. The reason for this difference could be due to methodological issues; for example, aquatic exercise compared to resistance exercise, duration of exercise, and so forth. The former studies also included a limited number of patients (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;14), which is why the power was probably low which questions the validity of the results. Also, the present study had a limited patient sample (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;24), although most other microdialysis studies studying muscle release of biomarkers in chronic pain conditions have had similar sample sizes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. However, it would be feasible and warranted to conduct larger studies on the effect of exercise on plasma levels of cytokines. In addition, even if the results from the main study of this randomized controlled trial showed a positive effect on FMS symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], the pain and fatigue as well as muscle force in the exercising leg were unaffected by the resistance exercise. Thus, the exercise might also have been of too low intensity to alter muscle cytokine levels. Bjersing and co-workers measured serum and cerebrospinal fluid levels of biomarkers, among them IL-6 and IL-8, before and after 15&#x000a0;weeks of Nordic walking in 49 FMS patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] and found no significant changes, in line with the results of the present study. They further did not find any effects of the exercise on 6MWT or pain intensity.</p><p>In concordance with previous microdialysis studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>] and biopsy studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>], the interstitial levels of IL-6 and IL-8 increased in response to dynamic contractions. Baseline levels of IL-6 and IL-8 were higher in dialysate than in plasma, and the levels did not correlate. This shows that IL-6 and IL-8 are released locally in the muscle tissue. Indeed, both IL-6 and IL-8 are regarded as myokines, i.e., cytokines that are released from myocytes. Also, TNF increased in response to dynamic contractions but only in CON. TNF is normally not regarded as a myokine as it does not increase after exercise, if not highly strenuous or prolonged [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. The dialysate levels of TNF were lower than plasma levels, which refutes that local release would have any effect on plasma levels. Even if we cannot draw any conclusions about plasma levels of cytokines in response to dynamic contractions in this study, as they were only assessed before microdialysis, it is well known that plasma IL-6 increases after exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. This is not related to muscle damage, as shown also by low-intensity concentric contractions leading to increased plasma IL-6 levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. In FMS, plasma and serum cytokine levels of IL-8 were reported to be decreased after 45&#x000a0;min of moderate cycling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] and after an exhaustive treadmill exercise lasting approximately 20&#x000a0;min [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The latter study also reported increased serum IL-6 and TNF levels and a blunted response of IL-10. The increase in IL-6 is in concordance with the dialysate data in this study, but the results regarding IL-8 differ. Other studies reported increased gene expression of IL-10, but not IL-6 or TNF, up to 48&#x000a0;h after a 25-min cycling exercise in FMS comorbid with chronic fatigue syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>], but no change in patients with FMS only [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Hence, even if studies are not directly comparable because of different methodologies, the diverging results across studies make conclusions about the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines due to dynamic contractions in FMS impossible at present.</p><p>The positive correlations between overall pain intensity and muscle IL-6 may seemingly indicate a role for cytokines in the local muscle pathophysiology of FMS. On the contrary, the increased dialysate levels of IL-6 and IL-8 immediately after dynamic contractions did not correlate with the increase in muscle pain or fatigue levels at any visit, which speaks against this. Thus, mechanisms other than muscle release of cytokines probably account for the increase in pain and fatigue during contractions. However, circulating cytokines, especially IL-8, released mainly from other sources may still be involved in FMS pathology as has been reported in many previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>].</p><p>Few previous studies have explored muscle cytokine levels with microdialysis. Of the pro-inflammatory cytokines analyzed in this study, IL-1&#x003b2; in dialysate was detectable in less than 50&#x000a0;% of samples and in very low levels both in FMS and CON, whereas the other cytokines were detectable in the majority of samples. This shows that it is possible to recover cytokines from muscle tissue with microdialysis even without adding dextran or albumin, albeit this might have improved recovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>].</p><p>Insertion of the microdialysis catheter usually disrupts the balance of substances in the tissue, which takes time to normalize. For smaller molecules, such as serotonin, glutamate and metabolites, 2&#x000a0;h of stabilization has been shown to be sufficient in intramuscular microdialysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. For cytokines the pattern may be different. One study reported about 30&#x000a0;% increases in IL-6 and IL-8 levels 6&#x000a0;h after insertion of a microdialysis catheter in the vastus lateralis muscle of healthy volunteers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. Also, for IL-6 and IL-8 in this study there was a general tendency to an increase in muscle levels with time. This could, of course, also be an effect of the dynamic contractions, as an increased release of both these cytokines was found in the dialysate sample obtained directly after the contractions. However, this was a transient increase and in the following sample the levels did not differ from baseline. Nevertheless, it is not known if a steady state is reached even after 6&#x000a0;h so it might not be feasible in a clinical situation to prolong the microdialysis to reach a steady state.</p><p>The strength of the present study is that the local release of cytokines was measured (with microdialysis) in a muscle (vastus lateralis) that had been subjected to resistance exercise twice per week for 15&#x000a0;weeks. The microdialysis method also allows continuous measurements in response to, for example, muscle contractions, as in the present study. No previous studies have made similar attempts, even if biopsy studies before and after acute exercise have been performed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. Another strength is that the study population represents FMS patients in the general population and not patients from tertiary care clinics. This may explain why the depression levels were within the normal range, contrary to other studies in FMS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. Among the study limitations is the sample size. Even if it was larger than previous studies regarding exercise effects on cytokine levels in FMS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>], the sample was still somewhat limited. Furthermore, to be able to compare cytokine levels before and after the intervention, the average of the dialysate levels during the dynamic contractions was used. This might have disguised subtle changes between sessions. However, as shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, the levels of the cytokines showed a similar pattern at both sessions which why this is less likely. No attempts were made to match the groups for variables other than age. One can therefore argue that any changes in outcome measures could be due to improvement in physical activity in FMS that was without significance for the pathophysiology. However, participants in both groups were physically inactive, and volunteered to participate as they wanted to start exercising. Finally, only pro-inflammatory cytokines were analyzed. Due to the recent findings of reduced IL-10 in response to exercise it would have been interesting to also analyze IL-10 and other anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4 and IL-13.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Although 15&#x000a0;weeks of progressive resistance exercise improved arm muscle force and reduced overall pain in FMS it neither altered the muscle levels of IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6, IL-8, or TNF, nor pain and fatigue levels in the vastus lateralis muscle. However, TNF was lower in FMS than CON and increased during dynamic contractions only in CON.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Abbreviations</title><p>%CV, percent coefficient of variation; 6MWT, 6-minute walk test; ACR, American College of Rheumatology; CON, healthy controls; CSF, cerebrospinal fluid; FMS, fibromyalgia syndrome; HADS, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale; IGF-1, insulin growth factor-1; IL, interleukin; IQR, interquartile range; MVC, maximum voluntary capacity; NSAID, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug; PPT, pressure pain threshold; SF36, Short-Form Health Survey (PSC: physical summary component, MSC: mental summary component); SSRI, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; VAS, visual analogue scale</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The colleagues who performed examinations and supervised the groups in Gothenburg, Alings&#x000e5;s, Link&#x000f6;ping, and Stockholm during the intervention are gratefully acknowledged.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p>Supported by grants from the Swedish Rheumatism Association, the Swedish Research Council (K2009-52P-20943-03-2, K2011-69X-21874-01-6, and K2015-99X-21874-05-05), the Stockholm County Council (ALF), The County Council of &#x000d6;sterg&#x000f6;tland (ALF), AFA insurance, the Norrbacka-Eugenia foundation, the Health and Medical Care Executive Board of V&#x000e4;stra G&#x000f6;taland Region, ALF-LUA at Sahlgrenska University Hospital, and Gothenburg Center for Person Centered Care (GPCC).</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p>As more analyses from this randomized controlled trial are currently underway, the authors will not share their data until all analyses have been made.</p></sec><sec id="FPar3"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>ME, KM, BGe, BGh, ML, IBL, and EK contributed to the conception of the study.
