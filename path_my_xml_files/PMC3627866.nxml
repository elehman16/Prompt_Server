Although
continuous femoral nerve block is considered the ideal method of analgesia after total knee
arthroplasty,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-tcrm-9-107">1</xref> it may have clinical disadvantages,
including an increased risk of infection and reduced ambulation. The incidence of serious falls
related to continuous femoral nerve block is increased within the four days postoperatively.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-tcrm-9-107">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-tcrm-9-107">3</xref>
Single injection femoral nerve block is easier and less costly to perform than continuous femoral
nerve block. A recent meta-analysis showed that although both single injection and continuous
femoral nerve block were superior to patient-controlled analgesia, the two former methods require
further comparison.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-tcrm-9-107">4</xref></p><p>Given that the degree of neural blockage is proportional to the amount of local anesthetic, the
anesthetic should be injected as close to the nerve as possible. Although femoral nerve block has
been performed using a traditional nerve stimulator, the patellar motor response is not sufficiently
reliable to quantify the degree of stimulation, except by phonomyography.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-tcrm-9-107">5</xref> Electrophysiologically guided suprascapular nerve block has been shown
to be more effective than traditional suprascapular nerve block in relieving shoulder pain in
patients with adhesive capsulitis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-tcrm-9-107">6</xref></p><p>We hypothesized that electrophysiologic guidance would more accurately localize the target nerve
than would a traditional nerve stimulator. We therefore compared the effects on postoperative
analgesia of electrophysiologically guided femoral nerve block with those of femoral nerve block
using a traditional nerve stimulator. To our knowledge, this is the first prospective,
double-blinded, randomized, positive-controlled clinical trial evaluating electrophysiologic
guidance for femoral nerve block in total knee arthroplasty.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>This prospective, randomized, double-blinded, parallel-group, positive-controlled clinical trial
was performed in an inpatient clinic in the department of orthopedic surgery at a general hospital
in Asia from July 2006 to October 2008.</p><p>Patients scheduled for elective classic unilateral total knee arthroplasty were included. We
excluded patients weighing &#x0003c; 50 kg or &#x0003e;100 kg, those with a coagulation or
neurologic disease, those who were hypersensitive to local anesthetics, those not classified as
American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I&#x02013;III, and those unable to
understand the pain scales or use patient-controlled analgesia. Prior to total knee arthroplasty,
patients were randomized 1:1 to the electrophysiologically guided or traditional nerve stimulator
groups using a random assignment generator with sequentially numbered containers (Wichmann-Hill
random number generator, randomization@com). The protocol was approved by our institutional review
board (approval number UUH-06-11), and all patients provided their written informed consent.</p><p>Shortly before the surgery, each patient was aseptically draped, with subsequent topical
anesthesia using 1 mL of 1% lidocaine. Patients were injected with a single dose of
ropivacaine for femoral nerve block according to the landmarks of Winnie et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-tcrm-9-107">7</xref> No sedative was administered.</p><p>The medical equipment (Medelec Synergy, Vickers Medical, Surrey, UK) used comprised three parts,
the first being to stimulate the nerve, the second being to take up the electrical signal, and the
third being to display the signal on the screen as a graph.</p><p>Patients in the electrophysiologically guided group were placed in the supine position, and the
femoral artery was palpated below the inguinal ligament. A 7 mm, 22 gauge, Teflon-coated,
electrically conductive, double-lumen, beveled cannula (Myojet disposable hypodermic needle
electrode, TECA Accessories, New York, NY, USA) was inserted just lateral to the femoral artery and
into the iliopsoas muscle. This cannula enabled both femoral nerve stimulation and injection of
local anesthetic. A recording electrode was placed on the skin above the motor point of the vastus
medialis showing the maximum electrical signal of muscle contraction. The femoral nerve was located
by nerve stimulation at a frequency of 1 Hz, a duration of 0.2 msec, and an intensity of 5 mA, while
monitoring the change in amplitude of the electrical signal. Once the electrical signal was found,
the stimulation intensity was reduced stepwise by moving the cannula back and forth and side to side
until the highest amplitude could be induced by a stimulation intensity &#x0003c; 0.5 mA. After the
aspiration test showed no evidence of blood, 10 mL of 0.375% ropivacaine was injected. To
confirm the correct level of analgesia, we monitored the disappearance of the electrical signal by
stimulation with an intensity of 5 mA shortly after injection and by assessment of the integumentary
sensation in the dermatome of the femoral nerve by pinprick tests (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-tcrm-9-107">Figure 1A and B</xref>).</p><p>Patients in the traditional nerve stimulator group received a single injection femoral nerve
block as described for the electrophysiologically guided group, using the same medical equipment,
nerve stimulation of equal parameters, and downward adjustment of intensity below 0.5 mA, while
monitoring brisk cephalic patellar tilting, a marker for contractions of the quadriceps femoris.
Loss of sensation was determined upon completion of femoral nerve block.</p><p>General anesthesia was induced by injection of alfentanil 15 &#x003bc;g/kg, propofol
2&#x02013;2.5 mg/kg, and rocuronium 0.6&#x02013;0.8 mg/kg, maintained with
40%&#x02013;60% oxygen-nitrous oxide and 1%&#x02013;2% sevoflurane,
and reversed with neostigmine 40 &#x003bc;g/kg and glycopyrrolate 7 &#x003bc;g/kg. Alfentanil 0.25
mg was injected intravenously if mean arterial pressure or heart rate was &#x0003e;125% of
preoperative values.</p><p>Supplemental postoperative analgesia after total knee replacement was standardized.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-tcrm-9-107">8</xref> The morphine dose was half that recorded for
Caucasians, due to the smaller body weight and volume of Asian. Pain was controlled by intravenous
patient-controlled analgesia morphine in 1 mg increments, with a 5-minute lockout time up to a total
limit of 4 mg.</p><p>Pain while at rest and moving was assessed using a visual analog scale (VAS, 0 = no pain,
100 = the worst pain) and postoperative pain score (0 = no pain; 1 =
moderate pain only while moving; 2 = moderate pain while resting or severe pain while
moving; 3 = continuous severe pain)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-tcrm-9-107">9</xref> at
hours 4, 24, 48, and 72 after the end of the surgery. If the VAS pain score exceeded 4 after 4 mg of
morphine, 1 mg increments were allowed until the score was reduced to 4. Each patient was
administered two tablets of acetaminophen 250 mg plus codeine 10 mg one hour after surgery, followed
by one tablet three times per day. The number of intravenous patient-controlled analgesia doses and
the total amount of morphine every 3 days were recorded. Nausea and vomiting were recorded only if
an antiemetic drug was used. Major side effects of ropivacaine, including convulsions and
hypotension, were recorded,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-tcrm-9-107">10</xref> as were urinary
retention needing catheterization or prolonged muscle paralysis.</p><p>Patients in both groups started an identical physiotherapy regimen the day after surgery. All
staff members, including the surgical teams, nurses, assessors, and physiotherapists, were blinded
to patient assignment.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 19.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc, Chicago,
IL, USA). An alpha level &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. The power
value was determined to be 80%, with an assumed dropout rate of 20%. A preliminary
study found a standardized difference of 0.8. Using Lehr&#x02019;s formula, we calculated that 60
patients would be required. Demographic factors were compared using the Chi-square and two-sample
Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic>-tests. Variable &#x000d7; time and variable &#x000d7; group
interactions of the pain scales were evaluated by repeated-measures analysis of variance. Total
amounts of morphine consumed and pain scores were evaluated by two-sample paired
<italic>t</italic>-tests or Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic>-tests.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Of the 97 patients screened, 37 were excluded. Sixty patients were recruited from July 2006 to
September 2008, with 30 assigned to each group. Three patients in the electrophysiologically guided
group were lost to follow-up, one due to no femoral nerve block and two due to poor standardization
of postoperative analgesia, as were five patients in the traditional nerve stimulator group, two due
to no femoral nerve block and three due to poor standardization of postoperative analgesia.
Therefore, our per-protocol analysis included 27 patients in the electrophysiologically guided group
and 25 in the traditional nerve stimulator group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-tcrm-9-107">Figure
2</xref>).</p><p>Pain scores and morphine consumption were assessed in the recovery room and the general ward at
4, 24, 48, and 72 hours after the end of surgery. There were no failures of femoral nerve block,
except for one patient with severe anxiety.</p><p>The two groups were well matched in terms of demographics and preoperative pain scores
(<italic>P</italic> = 0.23&#x02013;0.97, <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-tcrm-9-107">Table

arthroplasty (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01). Postoperative VAS score was significantly lower in
the electrophysiologically guided group than in the traditional nerve stimulator group at 4 hours,
both while at rest (48 &#x000b1; 1.4 versus 59 &#x000b1; 0.8, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01) and
while moving (62 &#x000b1; 1.1 versus 69 &#x000b1; 0.9, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01, <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-tcrm-9-107">Table 2</xref>). However, postoperative pain scores at 4 hours
did not differ significantly.</p><p>Variable &#x000d7; group interactions of VAS score did not differ significantly, indicating that
constant VAS intervals were present at each endpoint in the two groups. Variable &#x000d7; time
interactions of VAS score differed significantly while at rest (F[2.1, 102.9]

= 99.9, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01), showing significant sequential changes within
the groups over time. Within each group, VAS score was significantly lower at 24, 48, and 72 hours
than at baseline, both while at rest and while moving (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01). At all
four time points, ie, 4, 24, 48, and 72 hours after total knee arthroplasty, the mean VAS score was
significantly lower in the electrophysiologically guided group than in the traditional nerve

stimulator femoral nerve block. The major finding of this study was that electrophysiologically
guided preoperative femoral nerve block reduced postoperative pain and morphine consumption more
than did the traditional nerve stimulator.</p><p>Femoral nerve block has been performed by checking contractions of the quadriceps femoris or
brisk patellar tilting induced by a traditional nerve stimulator. However, visual determination of
muscle retraction is not ideal for quantification. Although electrodiagnostic methods have been used
to evaluate neurologic disease, they have not been used previously to assess peripheral nerve
blockade, although a few recent trials have described the use of an electrophysiologic
approach.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-tcrm-9-107">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-tcrm-9-107">12</xref></p><p>Electrodiagnostic studies of motor nerves rely on the magnifying effect. Stimulating one motor
axon can induce activation of many adjacent muscle fibers simultaneously, depending on the
innervation ratio of the target muscle. Amplified electrical impulses are recorded and displayed on
a screen in the form of a graph. Electrodiagnostic methods can assist in determining the maximum
amplitude of electrical signals generated by stimulation with a minimum intensity, enabling
real-time quantification.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-tcrm-9-107">13</xref> Theoretically,
electrophysiologic guidance can be superior to visual assessment in standardization, with more
precise quantification, resulting in better nerve location and more accurate nerve blockage.</p><p>In patients undergoing knee arthroscopy, ultrasound guidance has been reported to reduce the
minimum effective volume of anesthetic required to block the sciatic nerve when compared with a
traditional nerve stimulator.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-tcrm-9-107">14</xref> Continuous femoral
nerve block with ultrasound reduced the volumes of local anesthetics and morphine consumption, as
well as postoperative pain scores, when compared with a traditional nerve stimulator.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-tcrm-9-107">15</xref> Thus, regardless of the type of modality, accurate
localization can enhance the efficacy of nerve blockade.</p><p>The failure rate of femoral nerve block is about 5%,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-tcrm-9-107">16</xref> with one important reason being anatomic variation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-tcrm-9-107">17</xref> For example, anatomic variation in the femoral nerve
have been reported in 35% of patients,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-tcrm-9-107">18</xref>
with variable muscular branches or slips dividing the nerve. None of our patients experienced
failure of femoral nerve block. Electrophysiologic guidance, which displays the shape of electrical
impulses on a screen, has the advantage of finding nerve variations (compound motor action
potential). Given that normal curves are biphasic,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-tcrm-9-107">13</xref> a division of the first peak into two or more peaks would suggest the presence of an
anatomic variation. Thus, electrophysiologic guidance may reduce the failure rate of femoral nerve
block.</p><p>The rate of femoral nerve injury due to puncture or intraneural injection has been reported to be
0.7% in 709 femoral nerve blocks.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-tcrm-9-107">19</xref> None
of our patients experienced femoral neuritis or neuropathy. Conduction block, defined as an
inhibition in the spread of an electrical current resulting in a reduction in amplitude to
80%&#x02013;90%, may be induced if stimulation with an intensity &#x0003e; 1.0 mA is
performed within 2 mm of the epineurium in rat sciatic nerve.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-tcrm-9-107">12</xref> The extraneural threshold for activation ranges from 0.3 to 0.6 mA in
humans, with an intraneural threshold of 0.3 mA.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-tcrm-9-107">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-tcrm-9-107">21</xref> However, there have been no reports
to date on the range of amplitude in which conduction blocks occur in humans. It is difficult to
detect a small reduction (10%&#x02013;20%) in amplitude by observing muscle
contractions or patellar movement. Electrophysiologic guidance can allow quantitative comparison of
amplitude, thus avoiding injury to the nerve. Because eight patients violated the protocol, we
utilized per-protocol analysis rather than intention-to-treat analysis. However, per-protocol
analysis may overestimate results.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-tcrm-9-107">22</xref></p><p>Knee pain can originate from the distribution of obturator or lateral femoral cutaneous
nerves.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-tcrm-9-107">7</xref> Fascia iliaca block
(&#x0201c;3-in-1&#x0201d;) has been developed for complete analgesia, with large volumes
(20&#x02013;60 mL) required. The volume we used (10 mL) may be insufficient for complete blockade of
two nerves. Moreover, injection of sufficient volume may not completely block two nerves.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-tcrm-9-107">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-tcrm-9-107">24</xref>
Because we did not determine whether the obturator or lateral femoral cutaneous nerve was blocked,
the result we observed may not represent the only effect of femoral nerve block. In addition,
sciatica and hip joint disorders may mask the pain of osteoarthritis knee joint, and we did not
exclude patients with comorbidities of the spine and hip.</p><p>The clinical effectiveness of femoral nerve block has been assessed using functional outcomes
such as length of hospital stay and range of motion.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-tcrm-9-107">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-tcrm-9-107">26</xref> However, we did not functionally
evaluate our patients. Although total knee arthroplasty is performed predominantly in female
patients in our country, the gender ratio of our patients may not represent that of patients
undergoing total knee arthroplasty. Another limitation may be poor standardization of other factors
affecting pain induction, such as duration of surgery and amount of opioid or pain killers used
during surgery.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Electrophysiologically guided single injection femoral nerve block can provide better pain relief
than traditional nerve stimulator femoral nerve block in patients undergoing total knee
arthroplasty, as well as reducing the consumption of analgesics, suggesting that the
electrophysiologically guided approach may prove more efficacious in localizing nerves. Except for
its greater cost, the electrophysiologically guided approach may be a good alternative, especially
for physicians experienced in electrodiagnosis.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Authors are grateful to Geum Mi Lee, nurse practitioner, for collection of data and coordination
