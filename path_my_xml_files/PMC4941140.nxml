<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Recruitment was conducted between June 2012 and December 2013. Briefly, infants of gestational age up to 27&#x02005;weeks and 6&#x02005;days, with the possibility to start cerebral NIRS monitoring within 3&#x02005;h after birth, who had written informed consent, were considered eligible for the trial. By means of a central web-based randomisation system infants were allocated to either the experimental group, with the cerebral NIRS monitoring visible, or the control group with the cerebral NIRS monitoring blinded.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Software analysing procedure and study workflow</title><p>In the experimental group the alarm was activated when the area under the curve (AUC) of the rStO<sub>2</sub> out of normal range, defined as rStO<sub>2</sub> between 55% and 85%, had accumulated 0.2%h during the past 10&#x02005;min.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> The units are expressed as %h because the AUC is calculated from time (x-axis) and rStO<sub>2</sub>% (y-axis).</p><p>Software was specifically developed to calculate the alarm. The software received data from the NIRS device and calculated the AUC and generated the alarm. The software also showed trends in rStO<sub>2</sub> and provided a recording system for interventions related to the treatment guideline as well as a dataset (physiological and biochemical variables and ventilator settings). The data were manually entered into this software programme by the clinical staff.</p><p>A dedicated treatment guideline was available to the clinical staff listing possible interventions to normalise an out of range rStO<sub>2</sub>.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> The interventions were focused on respiratory and circulatory support and are described in detail elsewhere.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> The treatment guideline was in accordance with the current national clinical practices. If an alarm prompted a clinical intervention this was reported in the software from a drop down menu listing various interventions. If a different intervention to that listed in the treatment guidelines was implemented, it was documented as &#x02018;Other&#x02019;. If after careful evaluation, the attending staff judged that there was no reason to believe that the infant was compromised, then the decision was &#x02018;No action&#x02019;.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p><p>A dataset was recorded every 6&#x02005;h according to the protocol and included heart rate, peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>), mean arterial blood pressure, mean airway pressure, inspired oxygen fraction, and pH, blood gases, lactate, base excess, haemoglobin and glycaemia if available. These data were also requested at the start of the alarm and 30&#x02005;min later (first review); in case the alarm was not resolved (AUC still above 0.2%h in the last 10&#x02005;min) within the first 30&#x02005;min a second review dataset was also requested 30&#x02005;min after the first review. The bedside software programme displayed the quality of the NIRS values provided by the device; this prevented missing values and false readings that could lead to inappropriate interventions. The various cerebral oximeters used in the study were comparable in terms of absolute value, repeatability and sensitivity to changes in oxygenation on the adult, human forearm.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p><p>Local staff was trained as appropriate to supervise all participants during the intervention. To minimise skin irritation related to the device it was recommended to move the NIRS sensor to a different location at the skull as often as every 4&#x02005;h to avoid damage from heat and/or pressure. Each NIRS sensor reposition was also documented.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Each site downloaded data to the data management centre after completion of the participant's intervention period. Using a Matlab (MathWorks, Natick, Massachusetts, USA) script created for this purpose, NIRS files, event files (decisions and sensor reposition information) and dataset were preprocessed. Data were reviewed manually to check data consistency.</p><p>Sensor reposition that occurred within the 10 min period following a previous sensor site reposition was considered a single event. In addition, NIRS sensor repositioning occurring within the 10 min period that followed an alarm in which the decision taken was &#x02018;No action&#x02019; was analysed separately; this was considered as an intervention that was termed &#x02018;Alarm-prompted reposition&#x02019;. In these cases the alarm apparently was judged to be the consequence of poor sensor&#x02013;skin contact yielding to non-reliable warning. Alarms occurring within the 15 min period following sensor repositioning were discarded.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Statistics</title><p>The data were analysed using the statistical software SAS V.9.2 (Cary, North Carolina, USA). The quantitative data are given as means (SD or 95% CI) or median (IQR) and the qualitative data as counts and percentages. Mixed-model analysis was used to adjust the effect of repeated measures per centre or total population. To avoid the effect of variations in study duration among infants results are expressed as &#x02018;per time unit&#x02019;.</p><p>In addition to rStO<sub>2,</sub> the peripheral SpO<sub>2</sub> was chosen as the physiological variable to evaluate the impact of warnings and eventual clinical decisions on the infants&#x02019; status. The peripheral SpO<sub>2</sub> value was calculated as the averaged mean value entered at the time of the alarm and at 30 and 60&#x02005;min of warning. The rStO<sub>2</sub> value was derived from the averaged mean of all samples obtained during 1&#x02005;min at the time datasets were entered. The unresolved alarm by time according to type of decision taken by clinicians was represented using the Kaplan and Meier method; differences were assessed by means of the log-rank test.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><p>Among the 86 infants included in the SafeBoosC trial in the NIRS experimental group,<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> 67 (78%) had data that fulfilled the requirements for this analysis.

The alarm warned the clinical staff of situations where the brain could be exposed to hypoxia or hyperoxia, and potential clinical interventions were suggested in a treatment guideline<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> to normalise an out of range rStO<sub>2</sub>. However, more than 55% of the warning episodes were not followed by an intervention. Two important aspects need to be considered. First, the infants in the study were monitored by other devices apart from NIRS and only the interventions triggered by NIRS warnings were recorded in the SafeBoosC phase II trial software. Second, the NIRS alarm accumulated the values of rStO<sub>2</sub> obtained over the preceding 10&#x02005;min, while the other monitoring systems did not (real-time reading and immediate alert system). These facts raise two important limitations of the present study. On the one hand, if compromised cerebral perfusion&#x02013;oxygenation was suspected, successful treatment interventions may have been driven by other monitoring devices, such as transcutaneous blood gas monitoring, pulse oximetry or others, and been implemented before the NIRS alarm warned the clinicians (not enough time to accumulate an out of range rStO<sub>2</sub>). On the other hand, if the intervention triggered by other devices was not rapidly effective and the infant's impaired condition was maintained for a longer period, the accumulated out of range rStO<sub>2</sub> would have triggered an alarm; in this case, the clinician eventually might have decided not to take any further action because appropriate action had already been implemented some minutes earlier. This may falsely inflate the &#x02018;No action&#x02019; response. As there is no alternative monitoring system for the continuous assessment of brain oxygenation the possibility to address these issues is limited. We would like to remark that evidence supporting the treatment guideline interventions is relatively low and cannot be recommended outside a research setting.</p><p>The time needed for the alarm to be resolved varied according to the type of the decision taken (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="FETALNEONATAL2015308829F2">figure 2</xref>). Sensor repositioning (&#x02018;Alarm-prompted reposition&#x02019;) returned rStO<sub>2</sub> to normal values (55%&#x02013;85%) within 30min in 80% of alarms and within 100&#x02005;min in all alarms. The percentage of alarms not resolved at 30 and 60&#x02005;min after &#x02018;No action&#x02019; were almost double compared with those in which there was an intervention (&#x02018;Treatment guideline intervention&#x02019;). Yet, despite an intervention, 15% of these were unresolved by 60&#x02005;min. This means that even if the intervention chosen was appropriate, the mechanism involved in improving brain perfusion&#x02013;oxygenation takes more time to be fully resolved. Finally, in some very ill infants, it is likely that cerebral hypoxia has been resistant to all interventions. It is important to note, however, that data collection may have varied both within and between centres. As it was manually entered, some interventions may not have been properly documented. Furthermore, the 30 and 60&#x02005;min points are likely to be insufficient to catch the details of multiple interventions. In the design of the study we chose those to avoid overloading the clinical staff with registration and thereby compromising the primary purpose of the trial.</p><p>To further evaluate the impact of alarms and decisions we analysed the evolution of SpO<sub>2</sub>&#x000a0;and rStO<sub>2</sub> at the time of the alarm and the subsequent reviews according to the type of decision taken by the clinician. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="FETALNEONATAL2015308829F3">figure 3</xref>, when the decision was a &#x02018;Treatment guideline intervention&#x02019; the averaged mean SpO<sub>2</sub>&#x000a0;showed the greatest change, from the lowest mean value at start of warning to a more physiological and stable post-warning average value at first (30&#x02005;min) and second (60&#x02005;min) reviews. Interestingly, when the decision was &#x02018;No action&#x02019;, the averaged mean SpO<sub>2</sub>&#x000a0;did not significantly vary, and remained during the whole intervention period within &#x02018;acceptable&#x02019; clinical ranges. More obviously, repositioning the NIRS sensor did not change SpO<sub>2</sub>. Thus, trends in SpO<sub>2</sub> support the contention that the decisions taken by clinicians were appropriate in most cases. As the average SpO<sub>2</sub>&#x000a0;at the time of the rStO<sub>2</sub> alarm was as low as 85%, it is not a surprise that the most common intervention was to increase FiO<sub>2</sub>. It is more of a surprise that the FiO<sub>2</sub> was not increased before the rStO<sub>2</sub> alarm as most units target SpO<sub>2</sub> at 90%&#x02013;95%.</p><p>We found a negative association between FiO<sub>2</sub> and both rStO<sub>2</sub> and SpO<sub>2</sub>. By stratifying the group into (a) infants in room air, (b) infants on low supplementary oxygen (22%&#x02013;29%) and (c) infants on high oxygen supplementation (&#x0003e;29%), we found that the impact of FiO<sub>2</sub> on rStO<sub>2</sub> and SpO<sub>2</sub> differed. The healthier the infant was (and so, the lower the supplementary oxygen needs) the higher the associated rStO<sub>2</sub> and SpO<sub>2</sub> values were (<xref ref-type="table" rid="FETALNEONATAL2015308829TB3">table 3</xref>). This also supports the notion that other treatment strategies suggested by the treatment guidelines, apart from FiO<sub>2</sub> adjustment, contributed to the return of rStO<sub>2</sub> to normal ranges, particularly in the sickest infants.</p><p>In our experience, the rStO<sub>2</sub> alarm defined in this study protocol was rarely used to initiate treatment of a patent ductus arteriosus or guiding glucose intake. The former is more dependent on the variations in neonatal intensive care unit policies with regards to early echocardiographic assessment in these infants.</p><p>We observed wide differences in sensor repositioning among the participating centres. This difference was not explained by the brand of NIRS device used but possibly by differences in sensor fixation, registration of repositioning or compliance with the standard operating procedure among centres.</p><p>On average four interventions for infants in the experimental group achieved the 58% reduction in the AUC of hyperoxia and hypoxia that we previously reported.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> As previously stated our data collection was not perfect and an in-depth analysis of the complex interaction of cerebral NIRS and the already available monitoring systems is difficult. From the results presented here it seems that cerebral NIRS monitoring did add some information that resulted in additional interventions. This was expected. Treatment was not changed in 75% of alarms. This may seem high, but it would on the other hand be surprising if out of range NIRS always resulted in interventions in such complex clinical scenarios as presented by this study population. Whether the NIRS monitoring also hindered some interventions is uncertain. Finally, we observed heterogeneity in the number of alarms between centres. We speculate this could be due to differences in clinical staff training on NIRS monitoring among the study participants<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> and in the severity of infant conditions. The patient-relevant clinical benefit of this complex intervention remains to be determined.</p><p>The absolute values provided by cerebral NIRS have shown poor repeatability and differences between the varied devices.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> To deal with this, systematic pretrial testing was conducted using several NIRS instruments.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Only two NIRS devices were used in this study reducing heterogeneity. We have to depend on the absolute values of cerebral tissue oxygenation and on absolute thresholds for intervention.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This post hoc analysis of the alarm episodes and their subsequent management in the experimental group of the SafeBoosC II randomised clinical trial revealed that three quarters of all alarms triggered were not followed by an active intervention at the bedside, suggesting that the treating clinician was content with the infant's overall status despite a cerebral oxygen outside of the monitoring range. However, 25% of the alarms triggered a treatment guideline intervention, averaging four interventions per infant, supporting the strength of this non-invasive monitoring system. Limitations of the study design, however, restrict the generalisability of the results. For a large-scale trial of monitoring of cerebral oxygenation with patient-relevant outcomes study staff must be adequately trained in the application of NIRS and the pathophysiological basis for the choice of intervention.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>All authors critically reviewed the revised versions of the paper and approved the final draft for submission.
