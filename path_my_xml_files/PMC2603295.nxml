G6PD allows regeneration of NADPH, which is essential for glutathione recycling and protection against oxidative damage. G6PD deficiency is the most common inherited human enzyme defect, present in more than 400 million people worldwide. The gene encoding G6PD is located on the X chromosome; G6PD-deficient hemizygous males and homozygous females are vulnerable to oxidant haemolysis, whereas heterozygous females have variable (milder) deficiency determined by the degree of X-chromosomal inactivation.</p><p>There are numerous polymorphisms of the G6PD gene. Approximately 200 variant alleles have been described and 140 mutations, or combination of mutations, have been identified <xref rid="pone.0004031-Beutler1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. The high prevalence of G6PD deficiency in the tropics and Mediterranean areas is attributed to a protective effect against clinical <italic>P. falciparum</italic> malaria <xref rid="pone.0004031-Tishkoff1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004031-Ruwende1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Despite extensive heterogeneity, a single molecular variant, G6PD A- predominates in sub-Saharan Africa where it affects 15 to 20&#x00025; of the African population, although there are marked differences between regions within the continent <xref rid="pone.0004031-Beutler2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. The A- variant differs from the normal G6PD B allele by two missense mutations, an A to G transition at position 376, encoding the so called &#x0201c;B&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;A&#x0201d; change (Asn126Asp), and a G to A transition at position 202, encoding the &#x0201c;A-&#x0201d; change (Val68Met). This additional mutation differentiates the &#x0201c;A-&#x0201d; allele with 12&#x00025; enzymatic activity, from the &#x0201c;A&#x0201d; allele with 85&#x00025; activity <xref rid="pone.0004031-Battistuzzi1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p><p>Acute haemolytic anaemia is the most frequent clinical manifestation associated with G6PD deficiency. This can be precipitated by foods or drugs with oxidant properties. The degree of drug-induced G6PD deficiency related haemolysis depends on a number of factors including the G6PD variant, the drug and dosage, and poorly characterised disease factors. Sulphonamides and sulphones are still widely used in tropical countries, and may cause haemolysis in patients with G6PD deficiency. Dapsone is used as a treatment of leprosy, some skin conditions, and more recently <italic>Pneumocystic carinii</italic> pneumonia <xref rid="pone.0004031-Wolf1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. It is used in combination with pyrimethamine, proguanil and chlorproguanil for malaria prophylaxis and malaria treatment. The most frequent adverse effects of dapsone are haematological. These include methaemoglobinaemia, haemolysis and anaemia, and less commonly agranulocytosis and idiosyncratic reactions (known as dapsone hypersensitivity syndrome). Patients with genetic deficiencies of enzymes involved in oxidant defences, such as G6PD or glutathione reductase, are more susceptible to haemolysis <xref rid="pone.0004031-Wolf1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004031-Brabin1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p><p>In 2005&#x02013;2006 an open label, randomised clinical trial was carried out in Rwanda to evaluate the safety and efficacy of artesunate&#x0002b;chlorproguanil-dapsone and amodiaquine&#x0002b;sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine for the treatment of uncomplicated <italic>P. falciparum</italic> malaria in children <xref rid="pone.0004031-Fanello1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>.</p><p>We evaluated the safety profiles of these two antimalarial treatments according to G6PD deficiency.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design</title><p>The drug trial has been described in detail elsewhere <xref rid="pone.0004031-Fanello1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Briefly, we tested efficacy and safety of chlorproguanil-dapsone co-administered with artesunate (CD&#x0002b;A), compared to amodiaquine combined with sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (AQ&#x0002b;SP), for the treatment of uncomplicated <italic>P. falciparum</italic> malaria in Rwanda. The trial was open label; 800 patients, aged 6&#x02013;59 months, with uncomplicated malaria were randomised to receive AQ&#x0002b;SP (400) or CD&#x0002b;A (400). Patients were hospitalized for 4 days, so that appropriate management, including blood transfusion, could be performed and followed&#x02013;up weekly until day 28 after treatment. Clinical and parasitological outcomes were recorded according to WHO guidelines <xref rid="pone.0004031-WHO1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.

In this study, conducted in a high transmission area, the haematocrit fell during acute malaria. This initial reduction was independent of the treatment received. Malaria causes anaemia through haemolysis of parasitized erythrocytes, accelerated clearance of uninfected erythrocytes, impaired compensation for this loss by bone marrow dyserythropoeisis and haemolysis due to oxidative stress <xref rid="pone.0004031-White1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Haemolysis may be exacerbated by some antimalarial drug treatment. In the present study, G6PD hemizygous and homozygous Rwandan children with uncomplicated <italic>P. falciparum</italic> malaria treated with CD&#x0002b;A experienced an estimated decline in haematocrit of nearly 2&#x00025; per day (equivalent to about 0.7 g/dL) compared with 1&#x00025; per day in patients who received AQ&#x0002b;SP, regardless of G6PD status.</p><p>The significantly steeper decline in haematocrit in G6PD-deficient children treated with CD&#x0002b;A is most likely to have resulted from the use of sulphone dapsone and its metabolite hydroxylamine. Artesunate may cause a temporary suppression of reticulocytosis which does not translate into anaemia, but would not explain the differential effect in G6PD-deficient subjects. Wootton et al., <xref rid="pone.0004031-Wootton1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> tested CD alone or in combination with different doses of artesunate. Although the study was not powered to conduct a formal comparison of safety between treatments, the safety profile of CD, including the haematological effects, did not appear to be influenced by the artesunate dose. General use of dapsone is limited because of adverse haematological reactions, particularly in subjects with G6PD deficiency. The life span of erythrocytes is reduced when the drug is taken, to a degree related to the dose and length of exposure and is more evident in persons with G6PD deficiency <xref rid="pone.0004031-Wolf1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004031-Brabin1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004031-Degowin1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004031-Taylor1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Although haematological toxicity is normally dose-dependent, even at low daily dosage can cause serious adverse events. For the treatment of leprosy dapsone has been used at 1&#x02013;2 mg/kg per day in children, but there is limited experience (or not documented) in children under five and in leprosy patients with G6PD deficiency. In our study 2.3&#x02013;4.7 mg/kg CD once daily for 3 days was associated with increased haemolysis and a greater risk of transfusion in children with G6PD deficiency.</p><p>By the end of the 28 day follow-up the haematocrit of most patients, with or without G6PD deficiency, recovered to normal levels. Drug induced haemolysis is self-limiting in individuals with G6PD deficiency because only older red cells are destroyed during drug challenge as these are the cells which are most enzyme deficient, whereas newly produced erythrocytes have nearly normal levels of G6PD which enables them to resist drug-induced destruction <xref rid="pone.0004031-Brabin1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p><p>In total, 10 patients had severe post-treatment haemolysis requiring blood transfusion and the risk of receiving a blood transfusion was higher in subjects with G6PD deficiency recipients of CD&#x0002b;A.</p><p>In this trial we recruited children with a PCV&#x02265;21&#x00025;; we hospitalized and carefully monitored them for the whole administration of the drug, transfusing blood when necessary. Under normal conditions these children would have received the treatment at the health centre or the drug would have been self-administered at home with the consequent risk of life threatening haemolysis.</p><p>In heterozygous females, the degree of deficiency is determined by the outcome of X-chromosomal inactivation and on average they have less severe clinical manifestations, although some develop severe acute haemolytic anaemia. In fact one heterozygous subject in this trial needed a blood transfusion.</p><p>In 2002, a randomised clinical trial in Kenya <xref rid="pone.0004031-Sulo1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> found that the degree of haemoglobin decline between days 0 and 7 was greater in children treated with CD than with SP; 6.9&#x00025; (13/188) of children receiving CD developed severe anaemia (haemoglobin levels of 5 g/dL or less) and exited the trial compared with 1.5&#x00025; (3/195) of children receiving SP. However no further analyses were performed on the G6PD deficiency status of the children.</p><p>In 2004, results of a randomised multicentre trial in Africa <xref rid="pone.0004031-WHO2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004031-Alloueche1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> showed that patients with G6PD deficiency were at greater risk for anaemia after CD treatment (OR&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;2.5; p&#x0003c;0.001) than after SP (OR&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.9; p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.94), whereas there were no differences between patients without G6PD deficiency who were recipients of CD or SP (OR&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.9; p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.62) . The risk for having a &#x0003e;4 g/dl drop in haemoglobin concentration was at least doubled in patients with G6PD deficiency after CD treatment (OR&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;3.2; p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.02).</p><p>More recently, preliminary results of a multi-centre, double-blind Phase III trial of CD co-formulated with artesunate vs. artemether-lumefantrine <xref rid="pone.0004031-WHO3" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, showed a significant reduction in haemoglobin due to haemolytic anaemia in patients with G6PD deficiency, with lowest levels of haemoglobin occurring seven days after treatment. Fifteen patients, all in the CDA group and 13 of whom with G6PD, had severe post-treatment haemolysis requiring blood transfusion in the study.</p><p>The prevalence of G6PD deficiency in African populations varies from 28.1&#x00025; in southwest Nigeria to 22.5&#x00025; in Congo, 15.7&#x00025; in Mali, 13.0&#x00025; in Uganda and 9.0&#x02013;15.5&#x00025; in Gabon <xref rid="pone.0004031-Beutler2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. In our study population the allele frequency of the G6PD was about 10&#x00025; in boys and 8&#x00025; in girls. In a previous study conducted in Rwanda <xref rid="pone.0004031-Munyanganizi1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> screening for G6PD deficiency using cord blood samples showed a phenotypic frequency of 3.8&#x00025;.</p><p>Pro-oxidant drugs, including antimalarial drugs associated with haemolysis in G6PD-deficient individuals are used commonly in malaria endemic areas. Screening for G6PD deficiency before drug administration of potentially pro-oxidants drugs although seldom available, is necessary.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Chlorproguanil-dapsone&#x0002b;artesunate in Rwanda had a poor safety profile in G6PD deficient individuals most likely as a result of dapsone induced haemolysis. This drug combination has also been previously reported to have poor efficacy (70&#x00025; Adequate Clinical and Parasitological Response at day 28 PCR corrected <xref rid="pone.0004031-Fanello1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>). CD is a fixed-dose combination produced by GlaxoSmithKline under the brand name of Lapdap&#x02122;. The co-formulated combination with artesunate, Lapdap-plus&#x02122;, was under development, but because it was associated with an increased risk of anaemia GSK has stopped the further development of the combination therapy and commenced a product recall process at pharmacy level in Kenya for Lapdap&#x02122; the only market with recent sales of the product <xref rid="pone.0004031-httpwww.gsk.com1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors are grateful to the patients and staff at the sentinel sites for their contribution to this study.
