This study compared the pharmacokinetic (PK), pharmacodynamic (PD), and tolerability profiles of cilnidipine and valsartan, both alone and in combination, in healthy male subjects.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and methods</title><p>Fifty-four subjects, enrolled into an open-label, single-dose, three-treatment, three-period crossover study, randomly received cilnidipine (10 mg), valsartan (160 mg), or both according to one of six sequences. Blood samples were collected at baseline and up to 24 hours after drug administration in each period. Plasma concentrations of cilnidipine and valsartan were determined by liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry. Maximum plasma concentration (C<sub>max</sub>) and area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to the last measurable time (AUC<sub>last</sub>) were estimated using a noncompartmental method. Tolerability was evaluated by assessing adverse events (AEs), vital signs, electrocardiograms, and clinical laboratory tests. Blood pressure was also measured for PD assessment.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 51 subjects completed the study. The PK profile of cilnidipine was not significantly affected by coadministered valsartan; the geometric mean ratio and 90% confidence interval (90% CI) of AUC<sub>last</sub> for cilnidipine with and without valsartan was 1.04 (0.98&#x02013;1.10). Likewise, cilnidipine did not affect the PK of valsartan; the geometric mean ratio (90% CI) of AUC<sub>last</sub> for valsartan with and without cilnidipine was 0.94 (0.83&#x02013;1.07). Coadministration of cilnidipine and valsartan reduced blood pressure in an additive way. No serious AEs were reported, and both cilnidipine and valsartan were well tolerated.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Coadministered cilnidipine and valsartan do not cause a significant PK or PD interaction, and they are well tolerated.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keyword</title><kwd>antihypertensive drugs</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Hypertension requires strict blood pressure control to lower the risk for cardiovascular disease or kidney failure.<xref rid="b1-dddt-8-1781" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> The combination of two or more antihypertensive agents having different mechanisms can reliably reduce blood pressure.<xref rid="b2-dddt-8-1781" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Combination therapy also minimizes the risk for adverse effects, prevents major cardiovascular diseases and end-organ damage, and increases drug compliance.<xref rid="b3-dddt-8-1781" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b4-dddt-8-1781" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> For example, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) and calcium channel blockers (CCBs) have been widely coadministered to treat hypertension when ARB or CCB alone was insufficient in lowering blood pressure.<xref rid="b2-dddt-8-1781" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="b5-dddt-8-1781" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b6-dddt-8-1781" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p><p>Cilnidipine is a dihydropyridine CCB that acts on the L-type calcium channel of blood vessels by blocking incoming calcium and suppressing the contraction of blood vessels, thereby reducing blood pressure.<xref rid="b7-dddt-8-1781" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Cilnidipine also works on the N-type calcium channel located at the end of the sympathetic nerve, inhibiting the emission of norepinephrine and suppressing the increase in stress blood pressure.<xref rid="b7-dddt-8-1781" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="b8-dddt-8-1781" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Once-daily administration of cilnidipine has been shown to decrease blood pressure safely and effectively, without excessive blood pressure reduction or tachycardia.<xref rid="b9-dddt-8-1781" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p><p>Valsartan is one of the most widely used ARBs. Valsartan lowers blood pressure by antagonizing the renin&#x02013;angiotensin&#x02013;aldosterone system, selectively competing with the angiotensin II receptor subtype (AT1) and preventing the angiotensin II-mediated increase in blood pressure. Valsartan can lower blood pressure for 24 consecutive hours,<xref rid="b10-dddt-8-1781" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> which renders once-daily administration of valsartan effective for the treatment of hypertension.<xref rid="b10-dddt-8-1781" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="b11-dddt-8-1781" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p><p>Any combination therapy must be evaluated to ensure that it does not exhibit clinically significant drug&#x02013;drug interactions, which may decrease drug efficacy and/or increase the risk of adverse events.

Because a fixed dose combination drug of cilnidipine and valsartan has been under development by Ildong Pharmaceuticals, Ltd, Seoul, Korea, the first step was to conduct an in vivo drug&#x02013;drug interaction study. Based on this understanding, the objective of the present study (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> registry number: NCT01838967) was to evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK), pharmacodynamic (PD), and tolerability profiles of cilnidipine (Cinalong<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>; Boryung Co, Ltd, Seoul, Korea) and valsartan (Diovan<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>; Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corp, Basel, Switzerland) when administered alone or in combination.

The lower limit of quantitation for cilnidipine and valsartan was 0.1 and 20 ng/mL, respectively.

Thirteen AEs were considered &#x0201c;possibly related&#x0201d; to the study drug, including dizziness (n=4), nausea (n=2), headache or head discomfort (n=3), and one case each of diarrhea, cold sweat, somnolence, and increased tendency to bruise (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-dddt-8-1781">Table 2</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study shows that cilnidipine and valsartan do not exert a significant PK drug interaction when coadministered in healthy male subjects. The evidence is that the point estimates of the GMR with and without the coadministered drug for the PK parameters, including C<sub>max</sub>, AUC<sub>last</sub>, and AUC<sub>inf</sub>, were close to 1, and all of their 90% confidence intervals fell entirely within the conventional bioequivalence range of 0.8&#x02013;1.25 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-dddt-8-1781">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-dddt-8-1781">Figure 2</xref>). Moreover, coadministration of cilnidipine and valsartan reduced blood pressure in an additive way, confirming that neither adversely affected the other&#x02019;s blood pressure-lowering effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-dddt-8-1781">Figure 3</xref>). In addition, cilnidipine and valsartan, both alone and in combination, were well tolerated, despite that they were administered at relatively high doses (10 mg and 160 mg for cilnidipine and valsartan, respectively). To support this notion, no serious AE occurred, and all of the AEs considered related to the study drugs, including head discomfort, dizziness, headache, and somnolence, are well described with the use of cilnidipine and valsartan.<xref rid="b11-dddt-8-1781" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="b13-dddt-8-1781" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="b14-dddt-8-1781" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p><p>Our study results are consistent with the findings of in vitro studies that identified different elimination pathways for cilnidipine and valsartan,<xref rid="b15-dddt-8-1781" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="b16-dddt-8-1781" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> thereby decreasing the likelihood of PK drug interaction between them. Cilnidipine is primarily metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP3A4), and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19.<xref rid="b15-dddt-8-1781" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> However, approximately 80% of valsartan is excreted as unchanged parent drug, with the remaining drug being primarily metabolized by CYP2C19.<xref rid="b15-dddt-8-1781" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> In addition, organic anion transporter-mediated excretion of valsartan through the bile was recently reported,<xref rid="b16-dddt-8-1781" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> but such a mechanism has never been reported for dihydropyridine compounds such as cilnidipine.</p><p>In all of the treatment groups, a maximal blood pressure-lowering effect was seen around 4&#x02013;6 hours postdose, whereas the t<sub>max</sub> was observed much earlier, ie, 2&#x02013;2.5 hours for cilnidipine and 3&#x02013;4 hours for valsartan (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-dddt-8-1781">Table 1</xref>).

Generally, a highest tolerated dose is recommended to be used in the drug&#x02013;drug interaction study, such that the potential for drug&#x02013;drug interaction is maximized. In this study, however, the second highest doses for cilnidipine (10 mg) and valsartan (160 mg) were evaluated instead, although the label allows up to 20 mg, for cilnidipine,<xref rid="b21-dddt-8-1781" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> and 320 mg, for valsartan.<xref rid="b22-dddt-8-1781" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> This was because those doses are prescribed more frequently in a clinical setting than the highest doses. Another limitation was that there was no placebo group in this study. Therefore, the blood pressure-lowering effects found in the present study were not placebo-adjusted. Finally, the maximum blood pressure-lowering effects of ARBs and CCBs have been reported to occur at 4&#x02013;8 weeks after the start of treatment.<xref rid="b23-dddt-8-1781" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="b24-dddt-8-1781" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Thus, future studies are warranted, where cilnidipine and valsartan are repeatedly administered and compared with placebo, maybe in patients with hypertension, to confirm the findings of the present study.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, coadministration of cilnidipine and valsartan does not cause a significant PK drug interaction in healthy male subjects and does not adversely affect their blood pressure-lowering effects. Coadministered cilnidipine and valsartan are well tolerated. Future studies, employing multiple administrations in hypertensive patients, are warranted to confirm these results.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This study was supported by a research grant from Ildong Pharmaceuticals, Ltd, Seoul, Korea.
