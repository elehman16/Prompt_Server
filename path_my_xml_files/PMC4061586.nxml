It has been estimated that they can occur at any age and can affect both men and women.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] The natural evolution of hemorrhoids is benign in nature, but they tend to get worse over time, and therefore they should be treated as soon as it occurs. The term hemorrhoids (or piles) is used to describe the enlargement of the venous tissues of the anal region, which becomes inflamed or prolapsed.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>The anal canal consists of three fibrovascular cushions that are supported within the anal canal by a connective tissue framework, which is important in providing a watertight seal to the anus. Hemorrhoids result from the hypertrophy of the hemorrhoidal plexus and pathological changes in the anal cushions.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] The degenerative effects of aging and regular straining during bowel movements may weaken the supporting tissues, producing a shearing force on the cushions, causing their descent and prolapse. The prolapsed cushions impair venous return, resulting in engorgement that may be further exacerbated by chronic straining during defecation, inadequate fiber intake, and conditions such as pregnancy, that raise intraabdominal pressure. Bleeding from the engorged prolapsed hemorrhoid occurs as a result of localized mucosal trauma or inflammation, which damages the underlying blood vessels. The anal cushions of patients with hemorrhoids show significant pathological changes like abnormal venous dilatation, vascular thrombosis, degenerative process in the collagen fibers and fibroelastic tissues, distortion and rupture of the anal subepithelial muscle.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] The symptoms associated with hemorrhoids include rectal bleeding, perianal pain, discomfort, mucous discharge, perianal itching, and irritation.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>Hemorrhoids are generally classified according to their position relative to the dentate line. External hemorrhoids originate below this line and become symptomatic only when thrombosed. Internal hemorrhoids arise above the dentate line and are marked by bleeding and protrusion.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] They can be further graded according to the degree of prolapse.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Internal hemorrhoids that bleed but do not prolapse are designated as Grade I hemorrhoids; those that prolapse and reduce spontaneously (with or without bleeding) are second grade hemorrhoids; prolapsed hemorrhoids requiring manual reduction are Grade III hemorrhoids; and prolapsed hemorrhoids that cannot be reduced are Grade IV hemorrhoids.</p><p>Treatment options vary based on the degree and severity of symptoms. Management of hemorrhoids may be medical (prescribing high fiber diet, antimotility agents, topical analgesics and corticosteroid creams for symptomatic relief, alternative/traditional medicine like oral flavonoids), nonoperative (sclerotherapy, cryotherapy, rubber band ligation, infrared photocoagulation, etc.) or surgical (open, closed, or stapled hemorrhoidectomy). In many countries, 70-80% of the population use traditional medicine for primary health care. As per World Health Organization (WHO), 80% of about 4000 million inhabitants on this planet rely on plant medicines.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Traditional healthcare systems are known to have different treatment regimens for management of hemorrhoids. Ayurveda is one of the traditional health care systems prevalent and practiced widely in India and other countries. Indian Regulations permit use of traditional medicine under proprietary ayurvedic medicine licenses. The preparations are approved by the state regulatory bodies and marketed. Several qualified ayurvedic physicians (~<italic>Vaidyas</italic>) practice traditional methods and use traditional medications for management of hemorrhoids. There are over half a million ayurvedic practitioners and over 800,000 registered traditional medicine practitioners in India.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>Proanthocyanidins, present in various plant parts, comprising of catechins and epicatechins, have been reported with free radical scavenging, antioxidant,[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] antiinflammatory, antiallergic, and vasodilatory activity.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Proanthocyanidins have been shown to inhibit the enzymes hyaluronidase, elastase, and collagenase, which degrade connective tissue structures leading to increased vascular permeability.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Moreover low compliance associated with treatments such as diet and lifestyle changes, hydrotherapy and mechanical compression therapy, renders oral therapy as an attractive option.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Several studies have assessed the use of oral micronized, purified flavonoid fraction (MPFF) (Daflon<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> 500 mg),[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and is one of the most commonly used treatment option for Grade 1 and Grade II hemorrhoids.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</p><p>On the basis of above considerations and probable mechanisms of action, we planned to use a marketed herbal preparation, Roidosanal<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (as capsules; standardized to contain not less than 7% of total catechins and epicatechins). Both the above products possess similar active chemical entities (flavonoids) and therefore assumed to have a similar mechanism of action. We conducted a pilot scale, open-labeled, multicentre study to determine the safety of Roidosanal<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> capsules, and to compare its efficacy against Daflon<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> 500 mg, in patients with hemorrhoids.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study design</title><p>This study was a multicentric, randomized, open labeled study conducted at three centers, namely, Mohinder Hospital, Batra Hospital and Research Center, and South End Clinic, in New Delhi from January 2009 to June 2010.

All patients had given signed informed consent before examination. Any patient presenting with anal fissures along with hemorrhoids was also recruited. Patients diagnosed with bleeding hemorrhoids and having no other abnormal vital signs and symptoms were included in the study. Pregnant and lactating women, alcoholics, and patients currently using other antihemorrhoidal drugs or planning to undergo any surgical procedure for hemorrhoids were excluded from the study.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Intervention</title><p>The test product consisted of a processed herbal preparation, Roidosanal<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (By Next Gen Pharma India Pvt. Ltd.) and it was compared with Daflon<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> 500 mg (By Serdia Pharmaceuticals (India) Pvt. Ltd.). Roidosanal<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> is a processed preparation from a mixture of four herbs, that is, gum-resin from <italic>Commiphora molmol</italic> (50%), gum-resin from <italic>Gardenia</italic> spp. (16.6%) and inflorescence from <italic>Tagates erecta</italic> (16.7%), and <italic>Mesua ferrea</italic> (16.7%). It is formulated as capsules and standardized to contain not less than 7% of total catechins and epicatechins. The control preparation, Daflon<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> 500 mg contains micronized purified flavonoid extracts of rutaceae 500 mg, equivalent to 450 mg of diosmin, and 50 mg of hesperidine per tablet. Daflon<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> 500 mg is marketed in India for treatment of venous diseases, namely, chronic organic and functional venous deficiency of lower limbs, varicose veins, sequelae of phlebitis, hemorrhoids, etc.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Test product and comparator for the study were supplied by the sponsor. Patients were randomized at the initial consultation visit to receive either of the two treatments, Roidosanal<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Caps (2 caps twice daily; Gr R) or Daflon<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> 500 mg Tabs (2 tablets daily; as per the recommended dosage in package insert of the product; Gr D), for 15 days. Compliance was ensured by project staff through regular phone calls and pill count at the end of treatment regimen. Patients were advised to restrict the amount of salt and spices in food. No laxatives or use of any other antihemorrhoidal drugs were allowed during the trial period.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Adverse events</title><p>All observed and reported adverse events regardless of treatment group or suspected causal relationship were recorded on the adverse events page of the case report proforma.

This involved signed informed consent and enrolment of patients as per the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Demographics and medical history including previous history of hemorrhoids or any other chronic diseases was assessed. Proctologic examination was performed to assess the hemorrhoidal conditions, and then the patients were randomized. The investigational products were given to all patients for 15 days with instructions for administration. Each patient's condition was assessed telephonically on the 8<sup>th</sup> day. On visit 2 (day 16) proctological examination was conducted again and it marked the end of treatment. However, the patients were followed-up, with visit 3 being the last visit, at the end of day 45. Tolerability of the interventions was evaluated subjectively by the investigator. Details of assessments done at each visit are explained below.</p><p>Proctoscopy was performed at baseline and end of treatment (16<sup>th</sup> day) by the same proctoscopy surgeon. Proctologic assessment was performed in the left-lateral position by inspection of the anal verge of the anal canal by using a proctoscope.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] Parameters namely, grade (I, II, III, IV) and position of hemorrhoids (at one site, two sites or all three primary sites, i.e., 3&#x02019;O clock, 7&#x02019;O clock, 11&#x02019;O clock position) were assessed. Hemoglobin and fecal occult blood tests were performed at baseline, 16<sup>th</sup>, and 45<sup>th</sup> day. Parameters namely, bleeding, itching, soiling, tenesmus, constipation, irritation after defecation per rectum were assessed qualitatively as Yes/No and frequency was measured quantitatively as none/week, 1-2 times/week or more than 2 times/week, at baseline, 8<sup>th</sup>, 16<sup>th</sup>, and 45<sup>th</sup> day of study. Anal pain was also recorded at the same time points using a linear visual analogue pain score (VAS) (range 0-10, 0 = no pain and 10 = the worst possible pain). However, the VAS score was regrouped as 1-3 = mild pain, 4-6 = moderate, and 7-10 = severe pain.[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="sec2-7"><title>Endpoints</title><p>The primary end points included change in &#x0201c;Grade&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Position&#x0201d; of hemorrhoids, as measured using a proctoscope.

Intragroup analysis demonstrated that patients in both groups were relieved of the irritation after defecation symptom on Days 8, 16, and 45 in a significant manner as compared with baseline [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>].</p><p>Constipation</p><p>Patients with history of constipation in Gr R were relieved significantly on 8<sup>th</sup> (<italic>P</italic> = 0.001), 16<sup>th</sup> (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.004), and 45<sup>th</sup> Day (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.025) as compared with baseline. Patients in Gr D showed significant relief only on the 8<sup>th</sup> day (<italic>P</italic> = 0.042; <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). The relief with Roidosanal<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> was prompt, achieved within 8 days of treatment, and sustained till the end of treatment and follow-up visit.</p><p>Diarrhea</p><p>Two (5.4%) patients in Gr R and 1 (2.8%) patient in Gr D complained of diarrheal symptoms at baseline (<italic>P</italic> = 0.999). Diarrheal symptoms improved in two patients (one in Gr R and one in Gr D) after treatment.</p><p>Hemoglobin level</p><p>Mean hemoglobin level at baseline was found to be 12.52 and 12.54 g/dl in Gr R and Gr D, respectively. Hemoglobin levels slightly improved after treatment (12.69 g/dl in Gr R and 12.70 g/dl in Gr D); however, the change between the groups or within group was not significant.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec1-4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Though there is anecdotal evidence demonstrating the use of herbal medicines containing bioflavonoids in ano-rectal diseases, scientific studies in this field are grossly inadequate. Herbal products are attracting attention in developed countries too, as an alternative to high cost modern drugs and associated side effects.</p><p>A comparative, open label trial in different grades of hemorrhoids, confirmed by proctoscopy was conducted in a total of 73 patients at three centers in urban and semi-urban areas catering to varied population of socioeconomic status and educational levels. The selected patients were randomly allocated to two groups, namely, a group taking processed herbal preparation (Roidosanal<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) or a popularly prescribed preparation (Daflon<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> 500 mg) available in Indian market. The characteristic signs and symptoms of hemorrhoids were scored for both groups at baseline, 8<sup>th</sup>, 16<sup>th</sup>, and on 45<sup>th</sup> day of treatment.</p><p>Therapeutic objectives in treatment of piles include shrinkage of piles mass, subsiding inflammation and preventing infection in the anal region, preventing bleeding from the rectum, relieving itching in the anal region, and relieving constipation as well. Of all the above, reduction in inflammation, bleeding, and pain bring immediate relief to the patient, and is of considerable importance to the treating physician. The study results showed that the Roidosanal<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> was effective in ameliorating ano-rectal conditions and associated signs and symptoms of hemorrhoids. The current study, although with a limited sample size was able to demonstrate the superior efficacy of Roidosanal<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> over Daflon<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> 500 mg, in improving the ano-rectal symptoms in patients, particularly with Grade III hemorrhoids. Prompt resolution of bleeding symptom on the 8<sup>th</sup> day was also observed with Roidosanal<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>. Treatment with either therapies demonstrated a significant response in Grade I and Grade II hemorrhoids, bleeding, pain, anal itching, soiling, and constipation. The study also demonstrates the importance of traditional medicine in the normal routine of a patient with hemorrhoids unless there is an absolute need for surgical intervention.</p><p>Limitations of the study included a pilot design (no sample size calculation), open label design, and no central laboratory for biochemistry tests or proctoscopy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Roidosanal<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> was found to be equally effective as Daflon<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> 500 mg in improving ano-rectal conditions and associated signs and symptoms of hemorrhoids. There were no major adverse events associated with the use of either product. Treatment of patients with Grade I to Grade III hemorrhoids with preparations like Roidosanal<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> or Daflon<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> 500 mg would be beneficial and can be looked for. Further large and double-blind trials with proper statistical methods need to be conducted to confirm the results.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>The authors express their gratitude to Next Gen Pharma India (New Delhi) for the financial support and for providing the study medications used in the study.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Financial support for patient-related procedures and examinations and study medications received from M/s Next Gen Pharma India Pvt.
