Based on meta-analyses of exercise and diet studies, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) recommend that lifestyle interventions should be initiated as the first step in treating new-onset type 2 DM.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Over the past 3&#x02005;years, The Look Ahead research group, the Lifestyle Over and Above Drugs in Diabetes (LOADD) and Early ACTivity in Diabetes (Early ACTID) randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have shown that dietary interventions which target weight reduction are beneficial and improve glycaemic control.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2&#x02013;</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> These trials achieved reductions in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) comparable to reductions demonstrated in patients starting metformin or a gliptin as monotherapies,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> and although the Look Ahead trial showed no reduction in cardiovascular events after 9.6&#x02005;years, participants in the intervention arm were less likely to be treated with insulin.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p><p>It has been reported that changes to the macronutrient composition of the diet may impact on glycaemic control, blood lipids and weight,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> but the effects of specific dietary changes on these metabolic outcomes are still unclear and no single &#x02018;diet for diabetes&#x02019; has been identified.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> In recognition of this, the 2012 ADA and EASD joint guidelines and 2011 Diabetes UK nutritional guidelines emphasise the importance of an individualised, patient-centred approach to diet rather than a prescriptive approach.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> This approach recognises that different people have individual dietary habits and may find certain dietary changes more straightforward than others. There is evidence that men and women living in the UK have differing dietary patterns.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Men have been reported to drink more alcohol and consume more meat but less fruit and diet soft drinks than women<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Few studies have looked at what changes are made to macronutrients in response to non-prescriptive dietary advice, whether men and women make different changes and whether these changes impact on metabolic control.</p><p>The Early ACTID trial included a non-prescriptive, patient-centred dietary intervention. The trial aimed to assess whether adding physical activity to a dietary intervention produced greater benefit than diet alone or usual care in individuals newly diagnosed with type 2 DM.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Participants who received the lifestyle interventions had better HbA1c, lower body weight, less insulin resistance and were on less medication than the control group at 6 and 12&#x02005;months. During the intervention, participants in this cohort reported small changes to higher calorie, low-fibre foods. Examination of the specific changes to foods and food groups reported by participants has been previously published<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> and this current paper focuses on macronutrients.</p><p>The aim of this paper is to describe baseline energy and macronutrient intakes of men and women who were enrolled into the dietary intervention in the Early ACTID study and to examine reported dietary changes made after 6&#x02005;months.</p><p>We conducted exploratory analysis to examine the following hypotheses:

Early ACTID was a diet and physical activity trial involving patients living in the south west of England who were recruited within 5&#x02013;8&#x02005;months of a diagnosis of type 2 DM from December 2005 to September 2008. Full trial procedures with the CONSORT diagram and results are described elsewhere.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>

For the first 6&#x02005;months, the intervention aimed to promote dietary change. At randomisation, patients attended a 1&#x02005;h appointment with a study dietitian followed by two further visits of 30&#x02005;min. These visits were supported by six additional visits to a research nurse, where 15&#x02005;min were used to discuss dietary matters for both groups, reinforcing dietary goals and 15&#x02005;min to discuss either physical activity or other matters pertinent to the patient, depending on the intervention group to which they were allocated. Maintenance was the primary goal of the second 6&#x02005;months and consisted of two more 30&#x02005;min dietitian visits and four additional visits to the research nurses.</p><p>The dietary intervention was based on the 2003 Diabetes UK healthy eating guidelines<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> and employed goal&#x02013;oriented, motivational interviewing<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Patients were encouraged to discuss their reasons for change, any ambivalence about change and to set their own dietary goals and identify their own strategies for achieving these goals. Prescriptive daily requirements for energy or macronutrients were not calculated unless requested by the patient and prescriptive meal plans or food lists were not used. Instead, patients received study specific, written dietary information at each visit (available at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jcrubristol.org.uk/EA/ACTID%20patients%20Handbook/Forms/AllItems.aspx">http://jcrubristol.org.uk/EA/ACTID%20patients%20Handbook/Forms/AllItems.aspx</ext-link>) and were encouraged to use this to evaluate their own eating habits. The materials included information on maintaining a regular meal pattern and including starchy carbohydrates as a part of each meal, reducing total, saturated and <italic>trans</italic> fat intake, limiting non-milk extrinsic sugars, aiming for five portions a day of fruit and vegetables and gave guidance on portion control. Specific food choices were discussed and participants were advised on choosing wholegrain and higher fibre foods, reducing fatty and processed meats and high fat dairy products and increasing oily fish and limiting foods such as cakes, biscuits, salty snacks and takeaway meals. The benefit of aiming for a 5&#x02013;10% weight loss by reducing overall energy intake was discussed with everyone. Goals were reviewed at each appointment and successes, difficulties and new strategies discussed. Patients were encouraged to self-monitor their weight and diet.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Measurements</title><p>Measures were taken at baseline (prior to randomisation) and repeated 6 and 12&#x02005;months later. Baseline and 6-month data were used in the current analysis, since outcomes at 6&#x02005;months were defined as the primary endpoint of the study. Measurements used in this analysis were weight, height (to calculate body mass index (BMI)), waist circumference, blood pressure, HbA1c, fasting lipids and minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) measured using accelerometry and defined as activity expending greater than 3&#x02005;kcal/kg/h. As previously described, blood measurements and anthropometric measures were carried out using standardised procedures.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Smoking habits and use of dietary supplements were assessed by a research nurse. The UK Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) 2007 was calculated from the home postcode and used as an indicator of socioeconomic position.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Dietary assessment and analysis</title><p>Patients in the intervention arms were asked to complete 4-day food diaries, to include two weekdays and one weekend day, prior to each appointment with a dietitian, recording all foods and drinks consumed during those 4&#x02005;days. Portion sizes were estimated using household measures and package weights and brands indicated where appropriate. The diaries were discussed during the appointments and used to identify potential areas for change and difficulties in making change, and to enable patients to observe change in their diets over time. Patients were asked to return all the diaries at the final visit for further analysis. Those who did not return the diaries at the visit were reminded by telephone and email to post&#x000a0;the outstanding diaries to the research team after the visit.</p><p>Baseline and 6-month food diaries were coded by one coder and checked for accuracy and agreement by a second coder, using the dietary coding programme Diet in Data Out (DIDO), developed at the Medical Research Council Human Nutrition Unit in Cambridge, UK.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Diaries were analysed with the nutrient analysis programme Bristol General Analysis of Dietary Experiments (BRIGADE).<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> The nutrient database is based on <italic>McCance and Widdowson's Composition of Foods, 5th edition</italic>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> updated with the supplements to that edition, new data from the 6th edition and manufacturers&#x02019; data. Additional nutrient data from the INTERMAP nutrient database for the UK were also used.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> If no portion size information was given, age-appropriate portion sizes were assigned.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> The mean daily consumption of each nutrient was calculated for each participant.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>As the dietary intervention was designed to be identical for both intervention groups and there were no difference in outcomes between the diet and diet and physical activity groups, the data were analysed as a cohort. Patients in the usual care group were excluded from the analysis since they did not receive the dietary intervention and were not asked to complete a diary at 6&#x02005;months. Descriptive statistics were used for patient characteristics and for intakes of macronutrients at baseline and at 6&#x02005;months. Variables were checked for normal distribution; non-normal variables were log transformed prior to analysis. For ease of interpretation, arithmetic means and back transformed variables are presented. Independent t tests were used to explore differences in continuous variables between men and women at baseline and between those who did and did not return food diaries, and &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> tests were used to explore differences in dichotomous variables. Paired sample t tests were used to describe differences in energy and macronutrient intake between baseline and 6&#x02005;months. McNemar tests were used to explore differences in numbers of people meeting recommendations at baseline and at 6&#x02005;months. As alcohol variables could not be transformed, the Mann Whitney U and paired sample Wilcoxon signed rank test were used to describe differences. Cases with missing data were excluded listwise. Data were assumed to be randomly missing and <xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2014004953TB1">table 1</xref> includes numerical superscripts to indicate the number of participants with missing data

Men were more likely to drink alcohol and more likely to drink to excess than women, with 49% of women and 28% of men recording no alcohol during the 4&#x02005;days and 8% of women and 19% of men reporting more than 30&#x02005;g of alcohol per day (p=0.022).</p><p>At 6&#x02005;months, the mean daily reported energy intake was reduced by 187&#x02005;kcal (p&#x0003c;0.001).

This was achieved by small reductions in all macronutrients, while maintaining fibre intake. The mean percentage energy from macronutrients was unchanged for women while men reported a small mean increase of 1.4&#x000b1;5.9% (p&#x0003c;0.001) of energy from carbohydrates.

Despite no mean change to energy from saturated fat, more men met recommendations at 6&#x02005;months (35% men at baseline vs 49% at 6&#x02005;months reporting less than 10% energy from saturated fat, p=0.007).

They reported a mean decrease in energy intake of around 200&#x02005;kcal/day during the first 6&#x02005;months. This is a modest reduction in calorie intake, but if sustained will have an impact on weight and glycaemic control. It has been argued that small changes in the long term are more effective for weight management than large changes in the short term.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Men reported a reduced alcohol intake that produced a greater reduction in energy and reported a small increase in the percentage energy from carbohydrate. Women reported modest reductions to all macronutrients but made no changes to alcohol, their energy reduction was less and the macronutrient ratio of their diets did not change. Both sexes maintained fibre intake. Although changes in percentage intake of macronutrients were associated with metabolic outcomes, these effect sizes were too small to be of clinical significance.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Comparison with other studies</title><p>The Early ACTID dietary intervention was a pragmatic, &#x02018;real world&#x02019; intervention, in which participants discussed dietary advice with dietitians and nurses to decide on their own dietary changes. The approach contrasts with dietary studies where participants are asked to make specific, prescribed changes to the macronutrient composition, by lowering carbohydrate and increasing protein,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28&#x02013;</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> or to lower the glycaemic index.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>
<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> The LOADD trial<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> based a successful dietary intervention in patients with poor glycaemic control on very similar recommendations to those used in the Early ACTID intervention, but total energy intake and macronutrient ratios for each participant were calculated and diets were prescribed according to these calculations taking into account personal preference, budget and sociocultural factors. The Early ACTID intervention did not compare a prescriptive with a non-prescriptive approach, so it cannot be used to demonstrate that this is superior, but reductions in weight, waist circumference and HbA1c were achieved that are comparable to those achieved during these interventions. Withdrawal rates for prescriptive dietary interventions range from 10% to 30% and these higher withdrawal rates may suggest that in routine clinical care a more flexible approach can be advantageous in promoting retention. Of those participants in Early ACTID who either did not attend all appointments or withdrew completely, only one person stated that they did not see the benefit of the trial. The majority could not schedule all nine dietitian and nurse visits because of other commitments, five cited other health issues, three moved too far away, one said they &#x02018;did not want to diet,&#x02019; one wanted to take orlistat from baseline and three gave no reasons. What is common to intervention trials in diabetes is that patients receive individual support and attend multiple appointments with a dietitian or a health practitioner who is an expert in promoting dietary change. It is important to emphasise that this model is not routinely replicated in primary care for patients with type 2 DM.</p><p>Exploratory analysis of the associations between specific dietary changes and metabolic outcomes found small effect sizes that are not clinically important, but they are consistent with existing nutritional data on the benefits of a reduction in trans fats on lipids and waist circumference,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> an increase in fibre on LDL cholesterol<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> and a reduction in alcohol and blood pressure.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> It is of interest that this analysis found that there was no benefit in carbohydrate reduction in men with good glycaemic control who are already consuming a low-to-moderate carbohydrate diet. It is not possible to determine whether there is an optimum macronutrient distribution for T2 DM from this analysis, particularly in those with poor glycaemic control, but there is no unequivocal evidence that low-carbohydrate diets produce better blood glucose control or weight loss than higher carbohydrate diets.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> A meta-analysis of low-carbohydrate diets versus low-fat diets conducted in 2012<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> concluded that there was evidence of a small but beneficial effect on lipid profiles of a low (defined as &#x0003c;45% energy from carbohydrate) or very low carbohydrate (&#x0003c;60&#x02005;g carbohydrate) diet but no difference in improvements to weight or glycaemic control. Larsen <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> correlated dietary change with metabolic outcomes and found associations with energy reduction and HbA1c and waist circumference.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Strengths and weaknesses</title><p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to describe the dietary intake of people soon after diagnosis with type 2 DM living in the UK, the dietary changes made during an intervention based on patient-centred, non-prescriptive dietary advice and that examines associations between dietary change and metabolic variables. The demographics of the Early ACTID participants included in this analysis suggest that these findings are only representative of the white population; however, the sample is socioeconomically diverse with 40% of the participants living in areas of high economic deprivation. Ethical approval was granted to make no changes to hypoglycaemic, lipid lowering or blood pressure medications during the first 6&#x02005;months, unless absolutely necessary, and this was controlled by a strict protocol. Owing to the small numbers, those participants who made medication changes were included in the analysis without correction.</p><p>The study has important weaknesses. Only 53% of the participants returned the baseline and 6&#x02005;month food diaries at the end of the trial, and these people had a lower BMI and waist circumference at baseline and achieved greater metabolic improvements. The participants who did not return the diaries reported mislaying them, which may indicate less motivation and less engagement with the trial. Participants who did return the diaries could have been more motivated to make dietary changes than a typical patient population, and given that their diets were good at baseline, may already have made dietary changes prior to entry into the Early ACTID study. The relative lack of dietary data limits our ability to generalise these findings to broader patient groups. Furthermore, this was an exploratory analysis using an existing dataset and as such an estimation of sample size was not conducted in advance. However, post hoc sample calculations indicate that the study was underpowered to detect small associations between dietary changes and metabolic outcomes, having 15% power for women and 52% for men at an &#x003b1; of 0.05.</p><p>The use of any self-reported measure of diet, including 4-day food diaries, is a recognised limitation in dietary studies. Under-reporting of food intake and selective under-reporting or under-eating of foods perceived to be &#x02018;bad&#x02019; are commonly documented, especially in people who are obese.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>&#x000a0;<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> Measurement of alcohol can be problematic due to the episodic nature of consumption, although including at least one weekend day can improve estimates by including alcohol consumption of &#x02018;weekend-only&#x02019; drinkers.<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> Methods exist to estimate under-reporting, using the calculated basal metabolic rate and estimates of physical activity,<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>
<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> but these methods assume that an individual's weight is stable and are consequently inappropriate for use during a weight loss trial. It should be noted that other dietary interventions in patients with type 2 DM have reported similar energy intakes<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x000a0;<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> and an energy reduction of around 200&#x02005;kcal/day is plausible assuming a dynamic model of energy balance<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> and given the modest weight reduction observed. It is also important to note that this is a secondary analysis, so cause and effect cannot be assumed. It was not possible to perform a formal mediation analysis since participants from the control arm were not asked to complete a food diary at 6&#x02005;months.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The Early ACTID trial indicates that a flexible, non-prescriptive approach to dietary advice based on standard healthy eating guidelines in type 2 DM given soon after diagnosis may be effective in promoting small dietary change, even in patients with good glycaemic control. This supports current clinical practice and guidelines. The current analysis suggests that changes in percentage intake of macronutrients do not have any clinically significant effect on metabolic outcomes. However, this needs confirmation in a larger cohort, with less good glycaemic control. Further research is needed on whether dietary changes made using a non-prescriptive approach are sustainable and beneficial in the longer term in a more typical patient population.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e177" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2014-004953.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e178" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2014-004953.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors acknowledge the participants in the Early ACtivity in Diabetes (Early ACTID) trial, members of the Early ACTID team and steering committee, Dr Pauline Emmett for advice on dietary analysis, Dr Rosemary Greenwood for advice on statistical analysis and Professor Debbie Sharp for assistance in manuscript preparation.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> This work forms part of the PhD thesis of CYE, which is supervised by RCA, JLT and RJ.
