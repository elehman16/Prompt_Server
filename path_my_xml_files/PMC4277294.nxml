Despite the widespread availability of noninvasive imaging, invasive angiography is commonly used early in the diagnostic pathway. Consequently, approximately 60% of angiograms reveal no evidence of obstructive coronary disease. Reducing unnecessary angiography has potential financial savings and avoids exposing the patient to unnecessary risk. There are no large-scale comparative effectiveness trials of the different diagnostic strategies recommended in international guidelines and none that have evaluated the safety and efficacy of cardiovascular magnetic resonance.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Design</title><p>CE-MARC 2 is a prospective, multicenter, 3-arm parallel group, randomized controlled trial of patients with suspected CHD (pretest likelihood 10%-90%) requiring further investigation. A total of 1,200 patients will be randomized on a 2:2:1 basis to receive 3.0-T cardiovascular magnetic resonance&#x02013;guided care, single-photon emission computed tomography&#x02013;guided care (according to American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association appropriate-use criteria), or National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines&#x02013;based management. The primary (efficacy) end point is the occurrence of unnecessary angiography as defined by a normal (&#x0003e;0.8) invasive fractional flow reserve. Safety of each strategy will be assessed by 3-year major adverse cardiovascular event rates. Cost-effectiveness and health-related quality-of-life measures will be performed.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The CE-MARC 2 trial will provide comparative efficacy and safety evidence for 3 different strategies of investigating patients with suspected CHD, with the intension of reducing unnecessary invasive angiography rates.

In a typical hospital setting, a variety of investigations may be used to diagnose CHD, risk-stratify, and determine the need for coronary revascularization.

Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) has high diagnostic accuracy for the detection of CHD, and the CE-MARC study demonstrated CMR's superiority over SPECT.<xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> Despite the widespread availability and recommendation of noninvasive imaging investigations in national and international guidelines,<xref rid="bb0010 bb0015 bb0020" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2&#x02013;4</sup></xref> invasive coronary angiography is commonly used early in the diagnostic pathway.

For the primary end point analyses, a sample size of 1,200 (allowing for 20% noncompletion) will provide 99% power to detect a difference of unnecessary angiography rates between CMR and NICE guidelines&#x02013;based management&#x02014;accounting for the 2:1 allocation ratio&#x02014;and 94% power between CMR and SPECT-guided care (2-sided test 5% significance level for a continuity-corrected &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test<xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref>). This is based on projected unnecessary angiography rates of 4.5%, 11.7%, and 30% in the CMR, SPECT, and NICE arms, respectively, arrived at by estimating the PTL profile of CEMARC patients (we estimated the PTL distribution to be 10%:33%:57% for low/moderate/high PTL, for those patients with PTL 10%-90%) and the false-positive rates of CMR and SPECT in these subgroups to compute a weighted average false-positive rate as the expected unnecessary angiogram rate. For the NICE arm, we noted that in patients with 61% to 90% PTL, nearly 60% of angiograms were negative, and so would drive high rates for this strategy, despite CT and SPECT patients (10%-60% PTL) undergoing fewer unnecessary angiograms.</p></sec><sec id="s0145"><title>Analysis plan</title><p>Statistical analysis will be performed as agreed in the prespecified statistical analysis plan.

A quality assurance process will be undertaken centrally by independent modality-specific imaging experts, to monitor the quality of image acquisition and interpretation of each imaging modality at all recruiting centers. This will involve an initial review of the first 15 imaging studies followed by an ongoing review of a random 10% of each imaging modality at each participating site. Clinical interpretation of the individual components of each imaging modality and overall study recommendation will be scored as 1 (agreement), 2 (minor disagreement), or 3 (major disagreement) and reported to the DMEC for independent consideration/action.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s0010"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The CE-MARC 2 trial is a prospective, multicenter, 3-arm parallel group, randomized controlled trial; it will provide comparative efficacy and safety evidence for 3 different strategies of investigating patients with suspected CHD, with the intention of reducing unnecessary invasive angiography rates. Evaluation of these management strategies has the potential to improve patient care, HRQoL, and the cost-effectiveness of CHD investigation.</p></sec><sec id="s0175"><title>Disclosures</title><p>S.P. is funded by a British Heart Foundation fellowship (FS/10/62/28409).
