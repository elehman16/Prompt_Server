The X-Bolt Dynamic Hip Plating System (X-Bolt Orthopaedics, Dublin, Ireland) is a new device which aims to reduce this risk of cut-out.

However, in the unstable fracture patterns where comminution exists, the fracture may collapse into varus and the device may fail, resulting in &#x02018;cut-out&#x02019; of the screw from the femoral head. The reported incidence of SHS cut-out is variable but most recent studies report failures in up to 5% of cases.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-2046-3758.64.BJR-2015-0016.R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>-<xref rid="bibr6-2046-3758.64.BJR-2015-0016.R2" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> In 1995, Baumgaertner et al<sup><xref rid="bibr2-2046-3758.64.BJR-2015-0016.R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> described the measurement of tip-apex distance and found that amongst a number of risk factors, a tip-apex distance &#x0003e; 25 mm was most strongly predictive of cut-out.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-2046-3758.64.BJR-2015-0016.R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup></p><p>The X-Bolt Dynamic Hip Plating system (X-Bolt Orthopaedics, Dublin, Ireland) is a device which builds on the SHS and seeks to improve fixation in the femoral head with the aim of reducing the risk of &#x02018;cut-out&#x02019;.

This difference, although statistically significant, does not appear to be clinically important and has not resulted in an increased incidence of screw cut-out. The increased tip-apex distance seen in the X-Bolt group may be multifactorial. The device is blunt-nosed and cannot advance beyond the reamed tunnel depth, unlike a lag screw, which may be advanced a little further into unreamed bone. Similarly, at the bone compactor step prior to implanting the X-Bolt, if the instrument is not at the tip-apex point when being deployed, this will result in a final X-Bolt position with an increased tip-apex distance. Recently, the manufacturer has updated the design of the bone compactor to help surgeons achieve optimum deep placement.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-2046-3758.64.BJR-2015-0016.R2" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup></p><p>Baumgaertner et al<sup><xref rid="bibr2-2046-3758.64.BJR-2015-0016.R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> studied 198 fracture fixations using a variety of angled plates (130&#x000b0;, 135&#x000b0;, 140&#x000b0;, 145&#x000b0;, 150&#x000b0;) where the mean tip-apex distance was 25 mm (9 to 63) and the overall incidence of cut-out at three months (excluding 150&#x000b0; side plates) was 4%.

Consequently, our cohort of hip fracture patients looks very different from that in Baumgaertner et al&#x02019;s study, and with a mean overall tip-apex distance of &#x0003c; 20 mm it is likely that the incidence of cut-out will be less than 4%. Indeed, at 12 months&#x02019; follow-up we observe 2% cut-out in the SHS group (one out of 49 fixations) <italic>versus</italic> 0% with the X-Bolt (number needed to treat = 1/absolute risk reduction = 1/0.02 = 50). At this rate, we would require 1228 participants (with 90% power and 5% type I error) to resolve a significant difference between the groups or 608 participants at the 4% level quoted by Baumgaertner et al.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-2046-3758.64.BJR-2015-0016.R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> The small sample size in this pilot study clearly represents the major limitation of this work and precludes any firm conclusions regarding the risk of cut-out. The strength of this study comes from the pragmatic nature of the inclusion criteria in WHiTE One.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-2046-3758.64.BJR-2015-0016.R2" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> All patients &#x0003e; 60 years of age with an unstable pertrochanteric fracture, including those with cognitive impairment, were included. Surgery was carried out by the on-call trauma team (consultants with a variety of subspecialty interest and training registrars) at the time of admission, a model which is common practice in the United Kingdom. The measured tip-apex distances are therefore likely to be representative of standard United Kingdom NHS practice. We do not believe that there was a significant learning curve associated with the use of the X-Bolt since both the surgical approach and device implantation do not differ significantly from the SHS.</p><p>We observed two late failures (&#x0003e; one year post surgery) in the SHS group. These two implant failures had tip-apex distances of 16.6 mm and 16.2 mm, which are significantly below the 25 mm threshold suggested by Baumgaertner et al<sup><xref rid="bibr2-2046-3758.64.BJR-2015-0016.R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> as strongly predictive of failure. It is likely that worsening bone quality and general frailty will have contributed to these late failures. It is not clear from the literature what the incidence of late failure is for the SHS in order to make a comparison or draw conclusions from this observation.</p><p>The main findings from this study are that the X-Bolt is a safe device with no increased cut-out when compared with the SHS, despite the observed increase in tip-apex distance with the X-Bolt. Surgeon concerns about minimising the tip-apex distance when implanting the X-Bolt compared with the SHS are justified but do not appear to be clinically important.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="con"><p><bold>Author Contributions:</bold> M.
