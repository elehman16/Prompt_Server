In addition, lung cancer patients may undergo a range of treatment modalities, including surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy, with accompanying side effects adding to patient burden (Molassiotis et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="ecc12538-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>).</p><p>Compared to other types of cancer, the distress associated with symptoms arising from lung cancer has been reported as the most intense (Schofield et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="ecc12538-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>). Several studies have identified the presence of a respiratory symptom cluster in patients with lung cancer showing close associations among breathlessness&#x02013;cough&#x02013;fatigue (Cheville et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="ecc12538-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>; Molassiotis et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="ecc12538-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). This interacting symptom cluster, called Respiratory Symptom Distress Cluster was found to play a central role in patients&#x02019; symptom experiences within the lung cancer population.</p><p>The randomised controlled trial (RCT) is a central tenant of evidence based healthcare (Treweek et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="ecc12538-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). Significant challenges have been experienced in previous trials with lung cancer patients. These have been the result of patients&#x02019; poor performance status and high symptom burden with complex symptomatology, which can lead to difficulties in study recruitment, retention and implementation of non&#x02010;pharmacological interventions (Jordh&#x000f8;y, Kaasa, Fayers, Underland, &#x00026; Ahlner&#x02010;Elmqvist, <xref rid="ecc12538-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">1999</xref>; Zhao &#x00026; Yates, <xref rid="ecc12538-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>).</p><p>Methodological literature is almost exclusively statistical and epidemiological, and very little of it is concerned with conduct or the particular demands that trials put on researchers and participants (Donovan et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="ecc12538-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">2002</xref>). When feasibility testing an intervention it is crucial to explore the views and experiences of all stakeholders. Consideration should be given to issues that might make a non&#x02010;pharmacological intervention more appropriate, viable, and achievably integrated into standard practice while responding to policy drives for service users to be more involved in research and health service development (Department of Health, <xref rid="ecc12538-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>). Nested qualitative studies, using semi&#x02010;structured interviews within trials are essential as they provide insight into such issues.</p><p>This paper reports the findings from a nested qualitative study, part of a RCT which aimed to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a non&#x02010;pharmacological intervention, the Respiratory Distress Symptom Intervention (RDSI), plus usual care versus usual care alone for the self&#x02010;management of breathlessness&#x02013;cough&#x02013;fatigue symptom cluster in lung cancer. The main results of the RCT feasibility trial are reported elsewhere (Yorke et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="ecc12538-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). RDSI had three core components focusing on, (1) breathing techniques, (2) cough easing techniques and (3) acupressure. Furthermore, patients were given a supplementary symptom experience information pack collated from existing resources (see Box&#x000a0;<xref rid="ecc12538-fea-0001" ref-type="boxed-text">1</xref>). Patients randomised to the control group received usual care alone (see Box&#x000a0;<xref rid="ecc12538-fea-0002" ref-type="boxed-text">2</xref>).</p><boxed-text position="float" content-type="Box" id="ecc12538-fea-0001" orientation="portrait"><label>Box 1</label><caption><title>Components of respiratory distress symptom intervention (further details regarding RDSI are provided in Yorke et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="ecc12538-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>)</title></caption><sec id="ecc12538-sec-0022"><title>i) Diaphragmatic breathing</title><p>Controlled diaphragmatic breathing techniques</p></sec><sec id="ecc12538-sec-0023"><title>ii) Acupressure</title><p>Patients were taught a number of acupressure points: L7, L9, LI4; ST 36; CV 21 and 20.</p><p>Patients were taught to select any of these points in any combination and to apply pressure at least twice a day, applying steady firm pressure for 1&#x000a0;min to each point with the thumb or middle finger, releasing the pressure slowly after the minute.

Approval for the conduct of the main RCT and nested qualitative study was provided by the National Health Service ethics and participating hospital governance committees (reference: 12/NW/0090). All participants (patients, carers and researchers) provided written informed consent to take part in interviews discussed here.</p><sec id="ecc12538-sec-0003"><label>2.1</label><title>Sampling</title><sec id="ecc12538-sec-0004"><label>2.1.1</label><title>Patient and carer participants</title><p>A purposive sample consisting of participants, who at trial entry had indicated an interest in taking part in interviews, was approached.

Patients and participating carers were requested to be interviewed separately. The interviews were guided by an interview schedule which focused on the following key issues: reasons for taking part in the trial; general experiences of taking part in the trial; patients&#x02019; experiences of receiving the intervention; patient experiences of being in the control group; and carers&#x02019; experiences of taking part in the trial. Interviewers were also free to explore other issues as they arose. Demographic and clinical data were collected either from the patient (age, gender, marital status) or from the medical records (i.e. WHO performance status, type of lung cancer and cancer treatment group). Participants were provided with the option to have interviews conducted face&#x02010;to&#x02010;face at a mutually convenient venue or a telephone interview. Interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim.</p><p>The focus group with project staff was directed by a topic guide organised around the following key topics: general experience of taking part in the trial; process of recruitment, consenting procedure and randomisation; experience and views regarding the training for intervention delivery; experiences and views regarding delivery of the intervention; overall conduct of the trial and their participation in the trial and final recommendations for the main trial. All focus group participants provided informed written consent for the focus group discussion to be audio&#x02010;recorded and subsequently transcribed verbatim, anonymity being assured.</p><p>All patient and carer participant interviews and the project staff focus group were conducted following completion of their study involvement.</p></sec><sec id="ecc12538-sec-0007"><label>2.3</label><title>Data analysis</title><p>A modified version of thematic analysis, a method for identifying, analysing and reporting patterns within data (Braun &#x00026; Clarke, <xref rid="ecc12538-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>), was undertaken using interview and focus group schedules as a guide for categorising data interviews and the focus group. The researchers familiarised themselves with the data through listening to the audio&#x02010;recordings and checking and re&#x02010;reading the transcripts. Data analysis was conducted by the two researchers who had undertaken the interviews and in collaboration with the Chief Investigator.

Two patients and one carer had the expectation that being in the trial might help ease troublesome symptoms, such as cough and fatigue, which were perceived as receiving little attention from healthcare professionals. Seven patients expressed no expectations whatsoever and one patient and one carer described being sceptical about how effective taking part would be. Two patients felt taking part would allow them to gain further knowledge of their symptoms and lung cancer. There was also the perception that patients felt somewhat neglected by their clinical teams and left to &#x0201c;get on with it&#x0201d; and participating in the trial may, therefore, offer an avenue for additional support.</p></sec><sec id="ecc12538-sec-0011"><label>3.1.2</label><title>Patients&#x02019; general experiences of taking part in the trial</title><p>Patients in both study arms reported gaining a greater understanding and knowledge of their illness and symptoms, especially in relation to the presence of symptoms post&#x02010;cancer treatment. The support from the research team was valued, particularly by those living alone. There was a feeling that they were continuing to be monitored through participation in the study, which provided them with a sense of reassurance.</p><p>Patients expressed varying degrees of difficulty in completing the questionnaires with three out of the 11 patients describing them as repetitive and overwhelming. In contrast, two patients appeared to have benefited from completing them as it tended to legitimise their symptoms or help them accept the realities of their disease. All patients appeared to be reassured with the knowledge that the symptoms were relatively common among lung cancer sufferers and were not unique to them. Patients stated that some of the questionnaires were not relevant as they referred to their lung cancer&#x02014;yet they believed their lung cancer to have been cured and they were no longer suffering from the disease. There was a general perception that the questions asked in the study questionnaires could be upsetting to patients and their carer's, however, no patients expressed feeling upset at being asked these questions themselves. One carer felt some questions were intrusive but understood why they were being asked. For this reason, additional support may be required when considering future trials.</p><p>One participant explicitly stated they found the Macmillan booklets and Supplementary Information very useful commenting on the CD in particular. However the general consensus was that far, too much information was supplied with patients finding it difficult to navigate around the various materials. Four patients appreciated the support in completing the questionnaire and felt they would have been less likely to complete them without it. Unfortunately, one patient did not recall receiving any information. Despite this, all patients in both groups were glad to have taken part in the trial and would recommend it to others.</p></sec><sec id="ecc12538-sec-0012"><label>3.1.3</label><title>Patients&#x02019; experiences of receiving the intervention</title><p>While initially two participants expressed scepticism that the interventions would work, they soon perceived a greater sense of control in their ability to manage their symptoms. Two interviewees reported immediate benefits from the intervention; the remainder discussed how benefits actualised over some time. Patients reported being able to undertake activities they had not been able to achieve since their diagnosis. Patients did not find the techniques restrictive, rather they used them as and when they felt the need. The only barrier to practising the techniques appeared to be when patients were feeling too unwell. All six participants described benefiting from practising breathlessness techniques, which in turn helped with associated anxiety. Two patients made a specific reference to the stretchy man technique expressing how they enjoyed or favoured this one in particular.</p><p>While difficult to grasp at first, the four patients who used the acupressure technique reported they found it beneficial and unobtrusive. Not all points taught suited all patients. It was felt that an additional reminder session would have been helpful as one patient admitted stopping due to feeling unsure they were doing it correctly. For patients who suffered from cough, the easing techniques appeared to be beneficial at times. In addition, there were unexpected benefits. The breathing techniques allowed one patient to forego her &#x0201c;sprays,&#x0201d; which she claimed she no longer needed. One patient, who had previously experienced great pain and anxiety when opening her bowels, was able to apply the breathing exercises to alleviate constipation and reported immediate benefit.</p></sec><sec id="ecc12538-sec-0013"><label>3.1.4</label><title>Patients&#x02019; experiences of being in the control group</title><p>Of the six patients randomised to the control group only one specifically expressed disappointment at this. Patients understood the process of randomisation and the necessity of having two groups were happy to have taken part and did find it beneficial. All control group participants stated they learnt a lot about their condition through the processes of informed consent. Reading the questionnaires also helped to legitimise their symptom experience and provided a sense of reassurance that other patients were likely to be experiencing similar symptoms.</p></sec><sec id="ecc12538-sec-0014"><label>3.1.5</label><title>Carers&#x02019; experiences of taking part in the trial</title><p>All three carers interviewed were pleased to have taken part in the trial. Like patients, they appeared to gain a greater understanding of the symptoms experienced by their relative/friend by reading the study information provided and completing the questionnaires. They appeared to be reassured by the contact with the research team, which they felt was a form of monitoring their relative/friend's illness. One carer took on an active role in encouraging and helping his spouse undertake the intervention techniques. Carers found the questionnaires repetitive, somewhat intrusive and at times not relevant since their partner did not have as severe an illness as the questionnaires implied. Like patients, carers felt the intervention should be offered to patients regardless as to where people were in their cancer treatment and post&#x02010;treatment journey. This would enable people to draw on the knowledge and skills learnt as required.

At a number of research sites recruitment was dependent on the doctors identifying potential participants. It was suggested that some doctors were acting as gatekeepers and that the screening and recruitment process varied across the sites. Those involved in the recruitment process reported that the inclusion/exclusion criterion was too restrictive. As a result, it was felt that many patients who may have benefited from participation in the trial were excluded. This was found to be particularly relevant for patients who were within 4&#x000a0;weeks of chemotherapy or 8&#x000a0;weeks of commencing tyrosine kinase inhibitors. The general perception was that patients should be able to receive the intervention regardless of where in the illness trajectory they were.</p><p>There was a sense that many patients who were identified as being suitable to participate tended to deny their symptoms, having become normalised and adjusted their lives accordingly. These patients when asked about their symptom experience responded that they were &#x0201c;not bothered&#x0201d; by their symptoms and therefore were ineligible. There was also a general sense that some patients participated because they would be receiving increased attention and support that may have been lacking from the clinical team. This view was also expressed by clinicians&#x02014;the study was viewed as a way of helping to meet perceived unmet patient needs. The time frame between providing consent and receiving the first intervention (suggested 1&#x000a0;week) was found to be problematic, as some patients became ill during that period whilst others had problems fitting in the intervention visits around other appointments.</p></sec><sec id="ecc12538-sec-0017"><label>3.2.2</label><title>Experiences and views regarding the training for intervention delivery</title><p>The specialist practitioners received two training sessions delivered by the lead complementary therapist. A training manual was also provided and ongoing telephone support was available, if required. The training and review sessions were generally well received and staff found the Good Clinical Practice (research conduct and ethics training in the UK) training beneficial and increased their knowledge and skills particularly regarding consenting and the research process. The specialist practitioners found the training manual was important with regards to supporting the different techniques, although it was felt that some key information was missing. In particular, it was felt that the role of physiotherapy, physical activity and exercise was underplayed in the fatigue information section.</p><p>Given that those delivering the intervention were from different disciplines with different levels of expertise presented an issue, particularly at the beginning of the trial, was how to use the information provided (Supplementary Information Booklet, Macmillan Managing Breathlessness and Coping with Fatigue). It was highlighted that they would have benefited from a better understanding of when and how to use the information booklets, although it was noted that the Supplementary Information Booklet provided the opportunity to talk about other issues (other than their normal clinical practice) and patients may benefit from this.</p></sec><sec id="ecc12538-sec-0018"><label>3.2.3</label><title>Experience and views regarding the delivery of the intervention</title><p>The delivery of the intervention varied across sites for example at one site all patients attended the hospital for the intervention whilst at a second site, patients received the intervention at home. The study protocol did not stipulate where the intervention was to be delivered and sites had the choice of delivering it at the hospital or in the community; specialist practitioners found the latter more convenient for patients. Participants also stated that it was challenging to fit the intervention training session around other commitments such as hospital and personal appointments. One specialist practitioner suggested that a video element may have been useful. Generally, those delivering the intervention reported that the experience had been quite educational for patients and carers as they benefited from being able to see how to do the techniques and understood the dynamics of how they worked.</p><p>Focus group participants suggested that the level of involvement of carers varied, but where they were involved it was perceived that they played a key role in encouraging patients to practice the different intervention techniques. However, there was also a sense of protectionism identified from the carer. This was especially evident in some circumstances when the researcher would conduct a follow&#x02010;up call yet the carer would speak to the researcher on the patient's behalf.</p><p>Specialist practitioners expressed some difficulty taking on the research role as the requirements of the trial differed slightly to what they would do in normal clinical practice. It was noted that some health professionals may be tackling the sessions from a physiological perspective whereas others may tackle it from a psychological level, but the key focus was on optimising participant self&#x02010;management of symptoms. In addition, it was felt that different health professionals may have focussed differently on different components of the intervention.</p><p>It was agreed that several questionnaires included in the participant study packs asked directly about lung cancer symptoms&#x02014;yet for those patients who believed they were cured following treatment made questionnaires difficult to complete as they could not relate to the questions and in some instances prevented people for taking part in the trial. Completing the paperwork also brought patients/carers focus back to the disease, which was viewed as evoking distress as it forced them to think about issues they may not have previously thought about or chose not to.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="ecc12538-sec-0019"><label>4</label><title>Discussion</title><p>Feasibility studies of complex interventions are important to test not only potential effectiveness but also to assess acceptability and practicality of the intervention, and to refine and improve it prior to conducting a fully powered trial. This nested qualitative study provides support for the intervention and development of a subsequent trial while highlighting aspects that require further development. In this qualitative study, we elicited both general and specific feedback from trial participants (patient and carers) and study staff involved in all aspects of the trial including recruitment, intervention training and intervention delivery. This approach provided a broad range of experiences, views and expectations with recommendations from key stakeholders.</p><p>It has been previously suggested that eligibility criteria for trials of supportive care intervention for people with lung cancer should be broad in an attempt to counteract relatively low recruitment rates and high attrition rates (Schofield et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="ecc12538-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>). In the current trial, patients were excluded if they had a chest infection or had received chemotherapy/radiotherapy within the previous 4&#x000a0;weeks. However, all interviewed patients and carers felt that the intervention should be available for patients when they most needed it and regardless of current or recent cancer treatment. This view was also shared by the research staff who found the eligibility criteria to be &#x0201c;restrictive.&#x0201d; This perhaps reflects the positive views held by participants about the intervention. It is known that patients&#x02019; experiences of symptoms such as breathlessness, cough and fatigue are influenced by recent infections and cancer treatments and therefore may impact on the results of studies designed to ameliorate such symptoms. As such, eligibility criteria will remain the same for the subsequent trial, where RDSI effectiveness will be tested. Following successful completion of the trial, RDSI will be recommended for people with symptoms regardless of previous infection or stage of cancer treatment.</p><p>During the focus group research staff indicated that potential participants were missed because the patient had &#x0201c;adjusted their life&#x0201d; and therefore symptoms were not viewed as &#x0201c;bothersome.&#x0201d; As we did not interview patients who declined to take part in the trial, these results cannot be confirmed. However, during post&#x02010;trial discussions with our cancer patient reference group, it was suggested that the use of the term &#x0201c;bothersome&#x0201d; may have been perceived by some patients as &#x0201c;complaining&#x0201d; (Yorke et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="ecc12538-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). Therefore, the screening question was changed to focus on daily activities that symptoms may interfere with: &#x0201c;Are you affected in your day&#x02010;to&#x02010;day life by breathlessness?&#x0201d; and repeated for each symptom. Research staff also suggested that the time frame between participant consent and delivery of the intervention was too restrictive and difficult to adhere to. The reasons for this were valid: patients became ill during that time or were busy with other commitments. This presents challenges when designing controlled trials as every effort is made to ensure that all participants are managed in a similar way. In the light of this, the timeframe between consent and delivery of the first RDSI session has been expanded to 2&#x000a0;weeks.</p><p>There was a perception that some patients agreed to participate in the trial, because it acknowledged and legitimised their symptoms to themselves, family/friends and healthcare providers. It was felt that participants who were post&#x02010;curative intent treatment were often left to &#x0201c;get on with it&#x0201d;: taking part in the trial in contrast provided the opportunity to legitimise symptoms and take some control. In particular, patients and carers indicated that taking part in the trial increased their knowledge about lung cancer and their symptoms. The search for symptom legitimation is a familiar phenomenon in patients&#x02019; post&#x02010;cancer treatment which can continue for several years (Rosman, <xref rid="ecc12538-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>). In this study, the informed consent process appeared to provide an educational session about lung cancer and its associated symptoms. This suggests the need for targeted patient education by clinicians during and after cancer treatment and reinforced with patients in long&#x02010;term follow&#x02010;up when patients are likely to be experiencing a range of symptoms (Hofman, Ryan, Figueroa&#x02010;Moseley, Jean&#x02010;Pierre, &#x00026; Morrow, <xref rid="ecc12538-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>).</p><p>The specialist practitioners felt that available services for palliative and supportive care were not being fully utilised by clinical staff. One focus group participant in particular, expressed disappointment that some clinicians regarded the trial intervention as only now having &#x0201c;something to offer our patients,&#x0201d; implying a lack of knowledge about available supportive services. It has been estimated that only approximately 15% of newly diagnosed lung cancer patients receive a referral to a breathlessness clinic at specialist centres, where such clinics exist (personal communication with Prof Miriam Johnson, based on pilot data for a breathlessness intervention study across five tertiary centres in the UK). This may, in part, relate to clinicians&#x02019; lack of awareness of the availability of palliative and support services for symptom management (Wagland et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="ecc12538-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>). However, this provides some evidence of the clinical need for an intervention like RDSI that can be delivered by a range of healthcare professionals who receive appropriate training.</p><p>Patients and carers expressed some discontent with the questionnaires and this was seen as a potential barrier to recruitment and retention. However, since the main RCT was a feasibility study the number of questionnaires was justified to enable the identification of the most useful measures for the planned follow&#x02010;on trial. The research team also identified the amount of paper work as a barrier to recruitment, but the importance of informed consent was noted as being essential for participant retention. Ensuring that potential research participants are fully informed about research expectations, including paper work completion, forms part of the Good Clinical Practice training programme, and was adhered to in this study. For the follow&#x02010;on trial, key outcome measures have been identified and participant response burden should reduce due to the decrease in the number of patient and carer&#x02010;reported outcomes (Yorke et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="ecc12538-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>).</p><p>Sensitivity is also required when informing patients and carers about the content of study questionnaires. It was apparent in the interviews that some participants found some items confronting and distressing. For some participants, the questionnaire items probed areas that they had not thought about or had chosen not to think about. Despite the decrease in the number of questionnaires to be used in the subsequent trial, there are likely to be some items in the retained questionnaires that may evoke a range of emotions and responses from participants. Although it is important to meet recruitment and questionnaire response rates, this needs to be balanced against the need to recruit fully informed participants and thereby meet acceptable ethical principles (Hunt, Shlomo, &#x00026; Addington&#x02010;Hall, <xref rid="ecc12538-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>).</p><p>Patients in this nested qualitative study who were randomised to the intervention arm appeared to find it acceptable and valuable, in some cases with unexpected benefits. In addition, some patients felt they were able to return to activities they had not undertaken for some time. Not all techniques suited all patients, however, they appeared to find the flexibility of choosing to utilise techniques relevant to what symptoms they were experiencing within the intervention beneficial. Flexibility, particularly with complex interventions that target a cluster of symptoms has been previously identified as an important factor for patients with lung cancer (Ellis et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="ecc12538-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>). The opportunity to implement intervention techniques as part of everyday routines was particularly welcomed&#x02014;such as applying different RDSI techniques whilst &#x0201c;sitting in the bus shelter.&#x0201d; However, it was also acknowledged by patients and carers that learning the different techniques requires patience and persistence. It is important to inform patients that it takes time to learn the different techniques and for them to have an effect. Reinforcement was viewed as important but could be timely and costly to the Health Service. A potential alternative might be the addition of an instructional video.</p><p>Patients and carers did not generally appear to find the supplementary written information useful with some having forgotten they had received it. Likewise, specialist practitioners were not sure when and how to introduce the supplementary information with many participants feeling somewhat overwhelmed by the volume of information. For the subsequent trial, only the Macmillan booklets for breathlessness and fatigue will be provided. Participating specialist practitioners who were physiotherapists also suggested that the role of physical activity, especially in the management of fatigue and breathlessness, should be incorporated as a key component of RDSI rather than only appearing in the written information. Given the strong evidence base for structured activity in the management of cancer&#x02010;related symptoms (Schwartz, Mori, Gao, Nail, &#x00026; King, <xref rid="ecc12538-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">2001</xref>; Speck, Courneya, M&#x000e2;sse, Duval, &#x00026; Schmitz, <xref rid="ecc12538-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>) this has been added as a key component to RDSI.</p><p>The results of this study need to be seen in the light of its limitations. All of the interview participants who took part in the study had completed the trial. Had we been able to interview those who did not complete the trial, we may have a better understanding of the factors that had influenced this decision. Another limitation is that interviews were cross&#x02010;sectional and at the end of the trial. Ideally, for a follow&#x02010;on trial, patients who do not wish to take part should also be approached for interview as this may provide important information about successful implementation in practice. In addition, longitudinal interviews with both control and intervention group participants should be conducted as a way of exploring the impact of interventions beyond statistical results and to identify important implementation strategies that are based on the experiences of those receiving the intervention (Farquhar et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="ecc12538-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="ecc12538-sec-0020"><label>5</label><title>Conclusions</title><p>The findings from this nested qualitative study are important as they provide crucial insight into the views and perceptions of patients, carers and researchers who participated in a RCT of the feasibility and acceptability of the RDSI for the management of breathlessness&#x02013;cough&#x02013;fatigue in lung cancer patients. Informed by these qualitative insights, we have been able to improve and refine the intervention and trial processes in order to conduct a fully powered trial. Considering such findings will help ensure that the trial is person&#x02010;centred and reflects the diverse needs and preferences of this particular population in appropriate and sensitive ways.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="ecc12538-sec-0021"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This study was funded by a grant from Marie Curie Cancer Care (Ref: C16396/A14093).
