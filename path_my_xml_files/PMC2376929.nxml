These services aim to identify individuals who have inherited a significantly increased risk of cancer in order to counsel them about their risks and to offer appropriate risk management to reduce morbidity and mortality. There is a challenge to provide this information in ways that the lay public can utilise to inform their health-care choices without causing undue psychological distress. Individuals who are not at significantly increased risk also need appropriate reassurance without precluding an appropriate vigilance to symptoms of sporadic cancer. There is also a challenge to respond to these new developments within existing health-care budgets. Internationally, there is a lack of consensus about how best to deliver cancer genetic services (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib15">Steel <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>) and an urgent need for empirical evidence to inform service development.</p><p>A survey of 22 regional cancer genetics services in the UK in 1998 reported that the predominant users of these services were women with a family history of breast cancer (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib18">Wonderling <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>). Of the women who are diagnosed with breast cancer, about 10&#x00025; report having a family history of the disease (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib13">Narod, 2002</xref>). Of these cases, only a small proportion will be due to inherited genetic mutations in one of the known susceptibility genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2. These genetic mutations give rise to increased lifetime risks of developing the disease, often at an earlier age than is the norm for sporadically occurring cases.</p><p><xref ref-type="other" rid="bib2">Brain <italic>et al</italic> (2000)</xref> showed that there was no difference in the effectiveness of multidisciplinary cancer genetics teams and breast surgeons in terms of psychological outcomes in the management of familial breast cancer in Wales. Secondary analysis of the data (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib4">Brain <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>) showed some significant differences in psychological outcomes between groups of women at different levels of breast cancer risk. Only those women at low or moderate risk showed significant reductions in cancer worry and perceived risk of breast cancer. Satisfaction with genetic counselling was significantly lower in those women found to be at high risk of breast cancer.</p><p>In South East Scotland, a multidisciplinary clinic offering specialist cancer genetic risk counselling and screening to women with a family history of breast cancer has been held in the regional breast screening centre in Edinburgh since 1992. With growing waiting lists for the South East of Scotland familial breast cancer clinic, more stringent referral criteria were applied. GPs referring women judged to be at low risk were sent a letter explaining that no appointment could be offered when the criteria were not met. Referrals of women at relatively low risk were still accepted where the woman's presentation remained a particular cause of concern (e.g. high level of anxiety about breast cancer risk which was difficult for the GP to manage).</p><p>An alternative model of cancer genetics services has been proposed (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib5">Campbell <italic>et al</italic>, 1995</xref>) whereby genetics nurse specialists could offer clinics within GP locality areas to carry out risk assessment, provide counselling for those whose risk was not significantly increased and mediate referral of those at higher risk to the specialist service. It was hoped this would provide improved support to primary care and better services for those at lower risk while encouraging more cost-effective use of specialist resources for those at increased risk of developing breast cancer.</p><p>We carried out a cluster randomised trial of this new model of service delivery comparing it to the existing multidisciplinary specialist service. This paper presents a comparison of the psychological outcomes of these two service models and across participant's level of breast cancer risk.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Participants</title><p>Ethical approval for the study was obtained from the local ethics committee. An invitation to take part in the trial was sent to all general practices in Lothian (<italic>n</italic>&#x0003d;125), South West Fife (<italic>n</italic>&#x0003d;54) and Borders (<italic>n</italic>&#x0003d;24) Health Boards in South East Scotland. One hundred and seventy practices (84&#x00025;) agreed to take part, 23 (11&#x00025;) declined and 10 (5&#x00025;) did not reply. This meant that 725 of the 828 (88&#x00025;) GPs in practice across these three Health Boards agreed to refer patients into the trial. Practices were randomly assigned to either arm of the trial using a minimisation technique (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib14">Pocock, 1983</xref>, pp 84&#x02013;86) to ensure that the two groups were balanced for size of practice, historical referral rate and social deprivation index.</p><p>During the period March 1998 to November 1999, any woman referred from participating GP practices to the regional clinical genetics department for breast cancer genetic risk counselling was invited to take part in the trial. To be eligible for the trial, women had to live in the region, be able to give informed consent and had to complete a baseline questionnaire. Women who were symptomatic or had been diagnosed with breast and&#x0002f;or ovarian cancer were excluded from the trial as were those who had previously consulted another clinic about their family history of cancer. Those who were ineligible to participate were offered the standard regional service.</p></sec><sec><title>Procedure</title><p>Potential participants were sent an information sheet and were invited to return the consent form to indicate whether they were willing to participate in the trial. Those who consented were then asked to complete a baseline questionnaire. Reminders were sent to all nonresponders after approximately 4 weeks. Only those who completed the baseline questionnaire were enrolled in the trial. Nonresponders and those who did not consent to participate in the trial were offered the standard regional service. The service offered to women who returned a completed baseline questionnaire was dependent on the arm of the trial to which their GP practice had been randomised.</p><sec><title>Standard (regional) service</title><p>Women were sent a family history form and a baseline questionnaire to complete. The family history form requested information about first-, second- and third-degree relatives. If the family history form was not returned, a letter was sent to the woman and to her GP to explain that no consultation was possible without this information. A genetics consultant (MS) and genetics nurse specialist (JC) assigned categorical risk assessments informed by published criteria (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p content-type="table-title">Criteria for assessing a significantly increased risk of breast cancer (Cancer Research Campaign, 1997)</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" border="1" width="85%"><colgroup><col align="left"/></colgroup><tbody valign="top"><tr><td align="left" valign="top" charoff="50">A woman's risk of developing breast cancer is moderately increased if she has one of the following:</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" charoff="50">&#x02022;&#x02003;A first-degree relative with breast cancer diagnosed under 40 years.</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" charoff="50">&#x02022;&#x02003;Two first- or second-degree relatives on the same side of the family with breast cancer diagnosed under 60 years or with ovarian cancer.</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" charoff="50">&#x02022;&#x02003;Three first- or second-degree relatives on the same side of the family with breast or ovarian cancer.</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" charoff="50">&#x02022;&#x02003;A first-degree relative with breast cancer in both breasts.</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" charoff="50">&#x02022;&#x02003;A first-degree <italic>male</italic> relative with breast cancer.</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap>) using the information on the completed family history form. If necessary, further information and&#x0002f;or confirmation of relatives&#x02019; diagnoses were obtained by a genealogist and from the Scottish Cancer Registry. When a woman was assessed as being at &#x02018;low risk&#x02019; (i.e. not at significantly increased risk), she and her GP were sent a letter to explain this. Women assessed as being at &#x02018;moderate&#x02019; or &#x02018;high risk&#x02019;, or where an adequate risk assessment could not be made from the information available, an appointment at the familial breast cancer clinic were offered. The clinic consultation offered more detailed discussion with a genetics consultant about risk status and with a specialist breast surgeon about options for risk management (i.e. breast cancer screening and, for &#x02018;high-risk&#x02019; women, prophylactic mastectomy or chemoprevention). Clinical breast examination and mammography (where appropriate) were carried out at this visit. After this appointment, the patient's GP was sent a letter to summarise the issues discussed. All women were asked to complete a postal follow-up questionnaire 4 weeks and 6 months later.</p></sec><sec><title>Novel (community-based) service</title><p>All women in this arm of the trial were sent an initial appointment for one of the community-based clinics (held in a GP practice near to where they lived), run by a genetics nurse specialist (RC&#x0002f;RT). At the clinic, the genetics nurse specialist ascertained the woman's family history of cancer and compiled a family tree. This information was compared to published criteria (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) to determine whether she was at significantly increased risk. When an adequate risk assessment could not be made during the appointment, further information and&#x0002f;or confirmation of relatives&#x02019; diagnoses were obtained from the patient or medical records, before the patient was informed of their risk by letter. Women deemed not to be at significantly increased risk (i.e. in the &#x02018;low-risk&#x02019; category) were offered information and reassurance and were discharged from the clinic. These patients and their GPs were sent a letter reaffirming their &#x02018;low-risk&#x02019; status and summarising the issues discussed at the appointment. Women found to be at increased risk (i.e. in the &#x02018;moderate-risk&#x02019; or &#x02018;high-risk&#x02019; categories) were offered an appointment at the regional centre with a geneticist and genetics nurse specialist.

They were asked to rate whether the frequency of any of these behaviours had changed since consulting genetics services (at 4 weeks) or in the last 6 months (at 6 months) on a scale from 1 (<italic>much less than before</italic>) to 5 (<italic>much more than before</italic>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Statistical methods</title><p>Descriptive statistics were generated to describe the study participants.

At 6 months, there were no significant differences between the two groups in the proportion of women who reported changing any of their health behaviours in the last 6 months.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The present study responded to an urgent need for empirical evidence to inform the development of cancer genetics services in South East Scotland. A novel community-based service to provide genetic risk counselling for women with a family history of breast cancer was compared to the existing standard regional service.</p><p>The initial response rate to invitations to participate was good with 75&#x00025; of the women invited agreeing to take part in the trial. The participation rates at each assessment point were satisfactory (baseline: 87&#x00025;; 4 weeks: 74&#x00025;; 6 months: 71&#x00025;) with 65&#x00025; of those enrolled in the trial completing all three questionnaires. The amount of data lost due to administrative reasons was comparable across the trial arms.</p><p>Women who dropped out of the study tended to be in the novel service arm of the trial or at low risk of breast cancer. The latter finding is not unexpected since these women may have been less motivated to continuing participating in a study of cancer genetics services which they were ineligible to receive. However, the women who dropped out of the study had greater levels of psychological distress. As these women may have dropped out in an effort to reduce their high levels of distress, they could perhaps benefit from further psychological intervention. Similar findings have been demonstrated by a previous trial of cancer genetics services (i.e. <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib2">Brain <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>). Given these potential participation biases, the results should be interpreted with caution in regard to their generalisability to a wider population.</p><p>The cluster randomisation strategy resulted in comparable trial arms at baseline in terms of sociodemographic and psychological characteristics. However, a greater proportion of women in the novel service arm were assigned a low risk of breast cancer. Further investigation is warranted to determine if this finding is due to chance or differences between the trial arms in terms of the method of risk assignment or the accuracy of family history details reported by participants.</p><p>At baseline, subjectively rated understanding of issues related to breast cancer genetic risk was relatively low (mean scores&#x0003d;9.4 for the standard service arm &#x0002f;8.9 for the novel service arm out of a possible 16) and this was reflected in the objective assessment of understanding. On average, correct responses were given to about one-third of the breast cancer genetics items and to about two-thirds of the mammography items. About one-third of participants were suffering from &#x02018;case-level&#x02019; distress. This is comparable to the findings in other samples of women prior to genetic risk counselling using the same measure and threshold (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib7">Cull <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>,<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib8">2001</xref>) and to published data from the general population (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib9">Goldberg and Williams, 1988</xref>). Mean scores on the Cancer Worry Scale were similar to those reported in women prior to genetic risk counselling by <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib16">Watson <italic>et al</italic> (1998)</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib2">Brain <italic>et al</italic> (2000)</xref> and slightly lower than those reported by <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib10">Hopwood <italic>et al</italic> (2001)</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib1">Bish <italic>et al</italic> (2002)</xref>.</p><p>The findings show that after consulting cancer genetics services, many of the short-term improvements in psychological outcomes experienced across participants were maintained up to 6 months. All participants reported greater subjective understanding of issues related to breast cancer risk and these improvements were most marked up to 4 weeks and were generally sustained up to 6 months. However, for the women at low risk of breast cancer in the standard service arm of the trial, unlike all other participant groups, these improvements did not reach statistical significance. This may be due to the fact that the majority of these women received a letter informing them about their low risk and were not offered a face-to-face consultation. Improvements in subjective understanding across participants were reflected by improvements in objective understanding which were again most evident between baseline and 4 weeks and were commonly maintained at a similar level up to 6 months. Although participants at low risk of breast cancer in the standard service arm did not feel that their subjective understanding had improved as much as the other participants, there were no differences between trial arms or risk groups in significant improvements on objectively assessed understanding.</p><p>It was reassuring to find that despite improvements in objective knowledge, the proportion of women suffering from &#x02018;case-level&#x02019; distress decreased up to 4 weeks and cancer worry continued to decrease up to 6 months. Unlike previous research that found significant reductions in cancer worry only for those women at low or moderate risk of breast cancer (i.e. <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib4">Brain <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>), reductions in cancer worry in the present study were not dependent on objective risk.</p><p>Women's perceptions of their risk of breast cancer were altered during the course of the study with significantly fewer women overall perceiving their risk as low at 4 weeks, than at baseline. More women who were informed about a low risk of breast cancer perceived their risk of breast cancer as low following their risk assessment, as may be expected. Similar findings have been reported elsewhere (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib1">Bish <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>). This suggests that the accuracy of perceived risk for the low-risk group improved during the course of the study. However, given the fact that responses to only one of the <italic>ad-hoc</italic> items were analysed for the purposes of this report and the accuracy of participants' risk perceptions was not assessed in this study, it is difficult to make any firm conclusions from these results. However, there is no evidence to suggest that learning that your risk of developing breast cancer is greater than you believed prior to genetic risk counselling causes psychological distress (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib7">Cull <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib17">Watson <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>).</p><p>This study has shown that the novel community-based model of breast cancer genetics services is generally comparable to the existing standard regional service in terms of the psychological outcomes experienced by recipients. Therefore, decisions regarding the implementation of the novel model of services should be based on additional factors such as the resources required and client satisfaction with the service. These factors have been investigated and will be published separately.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Gordon Murray for assistance with the randomisation procedure and Jacqui Calder for administrative support.
