A key strategic question is how to maximize placebo responses in clinical practice, with the goal of improving treatment outcomes and patient benefit (<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Placebo responses are generally defined as positive treatment outcomes that are caused by nonspecific treatment effects, such as the quality of patient&#x02013;doctor communication, patients&#x02019; expectations toward the benefit of a treatment, or associative learning procedures such as conditioning (<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).

The experimental evidence in rodents and humans demonstrating behavioral conditioned immunopharmacological effects suggests that associative learning procedures may be an effective and ethical unproblematic supportive strategy for pharmacological regimens in clinical situations. The aim would be to use the learned immunopharmacological response to substitute for a portion of the pharmacological agent, thereby reducing drug-induced unwanted adverse effects for the patient benefit (<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).</p><p>Based on studies in experimental animals, we previously established a taste-immune conditioning paradigm in healthy human subjects (<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), in which the calcineurin-inhibitor cyclosporine A (CsA) as an unconditioned stimulus is paired with a novel-tasting drink, the conditioned stimulus (CS). After several unconditioned stimulus&#x02013;CS pairings during the acquisition (training) phase, the CS (drink) is presented together with placebo pills during the evocation. Reexposure to the CS induced a learned immunosuppressive effect, reflected by reduced cytokine (interleukin-2, IFN-&#x003b3;) production and cytokine mRNA expression in peripheral blood lymphocytes (<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). This conditioned immunosuppressive effect can be reproduced (<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), and extinction of the learned immunosuppression can be inhibited, by combining reexposures to the CS with low- or subtherapeutic doses of the drug (<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). These phase 1, proof-of-concept studies in healthy subjects demonstrate that the intense, bidirectional communication between the brain and the peripheral immune system can be exploited to induce learned placebo responses in immune functions (<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>).</p><p>The intake of immunosuppressive drugs has serious adverse effects such as increased cardiovascular morbidity, nephrotoxicity, neurotoxicity, and hypertension (<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Reducing medication dosage without diminishing medication efficacy could improve clinical care for postorgan transplantation and chronic inflammatory autoimmune diseases. In clinical routine, the majority of these patients will already be receiving immunosuppressive treatment before possibly participating in an immunosuppressive learning paradigm as a supportive therapy. It is not clear, however, whether such patients could safely benefit form dose reduction through placebo-conditioning paradigms.</p><p>Thus, in this study, we combined a taste-immune conditioning paradigm in renal transplanted patients, who were already receiving an immunosuppressive drug regimen with calcineurin-inhibitors (CsA or tacrolimus). After analyzing baseline kinetic of immune functions and neuroendocrine parameters under routine drug intake, patients combined their medication with a novel gustatory stimulus serving as CS twice a day for 3 consecutive days (acquisition). During evocation days, in addition to their morning and evening drug intake, patients received placebo pills at two additional points during the day, together with the gustatory CS.

In this study with kidney transplant patients, long-term treated with immunosuppressive drugs cyclosporine A or tacrolimus, the introduction of a taste-immune conditioning procedure induced a significant learned inhibition of T cell proliferative capacity. The conditioning paradigm increased the effectiveness of the medications without any increase in medication dose. These data provide a proof of concept that learned placebo responses in immune functions can be employed as additional therapy during immunosuppressive treatment to maximize treatment efficacy.</p><p>The phenomenon of learned immune responses is based on two phenomena: On the one hand, it depends on the intense bidirectional communication between the CNS and the immune system (<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), and on the other hand, it relies on the ability of an organism to &#x0201c;learn&#x0201d; a physiological reflex via associative learning processes (classical or behavioral conditioning) (<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Experimental evidence in rodents and healthy human subjects has demonstrated behaviorally conditioned immunosuppressive effects, both in humoral and cellular immune functions (<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Employing the calcineurin-inhibitor CsA as an unconditioned stimulus in a taste-immune learning paradigm, we explored this phenomenon of learned immunosuppression as part of a conditioning-induced placebo response in healthy male subjects. These studies demonstrate that the learned immune response, reflected by inhibition of cytokine production, can be reproduced during a second, unreinforced reexposure to the CS (<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>); that the learned immune response can be induced by associative learning solely, and not via patient expectations (<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>); and that extinction of the learned immunosuppressive response can be inhibited when subtherapeutic dosages of the immunosuppressant drug are applied together with the CS during prolonged evocation (<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).</p><p>Previous experimental data in rodents and healthy subjects supported the notion that classical conditioning of immunosuppressive drug responses is a promising tool that could be used to improve treatment outcomes. For example, evidence in rodents indicated that pretreatment with immunosuppressive drugs seems not to affect conditioned immune functions (<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). However, the question arose of whether and to what extent patients already receiving long-term immunosuppressive therapy with calcineurin inhibitors such as CsA of tacrolimus (Tac) could still develop a learned immunosuppression. The data provided here demonstrate that implementing a taste-immune learning protocol into an unchanged drug regimen in long-term immunosuppressed renal transplant patients resulted in a learned immunosuppression reflected by an inhibition of T cell activity.</p><p>The potential clinical applicability of learned immunosuppressive responses has been convincingly demonstrated in rodents, where conditioned immune responses significantly reduced mortality in animals with inflammatory autoimmune disease and significantly reduced allergic responses or prolonged the survival time of transplanted vascularized organs (<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). These learned immune responses in rodents, as well as in healthy human subjects, were induced in the absence of any drug application or significantly reduced drug dosages administered during the evocation trials (<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). These data suggest that learned immune responses may have a role as supportive therapy into an immunosuppressive regimen to maximize treatment efficacy and significantly decrease drug dosages, with the aim of reducing unwanted drug adverse effects (<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Furthermore, the toxic adverse effects of immunosuppressive substances such as calcineurin inhibitors (cardiovascular morbidity, nephrotoxicity, neurotoxicity, and hypertension) are predominantly caused by the pharmacological substance itself (<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). The behavioral conditioned immunosuppression exploits the brain&#x02013;immune communication with significantly reduced drug dosages. We do not have yet direct evidence for potential reduction of long-term toxic drug adverse effects. However, we do know that the learned immunosuppression with CsA is diminishing the calcineurin activity, and that this effect seemed to be mediated via adrenoreceptors and distinct intracellular mechanisms compared with the drug effect (<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>).</p><p>The precise mechanisms steering these learned placebo responses in immune functions in immunosuppressed patients are unclear. The learned immunosuppressive changes were neither associated with significant changes in cytokine mRNA expression, T lymphocyte numbers, plasma levels of cortisol, or catecholamines, nor associated with changes in cardiovascular or behavioral measures. In rodents, the conditioned immunosuppressive effects using CsA as an unconditioned stimulus are centrally mediated in the CNS via the insular cortex and the amygdala (<xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). In the periphery, the learned inhibition of calcineurin activity in lymphocytes seemed to be mainly mediated via noradrenergic innervation of lymphatic organs such as the spleen and &#x003b2;-adrenoreceptor-dependent mechanisms (<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). In addition, noradrenaline plasma levels were significantly correlated with the learned suppression of interleukin-2 levels in healthy volunteers (<xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). However, we could not identify any correlation between the learned T cell responses and sympathetic adrenal activity in the patient data presented here. In addition, patients receiving &#x003b2;-adrenoreceptor antagonists (<italic>n</italic> = 20) did not significantly differ in their learned T cell response from patients taking no &#x003b2;-blockers (<italic>n</italic> = 10). Further studies have to analyze the mechanisms mediating the learned immune responses in immunosuppressed patients.</p><p>The present study demonstrates the proof of principle that learned immunosuppressive placebo responses can be introduced into an ongoing immunosuppressive pharmacological regimen in renal transplant patients. There are a number of limitations, however, regarding possible clinical applicability of such learning strategies in clinical routine. The results of this study need to be replicated with a larger number of transplant patients over a longer period of time. Future studies have to examine whether these results also apply to patients with different requirements of long-term immunosuppressive therapy, such as chronic, inflammatory autoimmune diseases. In this context, it needs to be determined whether and to what extent the taste cues are essential in this learning paradigm to induce learned immunosuppressive effects. In healthy humans, extinction of the learned immunosuppressive response could be prevented by administering low therapeutic dosages of the drug together with the CS, inducing a reconsolidation process in the immune response (<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). In addition, inhibition of T cell proliferation or cytokine mRNA expression in lymphocyte are indicators of an immunosuppressive response; whether and to what extent this is also a corresponding marker for disease activity or the rejection process of transplanted organs has to be determined.</p><p>In general, analyzing long-term drug intake from the perspective of associative learning processes, behavioral conditioning of drug responses may be a promising tool that could be used as a placebo-based dose reduction strategy to limit unwanted drug adverse effects and to improve treatment efficacy (<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). For immunosuppressive regimens in particular, there is a need to understand which properties of which immunopharmacological agents can be behaviorally conditioned and which reinforcement schedules should be used to achieve optimal effects and prevent habituation or extinction of the learned immunopharmacological responses.</p><p>In summary, the clinical exploitation of learned placebo responses in immune functions is still in a very early stage. The data presented here provide experimental evidence that learned immunopharmacological responses can be implemented into ongoing immunosuppressive therapy in renal transplant patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s6"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s7"><title>Patients.</title><p>Thirty renal transplanted patients (24 male, 6 female) with stable kidney function for at least 6 mo participated in the study (sociodemographic variables are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t01">Table 1</xref>).

All patients gave written informed consent and were provided full transparency about the background and procedure of the study. The conditioning paradigm was fully explained, and patients understood that the placebos that accompanied the CS drink during evocation were inactive/inert. On day 1 (baseline), patients were invited to the clinic, and blood was drawn at 2, 6 and 10 h after drug intake (9 AM) to analyze immunological and neuroendocrine parameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3</xref>). Days 2, 3, and 4 constituted acquisition, during which patients were asked to combine their immunosuppressive drug intake (CsA or Tac) at 9 AM and 9 PM, together with 50 mL of a green-colored novel gustatory stimulus consisting of colored strawberry milk, lavender oil, and green food coloring, employed as the CS in this taste-immune conditioning paradigm. After a 2-d break, during which the drug intake was not combined with the CS (drink), the evocation phase was performed on study days 7 and 8, where morning and evening drug intake was again combined with the CS (drink). In addition, patients received placebo pills 4 h (at 1 PM) as well as 8 h (at 5 PM) together with the CS to increase the salience of the CS as a medical intervention and to closely mimic the situation of taking the CS always together with a medication. The second evocation day (study day 8) was performed in the clinic after the identical procedure as the previous evocation day (drug intake + CS at 9 AM; placebo pill intake + CS at 1 AM and 5 PM). In addition, blood samples were taken at three points, 2, 6, and 10 h after morning drug intake (9 AM), to compare the neuroendocrine and immunological parameters with the baseline measure. Importantly, all patients did not change their medication schedules during the 8 d of the study: neither the immunosuppressive medication nor the accompanying medication.</p><fig id="fig03" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 3.</label><caption><p>During baseline measures (day 1; without any drug-cue association), blood samples were taken at three different times: 2, 6, and 10 h after morning (9 AM) drug intake.
