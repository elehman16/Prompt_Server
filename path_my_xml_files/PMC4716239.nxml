Although the overall incidence of stroke has been recently declining, the incidence of stroke in young adults is increasing. Traditional vascular risk factors are the main cause of young ischaemic stroke. Acupuncture has been shown to benefit stroke rehabilitation and ameliorate the risk factors for stroke. The aims of this study were to determine whether acupuncture treatment will be effective in improving the activities of daily living (ADL), motor function and quality of life (QOL) in patients of young ischaemic stroke, and in preventing stroke recurrence by controlling blood pressure, lipids and body weight.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>In this randomised, sham-controlled, participant-blinded and assessor-blinded clinical trial, 120 patients between 18 and 45&#x02005;years of age with a recent (within 1&#x02005;month) ischaemic stroke will be randomised for an 8-week acupuncture or sham acupuncture treatment. The primary outcome will be the Barthel Index for ADL. The secondary outcomes will include the Fugl-Meyer Assessment for motor function; the World Health Organization Quality of Life BREF (WHOQOL-BREF) for QOL; and risk factors that are measured by ambulatory blood pressure, the fasting serum lipid, body mass index and waist circumference. Incidence of adverse events and long-term mortality and recurrence rate during a 10-year and 30-year follow-up will also be investigated.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>Ethics approval was obtained from the Ethics Committee of The Third Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang Chinese Medical University. Protocol V.3 was approved in June 2013. The results will be disseminated in a peer-reviewed journal and presented at international congresses. The results will also be disseminated to patients by telephone during follow-up calls enquiring on the patient's post-study health status.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number</title><p>ChiCTR-TRC- 13003317; Pre-results.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>young</kwd><kwd>acupuncture</kwd><kwd>randomized</kwd><kwd>sham-controlled</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Strengths and limitations of this study</title></caption><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>This will be the first study protocol concerning the effect of acupuncture for treating and preventing stroke specifically in young adults.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Methodological strengths included: rigorous randomised, sham-controlled, participants-blinded and assessors-blinded, and lengthy follow-ups.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The sham acupuncture (superficial needle insertion and minimal stimulation at non-acupoint and non-meridian areas) may be associated with larger effects than pharmacological and other physical placebos, and produce some physiological activity.</p></list-item></list></boxed-text><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Stroke is one of the most frequent causes of death and chronic disability in China.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Although the overall incidence of stroke has been recently declining, the incidence of stroke in young adults is increasing. Approximately 10&#x02013;14% of ischaemic strokes occur in adults between 18 and 45&#x02005;years of age.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> While a specific definition of &#x02018;young stroke&#x02019; does not exist, the vast majority of authors consider &#x02018;young stroke&#x02019; as strokes that occur in individuals under 45&#x02005;years of age.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> For the purposes of this research, we defined &#x02018;young stroke&#x02019; as strokes occurring in adults between 18 and 45&#x02005;years of age and designed a randomised clinical trial to address the particular needs and differences of this younger age group.</p><p>The causes of young stroke are heterogeneous; however, traditional vascular risk factors, such as hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, obesity, smoking, alcohol drinking, and diabetes mellitus, are suggested to be the main risk factors.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> This finding challenges the traditional view that young stroke is often caused by &#x02018;rare&#x02019; events.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Stroke in the younger age group may have a dramatic impact on the quality of life (QOL) for survivors, given their longer life expectancy and life stage. This age group has a longer life expectancy than do older adults who suffer from strokes; also, these adults are likely to be wage-earning caregivers for either children and/or ageing parents. Disability from young stroke may create an additional economic burden on the family along with a societal impact. Owing to the potentially greater impact of disability-adjusted life years for this age group, more attention should be paid to the rehabilitation programme and prevention of recurrence of young stroke.</p><p>Our previous two separate clinical trials, one for subacute stroke and the other for acute stroke, have been investigating the impact of acupuncture on stroke outcomes overall.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> During this investigation, we have found that young adults with stroke may obtain &#x02018;De Qi&#x02019; more easily and recover better than do older patients (&#x02018;De Qi&#x02019; is an acupuncture term for the sensation of &#x02018;qi&#x02019; arriving on the needle, also known as &#x02018;obtaining qi&#x02019;, causing the acupuncture needle to elicit the patient's feeling of soreness, numbness, distension, heaviness or electric shock around the point together with the practitioner's feeling of tenseness around the needle). A literature search for &#x02018;acupuncture for young stroke&#x02019; did not yield any results, while intervention outcomes may have a different impact on young stroke. To date, most of the literature that is focused on young stroke comprises observational studies and few intervention studies have been published. Randomised clinical trials that investigate the impact of acupuncture on young stroke are currently scarce. Therefore, the role of acupuncture in young stroke treatment deserved further study.</p><p>Acupuncture originated more than 3000&#x02005;years ago in China and has gained popularity in the USA since the late 1970s.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Over its 2500&#x02005;years of development, a wealth of experience has accumulated in the practice of acupuncture for stroke treatment and prevention. According to a report by the WHO in 2002, &#x02018;strokes and their sequelae are another major indication for acupuncture.&#x02019;<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Furthermore, recent reviews have shown positive, but limited, effectiveness of acupuncture as an adjunct treatment to the conventional care of stroke.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11&#x02013;13</xref> Acupuncture has also been reported to have benefits for treating risk factors for stroke, including hypertension, hyperlipidaemia and obesity.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14&#x02013;16</xref> This intervention modality has a long history of safety and efficacy. As long as trained practitioners perform acupuncture using clean needle techniques, it is a generally safe procedure;<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> however, some studies were at risk of bias. Future studies should focus on the appropriate modality of acupuncture intervention, sham controls, the appropriate length of treatment and the development of more precise tools to assess outcomes.</p><p>This clinical trial focuses on young ischaemic stroke. The study will test the hypotheses that acupuncture (when compared with a sham control group) will be effective in improving several outcome measures after a first-time young stroke, as well as improving risk factors that are associated with recurrent stroke. The outcome measures will include independence in activities of daily living (ADL), motor function and QOL. The risk factors that will be examined include blood pressure (BP), lipids and body weight.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design</title><p>This is a 20-week, single-centre, randomised, sham-controlled, participant-blinded and assessor-blinded, exploratory clinical trial.

ChiCTR-TRC-13003317) and will be conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. We will recruit participants by advertising in the local newspapers, health-related TV programmes, internet and WeChat in Hangzhou city. We will conduct this trial in the acupuncture and rehabilitation departments of a teaching hospital that is located in the centre of Hangzhou city. There are 50 beds in the inpatient clinic and 80 beds in the outpatient clinic of the acupuncture department, and 60 beds in the rehabilitation department. All patients will provide written informed consent. The research coordinator will arrange an in-person meeting with potential participants to discuss the study in detail (ie, the study purpose, procedures and time commitment, as well as the potential risks and benefits associated with participation in the study) and to obtain written informed consent. The confidentiality of participant records will be protected. At the time of enrolment, each patient will be assigned a unique study identification number, which is the only direct identifier included on all study paper forms and in the electronic database. During and after the trial, all records will remain secure, either in a locked filing cabinet in a secure area or in password-protected computer files. Compensation for trial participants for trial-related harms will be provided by The Third Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang Chinese Medical University and will be made on a case-by-case basis. All hospital and medical care related to any possible harm from the trial will be provided free of charge to the patient.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Patient population</title><p>Patients between 18 and 45&#x02005;years of age with a recent (within 1&#x02005;month) ischaemic stroke are eligible for this study. Patients who will be included as eligible participants should display clear consciousness and stable vital signs, with a modified Rankin Score (mRS) 2&#x02013;4, and have no aphasia or cognitive dysfunction.</p><p>The exclusion criteria will include patients with intracranial lesions or cerebrovascular disease history that have caused sequelae, such as movement disorders, mood disorders, cognitive dysfunction or speech problems; or individuals who are pregnant or breast feeding. Patients with serious diseases that are related to the heart, liver, kidney or haematopoietic system will not be allowed to participate. Patients who are not interested in this study or are participating in other clinical trials will also be excluded. To increase the credibility of the sham control, patients with prior experience of acupuncture will be excluded from our final protocol. Since many people in China have previously received acupuncture, this exclusion criterion may prolong the study period by excluding otherwise eligible participants. Nevertheless, we believe that this exclusion category will improve the quality of the research by providing a more effective sham control. Changes that affect trial participants directly will be explained in person by their coordinators.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Randomisation and blinding</title><p>Randomisation will be computer generated by independent research staff using SAS 9.3 software (order number: 99TKBM). The generated list of random numbers will be placed into sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes. Consecutive patients will be randomly assigned to an acupuncture group (AG) or a sham acupuncture group (SG) in a 1:1 ratio according to the information received from the envelopes. Two acupuncture doctors will be designated to perform the acupuncture treatment for the AG or SG separately. The study coordinator, who will not be involved in treatment or assessment, will inform the participants that they will receive either a &#x02018;traditional Chinese acupuncture&#x02019; (verum) or a &#x02018;less-painful acupuncture developed especially for this study&#x02019; (sham).

For scalp acupuncture, the needle is swiftly inserted into the subcutaneous tissue of the scalp in a horizontal direction. When the tip of the needle reaches the subgaleal layer and the practitioner feels low insertion resistance, the needle is further inserted to a depth of 30&#x02013;40&#x02005;mm by the twirling method. Three needles are used for each area. For body acupuncture, the needle is inserted into the points to a depth of between 30 and 40&#x02005;mm according to different regions. Manual stimulation will be applied to the needles until the patients experience the needling sensation (called &#x02018;Deqi&#x02019; in Chinese acupuncture). For electroacupuncture of CV12 (Zhong wan) and CV10 (Xia wan), ST25 (Tianshu, 2 sides) points, SDZ-&#x02161;B Nerve and Muscle Stimulator (Suzhou Medical Appliance Factory, Suzhou, China) will be used to give continuous high-frequency (50&#x02005;Hz) stimulus. The intensity is adjusted to a level that is tolerable to the patient (usually about 3&#x02013;5 grade, with a possible scope of 1&#x02013;65 gradients of intensity).</p></fn><fn><p>&#x02020;Manipulations of sham acupuncture. The same stainless needles (0.25&#x02005;mm&#x000d7;40&#x02005;mm, described above) will be used. For body acupuncture, 20 needles will be inserted 1&#x02005;cm lateral away from the actual acupoints; and the same electroacupuncture instrument will be used, but only with 1 grade of intensity. For scalp acupuncture, needles will be inserted 1&#x02005;cm anterior away from the motor area and the sensory area of the lesion side.</p></fn><fn><p>&#x02021;Manipulations of two groups. The acupuncturists of two groups will insert needles in about 5&#x02013;7&#x02005;min, during which time minimal interaction with the patients will be made. Then the patients are left alone to rest for 30&#x02005;min (the needle retention period for body acupuncture is 30&#x02005;min, while that for scalp acupuncture is 4&#x02005;h). At the end of each treatment, the needles will be removed quickly within 3&#x02013;5&#x02005;min, and minimal social interaction is made. Patients receive no additional attention, training or interaction as a result of the acupuncture session, thereby standardising the treatment and control groups.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Outcome measures</title><sec id="s2f1"><title>The primary outcome</title><p>The primary outcome will be the Barthel Index (BI) for independence in ADL.

To improve the fine motor control poststroke and obtain more independence in ADL will require a higher level of recovery. Therefore, any treatments that contribute to functional rehabilitation should not be ignored, including traditional acupuncture. Despite the controversy in recent years concerning the role of acupuncture as a routine treatment for stroke, acupuncture may help to improve neurological deficits without important side effects,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25&#x02013;27</xref> and is well accepted as part of comprehensive rehabilitation strategies in China.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Prevention of ischaemic stroke recurrence in young patients also remains an important clinical problem. Acupuncture may not only be helpful in the treatment of poststroke rehabilitation without significant side effects but may also have the effect of regulating BP and lipid counts, as well as facilitate losing weight at the same time.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> The acupuncture points used in this trial were designed for treating stroke and risk factors, which were selected in compliance with traditional Chinese medical principles and confirmed by modern research studies.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Moreover, since acupuncture reactions and &#x02018;De Qi&#x02019; are much easier to achieve in young adults, acupuncture treatment in these patients is expected to achieve better therapeutic effects.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></p><p>This trial focuses on ADL as the primary outcome because the ultimate goal of stroke rehabilitation is to improve the ADL of patients towards greater independence. Motor dysfunction is the most important sequela after stroke and has a significant impact on ADL measurements. Since young adults have a longer expected lifespan after the incidence of stroke, the QOL should also be considered. As a result, FMA and WHO-QOL were chosen as two secondary outcomes of treatment efficacy. Young patients have a much longer exposure to risk of a recurrent vascular event than do older patients, based on their age alone. Therefore, the study also examines risk-factor-related outcomes and the prevention of recurrent stroke by employing acupuncture for controlling hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, excessive weight and abdominal obesity. In addition, AEs and long-term outcomes with respect to recurrent events and mortality will be observed. In summary, the comprehensive rehabilitation and efficient secondary prevention of stroke in young individuals may greatly increase the number of productive years with good QOL. To the best of our knowledge, this will be the first trial of a rigorous, randomised, sham-controlled trial of acupuncture that was designed specifically for treating and preventing young stroke.</p><p>There is a limitation in our trial that should be acknowledged. Including a third &#x02018;no acupuncture&#x02019; group will improve the control design in our acupuncture trial. The possibility of a placebo effect, particularly for those who believe in traditional medicine, should not be dismissed; however, sham acupuncture interventions might, on average, be associated with larger effects than pharmacological and other physical placebos.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Some of the sham acupuncture methods may also produce physiological activity.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> The nature of the placebo effect that is associated with sham acupuncture is an entire field of study unto itself. We consulted several Chinese acupuncture experts, many of whom believed that the effect of acupuncture for stroke is closely related with the stimulation of acupoints and meridians and &#x02018;De Qi,&#x02019; which is in accordance with the ancient TCM theory that states, &#x02018;no De Qi, no effects.&#x02019; These experts believe that sham acupuncture that is designed as &#x02018;superficial needle insertion and minimal stimulation at non-acupoint and non-meridian areas&#x02019; in this trial could produce a placebo effect, but with no additional efficacy (or that a reduced influence by the sham acupuncture could be ignored when compared with real acupuncture). Nevertheless, in an acupuncture analgesia clinical trial, a sham acupuncture (of any type) could produce additional influence beyond that of a placebo. In our experience, sham acupuncture may produce different effects in different diseases. This may be because of the different mechanisms of acupuncture treatment for different diseases. For example, stroke is a major and complex disease while acupuncture treatment for stroke should focus on regulating the whole body and under the guideline of TCM theory. For painful syndromes, acupuncture treatment is much simpler to perform and easier to produce effects even if we do not select acupoints and meridians and only use local points. In this respect, the influence of sham acupuncture for pain may be greater than that for stroke. Taking into account that sham acupuncture may have little effect on the treatment of stroke, but could eliminate the placebo effect, we reasoned that sham acupuncture is an ideal control setting in this trial so long as it is well conducted. This conclusion is based on our clinical practice and requires further study. We will consider the nature of sham acupuncture in future studies to maximise the avoidance of this limitation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Stroke in young adults requires a higher level of recovery and an effective prevention of recurrence.
