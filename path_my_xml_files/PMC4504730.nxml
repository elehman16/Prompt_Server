They offer the promise of eliciting a more integrated immune response and more abundant and sustained expression of the encoded viral antigens. Although a vaccine to prevent human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection remains an urgent global health priority, concerns about the safety of using live-attenuated HIV itself as a vaccine [<xref rid="OFV082C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] has led the field to focus heavily on the exploration of replication-defective viral vectors to deliver HIV-1 antigens. There are limited data to suggest these vectors are able to induce an optimal, integrated immune response, which may include CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell help for B-cell/antibody and polyfunctional cytotoxic T-cell responses together with long-term immunologic memory [<xref rid="OFV082C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. To date, only 1 replication-defective viral vector, based on canarypox, administered sequentially with a gp120 subunit boost vaccine, has demonstrated partial protection from HIV acquisition in an efficacy trial [<xref rid="OFV082C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Currently, only a few replicating viruses, including vaccinia (clinical trial ID NCT01705223), Sendai virus (NCT01705990), measles (NCT01320176), and adenovirus subtype 4 (NCT01989533), have advanced to clinical trials as HIV-1 vaccine vectors. Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) is a member of the genus <italic>Vesiculovirus</italic> in the family <italic>Rhabdoviridae</italic>. The 2 major serotypes are New Jersey and Indiana. Vesicular stomatitis virus has a single-strand, negative-sense, nonsegmented RNA genome. Similar to Sendai and measles viruses, the virus genomic organization of VSV (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="OFV082F1">1</xref>A) and life cycle make it particularly attractive as a candidate vaccine vector because the genome can accommodate multiple gene inserts, is stable over many generations, and does not undergo recombination. In addition, the VSV genome replicates in the cytoplasm and is incapable of integrating within the genomes of infected host cells. Finally, VSV is a zoonosis, cycling between biting insects and livestock (cattle, horses, and swine). Human infection with VSV is rare in most regions of the world except in certain regions of Central and South America where VSV is endemic. Where VSV infection does occur, it is typically asymptomatic or is associated with an acute influenza-like illness with symptoms such as fever, muscle aches, and malaise [<xref rid="OFV082C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="OFV082C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Thus, the general population is largely free of pre-existing, virus-neutralizing immunity&#x02014;a factor that has limited the clinical utility of HIV-1 vaccines based on adenovirus subtype 5 [<xref rid="OFV082C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="OFV082C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].
<fig id="OFV082F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>(A) Wild-type vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) genome organization and virion structure. Viral transcription is polar, initiating at the single 3&#x02032; promoter and proceeding to the 5&#x02032; end of the genome, producing a steep 3&#x02032; to 5&#x02032; gradient of gene expression. The N protein encapsidates viral genomic RNA forming viral nucleocapsid; the M protein drives virus assembly and budding from infected cells, and the G protein forms trimers in host cell plasma membrane, which becomes the envelope of budding virus particles. The P and L proteins associate to form the viral RNA polymerase that copackages into virus particles with nucleocapsid, providing the components needed to initiate the next infectious cycle. The mature virus particle is bullet shaped (60 nm &#x000d7; 180 nm) with a lipid envelope and underlying M protein surrounding a dense nucleocapsid core. (B) The recombinant VSV human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 vaccine vector (rVSVN4CT1gag1). The vaccine construct encodes the HIV-1 gag transgene (strain HXB-2 p55 gag) in position one of the genome (gag1) to maximize gene expression, has the N gene translocated from first to fourth position (N4), and encodes a G protein that has the cytoplasmic tail truncated from 29 to 1 amino acid (CT1).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ofv08201"/></fig></p><p>Recombinant VSV (rVSV) has been extensively studied as a potential HIV vaccine vector in preclinical, nonhuman primate (NHP) models [<xref rid="OFV082C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="OFV082C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. After 2 sequential immunizations, rhesus macaques that received rVSV expressing HIV-1 <italic>env</italic> and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) <italic>gag</italic> were all infected but were protected from disease progression for 4 years or more after infection with SHIV 89.6P, maintaining low or undetectable viral load set points and preserved CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell counts [<xref rid="OFV082C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. This encouraging level of postchallenge protection from disease suggested that rVSV vectors expressing HIV genes might be an effective HIV vaccine in humans. To maximize safety for first-in-human clinical evaluation, a highly attenuated form of rVSV Indiana was developed. This involved downregulating VSV N protein expression by translocating the N gene further away from the 3&#x02032; transcription promoter and truncating the VSV G protein cytoplasmic tail from 29 amino acids found in wild-type virus to a single amino acid [<xref rid="OFV082C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In addition, HIV-1 <italic>gag</italic> expression was achieved by insertion of the <italic>gag</italic> gene adjacent to the 3&#x02032; transcription promoter (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="OFV082F1">1</xref>B). The resulting vector (rVSVN4CT1gag1) was shown to be safe, well tolerated, and immunogenic in several murine and NHP studies [<xref rid="OFV082C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="OFV082C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].

Sixty adults aged 18&#x02013;50 years who reported low behavioral risk for HIV infection and tested HIV-1-seronegative and were determined to be healthy based on medical history, physical exam, and laboratory tests were enrolled after providing written informed consent. Due to a potential concern for rare cases of neurovirulence associated with wild-type VSV infection [<xref rid="OFV082C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and to avoid misclassification of commonly experienced adverse events during trials (eg, headaches), individuals were excluded if they had a history of neurologic or neuropsychiatric disorders. In addition, given that this was a novel replicating vector vaccine, precautions were taken to exclude individuals in close contact with infants, the elderly, immunocompromised individuals, or persons with chronic lung disease.

Safety evaluations included physical examinations and standard clinical chemistry and hematological tests. Local injection site (pain, tenderness, redness, erythema, and induration) and systemic reactogenicity symptoms (malaise, headache, fever, chills, myalgias, arthralgias, nausea, vomiting, and fatigue) were assessed daily for 7 days following each vaccination or until resolution. Adverse events were graded based on the HVTN Table for Grading Severity of Adverse Experiences (<uri xlink:href="http://rsc.tech-res.com/Document/safetyandpharmacovigilance/Table_For_Grading_Severity_of_Adult_Pediatric_Adverse_Events.pdf">http://rsc.tech-res.com/Document/safetyandpharmacovigilance/Table_For_Grading_Severity_of_Adult_Pediatric_Adverse_Events.pdf</uri>). Participants were observed for 6 months after the last vaccination, and then they were contacted annually to complete 3 years of long-term follow-up. Additional safety monitoring included mini-mental state examinations at baseline and at each visit. Participants were also evaluated for any oral lesions that might be indicative of rVSV-induced pathology. To assess virus dissemination and shedding, blood, urine, and saliva samples were collected at days 3 and 7 postvaccination and swabs were taken from any oral lesions observed up to 2 weeks postvaccination. Test samples were thawed rapidly in a 37&#x000b0;C water bath, and duplicate 100 &#x000b5;L samples were then adsorbed to freshly confluent Vero cell monolayers, containing 100 &#x000b5;L Dulbecco's modified Eagles medium (DMEM) supplemented with 200 IU of penicillin, 200 &#x000b5;g/mL streptomycin, and 5 &#x000b5;g/mL fungizone in 24-well plates, for 15 minutes at room temperature followed by 30 minutes at 37&#x000b0;C.

Cytokine production was assessed after stimulation with a Gag Consensus B peptide pool (15-mers overlapping by 11 amino acids, 1 &#x000b5;g/mL for each peptide) as previously described [<xref rid="OFV082C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The 6-hour stimulation included brefeldin A (10 &#x003bc;g/mL; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and anti-CD28/anti-CD49d (each at 1 &#x003bc;g/mL; BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). Staphylococcus enterotoxin B (Sigma-Aldrich) was used as a positive control, and peptide diluent (dimethyl sulfoxide [DMSO] at a final concentration of 1%) was used as a negative control. Data were acquired on an LSRII and analyzed using FlowJo (Treestar, Inc., Ashland, OR). Positivity of the ICS responses of individual cytokines or cytokine combination was determined by a 1-sided Fisher's exact test applied to each peptide pool-specific response versus the negative control response with a discrete Bonferroni adjustment for the multiple comparisons due to testing against multiple peptide pools. Peptide pools with adjusted <italic>P</italic> values less than &#x003b1; = 0.00001 were considered positive.

There were no product-related SAEs, and no VSV was detected from samples of blood, urine, and saliva or from swabs of oral lesions. In contrast, a clinical study of a less attenuated form of rVSV, developed as an Ebola virus vaccine [<xref rid="OFV082C23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], demonstrated some severe reactogenicity events including arthritis, and vaccine virus was detected in blood, joint fluid, and skin vesicles. That vaccine, rVSV-ZEBOV, was attenuated by replacing the VSV G gene with the glycoprotein (GP) gene of Ebola virus generating an rVSV-GP pseudotype, which may alter virus tropism but does not constrain intracellular VSV replication. However, the rVSVN4CT1 vaccine platform described herein is attenuated by 2 different, stable genome modifications [<xref rid="OFV082C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="OFV082C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], resulting in significant growth attenuation in vitro. In HVTN 090, we found that VSV seroconversion was 100% after 2 vaccinations, with a dose-dependent increase in VSV nAb. More than 60% of vaccinees developed HIV-1-specific T-cell responses after the prime and boost at the highest dose tested (3.4 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7</sup> PFU), mediated almost entirely by CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and the magnitude of CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses to Gag correlated with VSV nAb titers. In addition, Gag p24 antibody was detected in one third of participants after 2 vaccinations at the highest dose.</p><p>Although some trials of vector-based HIV vaccines in humans have demonstrated lower levels of immunogenicity compared with their SIV-based homologs tested in preclinical NHP models [<xref rid="OFV082C24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="OFV082C25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], we found that the frequency and magnitude of HIV-1-specific T-cell immune responses were only modestly lower than predicted with the rVSV vector. In preclinical NHP immunogenicity studies, the rVSVN4CT1gag1 vector elicited a Gag-specific cellular immune response in a majority of animals, with an average of 200 IFN-&#x003b3; spot-forming cells (SFC)/million PBMCs after a single IM injection of 10<sup>7</sup> PFU of virus and over 500 SFC/million PBMCs after a booster dose with rVSVN4CT1gag1 serotype New Jersey, intended to minimize effects of antivector immunity [<xref rid="OFV082C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="OFV082C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. HVTN 090 showed comparable frequency, albeit somewhat lower magnitude ELISPOT responses (median of approximately 100 SFC/million PBMCs after 2 doses of rVSV<sub>IN</sub>), with a homologous serotype boost. It is notable that the observed boosting of T-cell responses after a second dose of the same rVSV<sub>IN</sub> vector indicates that future clinical development should consider regimens with homologous rVSV boosting.</p><p>There were a few limitations of this study. Two individuals did not receive their second doses of rVSV <italic>gag</italic> at 3.4 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7</sup> PFU, with consequent loss of data at this dose. Based on available data, this highest dose was taken forward as a boost for a DNA prime (HIV-1 multiantigen vaccine; Profectus BioSciences, Inc.) given with <italic>IL-12</italic> pDNA adjuvant and delivered IM with electroporation in another study, HVTN 087. Preliminary evidence suggests that this prime-boost regimen substantially enhanced HIV Gag-specific T-cell responses after vaccination with rVSV HIV-1 <italic>gag</italic> [<xref rid="OFV082C26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The rVSV prototype vaccine evaluated in both HVTN 087 and HVTN 090 encoded <italic>gag</italic> only, and, as expected, there were limited HIV-specific antibody responses generated. Given the correlation of vaccine-induced Env-specific responses with lower risk of HIV infection [<xref rid="OFV082C27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], Profectus has moved forward with development of a clinical candidate that encodes the <italic>env</italic> gene from an HIV-1 clade C transmitted/founder strain, 1086.C. This vaccine elicited a robust Env-specific humoral response in guinea pigs (unpublished data) and has been manufactured in preparation for clinical evaluation in a DNA/rVSV prime-boost study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>In summary, these first-in-human data demonstrate that an attenuated replication-competent rVSV vaccine is both safe and immunogenic, and it is a promising candidate for future HIV vaccine development.
