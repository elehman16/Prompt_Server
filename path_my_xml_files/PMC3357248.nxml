A significant decrease in fasting plasma glucose was observed in both lixisenatide groups versus placebo. Mean decreases in body weight (&#x0223c;2 kg) were observed in all groups. The most common adverse events were gastrointestinal&#x02014;nausea was the most frequent (lixisenatide 23% overall, placebo 4.1%).

As a class, GLP-1 receptor agonists possess a number of favorable clinical characteristics in addition to their glucose-lowering effects, including a low propensity to cause hypoglycemia (as a result of their glucose-dependent action) and promotion of weight loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Preclinical studies using in vitro and animal models also suggest that GLP-1 receptor agonists have the potential to preserve pancreatic islet &#x003b2;-cells, which may help to provide more stable metabolic control long term (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). As of today, three representatives of the GLP-1 receptor agonist class have been marketed: exenatide (twice-daily and once-weekly formulations) and liraglutide once daily.</p><p>Lixisenatide (AVE0010) is a new selective once-daily GLP-1 receptor agonist in development for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). It is a 44-amino acid peptide that is amidated at the C-terminal end and shares some structural elements with exendin-4 (the main difference being the addition of 6 lysine residues at the C terminus) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Lixisenatide is highly selective for the GLP-1 receptor and exerts about fourfold higher affinity for the GLP-1 receptor than native human GLP-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). The preclinical pharmacological profile of lixisenatide suggests that stimulation of insulin secretion by lixisenatide is strictly glucose dependent. In animal models, lixisenatide enhances insulin biosynthesis and stimulation of &#x003b2;-cell proliferation and delays gastric emptying and reduces food intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). In human islets, lixisenatide prevents lipotoxic islet insulin depletion and preserves insulin production, storage, and pancreatic &#x003b2;-cell function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Lixisenatide undergoes renal metabolism, but mild or moderate renal impairment does not appear to influence its pharmacokinetics or tolerability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>).</p><p>In a 13-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, phase II dose-ranging study, lixisenatide administered at doses of 5, 10, 20, or 30 &#x003bc;g once daily or twice daily in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with metformin significantly improved HbA<sub>1c</sub> compared with placebo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Dose-dependent improvements were also observed for fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and postprandial plasma glucose (PPG) associated with the morning meal and average self-monitored seven-point blood glucose levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). The dose of 20 &#x003bc;g administered once daily was found to provide the optimal balance of efficacy and tolerability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>).</p><p>Accordingly, in this Phase III study, we assessed the safety and efficacy of 20 &#x003bc;g lixisenatide once daily in a 12-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group monotherapy trial in patients with type 2 diabetes not currently receiving glucose-lowering therapy.</p><sec id="s2"><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><sec id="s3"><title>Study participants</title><p>The study population comprised male and female patients aged 20&#x02013;85 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus not currently receiving glucose-lowering therapy and with glycated hemoglobin (HbA<sub>1c</sub>) &#x02265;7.0% and &#x02264;10.0%. The main exclusion criteria were as follows: treatment with a glucose-lowering pharmacological agent within the previous 3 months; FPG at screening &#x0003e;250 mg/dL (13.9 mmol/L); amylase and/or lipase &#x0003e;3 times the upper limit of the normal (ULN) laboratory range; clinically relevant history of gastrointestinal disease with prolonged nausea and vomiting during the previous 6 months, chronic pancreatitis, or stomach/gastric surgery; history of myocardial infarction, stroke, or heart failure requiring hospitalization within the previous 6 months; hepatic disease, end-stage renal disease, and/or dialysis at screening.</p><p>The study was approved by the institutional review boards or ethics committees and was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice guidelines. All patients gave written informed consent to participate in the study.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Study design</title><p>This 12-week, multinational, randomized, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study was conducted at 61 centers in 12 countries (Belgium, India, Israel, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, Poland, Romania, Russian Federation, Tunisia, Ukraine, and United States) between 2008 and 2009. The study drug was double-blind regarding active treatment or placebo and open-label regarding the treatment volume and dose increase regimen.</p><p>After a 2-week screening phase, eligible patients entered into a 1-week, single-blind, placebo run-in period. Eligible patients were then randomized to receive one of four treatment regimens in a 1:1:1:1 ratio for 12 weeks: <italic>1</italic>) lixisenatide 2-step dose increase (10 &#x003bc;g for 1 week, 15 &#x003bc;g for 1 week, and then 20 &#x003bc;g), <italic>2</italic>) lixisenatide 1-step dose increase (10 &#x003bc;g for 2 weeks and then 20 &#x003bc;g), <italic>3</italic>) placebo 2-step dose increase, and <italic>4</italic>) placebo 1-step dose increase. This was followed by a 3-day, posttreatment follow-up period. All treatments were administered once daily within 1 h before breakfast. Routine fasting self-measured plasma glucose and central laboratory alerts on FPG were set up to ensure that glycemic parameters remained under predefined thresholds values (defined depending on study period as: FPG &#x0003e;270 mg/dL [15.0 mmol/L] from baseline visit [day 1] to visit 8, week 8; FPG &#x0003e;240 mg/dL [13.3 mmol/L] from visit 8, week 8 to visit 9, week 12). Rescue medication was introduced in subjects with FPG above those thresholds values, if no reasonable explanation existed for insufficient glucose control, or if appropriate action failed to decrease FPG. Metformin was recommended as first-line rescue medication.</p><p>Randomization of subjects, allocation of medication, and management of drug supplies was performed using an Interactive Voice Response System. Patients were stratified by screening values of HbA<sub>1c</sub> (&#x0003c;8%, &#x02265;8%) and BMI (&#x0003c;30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, &#x02265;30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>).

All clinical laboratory assessments, including HbA<sub>1c</sub>, were measured at a National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program Level 1 certified central laboratory (Covance), using a high performance liquid chromatography method.</p><p>The secondary efficacy measures included the percentage of patients achieving an HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x0003c;7.0% or &#x02264;6.5%, change in FPG, and change in body weight. The secondary efficacy measures of 2-h PPG and 2-h glucose excursion (defined as 2-h PPG minus plasma glucose 30 min before the breakfast meal test before study drug administration) were assessed for a subgroup of patients at selected sites during a standardized meal test. For logistic reasons, the 2-h PPG after standardized meal challenge test was only assessed in a subgroup of all the patients in selected sites (&#x0223c;50% of the randomized patients). In a selected country, all sites and all patients should undergo the meal test. The countries for the meal test were selected according to the following criteria: the anticipated number of patients to be enrolled (based on feasibility); balanced ethnicity at the end, as far as possible; and easy implementation of the meal test substudy (i.e., fast approval, easy import license for the meal test drink (Ensure Plus).</p><p>The meal test consisted of a 600 kcal liquid meal (400 mL of Ensure Plus; Abbott Nutrition, Columbus, OH) composed of 53.8% carbohydrate, 16.7% protein, and 29.5% fat and was to be consumed within a 10-min period, 30 min after drug administration at week &#x02212;1 and week 12. Blood was sampled at 3 time points: <italic>1</italic>) 30 min before the meal test (before study drug administration), <italic>2</italic>) just before consumption at the start of the meal test (0 min), and <italic>3</italic>) 120 min after the start of the meal test. Antilixisenatide antibody levels were measured. Antilixisenatide antibody status and concentration were measured by Biacore. It is a commercial system that is validated and complies with the current regulatory standards, based on Surface Plasmon Resonance using Biacore technology.</p><p>Safety and tolerability were assessed by physical examination, blood pressure, heart rate, 12-lead electrocardiogram, standard laboratory measurements, antilixisenatide antibodies, and adverse events reporting (including, in particular, symptomatic and severe symptomatic hypoglycemia, local intolerability at injection site, allergic or allergic-like reactions, suspected pancreatitis, and major cardiovascular events). Symptomatic hypoglycemia was defined as symptoms consistent with hypoglycemia, with accompanying blood glucose &#x0003c;3.3 mmol/L (60 mg/dL) and/or prompt recovery with carbohydrate. Severe symptomatic hypoglycemia was defined as symptomatic hypoglycemia in which the patient required the assistance of another person and which was associated either with a plasma glucose level &#x0003c;36 mg/dL (2.0 mmol/L) or, if no plasma glucose measurement was available, with prompt recovery with carbohydrate.</p><p>The safety population comprised all randomized patients exposed to at least one dose of investigational drug.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>The two placebo groups were combined in all analyses. Sample sizes of 120 patients in each lixisenatide treatment group and the combined placebo group were calculated to provide a statistical power of 90% to detect a 0.5% difference in HbA<sub>1c</sub> between active treatment and placebo assuming a standard deviation of 1.2%. Statistical significance was assumed at the 5% level. All statistical computations were performed using SAS, version 8.2 or higher.</p><p>Analyses of the primary efficacy variable (changes in HbA<sub>1c</sub> from baseline to end point) were performed using an ANCOVA model, with treatment group, screening strata for HbA<sub>1c</sub> and BMI, and country as fixed factors and baseline HbA<sub>1c</sub> as a covariate. The same method was used for analysis of secondary efficacy parameters. The Last Observation Carry Forward procedure was used to handle missing assessments, early discontinuation, or introduction of rescue therapy during the double-blind treatment period. Least squares (LS) means were calculated from the model to estimate treatment effect size. Comparisons between each lixisenatide group and placebo were based on treatment differences using the LS means. A step-down testing procedure was applied. The lixisenatide 2-step dose increase arm was first compared with the combined placebo group (primary objective); if the test was statistically significant, then the lixisenatide 1-step dose increase arm was compared with the combined placebo group (secondary objective). The percentage of patients achieving HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x0003c;7.0% or &#x02264;6.5% and the percentage of patients requiring rescue therapy were analyzed using a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test stratified according to screening HbA<sub>1c</sub> and screening BMI.</p><p>Unless otherwise indicated, all efficacy data were analyzed in the intent-to-treat population, comprising all randomized patients who received at least one dose of double-blind investigational drug (lixisenatide or placebo) and had both a baseline assessment and at least one postbaseline assessment of any primary or secondary efficacy variable. Only two patients were excluded from the efficacy analyses because of lack of postbaseline efficacy data.

The magnitude of improvement in HbA<sub>1c</sub> (placebo-subtracted change of &#x02212;0.54 and &#x02212;0.66% from a baseline of 8.0% &#x000b1; 0.9 and 8.1% &#x000b1; 0.9 for the 2-step and 1-step dose increase groups, respectively) is consistent with that seen with exenatide twice daily when administered as monotherapy in treatment-na&#x000ef;ve patients (placebo-subtracted change of &#x02212;0.5% with 5 &#x003bc;g and &#x02212;0.7% with 10 &#x003bc;g twice-daily exenatide from a baseline of 7.8%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). No other placebo-controlled studies are available for GLP-1 receptor agonist monotherapy in a similar patient population. The only available study with liraglutide monotherapy used the active comparator glimepiride, and many patients had been treated previously with oral agent monotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>).</p><p>In the current study, there was a pronounced effect of lixisenatide on PPG associated with the morning meal, with statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement of both 2-h PPG (&#x02212;4.5, &#x02212;5.5, and &#x02212;0.7 mmol/L for the 2-step and 1-step dose increase and placebo groups, respectively) and blood glucose excursions (&#x02212;3.8, &#x02212;4.4, and &#x02212;0.7 mmol/L for the 2-step and 1-step dose increase and placebo groups, respectively) measured during a standardized meal test. This represents a 75% reduction in the postprandial glucose excursion. These results are consistent with those of previous studies of lixisenatide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>) and greater than those observed for monotherapy with liraglutide 1.2 mg and 1.8 mg (1.7 and 2.1 mmol/L decreases in PPG averaged across all meals, respectively), although breakfast PPG was not reported specifically in that study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). The importance of targeting PPG is now recognized by international organizations and the International Diabetes Federation recommends that patients with diabetes manage their HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels to &#x0003c;6.5% by addressing both FPG and PPG, with 2-h PPG level targets of &#x0003c;7.8 mmol/L (140 mg/dL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>).</p><p>Lixisenatide monotherapy also provided improvements in FPG (&#x02212;0.9 mmol/L for the 2-step and &#x02212;1.1 mmol/L for the lixisenatide 1-step dose increase arms [both <italic>P</italic> values &#x0003c;0.001]). This is comparable with changes observed with liraglutide monotherapy (1.2 mg = &#x02212;0.8 and 1.8 mg = &#x02212;1.4 mmol/L) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). In this study, lixisenatide provided a mean weight loss of &#x0223c;2 kg, which is comparable with what was reported after 12 weeks of treatment with other GLP-1 receptor agonists when administered as monotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>).</p><p>The glucose-lowering efficacy of lixisenatide can be considered independently of any potential impact because of weight loss since, in the current study, the weight loss observed was not different to that seen with placebo. The patients included in the study had a short duration of diabetes and were not receiving any glucose-lowering therapy and were therefore probably the most sensitive and compliant to dietary interventions, which can explain the weight loss observed with the placebo in this 12-week study. This weight change in the placebo group is compatible with that seen in other studies where lifestyle changes occur in the placebo group, but are usually short lived (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>).</p><p>We found that lixisenatide was well tolerated, with no difference between the 2-step and 1-step dose increase regimens. As expected, the most frequent adverse events were gastrointestinal in nature: mainly nausea, with low rates of vomiting. Most of these events were transient, mild to moderate in intensity, and resolved spontaneously. Only very few led to treatment discontinuation. The nausea frequency (22% for the combined lixisenatide groups) is consistent with the frequency observed in the lixisenatide dose&#x02013;ranging study (25.5% with 20 &#x003bc;g once-daily dose) and in studies conducted with other GLP-1 receptor agonists when used in monotherapy (13&#x02013;29%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Rates of symptomatic hypoglycemia associated with lixisenatide in the current study were low (with no severe events) and similar to placebo. Although this study is only of 12 weeks&#x02019; duration, additional Phase III studies have had a main 24-week treatment period and the majority has also included long-term extension periods of at least another year to assess long-term safety and tolerability. Antibody concentration was very low in the majority of patients, and available data suggest that HbA<sub>1c</sub> reduction and overall safety profile are similar in antilixisenatide antibody-positive and -negative patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). The potential influence of antibodies in the longer term will be addressed in publications of longer-term trials from the GetGoal program.</p><p>The current study shows that lixisenatide once daily is effective and well tolerated when used as monotherapy in treatment-na&#x000ef;ve patients. The impact of lixisenatide on hyperglycemia around the morning meal may also be advantageous, since this component of glycemia appears to be relatively resistant to oral therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Recent data in metformin-treated patients also suggest that lixisenatide once daily is noninferior to exenatide twice daily in terms of HbA<sub>1c</sub> reduction, but has the advantages of less hypoglycemia and fewer gastrointestinal adverse events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, the results from this first completed study in the Phase III clinical trials program for lixisenatide have demonstrated that lixisenatide monotherapy administered once daily provides significant improvements in glycemic control with a pronounced postprandial effect. In addition, lixisenatide was safe and well tolerated, and there was no relevant difference in the safety and tolerability of the 1-step and 2-step dose increase regimens. The results support a role for once-daily lixisenatide monotherapy using a 1-step dose increase regimen in patients not controlled on lifestyle interventions and highlight the potential of lixisenatide for further development as a glucose-lowering compound to treat patients with type 2 diabetes.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><p>Clinical trial reg. no.
