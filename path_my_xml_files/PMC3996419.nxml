reality-based yoga program on middle-aged female low back pain patients. [Subjects and
Methods] Thirty middle-aged female patients who suffered from low back pain were assigned
to either a physical therapy program or a virtual reality-based yoga program for a period
of four weeks. Participants could check their posture and weight bearing on a monitor as
they shifted their weight or changed their postures on a Wii balance board. There were a
total of seven exercise programs. A 30-minute, three times per week, virtual reality-based
Wii Fit yoga program or trunk stabilizing exercise was performed, respectively. [Results]
Repeated-measures analysis of covariance revealed significant differences in between pre-
and post-training VAS, algometer, Oswestry low-back pain disability index (ODI), Roland
Morris disability questionnaire (RMDQ), and fear avoidance beliefs questionnaire (FBQ)
scores. The VAS, algometer, ODI, RMDQ, and FBQ scores showed significant differences in
groups. Regarding the effect of time-by-group interaction, there were significant
differences in VAS, ODI, ODI, and FBQ scores. [Conclusion] In conclusion, for middle-aged
female patients who have low back pain, a virtual reality-based yoga program was shown to
have positive effects on physical improvements, and this program can be employed as a
therapeutic medium for prevention and cure of low back pain.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Low back pain</kwd><kwd>Virtual reality</kwd><kwd>Yoga</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Low back pain (LBP) is a symptom experienced by 80% of adults at least once in their life
time. Nowadays, especially due to industrialization, the number of occurrences is
increasing<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Often, relief of light pain
is achieved naturally within two months. If the pain persists for longer than three months,
it develops as chronic pain<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. In a
previous study, the prevalence of LBP was higher among women than among men in all age
groups (n=92,936), with the highest values seen in the middle-aged woman group<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus, therapeutic intervention and
preventative activities for LBP are significantly important for middle-aged women. Among the
many interventions for treatment of LBP, causes of LBP are diverse, and its patterns are
also varied. Yoga and stretching are known to be effective for relief of LBP symptoms<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>, and yoga and stretching are widely utilized
as rehabilitative therapeutic exercises<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Yoga&#x02019;s unique positions are reported to increase activities of the parasympathetic system,
which in turn increase the levels of thalamic GABA. In addition, yoga increases the level of
peripheral nerve activity<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. As the science
has developed, virtual reality programs developed for use as games have been applied in many
fields. Rehabilitation is one of the fields that uses these types of program for therapeutic
purposes. The Wii Fit yoga program from Nintendo, which requires completion of yoga activity
in a virtual reality environment, is known to be effective for actually following the yoga
movement without any prior professional yoga instructions and training. Therefore, the goal
of this research is to explore the therapeutic effects of the Wii Fit program on middle-aged
LBP patients through a yoga exercise program.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This research was conducted at a K hospital located in Seoul with 30 middle-aged female
patients who suffer from chronic LBP. Participants were randomly separated into two groups.
All participants underwent a thorough examination and were diagnosed as having chronic LBP
by a medical doctor with X-ray, CT, and MRI examinations. All of them had been experiencing
chronic LBP for longer than two months, and anyone with lowered muscle strength or sensory
or cauda equine syndrome was excluded. In the experimental group, a 30-minute virtual
reality-based yoga program using Wii Fit activities such as deep breathing, the half-moon
pose, warrior pose, tree pose, chest to knee pose, chair pose, and palm tree pose. The
virtual reality-based yoga programs were performed in a total of 12 sessions over the course
of four weeks, with each session lasting 30 minutes.</p><p>The general characteristics of the subjects in the experimental group were as follows: a
mean age of 44.33&#x02005;years, a mean height of 158.33&#x02005;cm, a mean weight of 58.15&#x02005;kg, a mean body
mass index of 22.49, and a mean mass of muscle of 20.53. Those of the subjects in the
control group were as follows: a mean age of 50.46&#x02005;years, a mean height of 156.55&#x02005;cm, a mean
weight of 56.18&#x02005;kg, a mean body mass index of 25.06, and a mean mass of muscle of 21.58.
There were no significant differences between the groups. The present study was approved by
the Sahmyook University Institutional Review Board (SYUIRB2013-036). All participants were
given an explanation of the objective of the study and its requirements, and all those who
participated provided written informed consent.</p><p>Participants could readily check their posture and weight bearing on a screen as they
shifted their weight or changed their postures on the balance board. There were seven
exercise programs. Three minutes of exercise were performed followed by one minute of rest.
A longer resting period was provided if desired. Thirty minutes of trunk stabilizing
exercise and 30 minutes of normal physical therapy were performed in the control group.
Trunk stabilizing exercise was performed with contraction exercise for the transverse
abdominis and multifidus followed by curl ups in order to contract the rectus abdominis. The
dead bug exercise, quadruped opposite arm and leg reach exercises, bridge, side bridge on
knees, middle anterior plank position, and balancing on unstable surfaces were performed.
Each movement was comprised of two sets lasting 30 minutes. One set included 10
repetitions.</p><p>The visual analog scale (VAS) was used for assessment of pain before and after the
intervention. Measurement was performed with a 10-cm scale marked with 1-cm increments. Pain
felt by participants was recorded. Pain was rated on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10
representing the most excruciating pain. The value indicated on the scale by the participant
was used as the score. Previous studies have shown that the reliability of the VAS
(r=0.76&#x02013;0.84) is high<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Pressure algometry has proven to be an important psychophysical examination tool for
obtaining measures of mechanical pain sensitivity from deep tissue<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. It has been widely used in adults, both in experimental and
clinical pain conditions<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. For example,
in osteoarthritis, fibromyalgia, temporomandibular disorders, and whiplash syndrome, reduced
pressure pain thresholds in response to mechanical pressure have been shown, indicating the
presence of hyperexcitability<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
intra-rater (r= 0.85) and inter-rater (r= 0.85) reliabilities of pressure algometry are
high<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The Oswestry low-back pain disability index (ODI) was completed by the participants and
included 10 questions assessing activities of daily living in order to examine the
functional level when experiencing LBP. Each category was scored from zero to five with
regard to the severity of disability caused during daily life<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. The intraclass
correlation coefficient was r = 0.938, and the Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha was 0.918 (day 1) and 0.895
(day 7) in the validation<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The Roland Morris disability questionnaire (RDQ) was used for measurement of the severity
of disability in participants who had less severe LBP. There are 24 categories comprised of
yes or no questions. Each participant can have a maximum score of 24. Scoring closer to 24
indicates greater functional disability<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. Quoted test&#x02013;retest correlations include
0.91 (same day), 0.88 (1 week), and 0.83 (3 weeks)<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The fear avoidance beliefs questionnaire (FABQ) was used to measure the fear of lower back
pain. There are five categories for the FABQ-PA (physical activity) and 11 categories for
the FABQ-w (work) with internal consistency (&#x003b1;) of 0.88 and 0.77<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>SPSS version 17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used for statistical analysis. A paired
t-test was used to determine the changes in pre- and post-test scores within a group, and
the interaction effect between group and time was assessed by using repeated-measures
analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with the baseline as the covariate. An alpha level of
p&#x0003c;0.05 was considered significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The results showed that repeated-measures analysis of covariance revealed significant
differences between pre- and post-training VAS, algometer, ODI, RMDQ, and FBQ scores. The

effect of time-by-group interaction, there were significant differences in the VAS, ODI,
RMDQ, and FBQ scores (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title> Comparison of body function between the groups (n=30)</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="3" colspan="1"/><th align="center" valign="middle" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Experimental group (n=15)</th><th align="center" valign="middle" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Control group (n=15)</th><th align="center" rowspan="3" valign="middle" colspan="1">Group (F)</th><th align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="3" colspan="1">Time (F)</th><th align="center" rowspan="3" valign="middle" colspan="1">Group x time (F)</th></tr><tr><th colspan="4" rowspan="1"><hr/></th></tr><tr><th align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pre</th><th align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Post</th><th align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pre</th><th align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Post</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">VAS (points)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7.00&#x000b1;0.89) <sup>a</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.27 (1.10)*</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6.95 (0.79)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.63 (1.91)*</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6.988<sup>&#x02020;</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">132.151 <sup>&#x02021;</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">15.451<sup>&#x02021;</sup></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Algometer (kg/cm<sup>2</sup>)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7.13 (1.02)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.10 (0.90)*</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7.33 (0.87)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5.46 (1.57)*</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5.175<sup>&#x02020;</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">52.534 <sup>&#x02021;</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.974</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">ODI (points)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">34.91 (6.19)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">13.82 (7.65)*</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">36.18 (5.02)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">24.55 (10.88)*</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.510<sup>&#x02020;</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">90.807<sup>&#x02021;</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7.578<sup>&#x02020;</sup></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">RMDQ (points)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">18.64 (2.84)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7.46 (4.84)*</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">19.09 (2.91)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">12.64 (6.48)*</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3.057</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">68.654<sup>&#x02021;</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.933<sup>&#x02020;</sup></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">FBQ (points)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">65.46 (9.64)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">17.55 (10.67)*</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">70.82 (4.58)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">41.64 (18.00)*</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">13.413<sup>&#x02021;</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">166.915<sup>&#x02021;</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">9.850<sup>&#x02021;</sup></td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>VAS, visual analog scale; ODI, Oswestry low-back pain disability index; RMDQ,

program using Wii Fit on body function of middle-aged women. There are many causes of LBP.
Among them, the main causes are soft tissue injury of the trunk or muscle weakness, which
result in lowered endurance, flexibility, and range of motion of the lumbar spine<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. Compared with normal people, people who
have LBP tend to have weaker and slower-reacting deep spinal muscles, and patients with
chronic LBP have increased muscle tension of the lumbar region in the thoracic, inguinal,
and femoral muscles<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In order to have normal muscle strength, the muscles, tendons, capsule, and ligaments
connected to joints need to have normal extensibility. Yoga, unlike other exercise without
sudden contractions of muscles, promotes strengthening and relaxing of muscles and
ligaments. With yoga, right alignment of the body can be sustained. It can aid alleviation
of pain through activation of weakened muscles. In addition, adequate relaxation of muscles
allows for effective muscle contraction. Thus, yoga can be suggested as a strengthening
exercise for weakened muscles. The isometric poses of the Wii Fit yoga programs trains the
smaller muscles around the spinal joints to bear more pressure and make the person
performing the poses work harder to stabilize themselves. Poses that force us to balance on
one leg while standing and change elevation or rotate train supporting muscles to work in
ways strictly for stability and balance. Use of a virtual reality system using a
computerized environment in which people can experience a similar situation can be helpful
in obtaining interactive simulation<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Especially in rehabilitation therapy, where repetitive feedback and motor learning are
necessary, a virtual reality system can provide adequate motivation of such a mechanism<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. By providing direct feedback, the virtual
reality system created with Wii Fit not only provides fun for participants but also promotes
greater balance. This research shows that repeated-measures analysis of covariance revealed
significant differences in VAS, algometer, ODI, and FBQ scores in groups. Pain was
alleviated, as shown by the VAS, ODI, and FBQ scores in the experimental group compared with
the control group.</p><p>This result validates that LBP can be eased through use of a virtual reality-based yoga
exercise program. In addition, a virtual reality-based yoga program can improve functional
level and reduce the fear of low back movement. A study conducted by Carpenter reported that
in patients with chronic LBP, a decrease in physical activity would lead to a decrease in
lumber muscle size and power, thus causing a repeated increase in LBP and stress, eventually
resulting in a vicious circle. For this reason, Carpenter&#x02019;s study suggested that
strengthening major weakened muscles such as the lumbar extension muscles could be a method
for prevention of such repeating cycles<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>. The virtual reality-based yoga program implemented in this research
study encourages postures such as deep breathing, the half-moon posture, and the tree
posture, as with real life yoga, and thus would have induced extension muscle activities. In
addition, feedback provided from the virtual reality program would have increased the
participant&#x02019;s motivation and concentration. These may have led to the significant result
presented in this research.</p><p>Because the incidence of LBP in the middle-aged women is higher than that of office workers
or laborers, LBP prevention programs and therapeutic interventions are needed. Considering
that most middle-aged women do not have time or money for personal health care because of
their housekeeping or child-rearing activities, a relatively low-priced virtual
reality-based yoga program would be a more effective and cheaper way to exercise than
attending a yoga class at a fitness center.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Frymoyer</surname><given-names>JW</given-names></name><name><surname>Pope</surname><given-names>MH</given-names></name><name><surname>Clements</surname><given-names>JH</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Risk factors in low-back pain.
