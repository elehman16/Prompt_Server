Results of a meta-analysis of six studies indicated the pooled prevalence of adult ADHD according to DSM-IV criteria to be 2.5&#x000a0;% (95&#x000a0;% CI 2.1-3.1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In a Dutch population the prevalence of adult ADHD has been found to be 2.1&#x000a0;% (95&#x000a0;% CI 1.4-3.0) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Patients with ADHD show a persistent pattern of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity, which leads to impairment of functioning in two or more areas in daily life, for example at work, school and/or home. These impairments have a substantial personal and economic impact. A recent study shows that ADHD is associated with increased mortality, mainly driven by deaths from unnatural causes like accidents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Furthermore, adult ADHD is related to higher levels of unemployment and those who are employed often experience workplace impairment and reduced productivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In an international population ADHD is associated with 22&#x000a0;days of excess lost role performance among employees a year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and with elevated risk of high number of days out of role (OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.6, 95&#x000a0;% CI 2.0-3.5) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Results of a recent survey in a Dutch general population sample showed that adults with ADHD had significantly more functional impairments and an increased health care use than persons without ADHD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>The vast majority of ADHD patients in the Netherlands is offered stimulant medication after or parallel to psycho-education on ADHD. In accordance with the NICE guideline on ADHD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] stimulants are the first-line treatment for adults as part of a comprehensive treatment programme that addresses psychological, behavioural and educational or occupational needs. The pooled effect size of stimulant medication in reducing ADHD symptoms was in the medium-to-high range [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Stimulants demonstrated efficacy and they seemed to improve work productivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Moreover drug treatment in ADHD seemed to have a protective effect on the risk of criminality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and suicidal behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Although pharmacological treatment has thus shown to be effective in reducing ADHD symptoms and to have beneficial effects, about 10-30&#x000a0;% of adults with ADHD do not adequately respond to stimulants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and often report adverse effects like decreased appetite, dry mouth, tension or jitteriness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], which can lead to discontinuation. It has also been found that these patients were compliant with medication for rather a brief period (M&#x02009;=&#x02009;49.5&#x000a0;days), and the average persistence with medication was less than a year (M&#x02009;=&#x02009;199.9&#x000a0;days) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Besides, some patients with ADHD are not willing to take medication at all. Furthermore, the evidence for long-term effects of stimulants is sparse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Therefore, there is a strong need for evidence-based psychosocial interventions, as an addition to or an alternative for pharmacological treatment of adult ADHD.</p><p>The NICE guideline recommends group Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) for adults with ADHD whose response to medication is insufficient, who have difficulty adhering to drug treatment or who are not willing to use medication. Some studies have shown evidence for the efficacy of treatment with CBT in adults with ADHD, particularly when combined with medication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. For example, Safren et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] found support for the effectiveness of individual CBT for patients with ADHD, who are treated with medication but continue to have residual symptoms, compared to a time-matched comparison treatment. Another study of Solanto et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] showed that meta-cognitive group therapy, which is a cognitive-behavioural intervention, provides significant benefit to patients with ADHD with respect to the severity of ADHD symptoms in comparison with supportive group therapy. However, more controlled research studies are required. Another promising psychosocial intervention for patients with ADHD is Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT), which combines methods of CBT and mindfulness meditation. Mindfulness is defined as paying attention in a particular way: on purpose, in the present moment, and non-judgmentally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. MBCT is usually offered in a group format, consisting of 8 weekly sessions of 2,5&#x000a0;hours and a silent day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], which may be more cost-effective than individual treatment. In recent years, mindfulness based therapy, such as MBCT, has been demonstrated to reduce anxiety, depression and stress in a wide range of psychiatric disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], including current anxiety and depressive disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Furthermore, there is evidence that mindfulness meditation strengthens attention regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] and improves some executive functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] in healthy subjects. Although these studies were not focused on patients with ADHD and replication studies need to be carried out, this is promising evidence in the search for an effective non-pharmacological treatment for this patient group.</p><p>A few studies on the effectiveness of mindfulness training for adults with ADHD have so far been conducted, two uncontrolled pilot studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] and two randomised controlled trials (Hepark, Janssen, De Vries, Schoenberg, Kan, &#x00026; Speckens: The effects of Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy on core sympotms and executive functioning in adults with ADHD: a preliminary randomised controlled trial, submitted) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The studies of Zylowska et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] and Mitchell et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] used the 8-week Mindful Awareness Practices (MAPs) for ADHD programme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], while our own group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] (Hepark et al., submitted) used an adapted and extended MBCT programme. All of these studies observed a substantial reduction of primary ADHD symptoms, and the effect of mindfulness training on ADHD symptoms seems to be mediated by an increase of mindfulness skills (Hepark et al., submitted). Moreover, improvements of executive functioning (Hepark et al., submitted) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] and emotion regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] were reported. In both pilot studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] improved executive control was observed using neuropsychological tasks, but this was not replicated in the two randomised controlled trials. Empirical evidence regarding the reduction of secondary symptoms, like depressive and anxiety symptoms and general functioning, is mixed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] and (Hepark et al., submitted). Possibly, this is partially due to baseline differences in levels of secondary symptoms in the various samples.</p><p>The results of the above mentioned studies support the feasibility and efficacy of mindfulness training as a treatment for adults with ADHD and encourage further research. This approach offers a novel and potentially useful tool in the multimodal treatment of ADHD. Previous studies are conducted in one centre and lack a follow-up period. Some of them are small [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], uncontrolled [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] and lack blinding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The proposed study is the first properly powered randomised controlled multi-centre study, which includes blinded outcome assessments, a longer term follow-up period and assessment of cost-effectiveness.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Aims of the trial</title><p>The primary aim of this study is to investigate effectiveness of MBCT in addition to Treatment As Usual (TAU) versus TAU alone in adults with ADHD. We expect that MBCT can improve ADHD symptoms and overall functioning in two ways: a) by strengthening their attention regulation and executive functioning, resulting in a greater reduction of ADHD symptoms rated by a blinded clinician (primary outcome) and self-reported ADHD symptoms and a greater improvement of executive functioning (secondary outcomes); and b) by extending their repertoire of coping strategies to deal with core symptoms and functional impairments, resulting in a greater improvement of general functioning, positive mental health and self-compassion (secondary outcomes).</p><p>Other aims of the study are to assess whether MBCT is a cost-effective intervention compared to TAU in patients with ADHD from a societal perspective and to assess the financial consequences of implementing mindfulness training in patients with ADHD from different perspectives (e.g. societal, health care, health insurance and patient). We expect that the implementation of this intervention will result in a reduction of medical and societal costs in the MBCT group compared to the TAU group.</p><p>Furthermore, in order to gain insight in the working mechanisms of mindfulness, we will investigate whether possible clinical effects of MBCT can be attributed to changes in mindfulness skills, self-compassion and adherence to MBCT.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study design</title><p>The design of the study is multi-centre, parallel-group, randomised controlled superiority trial. Patients will be randomised to MBCT in addition to TAU or TAU alone. The study protocol has been ethically approved by CMO Arnhem-Nijmegen for all participating centres and registered under number 2014/206.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Participants</title><p>The study population will consist of adults with ADHD. To enhance generalisability, the study is conducted in three different mental health centres for patients with ADHD in the south-east of the Netherlands: the Department of Psychiatry of the Radboudumc in Nijmegen, the Reinier van Arkel Group in the Jeroen Bosch hospital in &#x02018;s Hertogenbosch and Dimence in Deventer. Each centre has a specialized outpatient clinic for adults with developmental disorders, like ADHD.</p><sec id="Sec6"><title>Eligibility criteria</title><p>We will include patients of 18&#x000a0;years and older who meet the following criteria: a) a primary diagnosis of ADHD, according to the criteria of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders &#x02013; 4<sup>th</sup> edition (DSM-IV-TR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] based on a structured Diagnostic Interview for ADHD, in adults (DIVA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]; and b) capable of filling out questionnaires in Dutch. Exclusion criteria will be: a) depressive disorder with psychotic symptoms or suicidality; b) current manic episode; c) borderline or antisocial personality disorder; d) substance dependence; e) autism spectrum disorder; f) tic disorder with vocal tics; g) learning difficulties or other cognitive impairments; and h) former participation in a MBCT or MBSR course or workshop of more than two hours&#x02019; duration. We will use a psychiatric structured diagnostic interview (MINI-Plus) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] to establish whether patients meet the above mentioned exclusion criteria a, b and d. To assess the third exclusion criterion, screening lists for borderline and antisocial personality disorders based on the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis II Disorders (SCID-II) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] will be administered. In patients meeting five or more criteria on one or both of the lists, the entire interview for borderline and/or antisocial personality disorder of the SCID-II will be conducted.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Procedure and treatment allocation</title><p>Recruitment will take place in different ways: by referral via the specialist outpatient clinics of the three participating centres and by self-selection. Currently and formerly treated patients with ADHD at the Radboudumc, the Reinier van Arkel Groep and Dimence will be informed about the study by their attending clinicians in various stages of their treatment process. Patients will also be recruited by self-selection by media advertisements, for example through the website of the Dutch association of adults with ADHD (Impuls &#x00026; Woortblind) and in presentations at regional thematic meetings. Interested patients will receive an information leaflet and are invited for a screening by telephone with the researcher or research assistant to assess eligibility. If patients seem to be eligible, they will get one to two weeks time to consider participation. Patients who chose to participate will be invited for an interview with the researcher or research assistant in which written informed consent will be obtained.</p><p>When the Diagnostic Interview for ADHD in adults (DIVA) has not been conducted to diagnose ADHD before, it will be administered by a psychologist or psychiatrist with relevant experience with this specific patient group to check whether a patient indeed meets the DSM-IV criteria for ADHD. Whenever possible the interview will take place in the presence of a family-member, partner or significant other to enable retrospective and collateral information to be ascertained simultaneously.</p><p>Blinded assessments with the investigator-rated screening version of the Conners&#x02019; Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-INV) will be obtained by trained psychiatrists or specialist registered nurses (in training) at baseline, 3, 6 and 9&#x000a0;months after baseline. The 6 and 9&#x000a0;months follow-up assessments will take place by phone. Self-report questionnaires will be administered at all of the above mentioned four time points. In order not to disadvantage patients randomised to the TAU group, we will offer them MBCT after completion of the study at 9&#x000a0;months follow-up.</p><p>Patients will be able to use medication for ADHD such as psycho-stimulants, during the entire study and they will not be withheld from other psychosocial treatments they might be offered. Concurrent interventions will be closely monitored and registered.

Block randomisation with varying predefined block sizes is used combined with minimisation. Block randomisation will be dominant over minimisation. The randomisation will be minimised taking account of: a) use of medication for ADHD (medication versus no medication); b) past participation in a psycho-education training (psycho-education versus no psycho-education); c) gender (male versus female); and d) subtype ADHD (combined, hyperactive-impulsive, inattentive and not otherwise specified). The researcher will be blind for the block sizes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Blinding</title><p>Blinded assessments by a psychiatrist or specialist nurse with the investigator-rated screening version of the Conners&#x02019; Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-INV) will take place at baseline and 3, 6 and 9&#x000a0;months after baseline. At baseline patient nor interviewer will know in which group the patient will be placed. To ensure that the interviewers stay blind during the other time points of assessment, patients will be instructed at the research interview not to share information about allocation with the interviewer. At the beginning of each assessment, the interviewer will repeat this instruction.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Outcome measures</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Selection and diagnostic measures</title><p>The Diagnostic Interview for ADHD in adults (DIVA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] is a structured interview used in our study to diagnose ADHD in adults. The first part consists of the DSM-IV criteria of ADHD in childhood and adulthood and the second part is to determine impairment in five domains (education and work, relationships and family life, social contacts, leisure time and self-confidence) in both life periods.

This interview consists of 30 items, which are rated on a 4-point Likert scale. Ratings can be organised in three subscales: Inattention, Hyperactivity/Impulsivity, and the ADHD index.

This self-report questionnaire consists of 24 items which are rated on a 5-point Likert scale. Five facets of mindfulness are distinguished: Observing, Describing, Acting with Awareness, Non-judging, and Non-reactivity. The Dutch version of the FFMQ-SF has been shown to be a reliable instrument which is sensitive to change in a population with depressive and anxiety symptoms.

Based on these study results, we expect a post-treatment difference of 4 between the two groups with a standard deviation of 7.5. Using a two-sided test with an alpha of 0.05, a power of 80&#x000a0;% and analyzing the data using ANCOVA assuming the correlation between pre- and post-assessments to be 0.5, we would need approximately 45 patients per arm.

Percentages of improved, recovered, unchanged and worsened patients in the intervention and control groups will be provided on the basis of predefined cut-off scores (<italic>T-</italic>score greater than 65) and standard deviations.

In addition, regression models will be used to derive prediction models for therapy outcome.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Secondary analyses</title><sec id="FPar11"><title>Cost-effectiveness analysis</title><p>For each patient in the MBCT and TAU group: a) costs; b) treatment response; and c) QALYs will be collected over the study period of nine months. Total costs for each patient will be obtained by multiplying the resource use as measured with the TiC-P with standard costs, based on the Dutch guideline for costing research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Overall mean and median costs will be compared across the two groups and where relevant, differences will be calculated inclusive of 95&#x000a0;% confidence intervals. Treatment response will be based on our primary outcome, the investigator-rated version of the CAARS. QALYs will be assessed by the SF-12. At baseline and each follow-up interval, each patient is assigned a utility score based on the SF-12. From these utility scores QALYs will be calculated for each patient using the Area Under the Curve (AUC) method. Mean and median QALYs will be compared across the two groups and where relevant, differences are calculated inclusive of 95&#x000a0;% confidence intervals.</p><p>If MBCT is more costly and more effective than TAU, an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) will be calculated by dividing the extra costs by the extra effects. ICERs are computed to obtain the costs per responder and the costs per QALY gained. This will give an estimation of the extra costs that are needed to gain one responder or QALY. If this is below the societal willingness to pay, mindfulness training is deemed cost-effective. If one comparator is less costly and more effective, it dominates the other and no ICER is necessary to determine cost-effectiveness. If MBCT is less effective and less costly, ICERs will be calculated representing the savings per QALY lost. Uncertainty surrounding the costs, effects and ICER will be addressed by means of bootstrapping.</p></sec><sec id="FPar12"><title>Mediation analysis</title><p>To gain insight in underlying working mechanism of mindfulness, we will test with a mediation analysis whether possible clinical effects of MBCT can be attributed to changes in mindfulness skills, self-compassion and adherence to MBCT.

Although pharmacotherapy has shown to be effective in reducing ADHD symptoms and its economic impact, there is a call for psychosocial interventions to offer in addition to pharmacotherapy or as an alternative treatment. At this moment research examining the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions for adult ADHD is still in its infancy. Mindfulness training, such as MBCT, is a promising psychosocial intervention, which can be offered in a group format. Considered from an economic perspective, this is an advantage over treatment on individual basis. Previous studies support the feasibility of mindfulness training for this patient group and provide preliminary, but consistent evidence that this intervention reduces ADHD symptoms and improves executive functioning. However, the methodology of these studies is limited by single-centre enrolment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], and (Hepark et al., submitted) lack of follow-up periods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], and (Hepark et al., submitted) small sample sizes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], lack of a control group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] and lack of blinded assessments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Our study will take account of these limitations and will examine the effectiveness of MBCT in adults with ADHD in further detail.</p><p>To our knowledge, this is the first properly powered randomised controlled study in this field, that contains blinded outcome assessments and an intention-to-treat analysis. Besides, a follow-up period with a length of six months after the end of treatment is included to consider potential long-term effects of MBCT. To enhance generalisability, this study is conducted in three different mental health centres with expertise in treating adults with ADHD. Additionally, cost-effectiveness will be assessed to evaluate whether MBCT is a cost-effective intervention compared to the treatment as usual and to examine the financial consequences of implementing this intervention. This trial will offer valuable information on whether MBCT has an effect on clinician-rated and self-reported ADHD symptoms, executive functioning, general functioning, positive mental health, self-compassion and medical and societal costs in comparison to treatment as usual.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ADHD</term><def><p>Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ANCOVA</term><def><p>Analysis of covariance</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AUC</term><def><p>Area under curve</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BRIEF-A</term><def><p>Behaviour rating inventory of executive function-adult</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CAARS</term><def><p>Conners adult ADHD scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CBT</term><def><p>Cognitive behavioural therapy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CMO</term><def><p>Central committee on research involving human subjects</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CI</term><def><p>Confidence interval</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CONSORT</term><def><p>Consolidated standards of reporting trials</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DIVA</term><def><p>Diagnostic interview for ADHD in adults</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DSM-IV</term><def><p>Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders 4<sup>th</sup> edition</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FFMQ-SF</term><def><p>Five facet of mindfulness questionnaire-short form</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICER</term><def><p>Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>INV</term><def><p>Investigator</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ISPOR</term><def><p>International society for pharmacoeconomics and outcomes research</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MAPs</term><def><p>Mindful awareness practices</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MBCT</term><def><p>Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MBI:TAC</term><def><p>Mindfulness based interventions-teacher rating scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MBSR</term><def><p>Mindfulness based stress reduction</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MHC-SF</term><def><p>Mental health continuum-short form</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MINI</term><def><p>Mini international neuropsychiatric interview</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NICE</term><def><p>National institute for health and care excellence</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OQ</term><def><p>Outcome questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SCID-II</term><def><p>Structured clinical interview for DSM-IV axis II disorders</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SCS-SF</term><def><p>Self-compassion scale-short form</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SF-12</term><def><p>Medical outcomes study 12-item short form health survey</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SV</term><def><p>Screening version</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TAU</term><def><p>Treatment as usual</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TiC-P</term><def><p>Trimbos institute and iMTA questionnaire on costs associated with psychiatric illnesses</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>QALY</term><def><p>Quality adjusted life year</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>Jan K.
