Contralateral needling is the insertion of needles into acupoints on the relative healthy side of the body to treat diseases such as apoplexy. However, there is little well-designed and controlled clinical evidence for this practice. This study investigated whether contralateral needling could treat hemiplegia after acute ischemic stroke in 106 randomly selected patients with acute ischemic stroke. These patients were randomly assigned to three groups: 45 in the contralateral needling group, receiving acupuncture on the unaffected limbs; 45 in the tional acupuncture group, receiving acupuncture on the hemiplegic limbs; and 16 in the control group, receiving routine treatments without acupuncture. Acupuncture at acupoints <italic>Chize</italic> (LU5) in the upper limb and <italic>Jianliao</italic> (TE14) in the lower limb was performed for 45 minutes daily for 30 consecutive days. The therapeutic effective rate, Neurological Deficit Score, Modified Barthel Index and Fugl-Meyer Assessment were evaluated. The therapeutic effective rate of contralateral needling was higher than that of conventional acupuncture (46.67% <italic>vs</italic>. 31.11%, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). The neurological deficit score of contralateral needling was significantly decreased compared with conventional acupuncture (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01).

The consensus surrounding stroke treatment is that early rehabilitative intervention may determine the outcome of neurological rehabilitation[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Hemiplegia caused by stroke indicates the dysfunction of the neurological network between the brain and limbs, namely collateral shock in the brain and any part of the movement control system[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Collateral disease theory[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], a modern branch of traditional Chinese medicine, is a clinical discipline within the studies of traditional Chinese medicine that focuses on pathology of the collateral system[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Collaterals are transversely divergent branches of the 12 regular channels that form a multi-layer network system that maintains the vital activities and homeostasis of the body. Collateral disease appears extensively in tractable internal diseases, miscellaneous diseases, and severe conditions that are contracted externally. The appearance of affected collaterals refers to the functional impairment or structural damage to the collateral vessels due to any pathogenic factors[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Collateral diseases refers to the specific pathogenic factors affecting the collateral system, including secondary pathological changes of <italic>zang</italic> and <italic>fu</italic> tissues (viscera, the large organs inside the body, such as the heart, liver, and stomach).</p><p>Acupuncture therapy was also based mainly on channel theory, later developing into an independent clinical discipline[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. For generations, physicians have emphasized channel theory while devaluing the collaterals; therefore, an in-depth study into collateral disease was rarely considered[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Unlike 12 regular channels, collaterals do not have a specific running course, so our understanding of their pathology is much less clear. Actually, the state of science and technology at that period in history naturally prevented academic study of the microscopic realm. Furthermore, a clear scientific explanation of collaterals and their pathological changes cannot be obtained through the traditional inspection method. This also greatly limits the development of collateral disease theory[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. However, the rapid development of modern science and technology and breakthroughs in biomedical microscopy now make it possible for us to study the physiological actions and pathological changes of collaterals from the viewpoint of modern reductionism[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The establishment of a system of syndrome differentiation and treatment for collateral disease can help improve therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of biomedical diseases[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Acupuncture for stroke treatment has long been accepted in many countries, including China[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], and has been enrolled in the catalog of fundamental medical care in China for decades[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, acupuncture methods vary with different physicians. Therefore, therapeutic efficacy has varied largely[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. There is little evidence supporting the effectiveness of acupuncture in the treatment of stroke, mainly because of poor methodological quality and small sample size. Further high-quality, randomized controlled trials with long-term follow-up are needed and economic analysis is necessary[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>It is accepted in traditional Chinese medicine from the oldest <italic>Nei Jing</italic> that contralateral needling is more effective than conventional acupuncture in the treatment of stroke[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that contralateral needling may have a predominant clinical therapeutic effect[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. However, there is little evidence from randomized controlled clinical trials[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].

It is not very difficult to understand that conventional acupuncture at the regular dose would produce no response if the acupoints were on the choked meridian. By contrast, acupuncture at the healthy meridians would move the healthy meridians and vessels to expel the pathogenic factors and to rectify the abundant or downward <italic>qi</italic> and blood. Therefore, contralateral needling would regulate the disturbed <italic>qi</italic> and blood, thus finally balancing <italic>yin</italic> and <italic>yang</italic>[<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p>The <italic>qi</italic> collaterals function to transport channel-<italic>qi</italic>, warm, nourish, and defend the body, convey information, and regulate vital activities. The vessel collaterals function to transport blood, nourish the body, supply <italic>qi</italic> and blood, perform fluid-blood transformation, and fulfill nutritive metabolism. Traditional Chinese medicine holds that &#x0201c;<italic>qi</italic> is the commander of blood, and blood is the mother of <italic>qi</italic>&#x0201d;, where the close relationship between <italic>qi</italic> and blood leads to high correlation between the functions of <italic>qi</italic> and vessel collaterals. Based on the relationships between <italic>qi</italic> collaterals and neuroendocrine-immunological regulation, and also between vessel collaterals and medium or small- sized capillary microcirculation, the &#x0201c;<italic>qi</italic> collateral-NEI (nerve, endocrine and immune) network and the &#x0201c;vessel collateral-vascular system&#x0201d; were re-established[<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref><xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref><xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref><xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref><xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p><p>Apparently, smoothly functioning collateral and normal circulation of <italic>qi</italic> and blood are the very foundations of vital activities. Owing to the structural characteristics of collaterals, such as transverse divergence, multi-layer subdivision, a thready and narrow shape, and reticular distribution, the <italic>qi</italic> and blood in the collaterals circulates slowly and diffuses extensively. These qualities also determine the pathogenic features and concepts of collateral diseases, such as susceptibility to stagnation and stasis, ease in entering and difficulty in exiting, and susceptibility to masses. The possible pathological changes include collateral-<italic>qi</italic> stagnation (deficient stagnation), stasis obstruction of the collaterals, contracture of the collaterals, and stasis blockage of collaterals. The underlying nature of collateral disease is &#x0201c;blockage&#x0201d;.</p><p>The ultimate aims of traditional Chinese medical therapies are to remedy defects, regulate <italic>yin-yang</italic> balance, and to restore the normal physiological state of the body. The <italic>Nei Jing</italic> states, &#x0201c;When analyzing the pathogenesis, one must begin from the five <italic>zangs</italic>, and then regulate <italic>qi</italic> and blood circulation to obtain balance&#x0201d;. Since the collaterals are passageways of <italic>qi</italic> and blood circulation, the fundamental purpose in the treatment of collateral disease is to keep the collateral smooth. The general principle of &#x0201c;unblocking the collaterals&#x0201d; exactly targets the physiological characteristics of the collateral disease[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Despite the general principle of unblocking the collaterals, collateral unblocking methods can vary according to the differences in etiological factors, pathological patterns, and clinical manifestations. The <italic>Yi Xue Zheng Zhuan</italic> (Orthodox Transmission of the Study of Medicine) by Shizong Gao (Qing Dynasty) reports, &#x0201c;There are varieties of collateral-unblocking methods. For example, regulating <italic>qi</italic> to harmonize blood or regulating blood to harmonize <italic>qi</italic>, up-regulating the adverse down-bearing <italic>qi</italic>, or reinforcing the body's resistance to disease&#x0201d;[<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The pathological state of the collateral disease can be regulated by eliminating the etiological factors, unblocking collaterals with collateral-entering medicinals, and dealing with the secondary pathological changes of <italic>zang-fu</italic> tissues. The etiological factors of collateral disease include six external pathogenic factors, epidemic <italic>qi</italic>, and retention of phlegm, chronic disease or pain.</p><p>Therefore, the treatment methods include regulating <italic>qi</italic>, supplementing <italic>qi</italic>, removing wind, dissipating cold, resolving phlegm and dampness, and removing toxic substance. Besides removing the etiological factors, collateral-unblocking medicinals such as acrid-property herbs, worms, insects, and vines can be added to improve clinical efficacy. These medicinals have been summarized by physicians from Zhongjing Zhang to Tianshi Ye, and they act to directly unblock the collaterals. Since collateral disease may also cause secondary pathological changes of <italic>Zang-fu</italic> organs, bones, tendons, muscles, and skin, medicinals that can repair these secondary pathological changes should be selected as well. Collateral disease can occur in different pathological states and manifest in different patterns, such as collateral-<italic>qi</italic> stagnation (deficient stagnation), stasis obstruction of the collaterals, contracture of the collaterals, stasis blockage of collaterals, retention of toxic-heat in the collaterals, collateral masses, impairment of the collaterals, and malnourishment of the collaterals. Consequently, all of the above factors should be taken into consideration in the determination of an appropriate treatment strategy and formula.</p><p>Previous experiences in the use of collateral-unblocking medicinals have certain academic value in the treatment of collateral diseases[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. It is of great theoretical and clinical significance for explaining the nature of collateral disease and for improving clinical efficacy to investigate the mechanism of action of these medicinals by means of modern experimental methods. However, these methods are still in their preliminary stages, possibly because there is no systematic theoretical system on collaterals and collateral disease, and also because paradoxical phenomena sometimes occur as a result of there being no standardized classification criteria for these medicinals.</p><p>Unlike twelve regular channels, collaterals do not have a specific running course; thus, understanding of their pathology is much less clear. The state of science and technology during ancient times prevented academic study of the microscopic realm. A clear scientific explanation of collaterals and their pathological changes cannot be obtained through the traditional inspection method. This limited the development of collateral disease theory. This unique acupuncture named as contralateral needling is originally recorded in Chapter 63 of Plain Questions, <italic>Nei Jing</italic> (Internal Classic), an ancient traditional Chinese medical text. The main purpose of contralateral needling is to normalize the injured streams of <italic>qi</italic> and blood through activating the acupoints on the relative healthy part of the body under the condition that the conventional acupuncture given to the affected abnormal area would be less effective. By following this philosophical concept, this kind of acupuncture is indicated clinically for meridian impotency[<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref><xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref><xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], and qi-blood circulation resulting from <italic>yin-yang</italic> unbalance.</p><p>Meridians, <italic>qi</italic> and blood of the body communicate from the left and the right physiologically and pathologically. As the specific inter-stimulus intervals were assumed to relate to transmission within specific motor pathways, it is argued that changes in the corticospinal transmission were pathway-specific[<xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The anatomical and physiological basis of contralateral needling in terms of regulating the functions of the brain are meridians, <italic>qi</italic> and blood, and <italic>yin</italic> and <italic>yang</italic> adjusting each other and filling each other up[<xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Acupuncture at different acupoints belonging to the same anatomic segment can exert different modulatory effects on the reorganizations of post-acupuncture resting state networks. The heterogeneous modulation patterns between two conditions may relate to the functionally specific modulatory effects of acupuncture[<xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].</p><p>Therefore acupoints in the upper limb are <italic>Chize</italic> (LU5), <italic>Hegu</italic> (LI4), <italic>Quchi</italic> (LI11), <italic>Waiguan</italic> (SJ5) and <italic>Jianliao</italic> (TE14); and <italic>Futu</italic> (ST32), <italic>Zusanli</italic> (ST36), <italic>Fenglong</italic> (ST40), <italic>Weizhong</italic> (BL40) and <italic>Huantiao</italic> (GB30) in the lower limb.

The results suggested that contralateral needling namely on the relatively healthy side of the human body was better than conventional acupuncture which on the hemiplegic side after 30 days treatment using modern rehabilitation evaluation methods from three different levels reflecting neurological injury deficiency, motor function of the extremity, and ADL after hemiplegia. In the contralateral needling group, the NDS decreased, while the MBI and the FMA increased significantly when compared with the conventional acupuncture group. Limitations of the present study included the small number of patients in each group; therefore, no major conclusions can necessarily be applied to other patients. In addition, the patients were selected based upon history of stroke, neurological evaluation and MRI; thus, there is likely some bias in patient selection for this study. Another limitation is a less extensive statistical analysis of patient variables such as body weight and the relationship with the ischemic brain lesion. It is hoped that further studies will be directed toward this end.</p><p>According to the findings of this study, this randomized, single-blinded control study showed that contralateral needling was better than conventional acupuncture in improving the recovery of neurological function, ADLs, and motor function of the hemiplegia due to acute ischemic stroke. However, large-scale clinical trials are needed to further investigate the effectiveness of the contralateral needling unblocking-collaterals technique.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-4"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-7"><title>Design</title><p>A randomized, controlled, single-blinded clinical trial.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-8"><title>Time and setting</title><p>This study was performed at People's Hospital of Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, People's Hospital of Rizhao City and the Second Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University Medical College, China between December 2008 and June 2012.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-9"><title>Subjects</title><p>Patients with first-time onset acute ischemic stroke (left or right) who received treatment from December 2008 to June 2012 were included in this study.

This topic is of actual value and clinical significance. There are few reports describing the scientific design and procedure of acupuncture for stroke treatment in China. There are some limitations in this study. For example, whether disease duration influences the therapeutic effect of contralateral needling is yet to be determined. In addition, the pathological mechanism of stroke and the severity of disease were not classified. The sample size was also too small in the control group. All these problems should be taken into consideration in future studies.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding:</bold> This study was partially funded by a grant from Ningxia Science and Technology Support Project, No. 2012ZYS207.</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflicts of interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Ethical approval:</bold> Ethical approval to undertake this study was obtained from the Human Research Ethics Committee, People's Hospital of Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, the Second Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University Medical College, and Rizhao People's Qingdao Hospital, China.
