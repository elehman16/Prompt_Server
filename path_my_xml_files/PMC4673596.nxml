<bold>Objective:</bold> Technological processes may influence the release of glucose in starch. The aim of this study was to compare the metabolic response and the kinetics of appearance of exogenous glucose from 2 cereal products consumed at breakfast.</p><p>
<bold>Methods:</bold> Twenty-five healthy men were submitted to a randomized, open, crossover study that was divided into 2 parts: 12 of the 25 subjects were included in the &#x0201c;isotope part,&#x0201d; and the 13 other subjects were included in the &#x0201c;glycemic part.&#x0201d; On test days, subjects received biscuits (low glycemic index [GI], high slowly available glucose [SAG]) or extruded cereals (medium GI, low SAG) as part of a breakfast similar in terms of caloric and macronutrient content. The postprandial phase lasted 270 minutes.</p><p>
<bold>Results:</bold> The rate of appearance (RaE) of exogenous glucose was significantly lower after consumption of biscuits in the first part of the morning (90&#x02013;150 minutes) than after consumption of extruded cereals (<italic>p</italic> &#x02264; 0.05). Conversely, at 210 minutes, it was significantly higher with biscuits (<italic>p</italic> &#x02264; 0.01). For the first 2&#x000a0;hours, plasma glucose and insulin were significantly lower after biscuits during the glycemic part. C-peptide plasma concentrations were significantly lower at 90, 120, and 150 minutes after ingestion of the biscuits (<italic>p</italic> &#x02264; 0.05).</p><p>
<bold>Conclusion:</bold> The consumption of biscuits with a high content of slowly digestible starch reduces the appearance rate of glucose in the first part of the morning and prolongs this release in the late phase of the morning (210 minutes). Our results also emphasize that modulation of glucose availability at breakfast is an important factor for metabolic control throughout the morning in healthy subjects due to the lowering of blood glucose and insulin excursions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><title>Key words</title><kwd><sup>13</sup>C-labeled carbohydrates</kwd><kwd>breakfast cereals</kwd><kwd>slowly available glucose</kwd><kwd>healthy subjects</kwd><kwd>glycemic index</kwd><kwd>starch</kwd><kwd>food process</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="5"/><table-count count="2"/><ref-count count="54"/><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s0001"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The
quality of carbohydrates in food has been studied for some 30&#x000a0;years, with particular attention being paid to the structure of starch in processed food products [<xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The technology and cooking methods applied to cereal products result in various degrees of starch digestion from rapidly (as extruded cereals [<xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]) to slowly digested carbohydrates (e.g., in some types of biscuits or pasta [<xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]). Numerous studies have compared the physiological effects of starch-based products and showed a correlation between the <italic>in vitro</italic> digestibility of starch and the postprandial plasma glucose and insulin responses [<xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Investigation of postprandial metabolism of food starch fractions is generally based upon the monitoring of postprandial changes in circulating plasma glucose and insulin concentrations over a 2-hour period. This approach makes it possible to calculate the glycemic [<xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and insulinemic indexes of foods [<xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, these peripheral postprandial markers provide only a partial reflection of the absorption kinetics of starch-derived glucose and give no indications about its absorption kinetics. Although moderate postprandial glucose response may indicate a slow appearance of ingested carbohydrates and slow tissue uptake [<xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], this response also results from rapid appearance of ingested carbohydrates and rapid uptake by tissue [<xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In the latter case, insulin secretion is enhanced in relation to glycemic response. It is thus necessary to describe metabolic response to carbohydrate ingestion rather than simply the glycemic profile resulting from the difference between incoming and outgoing glucose flow rates whether exogenous from the food or endogenous from the organism. In order to study the kinetics of absorption of carbohydrate rich foods, the double-isotope labeling method is generally used [<xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="cit0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. This method makes it possible to measure the rates of appearance in plasma of exogenous glucose from the test food only [<xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Most studies are limited to a 120-minute postprandial follow-up and to the ingestion of an isolated tested cereal product. In the present study, the test food was incorporated within a complete breakfast and tested over a longer postprandial duration (270 minutes).</p><p>The aim of this study was to compare the kinetics of appearance of exogenous glucose in healthy subjects in response to the ingestion of a breakfast containing different cereal products manufactured from the same ingredients but using 2 distinct technologies (extrusion technology and the rotary molded biscuit process). The 2 cereal products tested had different glycemic index (GI) and contents of slowly available glucose (SAG as determined <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref rid="cit0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="cit0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]).</p></sec><sec id="s0002"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s0002-0001"><title>Subjects</title><p>Twenty-five healthy male subjects with no familial history of metabolic disease (non-insulin-dependent diabetes, dyslipidemia, glucose intolerance) or early cardiovascular diseases, no dietary behavior disorders, and no intensive physical activity were selected. The inclusion criteria were age between 18 and 40&#x000a0;years, stable weight over the previous 3 months, a body mass index (BMI) between 20 and 25&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>, and normal results for biological tests at inclusion. Twelve subjects (aged 25 &#x000b1; 1 year) were recruited for the &#x0201c;isotope part&#x0201d; of the study. Subjects presenting natural <sup>13</sup>C isotopic enrichment in exhaled CO<sub>2</sub> &#x02265; &#x02212;23&#x02030;, determined with a breath test at the preinclusion visit, and subjects consuming high levels of products naturally rich in <sup>13</sup>C (e.g., maize, glucose corn syrup) were excluded. Based on unpublished data from CRNH-Rh&#x000f4;ne-Alpes (Normand, March 2000) comparing the postprandial exogenous appearance rates of 2 cereal products (semolina and pasta), the mean difference between the 2 groups was 1&#x000a0;mg.kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>.min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> with a variance of 4&#x000a0;mg.kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>.min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. The power of the trial was fixed at 80% and alpha risk at 5% in bilateral conditions. Based on these data, the calculated sample size was 12 subjects [<xref rid="cit0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. This part of the study was approved by the ethics committee of Lyon A, France, and was in accordance with both the French Huriet-Serusclat law and the Second Declaration of Helsinki.</p><p>The 13 other subjects were recruited for the &#x0201c;glycemic part.&#x0201d; This part of the study was approved by the Human Ethics Review Committee of Sydney University and was performed in accordance with the revised Declaration of Helsinki, Good Clinical Practice (CPMP/ICH/135/95) and the European regulatory requirements (Directive 75/78/CE).

Subjects consumed the products during 2 periods of 21&#x000a0;days each as habituation periods, each of which was followed by a metabolic study day. During the habituation periods, non-<sup>13</sup>C-enriched breakfast cereal products were provided to the subjects. One-week semiquantitative food consumption surveys were carried out 3&#x000a0;times during the experimental periods: during the preinclusion period to quantify the food contributions in basal condition and at the end of each habituation period to detect a potential effect of the test breakfasts on the daily dietary intake. Each subject received individual guidance by a trained clinical dietician and was instructed to evaluate and record the amount of food and beverages eaten each day using a 7-day food diary. Ingested food quantities were evaluated using a pictures dietary support elaborated during the SU.VI.MAX (<italic>SUppl&#x000e9;mentation en VItamines et Min&#x000e9;raux AntioXydants</italic>) [<xref rid="cit0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The macronutrient intakes were calculated using a computerized food database including specific product ingredient lists and recipes for test foods (GENIE by MICRO 6 using CIQUAL table; AFSSA, France). The periods of consumption of each test product were separated by a 14-day washout period.</p><p>Part 1 of the study was performed at the Centre de Recherche en Nutrition Humaine Rh&#x000f4;ne-Alpes (CRNH) at the H&#x000f4;pital Edouard Herriot (Lyon, France). After a 10-hour overnight fast, on arrival at the metabolic unit (i.e., study days 22 and 57), catheters were inserted into a forearm vein of each subject for blood sampling and isotope infusion. <sc>d</sc>-[6,6-<sup>2</sup>H<sub>2</sub>] glucose was given in a continuous infusion (0.0475&#x000a0;mg/kg.min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) over a period of 2&#x000a0;hours prior to the consumption of the test cereal products and over a period of 4.5&#x000a0;hours after the start of ingestion of the test breakfasts. Starch and simple carbohydrates from test cereal products were enriched with <sup>13</sup>C. Breakfast was taken over a period of 15 minutes maximum (from T0 to T15). Blood samples were taken at baseline (T-120, T-15, and T0) and every 30 minutes during the 270 minutes of the postprandial period for measurements of glucose, insulin, C-peptide, nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA) concentrations and deuterium and <sup>13</sup>C glucose isotopic enrichments in plasma.

By the end of the morning, RaE from biscuits tended to become greater than RaE from extruded cereals (significant difference at 210 minutes). The disappearance rates of total and exogenous glucose RdT and RdE followed a similar evolution over the postprandial period and were lower after the biscuits breakfast, in association with a lower C-peptide secretion.</p><p>Contradictory results were obtained between parts 1 and 2 of the study with regard to glycemic response. In part 1, no significant difference was obtained on the peak of glycemia or iAUC between the 2 breakfasts, whereas in part 2, significant differences with a reduced peak and lower iAUC of glycemia were obtained after the biscuits breakfast than after the extruded cereals breakfast. The main difference between the 2 parts was the blood sampling interval. In part 1, with a sampling every 30 minutes, we hypothesize that the glycemic peak was missed. In part 2 when the blood sampling was performed every 10 minutes during the first postprandial hour, significant peak and iAUC reduction were obtained after the biscuits breakfast.</p><p>The information on the insulin and C-peptide plasma concentration kinetics reinforced this hypothesis. Though there was no significant difference in insulin response between breakfasts in part 1, C-peptide response, which has a longer half-life than insulin (30 minutes for C peptide [<xref rid="cit0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="cit0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] compared to &#x0223c;5 minutes for insulin [<xref rid="cit0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="cit0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]), was reduced after the biscuits breakfast. The difference in the degree of significance of C-peptide and insulin kinetics probably resulted from the higher biological variability induced by the short half-life of insulin compared to that of C-peptide [<xref rid="cit0041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Moreover, insulin response was significantly reduced (peak and iAUC) after the biscuits breakfast when the interval between blood sampling was 10 minutes (part 2) instead of 30 minutes (part 1).</p><p>At the late phase of the postprandial period, glycemia tended to be significantly higher after the biscuits breakfast than after the extruded cereals, especially in part 1 of the study. A work confirmed our results for overweight subjects without metabolic disturbances [<xref rid="cit0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p><p>Most studies dealing with the quality of carbohydrates are based upon an approach that measures glucose from both exogenous and endogenous origins. However, these parameters are the result of the appearance and disappearance of carbohydrates in the systemic circulation. Previous studies using the stable isotope method have shown that moderate glycemic response may result from an increase in the rate of disappearance of glucose induced by stimulated insulin secretion through higher protein content of cereal products [<xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In addition, Normand et&#x000a0;al. demonstrated that the rate of appearance of glucose may be reduced by adding lipids to a meal [<xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In Normand et&#x000a0;al. [<xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and Schenk et&#x000a0;al. [<xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], the glycemic responses to meals were reduced. Therefore, not all products with a low GI or that induce moderate glycemic response necessarily contain slowly digestible carbohydrates, because low glycemic response may be obtained by other means, such as adding lipids or insulinogenic substrates (i.e., proteins [<xref rid="cit0042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="cit0044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]). Hence, the concept of low GI may not be routinely associated with the slow appearance of carbohydrates. Therefore, it is not possible to draw a conclusion regarding the metabolic impact and long-term health benefits of a food solely by observing glycemia and insulinemia without giving appropriate attention to glucose kinetics. In the present study, the low GI of biscuits resulted in a slow carbohydrate appearance, as expected from the high SAG content of the product.</p><p>The sequence of events following breakfast can be summarized as follows. The RaE was similar for both breakfasts for the first 30 minutes, whereas the RdE was similar only during the first hour. This similarity may be due to the initial release of a part of the RAG from both products. After the first hour, the biscuits breakfast resulted in a slower and more stable RaE compared to the extruded cereals, combined with a slower RdE and a lower insulin demand, corresponding to digestion of the SAG fraction. Finally, at 210 minutes, the RaE from the biscuits breakfast was greater than that from the extruded cereals, whereas the RdE and RdT were similar for the 2 cereal products.</p><p>The quantities of exogenous glucose appearing during the total postprandial period were greater than the ingested quantities, irrespective of the breakfast eaten. This result may be ascribed to <sup>13</sup>C-glucose recycling, which occurs as a result of labeled glucose synthesized in the liver from <sup>13</sup>C-lactate produced from exogenous glucose in the gut or in peripheral tissues [<xref rid="cit0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="cit0045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="cit0047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. This phenomenon leads to further appearance of <sup>13</sup>C-glucose in the peripheral circulation, which is consequently determined twice. This phenomenon, if it occurred, led to an overestimation of glucose absorption late in the observation period, which should be greater for the extruded cereals than for the biscuits breakfast, because the <sup>13</sup>C-glucose rate was higher for extruded cereals during the first part of the postprandial phase. However, RaE from the biscuits breakfast became greater than RaE from extruded cereals at 210 minutes. Hence, the late overestimation of RaE may have a major impact for the extruded cereals breakfast and then lead to an underestimation of the differences between the 2 breakfasts during the last hour of the postprandial period.</p><p>It also should be noted that the extruded cereals had a higher carbohydrate content (6&#x000a0;g in the 70&#x000a0;g portion); in fact, the caloric content of the breakfasts was adjusted and the addition of full-fat milk to the extruded cereal product allowed adjustment of the lipid content. This could explain the observed difference in RaE and postprandial responses. Based on previous works, a recent paper showed significant differences in RaE and glycemic responses, where the carbohydrate content of the cereal products (and breakfasts) were similar (59&#x000a0;g) but the SAG contents were different (21&#x000a0;g/80&#x000a0;g portion vs. less than 1&#x000a0;g/80&#x000a0;g portion) [<xref rid="cit0048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. In addition, when considering results obtained on GI, where the carbohydrate content was adjusted to 50&#x000a0;g of carbohydrates, it has been shown that SAG is the main parameter explaining the GI of cereal products, before fat and other carbohydrates [<xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The SAG range of the 26 cereal products was between less than 1&#x000a0;g/portion and 14&#x000a0;g/portion, comparable to the difference observed in the present article. Hence, both carbohydrate parameters (quantity 6&#x000a0;g difference, digestibility 12&#x000a0;g difference) may play a role. However, based on the breakfast composition and previous data, carbohydrate digestibility (evaluated according to SAG content) is an important parameter to be considered in the modulation of RaE and glycemic response.</p><p>Recently, a novel method of evaluating glucose fluxes has been developed, the triple-tracer method, which has been compared to the conventional dual-tracer method [<xref rid="cit0049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. The results obtained for 8 subjects confirmed that the conventional method provides relevant results but slightly underestimates RaE compared to the triple-tracer method. Moreover, EGP is more accurate with the triple-tracer method because it is measured directly, in contrast to being deduced from calculations in the dual-tracer method (difference between RaT and RaE).</p><p>In our study, EGP tended to be less inhibited during the first part of the morning after the biscuits breakfast than after the extruded cereals breakfast (the opposite trend was observed at the end of the morning). This was coherent with the lower insulin secretion induced by the biscuits breakfast during the first part of the morning. The lower inhibition of EGP after the biscuits breakfast may have hidden the influence of the slower appearance of exogenous glucose on glycemia. However, this result has to be considered cautiously because of the means used for calculation and, thus, its level of accuracy. When comparing the triple-tracer and the double-tracer methods, it has been shown that the main differences for EGP between the 2 methods were observed during the first postprandial stage and that there was a global underestimation of EGP suppression with the dual-tracer method [<xref rid="cit0049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Hence, further investigations are required to confirm this initial result.</p><p>Still, we can assume that the lower total carbohydrate oxidation was related to the lower glucose disappearance rates observed with the biscuits breakfast throughout the morning. These consistent results have not always been observed in previous studies [<xref rid="cit0050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>].</p><p>In conclusion, this study shows that under real conditions of breakfast consumption, in healthy males the RaE from biscuits containing high levels of SAG and a low GI was lower at the beginning and higher at 210 minutes (i.e., more stable over the entire morning period) compared to the extruded cereals containing low levels of SAG and medium GI. Concomitantly, postprandial glucose response and insulin demand were reduced. Furthermore, this study shows that measurement of glucose rates and fate can be precious information to use in evaluating the influence of low-GI foods on metabolic parameters and thus their health interest [<xref rid="cit0051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>].</p><p>In our context, the double labeling of glucose (exogenous and total) allowed the parallel follow-up of endogenous glucose kinetics and indeed highlighted the compensatory lower inhibition of EGP. Consequently, isotope analysis is important in understanding the mechanisms underlying plasma glycemic response. The combined glucose isotope and glycemic analyses showed that if RaE was highly different between groups in response to breakfast, the difference in glycemic response was less pronounced due to modulation of EGP.</p><p>Finally, the present findings suggest that the consumption of slowly digestible starch products could contribute to decreasing postprandial glucose excursions and potentially metabolic profiles. This could be of great interest in relation to the genesis of chronic pathologies such as diabetes [<xref rid="cit0052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="cit0054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>].</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>We are grateful to Klaus Englyst (Englyst Carbohydrates-Research &#x00026; Services Ltd., Southampton, UK) for his collaboration in determining the carbohydrate digestibility profile of the cereal products; Jean-Marie Grouin, University of Rouen, INSERM U657; Fran&#x000e7;oise Tondu, Danone Research, Palaiseau, France, for their great expertise in statistical analysis; and Vincent Lang, Danone Group, for his help in the study launch.</p></ack><sec id="s0005"><title>AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS</title><p>S.V., S.N., and M.L. contributed to the conception and the design of the study.
