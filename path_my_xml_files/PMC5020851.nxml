Although many surgeons sequentially use parecoxib and celecoxib as a routine strategy for postoperative pain control after TKA, high quality evidence is still lacking to prove the effect of this sequential regimen, especially at the medium-term follow-up. The purpose of this study, therefore, is to evaluate efficacy and safety of postoperative intravenous parecoxib sodium followed by oral celecoxib in patients with osteoarthritis (OA) undergoing TKA. The hypothesis is that compared to placebo with opioids as rescue treatment, sequential use of parecoxib and celecoxib can achieve less morphine consumption over the postoperative 2&#x02005;weeks, as well as better pain control, quicker functional recovery in the postoperative 6&#x02005;weeks and less opioid-related adverse events during the 12-week recovery phase.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>This study is designed as a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group and placebo-controlled trial. The target sample size is 246. All participants who meet the study inclusion and exclusion criteria will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either the parecoxib/celecoxib group or placebo group. The randomisation and allocation will be study site based. The study will consist of three phases: an initial screening phase; a 6-week double-blind treatment phase; and a 6-week follow-up phase. The primary end point is cumulative opioid consumption during 2&#x02005;weeks postoperation. Secondary end points consist of the postoperative visual analogue scale score, knee joint function, quality of life, local skin temperature, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C reactive protein, cytokines and blood coagulation parameters. Safety end points will be monitored too.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>Ethics approval for this study has been obtained from the Ethics Committee, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, China (Protocol number: S-572) Study results will be available as published manuscripts and presentations at national and international meetings.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02198924">NCT02198924</ext-link>.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>parecoxib</kwd><kwd>celecoxib</kwd><kwd>total knee arthroplasty</kwd><kwd>postoperative pain</kwd><kwd>cumulative opioid consumption</kwd><kwd>opioid sparing</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Strengths and limitations of this study</title></caption><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>This is the first study to investigate the efficacy and safety of the sequential analgesia regimen of intravenous parecoxib followed by oral celecoxib after total knee arthroplasty surgery.</p></list-item><list-item><p>This study will explore the benefits of prolonged sequential treatment of parecoxib and celecoxib in medium-term function recovery.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The results will promote the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs incorporation into the standard multimodal analgesic regimen for postoperative pain control.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Potential limitations include the need for further validation studies from other institutions outside China, lack of investigation of the long-term (eg, &#x0003e;3&#x02005;months) effects of the sequential treatment, and compromise of the test accuracy of synovial fluid cytokines.</p></list-item></list></boxed-text><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic degenerative joint disorder which frequently occurs in the elderly.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> In mainland China, knee OA is the leading cause of disability in elderly patients. Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is now generally regarded as an effective treatment for end-stage knee OA in pain alleviation, joint deformity correction and life quality improvement.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p><p>However, TKA has been regarded as a most painful orthopaedic surgery due to the weight-bearing characteristics of knee joint and the high demand for functional exercise within 6&#x02013;8&#x02005;weeks postoperation.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> First, TKA induces massive tissue damage and severe perioperative pain which jointly hamper early postoperative rehabilitation and exert negative effects on surgical outcome and patient satisfaction.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Second, postoperative pain, as the most suffering experience for patients with TKA, may prolong postoperative bedbound duration and increase the risks for pulmonary infection, deep venous thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), etc.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Third, previous findings suggested that local inflammation triggered by tissue damage increases the central and peripheral pain sensitivity, as well as leads to acute haemorrhage and swelling, which poses greater challenges to the postoperative rehabilitation.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p><p>The targeted treatment with a selective cyclooxygenase (COX-2) inhibitor, such as parecoxib or celecoxib, can significantly reduce the inflammatory reaction level within 2&#x02005;days postoperation.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11&#x02013;14</xref> In addition, perioperative administration of celecoxib can relieve postoperative pain and improve articular function, thereby improving the life quality of the patients. Recently, sequential therapy of intravenous-to-oral COX-2 inhibitor administration has been demonstrated as effective in many postoperative pain control models.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15&#x02013;19</xref> Significant morphine sparing effect and reduction of opioid-related complications were also observed.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15&#x02013;19</xref> In China, it is becoming a routine at many institutions that 40&#x02005;mg parecoxib be administered intravenously two times a day for the first 3&#x02005;days after surgery, followed by 200&#x02005;mg celecoxib administered orally two times a day for 2&#x02005;weeks or longer.

<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Inadequate pain control has been correlated with prolonged postoperative bed time, increased incidence of pulmonary infection, DVT, PE and poor functional recovery in some patients after TKA.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p><p>Multimodal analgesia is currently recommended for postoperative pain control after TKA.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28&#x02013;30</xref> It basically refers to the administration, via the same route or by different routes, of multiple analgesics to provide superior analgesia and limit side effects and AE. Multimodal analgesia is achieved by combining different analgesics that act by different mechanisms (eg, NSAIDs, opioids and local anaesthetics), resulting in additive or synergistic analgesia, lower total doses of analgesics and fewer side effects.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>
<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Among multimodal analgesia modalities, NSAIDs, especially selective COX-2 inhibitors, play an important part in the postoperative pain control after TKA.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></p><p>Non-selective NSAIDs may cause gastrointestinal (GI) and haematological AEs, compromise platelet function,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> and are associated with increased postoperative bleeding and increased blood transfusion requirements after joint arthroplasty surgery.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></p><p>Selective COX-2 inhibitors display similar anti-inflammatory properties with traditional NSAIDs, but lack many of the side effects associated with NSAIDs because they spare the COX-1 enzyme and have no clinically significant effect on platelet or GI function.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>

<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></p><p>Parecoxib sodium (parecoxib) is the injectable prodrug of valdecoxib and is the only parenteral formulation of a selective COX-2 inhibitor NSAID.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> It can be rapidly hydrolysed in vivo to its active form, valdecoxib, which is &#x0223c;28&#x02005;000-fold more potent against COX-2 than COX-1.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> Following intravenous injection, parecoxib is rapidly converted to valdecoxib, the pharmacologically active substance, by enzymatic hydrolysis in the liver. AUC and Cmax following two times a day administration is linear up to 50&#x02005;mg intravenous and 20&#x02005;mg intramuscular. Following single intravenous and Intramuscular doses of parecoxib sodium 20&#x02005;mg, Cmax of valdecoxib is achieved in &#x0223c;30&#x02005;min and &#x0223c;1&#x02005;hour, respectively.

<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> also revealed that 40&#x02005;mg of intravenous administered parecoxib can alleviate the anxiety during the perioperative period of TKA, which consequently led to better satisfaction scores and overall experiences for the patients. Celecoxib, another oral specific COX-2 inhibitor, was shown as having short-term pain reduction and morphine sparing effect in patients undergoing TKA,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> as well as improving functionality recovery if prolonged use up to 6&#x02005;weeks postoperatively.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p><p>Treatment of postoperative pain with intravenous with or without subsequent oral COX-2 specific inhibitor has been demonstrated as effective in many postoperative pain models.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15&#x02013;19</xref> Significant morphine sparing effect and reduction of opioid distressed symptoms were also observed. Combination of intravenous parecoxib and oral valdecoxib was used for &#x0003c;2&#x02005;weeks in most of the previous studies. In these studies,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15&#x02013;19</xref> short-term postoperative pain control and morphine sparing effect were evaluated. However, to the best of our knowledge, no study has investigated the effect of prolonged (6&#x02005;weeks) sequential treatment of intravenous parecoxib and oral celecoxib on the medium-term functionality recovery.</p><p>We present here the protocol of the PIPFORCE study, which aims to investigate the sequential analgesia regimen with intravenous parecoxib followed by oral celecoxib for postsurgical analgesic treatment in patients with OA undergoing TKA. Participants will receive study medication consisting of the parecoxib injection in analgesic doses or matching placebo followed by oral celecoxib in acute pain doses or matching placebo in a double-blind fashion. The hypothesis is that participants treated with parecoxib/celecoxib will consume less morphine over the 2&#x02005;weeks postoperative period, achieve improved pain control over the study period, quicker return to functionality, and have less opioid adverse events than those treated with opioids alone over the 12-week recovery phase. Both treatment groups will be able to use open-label rescue medication with opioids.</p><p>The possible limitations of the PIPFORCE study are listed as follows: First, since the four study centres of this multicentre RCT study are all from mainland China, the future results of the PIPFORCE study should be explained with this concern and require further validation studies in data sets from other institutions outside China. Second, the PIPFORCE study does not investigate the long-term (eg, &#x0003e;3&#x02005;months) effects of the sequential treatment on inflammation control and functional rehabilitation after TKA. Finally, cytokines of synovial fluid, as one of the exploratory end points, will be tested in this study with the aim of observing the trend of change of local inflammation. However, the synovial fluid tested after surgery is actually obtained from the wound drainage and inevitably contains blood, which will compromise the test accuracy. We will ensure that the same technique is used to obtain the synovial fluid sample in both groups to guarantee the comparability. In addition, we will also observe peripheral blood cytokines as the reference.</p><p>In spite of these possible limitations, the contribution of the PIPFORCE study is expected to provide a comprehensive understanding of how the sequential regimen with intravenous parecoxib followed by oral celecoxib affects postoperative pain relief, inflammation control and functional rehabilitation in patients with OA undergoing TKA. The completion of this study will provide solid evidence for the efficacy and safety of the clinical use of the sequential regimen of COX-2 specific inhibitors after TKA surgery. The results will assist in optimising NSAIDs use as a part of the standard multimodal analgesic regimen for managing postoperative pain. Furthermore, this project will provide insight into the benefits of prolonged sequential treatment of parecoxib and celecoxib in this population on the medium-term functionality recovery.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank all study participants and staff who devoted their time and efforts to the study.
