in women&#x02019;s lives that greatly impact the physical,
mental and social health of the mother. Postpartum
blues, depression and anxiety are common
realities in today&#x02019;s world, especially in developing
countries where many remain underdiagnosed
and undertreated due to different reasons (poverty,
culture, values and major life events) (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Major
depression after childbirth has serious risks such as suicide and infanticide (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). It also decreases
breastfeeding, induces severe malnutrition and
other diseases (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Postpartum depression (PPD) is
a public health issue whose worldwide incidence
is approximately 15% or more (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>-<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). In some cities
of Iran, PPD incidence has been reported as
23.7 and 32% (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>).</p><p>Finding strategies for prevention, early detection
and treatment of PPD can have major benefits in
the areas of reproductive rights, as well as medical
and financial aspects. These strategies can promote
public health, especially in societies with limited
human and financial resources. Several strategies
have been implemented in an attempt to find helpseeking
behaviors, that screen, prevent and manage
mothers who suffer from this illness (e.g., peer
support); provide telephone care management; and
establish consultation centers and Crisis Intervention
Units (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>-<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>).</p><p>Some studies have shown that women preferred
"talking therapies" with someone who was nonjudgmental
rather than pharmacological interventions.
Dennis and Chung-Lee (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) studied the
effect of telephone-based peer support on prevention
of PPD at 12 weeks after childbirth. They
found that the group who received postpartum care
plus telephone-based peer support reported higher
levels of positive relationship qualities than the
control group. In their study women preferred to
talk with someone than to receive medical interventions.
They concluded that peer volunteer support
might be a preventive strategy for PPD. Simon
et al. (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) compared the benefits of telephone
care management with telephone psychotherapy
for depression and concluded that telephone psychotherapy
was more effective than telephone care
management.</p><p>In Iran, a limited number of studies have described
and explained PPD. Hassan Zahraee et al.
(<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) studied the supportive role of the midwife in
preventing PPD in Isfahan. The results showed
that mean depression scores of mothers who received
emotional and informational support of a
midwife on the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 10<sup>th</sup> days postpartum were
significantly lower than the control group on the
45th day after childbirth. They concluded that midwife
support might be an effective factor in preventing
PPD. Sadr et al. (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) studied factors that
affected PPD in Tehran and have reported significant
relationships between PPD and the husband&#x02019;s
education, marital dissatisfaction and lack
of social support, unwanted pregnancy, congenital
disorders of the newborn, and mental disorders.
Additionally, it is possible that genetics may play
a role in susceptibility to PPD (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). However, it is
important to emphasize that genetic and biologic
factors of PPD have yet to be efficiently studied
and explained (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>).</p><p>Telephone-based support can help mothers with
access to postpartum information and care as well
as receive responses to their questions according
to a study by Goodman (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). In Iran, there have
not been any studies regarding the effect of health
volunteer telephone-based support on PPD. Thus,
this research aimed to study the effect of health
volunteers&#x02019; telephone based-support on PPD. The
term "health volunteers" were women who interacted
with families in primary health care (PHC)
and acted as bridges between health centers and
the community in Iran.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>In this randomized controlled trial, 203 postpartum
women completed the Edinburg Postnatal
Depression Scale (EPDS) during routine postpartum
care visits conducted 10 to 15 days after uncomplicated
childbirth in hospitals affiliated with
Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences.
The EPDS was validated in Iran. This scale is a
10-item self-report questionnaire with a possible
score range of 0 to 30. Items 1, 2, and 4 are scored
0, 1, 2 or 3 with the top box scored as 0 and the
bottom box scored as 3. Items 3 and 5-10 are reverse
scored, with the top box scored as 3 and the
bottom box scored as 0. The cut-off point for detecting
depression was identified as a score of &#x0003e;10
(<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Cases with scores &#x02265;14 were considered to be
severely depressed. The aim, benefits and privacy
were explained in simple words to participants after
which the EPDS was completed by the mothers.
If the mother was unable to complete the questionnaire,
the interviewer assisted with completion.
Thus, 75 cases of mothers who suffered from PPD
were detected, 67 cases had moderate depression
and the other 8 cases had severe depression.</p><sec><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p>The criteria for including cases were term pregnancy,
live birth and depression score (EPDS
score) &#x0003e;10 to &#x0003c;14.</p></sec><sec><title>Exclusion criteria</title><p>The criteria to exclude cases were: history of
mental disorder, episodes of mental disorders during
pregnancy or in the last 12 months that necessitated
the use of medicines, nonviable fetus, history
of PPD, current use of prescribed psychiatric
drugs and an EPDS score of &#x02265;14. Mothers with
EPDS scores &#x02265;14 and who had suicidal thoughts
were referred to a psychiatrist. By considering
the exclusion criteria, 21 of 75 depressed mothers
were excluded; 54 of the participants were eligible
to remain in the trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Intervention description and assessment</title><p>There were 54 eligible mothers out of 203 postpartum
mothers (n=27 per group) who had mild to
moderate depression (&#x0003e;10 to &#x0003c;14 EPDS scores).
These cases were recruited and randomly assigned
into the intervention and control groups. After obtaining
informed written consent, demographic
and obstetric information of the participants was
gathered by a questionnaire as follows: age, parity,
number of children, job, education, interpersonal
relationship with husband, history of disease,
newborn gender, willingness of parents to a specific
newborn gender, quality of childbirth, type of
childbirth, health status of newborn, and wanted
pregnancy.</p><p>In both groups, mothers received routine postpartum
care as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">table 1</xref>. Routine postpartum
care did not have any screening tool for PPD.
The intervention group received telephone support
provided by eight health volunteers. These health
volunteers had been trained in a workshop to enable
them to communicate effectively and accurately
with mothers and to manage their problems.
Volunteers were instructed to refer cases that they
could not handle to health centers.</p><p>Each trained volunteer called 3 to 4 mothers
at intervals of 2 to 3 times per week until 6
weeks after childbirth. During each phone call,
after a greeting, they asked the mother about
her health status, newborn&#x02019;s condition, complaints,
and the mother&#x02019;s relationship with her
newborn or husband, and whether there was any
problem. The volunteers managed the problem
according to their training, and if needed, assistance
was given by a principal researcher. During
the conduction of research all volunteers
were in contact with the main researcher however
they kept all data confidential from their
fellow volunteers. The control group did not receive
any further intervention during the study.
At the end of 6 weeks (after intervention), both
groups completed the EPDS to reassess depression
scores. There were 5 participants from the
intervention group and 3 from the control group
that were lost to follow up.</p></sec><sec><title>Data analysis plan</title><p>Data were processed using SPSS version 16.
Data with nominal and ordinal scales were compared
in two groups using the Chi-square and
Fisher&#x02019;s exact tests. Data with ratio scales was
tested using the t test. The changes in depression
scores between the pre- and post-intervention in
each group were tested using the paired t test; the
changes of scores between two groups were compared
with the t test (26, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). A P value of
&#x0003c;0.05 was considered significant.</p><p>This study was registered at the Iranian Registry

whereas in other Iranian studies this incidence was
reported as 23.7 (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) and 32% (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). It should be
mentioned that the timing of screening differed
among these studies therefore these differences
could be time dependent. The PPD incidence in
developed countries has been reported as 13%
(<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Thus the PPD incidence in Iran appeared
to be more than developed countries. Further researches
should be done for understanding the influencing
factors.</p><p>Mean depression scores before intervention in
both groups were the same, however after intervention
the mean depression scores in the intervention
group who received telephone support was
significantly lower than the control group. It could
be concluded that the decrease of EPDS scores
was due to intervention. However, we could not
find any study about health volunteer telephonebased
support. A similar result was reported by
Dennis et al. (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) after peer support. They found
that PPD could be decreased after peer support
(mother to mother support). Meanwhile, Hassan
Zahraee et al. (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) found that midwives&#x02019; emotional
and informational support given on days 2 and
10 after childbirth prevented PPD after 5 weeks.
Hantsoo et al. (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) studied the efficacy of treatment
with computer-assisted cognitive-behavioral
therapy for antepartum depression and suggested
this therapy to be used for antepartum depression.</p><p>In both groups the depression scores decreased
after 6 weeks, but the intervention group showed
more decrease than the control group. Mean depression
scores of the intervention group decreased
in the non-depressed area (decreased under
&#x0003c;10 scores), but the control group mean scores
remained at the &#x0003e;10 scores (depressed area). In
other words, although depression scores in the
control group decreased, this was not adequate. A
similar result was reported by Dennis et al. (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>),
they found that in the peer supported group, there
were a significantly less proportion of depressed
mothers compared to the control group. In contrast,
Mohammad-Alizadeh-Charandabi et al. (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>)
conducted a randomized controlled trial that studied
the effect of telephone support on PPD. They
found no significant difference regarding frequency
of depression as well as mean depression scores
between the intervention group that received telephone support by a midwife and the control group.
This contradiction might be due to the selection
of a different cut-off point for depression. In their
trial, the cut-off score was &#x02265;13, whereas in the current
study, it was &#x0003e;10, according to findings by Edmondson
et al. (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>).</p><p>The advantage of the findings of the present
study when compared with those of other studies
and strategies suggested for handling PPD was
the decrease in PPD scores which was achieved
by engaging inexpert health volunteers and via
telephone calls. This was a cost benefit method
available in every house. In other words, there
was no high-skilled person required, nor the
need for any advanced technology or complex
tools. In the study by Mohammad-Alizadeh-
Charandabi et al. (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), the intervention was performed
by trained midwives with no evidence of
decreasing PPD reported. In our study, intervention
was performed by health volunteers (grassroots
community members with a high potential
for communication) who worked free of charge
and communicated directly with families. This
could be used as a model to engage accessible
human resources for improving mothers&#x02019; health
in every society. This model, as a simple method,
could reduce the burden of disease and prevent
the establishment of depression and its severity.
Therefore the use of expensive therapies
and medications alongside with complications
for families and society would be decreased and
the national health system could additionally
benefit from this approach. Some studies have
suggested computer-assisted cognitive-behavioral
therapy for antepartum depression (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>).
Since the computer is not widely used by Iranian
women, this cannot be implemented in Iran at
the present time.</p><p>The present study limitation included support
from the family and the husband as an important
factor in PPD, which we have not considered in
this study. Thus, additional studies with more cases
and factorial designs will be necessary to achieve a
precise conclusion.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this study, health volunteer telephone-based
