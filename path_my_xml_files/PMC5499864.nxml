A source of real-time, credible (ie, accurate and reproducible), case-level data on medication adherence that is readily accessible to psychiatric prescribers to guide treatment decisions is needed.<xref rid="b8-ppa-11-1071" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p><p>Available methods of assessing patient-level adherence can be divided into subjective and objective measures.

Such information has the potential to lead to better-informed clinical decisions. However, there is limited evidence on whether prescribers would make use of or attend to such information if it were available.</p><p>The objective of this study was to determine how access to credible patient drug adherence information (PDAI) might influence psychiatric practitioners&#x02019; prescribing and practice patterns. There has been considerable research on the issue of adherence in patients with schizophrenia, and specifically on the real-world challenges that providers encounter while attempting to gauge whether patients are adherent to their medication.<xref rid="b15-ppa-11-1071" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Other studies have used survey vignettes to examine how patient and provider characteristics impact antipsychotic treatment strategies.<xref rid="b16-ppa-11-1071" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="b17-ppa-11-1071" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Nevertheless, to our knowledge, this study is the first to use a 2-arm randomized controlled online survey design to test whether better information about adherence leads to more appropriate treatment decision-making among providers treating patients with serious mental illnesses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Study design</title><p>A convenience sample of health care practitioners who treat schizophrenia with antipsychotics, assigned to experimental or control groups using simple randomization, participated in this cross-sectional survey. The survey contained clinical case vignettes that described patients with schizophrenia being treated with antipsychotic medication. The 2 groups received identical vignettes with one exception: the experimental group&#x02019;s vignettes included credible PDAI, whereas the control group&#x02019;s vignettes did not. As a test of similarity across the experimental and control respondents, both groups also received 2 vignettes that were completely identical in all respects. Following each vignette, respondents were asked what, if any, changes they would make to the current treatment regimen by selecting from lists of both pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic treatment options. Information on respondents&#x02019; demographics, training, clinical practice setting, and approaches to treatment was also collected. The Chesapeake Institutional Review Board reviewed the study procedures and exempted the study from full review because of low/no risk to the study participants.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods|subjects"><title>Study participants</title><p>A convenience sample of psychiatric prescribers, including psychiatrists, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants, currently treating patients with schizophrenia was invited by telephone, email, mail, and/or fax to participate in the study. We elected to include both psychiatrists and nonpsychiatrist prescribers as the latter account for a meaningful fraction of atypical antipsychotic prescriptions.<xref rid="b18-ppa-11-1071" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Eligible participants included prescribers who had graduated from an accredited medical school, prescribed antipsychotics, and treated &#x02265;1 patient with schizophrenia per month. The study included doctors of medicine, doctors of osteopathic medicine, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners. Those who did not meet the eligibility criteria or refused to complete the eligibility screener were excluded, whereas all respondents who successfully completed the survey, including pilot test participants, were compensated for their time and effort. Participants were blinded to the sponsor of the study.</p><p>The study was powered such that a target sample size of n=200 participants assigned to 2 equal groups would be sufficient to detect a difference of 16.5% in the proportion of participants opting for adherence-focused treatment in the presence of adherence information at 0.05 alpha level and with a power of 0.80.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Survey</title><p>The survey incorporated 8 clinical case vignettes, which were brief, carefully written descriptions of patients with schizophrenia in situations that simulate real-world clinical scenarios. The vignettes were drawn originally from case vignettes in peer-reviewed journals, but then modified using input from a clinical expert (Lindenmayer) to simplify each vignette and modify it for the purposes of this study. Key patient characteristics (age, sex, disease severity, and adherence) varied across the 8 vignettes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-ppa-11-1071">Table S1</xref>). Each vignette represented specific patient behaviors and characteristics, including self-reported medication adherence, substance use, and the presence of medication side effects, as well as both self-reported and observed symptom severity. Based on specified combinations of these patient characteristics and behaviors, each vignette was assigned to one of the following types: (1) nonadherent patients; (2) adherent, poorly controlled patients; and (3) adherent, well-controlled patients. All vignettes represented patients using oral antipsychotic medication at the time of presentation. A sample vignette is provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ppa-11-1071">Figure 1</xref>, and the full text of all vignettes is provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-ppa-11-1071">Table S2</xref>.</p><p>In addition to the vignettes, the survey included questions of provider and practice characteristics including years of practice, current number of schizophrenic patients under their care, the number currently on antipsychotic medication, and the methods used to assess patient compliance with medication. The survey was programmed to be accessible online and adaptable to both desktop and mobile devices using Qualtrics survey software (Qualtrics, Provo, UT, USA).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Survey administration</title><p>Study participants received an e-mail with a link to the online survey site with credentials. After completing an informed consent form, participants were provided with a set of instructions, and then asked a series of questions to determine whether they met the study inclusion criteria. Those who met the inclusion criteria were presented with 8 clinical vignettes. As previously mentioned, the vignettes presented to the experimental group included credible PDAI (eg, information from MEMSCap, blood levels), whereas the control group received the same vignettes with no credible PDAI. To test for differences in treatment patterns between the control and experimental groups not associated with the experimental condition, respondents in both groups received 2 vignettes (1 with and 1 without PDAI) that were identical in all respects.</p><p>In response to each vignette, participants were asked to select their preferred pharmacologic (increase dose, switch to another oral antipsychotic medication, switch to a long-acting injectable [LAI] medication, augment therapy using another antipsychotic, augment therapy with a non-antipsychotic medication to treat symptoms, or monitor clinical stability) and non-pharmacologic treatment recommendations (supportive employment, psychoeducation, support group, adherence-related motivational interviewing, intensive case management, referral to patient&#x02019;s primary care physician, or ruling out substance abuse).</p><p>Following the 8 survey vignette questions, additional information on the respondent&#x02019;s demographics, patient population, and treatment practices was requested. Finally, the survey presented a statement of appreciation for participating in the study and requested each respondent&#x02019;s mailing address in order to mail the remuneration for completing the survey.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Analysis</title><p>The primary end point for this study was the prescribers&#x02019; selection of treatment modification based on the list of pharmaceutical options. All variables of interest were categorical, with frequency distributions and percentages calculated for the total sample as well as by type of cases mentioned above. A Wald chi-squared (<italic>&#x003c7;</italic><sup>2</sup>) test of homogeneity was performed on frequencies of provider and practice characteristics to assess if any of the variables were significantly different between the experimental and control groups. The <italic>&#x003c7;</italic><sup>2</sup> test was also used to determine between-group differences in proportions of respondents who selected each of the treatment choices. Pairwise comparisons by treatment choice across groups were performed using multinomial logistic regression, with false discovery rate adjustment applied to the resulting <italic>P</italic>-values. The responses of &#x0201c;monitoring clinical stability&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;intensive case management&#x0201d; served as the reference groups for responses to pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic treatment, respectively.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Survey respondents</title><p>Of the 240 prescribers who responded to the survey invitation, 224 (93.3%) were randomized and 219 of them (97.8%) completed the survey (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ppa-11-1071">Figure 2</xref>). Among the respondents, 127 (58.0%) were female, 133 (60.7%) were white, and most (62.1%) had practiced medicine for &#x0003e;5 years.

The results underscore the value of credible and objective medication adherence information in making informed clinical decisions for managing patients with schizophrenia.</p><p>For nonadherent patients, prescribers&#x02019; access to credible PDAI significantly increased the likelihood of recommending adherence-remediation interventions such as the prescription of LAI medications and adherence-related motivational interviewing. The study also showed that for nonadherent patients, the providers without access to credible PDAI were inclined to select treatment options that would be unlikely to maximize health benefits, such as increasing the dose or augmentation with a second antipsychotic. For adherent, poorly controlled patients who were not presenting with active psychosis or hospitalized for psychotic behavior, respondents with access to credible PDAI were less likely to prescribe an LAI and more likely to change the dose. Thus, access to credible PDAI may decrease unwarranted prescribing decisions. LAIs are generally recommended for patients with suspected nonadherence because they simplify dosing regimens and have the potential to improve adherence.<xref rid="b19-ppa-11-1071" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Psychoeducation and motivational interviewing are the non-pharmacologic interventions frequently recommended to promote adherence.<xref rid="b1-ppa-11-1071" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></p><p>By contrast, for adherent patients experiencing significant psychoses (ie, hospitalized), the treatment recommendations differed significantly between groups, that is, those with PDAI were less likely to prescribe, perhaps unnecessary, LAI formulations of antipsychotics. This finding likely reflects the persistent challenges in managing treatment-refractory disease, where adherence information might be more critical for more severe symptom expression compared to poorly controlled but not actively psychotic patients. In both cases, the availability of PDAI has the potential to contribute to decisions to modify treatment plans, if for no other reason, to differentiate between persistent and intractable disease and noncompliance with medication. The most frequent treatment choice for poorly controlled patients in both experimental and control groups was increasing the medication dose, indicating that a large number of respondents in the control group assumed the patients to be adherent. Previous studies have recommended therapeutic monitoring by examining plasma levels of antipsychotics in the case of poor response before making treatment changes,<xref rid="b20-ppa-11-1071" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="b21-ppa-11-1071" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> although this method has limitations such as interindividual variability and unavailability of routine plasma assay.<xref rid="b8-ppa-11-1071" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b22-ppa-11-1071" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></p><p>In the real-world, subjective assessments of adherence have been the most commonly used measures to estimate adherence, although validity of these methods is questionable.<xref rid="b23-ppa-11-1071" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> For example, physician-reported estimates of patient adherence to oral antipsychotics had a false-positive rate of 94%,<xref rid="b11-ppa-11-1071" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> suggesting a clear discordance between physician perceptions and actual adherence and highlighting the need for credible adherence estimates. Furthermore, a frequently endorsed method used to assess medication adherence is assessment of patient symptoms, which is confounded by medication effectiveness. Perceptions of adherence and subsequent prescribing behavior are also shaped by characteristics and actions of both patient (eg, compliance, socioeconomic status) and provider (gender, age, practice setting).<xref rid="b24-ppa-11-1071" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></p><p>Objective measures of adherence, such as pharmacy claims or electronic monitoring, are considered to be more credible<xref rid="b25-ppa-11-1071" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> than patient self-reports or provider estimations. It should be noted that, although objective, these are proxy methods of measuring adherence.<xref rid="b8-ppa-11-1071" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> The MEMSCap, for instance, registers opening of the bottle cap, but not medication ingestion.</p><p>A digital medicine system that is being developed for patients with serious mental illness uses medication with an embedded sensor that detects an ingestion event.<xref rid="b13-ppa-11-1071" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="b14-ppa-11-1071" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> The usability of this system has been demonstrated in patients with schizophrenia.<xref rid="b26-ppa-11-1071" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Availability of credible PDAI via this system may provide an opportunity for early and targeted intervention. Until credible PDAI becomes widely available, strategies that focus on prescriber investigation of adherence at the point of care &#x02013; through dialogue and collaboration with patients and their caregivers &#x02013; are needed in order to identify the most appropriate therapy. Our findings underscore the importance of having available a long-acting therapy option that can help to mitigate challenges in ascertaining true adherence to treatment in the absence of more reliable methods in the clinical setting.</p><p>Relapse is one of the most frequently cited drivers of costs associated with schizophrenia.<xref rid="b27-ppa-11-1071" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Because nonadherence is a critical factor that leads to higher rates of relapse, credible approaches to monitoring adherence may decrease medical costs. A separate analysis of results from this survey found that access to credible PDAI would lead to a decrease in annual medical cost of $3560 for nonadherent patients with schizophrenia.<xref rid="b28-ppa-11-1071" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Thus, access to accurate adherence information has important economic implication in addition to clinical benefits.</p><p>This study has several strengths. It is the first study to incorporate clinical case vignettes to quantify preferences of psychiatric health care providers for treating patients with schizophrenia based on the availability of adherence information. The eligibility criteria ensured that the recruited providers had the appropriate backgrounds to participate in the survey, currently practiced medicine, prescribed antipsychotics, and treated patients with schizophrenia. Random assignment of providers to either the experimental or control group removed or reduced potential bias.</p><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>The vignettes were limited to 8 clinical cases and represent only a fraction of the heterogeneous population of patients with schizophrenia seen in clinical practice. Furthermore, the decision process for a hypothetical case might not entirely reflect real-world treatment decisions. Providers were asked to make treatment decisions without considering restrictions imposed by insurance plans, limited resources, and other prescribing constraints such as formulary restrictions or requirements for prior authorization. Additionally, providers were asked to make decisions in the absence of additional clinical information that could be obtained during patient&#x02013;physician dialogue in usual clinical practice. Therefore, providers&#x02019; responses captured in the survey may be more synthetic than would be expected upon initial review of the vignettes. Finally, the study utilized a convenience sample; therefore, it was not designed to generate nationally representative conclusions. Potential study participants were identified from commercially available list of psychiatric prescribers of antipsychotic medication for schizophrenia that provided only contact information. As a convenience sample, we make no claim of the generalizability of study results. However, because we randomly assigned participants into 2 groups that were not statistically different across the characteristics measured in this study, we infer that the differences on treatment choice between groups are the result of credible compliance information presented within the experimental group&#x02019;s vignettes.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this study, provider access to credible PDAI led to significantly increased use of adherence-remediating interventions for nonadherent patients with schizophrenia and decreased use of adherence-targeted interventions for adherent patients. Access to adherence information is particularly important for treating real-world patients in typical clinical settings where blood-level assessments of antipsychotic treatments are rarely available and where LAI preparations are underused. Access to credible PDAI has the potential to improve outcomes and reduce health care costs associated with schizophrenia, and will also help clinicians evaluate potential side effects more accurately if they know whether the relationship with medication is plausible or not.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary materials</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1-ppa-11-1071"><table-wrap id="ts1-ppa-11-1071" position="float"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>Distribution of key patient characteristics in vignettes</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="2" valign="top" align="left" colspan="1">Factors</th><th rowspan="2" valign="top" align="left" colspan="1">Group</th><th colspan="8" valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1">Patient vignette

He was using alcohol, marijuana, and methamphetamines. He had progressively paranoid delusions to the point where his mother had him admitted to an inpatient psychiatric hospital at age 23. Toby&#x02019;s first psychiatric admission lasted 4 days. He was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and enrolled into an investigational study that prescribed risperidone (Risperdal) (4 mg/d). While he was taking risperidone, his hallucinations decreased somewhat but did not disappear. He had a good relationship with his treating outpatient physicians, who noted mild, persistent negative symptoms.

The voices are only a problem when they become abusive and tell her what an &#x02018;evil, spiteful witch&#x02019; she is. Prior to starting clozapine, she had tried &#x02018;loads of different pills&#x02019; (including: olanzapine, quetiapine, and lurasidone), none of which had been effective at making the &#x02018;voices nice again&#x02019;.

Robert has been living in a group home with 8 other residents where he is responsible for taking his own medication. He usually does attend his monthly outpatient visits and also attends a club house. His medications were lurasidone (Latuda) (80 mg/d) and metformin [1,000 mg/d]. Over the past few weeks Robert has become increasingly unpredictable, responding to internal stimuli with bursts of uncontrollable laughing and swearing. He also believes the other group home members are out to get him. His psychiatrist called 911 to have Robert admitted to the inpatient services. After a 6 day intensive inpatient stay Robert re-stabilized on lurasidone (Latuda) (120 mg/d) and was discharged back to the group home. <italic>Two weeks after discharge, his psychiatrist reviewed Robert&#x02019;s electronic cap monitor data and blood plasma levels and found that Robert had only taken half of the pills he was supposed to take and had low plasma levels</italic>.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Kay</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Kay is a 34-year-old female with an 8-year history of schizo-affective disorder, with multiple depressive episodes that led to drug overdoses and three suicide attempts.
