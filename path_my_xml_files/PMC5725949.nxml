Whilst there is evidence for the initial effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of such schemes for increasing physical activity, evidence of long-term effects is limited. Techniques such as goal setting, self-monitoring and personalised feedback may support motivation for physical activity. Technologies such as activity monitoring devices provide an opportunity to enhance delivery of motivational techniques.

Usual practice is a 16-week structured exercise programme; the intervention consists of an accelerometry-based activity monitor (MyWellnessKey) and an associated web platform (MyWellnessCloud). The primary outcomes are predefined progression criteria assessing the acceptability and feasibility of the intervention and feasibility of the proposed evaluation methodology. Postal questionnaires will be completed at baseline (time 0: T0), 16&#x000a0;weeks after T0 (T1) and 12&#x000a0;months after T0 (T2).

Increasing activity at the population level and among at-risk groups is a public health priority [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Physical activity interventions for at-risk groups often involve advice and/or signposting from primary care practitioners [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Exercise referral schemes (ERS) are one common model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], usually involving referral to a community-based structured exercise programme. In Wales, the 16-week National Exercise Referral Scheme (NERS) has been running since 2007. A previous effectiveness study of the scheme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] showed that, at 12&#x000a0;months, NERS was associated with improvements in physical activity for patients at risk of coronary heart disease, but not for those referred for anxiety and depression, despite an improvement in their mental health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The evaluation also showed the base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was &#x000a3;12,111 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY), falling to &#x000a3;9741 if participants were to contribute &#x000a3;2 per session [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Qualitative data highlighted a need for post-intervention motivational support to maintain changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Whilst there is evidence for effectiveness of ERS in increasing physical activity in the short term [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], evidence of long-term effects is limited. The Department of Health&#x02019;s Quality Assurance Framework for Exercise Referral [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] highlights the need to understand how to support long-term maintenance of changes in physical activity.</p><p id="Par17">On entry to an ERS, patients may be initially motivated by external sources such as GP advice to attend [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. However, sustained changes in physical activity are consistently associated with more internalised, or autonomous, motivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. According to self-determination theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], the development of autonomous motivation can be achieved through supporting psychological needs for autonomy (volitional and self-endorsed engagement), competence (personal mastery and effectiveness) and relatedness (meaningful interpersonal connections). Thus, developing ways to support these three needs should help to maintain changes in physical activity. Support for this notion is provided by the randomised controlled trial of the Welsh NERS which found increases in autonomous motivation after scheme exit. This increase explained almost half of the between-group difference in physical activity 6&#x000a0;months later [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Integrating processes to further enhance and sustain autonomous motivation during and after involvement in an exercise referral scheme may lead to larger effects and longer-term maintenance of these. Existing evidence points to potential motivational effects of techniques such as goal setting, monitoring and personalised feedback on progress towards goals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] which may support autonomous motivation by enhancing patients&#x02019; sense of mastery and competence and are recommended by NICE as core components of behaviour change interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p id="Par18">Technologies such as activity monitors provide opportunities to enhance delivery of goal setting and feedback, allowing for more frequent and automatic feedback on progress towards activity goals, tailored updating of goals based on achievement and remote contact with intervention providers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In addition to addressing psychological needs for competence, incorporation of social components may support motivation through promoting relatedness to other service users. Research on such technologies in exercise interventions suggests that use can be quickly integrated in participants&#x02019; lives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and may increase physical activity levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]; however, overall, the evidence is equivocal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Furthermore, little is known about the acceptability of these technologies to ERS populations or if the benefits will remain once the initial novelty has ceased. Exercise referral patients are a diverse group with a range of ages and conditions. For example, although the average age of participants in the evaluation of the Welsh NERS was 52&#x000a0;years old, the overall ages ranged from 16 to 88. Thus, familiarity with technology and willingness to use it may differ within the group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. In addition, participant diversity in terms of socioeconomic status and geographic location may result in differences in access to high-speed internet connections or the hardware required for engaging with some technologies (e.g. personal computer). Hence, prior to a trial of effectiveness, which may be undermined by difficulties integrating technologies into routine practice or facilitating uptake by patients, piloting is required to investigate these issues.</p><p id="Par19">A preliminary investigation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] tested a protocol for integrating activity monitoring devices (MyWellnessKey, Technogym) and a linked web platform in one local authority area of the Welsh NERS. The study showed potential for using the MyWellnessKey (MWK) devices in the scheme; however, further work is required to understand the feasibility and acceptability of this on a larger scale with a demographically diverse population. In this paper, we describe the protocol of the PACERS study, a pilot trial to assess the feasibility and acceptability of using the MWK activity monitors to promote maintenance of physical activity within NERS. The aim of the study is to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention (the MWK) and its proposed evaluation methodology, in order to optimise design and delivery and evaluate whether a full-scale randomised controlled trial of effectiveness is warranted and feasible.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Study aim</title><p id="Par20">The primary aim of the study is to assess the feasibility and acceptability of implementing the MWK activity monitors within the Welsh NERS as well as the proposed evaluation methodology in order to optimise design and delivery for conducting a definitive evaluation trial.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study objectives</title><p id="Par21">The main objectives for this study are to investigate:<list list-type="alpha-lower"><list-item><p id="Par22">the fidelity of delivery of the intervention and trial methodology including compliance with study invitation and randomisation processes;</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par23">the acceptability of the intervention to participants in terms of its usability and likelihood of future use;</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par24">whether randomisation is acceptable to 50% or more of participants;</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par25">the feasibility of recruiting 20% or more new NERS patients and retaining at least 80% of participants at 12-month follow-up (T2);</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par26">contamination, by exploring whether less than 20% of control participants are exposed to the intervention;</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par27">the effect of the intervention on the main hypothesised change mechanism (autonomous motivation); and</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par28">the feasibility of collecting the primary, secondary and process outcome measures and economic evaluation methods.</p></list-item></list>
