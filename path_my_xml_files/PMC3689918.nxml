Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) commonly reported with GXR monotherapy treatment include somnolence, fatigue, nausea, lethargy, and hypotension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Patients taking GXR have demonstrated similar growth compared with normative data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>Psychostimulants are the most widely prescribed pharmacologic agents for the treatment of ADHD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (LDX; Vyvanse<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>; Shire US LLC, Wayne, PA, USA) is a long-acting prodrug psychostimulant, which is approved as monotherapy for the treatment of ADHD in children (aged 6&#x02013;12&#x000a0;years), in adolescents (aged 13&#x02013;17&#x000a0;years), and in adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. TEAEs commonly reported with LDX treatment across these populations include anxiety, decreased appetite, diarrhea, dry mouth, insomnia, irritability, nausea, upper abdominal pain, and vomiting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>Two studies have examined the adjunctive use of GXR with psychostimulants in children and adolescents with a suboptimal response to psychostimulant treatment. An open-label study found that the addition of GXR did not result in unique adverse events (AEs) compared with those reported historically with either treatment alone, and adjunctive administration was also associated with significant improvements in ADHD symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The results of this earlier study were confirmed in a large, pivotal, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled study of GXR adjunctive to psychostimulants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Despite these earlier investigations, the potential for pharmacokinetic drug&#x02013;drug interactions (DDIs) between GXR and LDX has not been thoroughly evaluated.</p><p>Pharmacokinetic DDIs can occur when two medications are coadministered, resulting in a change in the metabolism, absorption, tissue and/or plasma binding, distribution, or elimination of one or both medications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Although guanfacine is known to be metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], LDX is absorbed as the intact prodrug and is converted via enzymatic hydrolysis to <italic>l</italic>-lysine and therapeutically active <italic>d</italic>-amphetamine primarily in the blood by red blood cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Although intact LDX is not metabolized by the CYP system and is neither an inducer nor an inhibitor of the system, the metabolism of <italic>d</italic>-amphetamine has not been fully characterized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. It is therefore prudent to study the pharmacokinetics of GXR coadministered with LDX to confirm the lack of metabolic interactions between these two therapies.</p><p>Although there is a lack of pharmacokinetic data on coadministration of GXR and LDX, pharmacokinetic studies of each medication administered alone have been published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. An open-label, dose-escalation, pharmacokinetic study of GXR in children (aged 6&#x02013;12&#x000a0;years) and adolescents (aged 13&#x02013;17&#x000a0;years) with ADHD showed that GXR exhibits a linear pharmacokinetic profile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. A linear pharmacokinetic profile of GXR was also observed in an open-label crossover study examining single doses of GXR 1-, 2-, and 4-mg tablets in healthy adults aged 18&#x02013;55&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Maximum guanfacine concentrations of 0.98, 1.57, and 3.58&#x000a0;ng/mL were attained at 6&#x000a0;h for the 1- and 2-mg doses and at 5.5&#x000a0;h for 4-mg doses. When administered alone, LDX has demonstrated a linear dose-proportional pharmacokinetic profile in both children and adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Maximum mean <italic>d</italic>-amphetamine concentrations of 53.2, 93.3, and 134&#x000a0;ng/mL were attained in children with ADHD at 3.5&#x000a0;h for the 30-, 50-, and 70-mg doses, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In healthy adults, maximum mean <italic>d</italic>-amphetamine concentrations of 44.6, 84.6, and 126.6&#x000a0;ng/mL were attained at 4&#x000a0;h for the 50-, 100-, and 150-mg doses. For the 200- and 250-mg doses, maximum mean concentrations of 168.8 and 246.3&#x000a0;ng/mL, respectively, were attained at 6&#x000a0;h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Two studies that assessed the pharmacokinetics of LDX 70&#x000a0;mg in healthy adults found maximum mean <italic>d</italic>-amphetamine concentrations of 80.3 and 90.1&#x000a0;ng/mL at 3&#x000a0;h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p>The safety profiles of GXR and LDX have been examined in previous studies.

Mean increases in SBP, DBP (2&#x02013;4&#x000a0;mmHg), and pulse rate (3&#x02013;6&#x000a0;beats/min) are often reported with LDX treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p>The primary purpose of this present study was to evaluate the pharmacokinetic profiles of GXR and LDX, administered alone and in combination, in healthy adults.

While intact LDX is not metabolized by the CYP system and is neither an inducer nor an inhibitor of the system, the metabolism of amphetamine has not been fully elucidated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Data have suggested that CYP2D6 is involved in the metabolism of amphetamine, and in vitro studies have suggested that amphetamine and its metabolites inhibit CYP2D6, CYP1A2, and CYP3A4 enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Therefore, it was prudent to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of GXR coadministered with LDX to confirm a lack of metabolic interactions between these two medications, as GXR is likely to be adjunctively administered with psychostimulants such as LDX to treat ADHD.</p><p>Although the guanfacine <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> exceeded the standard upper limit of bioequivalence by 7&#x000a0;% when GXR was coadministered with LDX, overall, coadministration of GXR and LDX did not result in a clinically meaningful pharmacokinetic DDI compared with the pharmacokinetics of either treatment administered alone.

As GXR is approved for the treatment of ADHD in children and adolescents aged 6&#x02013;17&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], the healthy adult subjects in this study may not have been representative of the population commonly treated with this medication in a clinical setting. In addition to age considerations, more studies would be needed to determine if similar outcomes would be seen in populations likely to receive adjunctive administration in clinical practice (e.g., subjects with comorbid disorders). In addition, subjects with comorbidities that may contribute to cardiac AEs were excluded from the study.</p><p>Caution should also be used in interpreting these results, as this study was designed to assess the pharmacokinetic parameters of coadministration of GXR and LDX; the study was not designed to robustly assess the cardiovascular effects of coadministration. As this was a single-dose rather than multiple-dose study, the effects that were observed may not be representative of those occurring at steady state. Therefore, the findings of this study may not be readily extrapolated to the therapeutic setting.</p><p>Finally, it is not known if similar safety and cardiovascular effects would be seen in large, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies, or in studies that assessed coadministration of GXR and LDX over a longer time period. Future studies should examine these areas, as well as the efficacy of coadministration.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec17" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Overall, coadministration of GXR and LDX did not result in a clinically meaningful pharmacokinetic DDI compared with the pharmacokinetics of either treatment administered alone. No unique TEAEs were observed with coadministration of GXR and LDX compared with either treatment alone. However, as the study was not designed to robustly assess cardiovascular effects and other safety parameters, further study of the safety of coadministration of GXR and psychostimulants is warranted.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>M.
